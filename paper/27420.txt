                                         ABSTRACT

At the aggregate level, the evidence that deviations from purchasing power parity (PPP) are too
persistent to be explained solely by nominal rigidities has long been a puzzle (Rogoff, 1996).
Another puzzle from the micro price evidence of the law of one price (LOP), which is the basic
building block of PPP, is that LOP deviations are less persistent than PPP deviations. To
reconcile the empirical evidence, we adapt the model of behavioral inattention in Gabaix (2014,
2020) to a simple two-country sticky-price model. We propose a simple test of behavioral
inattention and find strong evidence in its favor using micro price data from US and Canadian
cities. Calibrating behavioral inattention with our estimates, we show that our model reconciles
the two puzzles relating to the PPP and LOP. First, the PPP deviations are more than twice as
persistent as PPP deviations explained only by sticky prices. Second, the LOP deviations decrease
to less than two-thirds of the PPP deviations in the degree of persistence.

1         Introduction
It is well known that the aggregate real exchange rate, namely the deviation from purchasing
power parity (PPP), is highly persistent. In a description of this empirical anomaly known
as the PPP puzzle, Rogoff (1996) states "Consensus estimates for the rate at which PPP
deviations damp, however, suggest a half-life of three to five years, seemingly far too long
to be explained by nominal rigidities" (p. 648). A closely related empirical fact of real
exchange rates is the gap in persistence between the PPP deviations and the deviations from
the law of one price (LOP), as the basic building block for PPP. For example, Imbs et al.
(2005) and Carvalho and Nechio (2011) argue that the aggregate real exchange rate (the PPP
deviations) is likely to be much more persistent than the good-level real exchange rate (the
LOP deviations).1 These previous studies emphasize the role of heterogeneity in the speed
of price adjustment. As Imbs et al. (2005) argued, "It is this heterogeneity that we find to
be an important determinant of the observed real exchange rate persistence since it gives rise
to highly persistent aggregate series while relative price persistence is low on average at a
disaggregated level" (p. 3).
        In this paper, we aim to explain two empirical anomalies simultaneously: (1) the gap
between the observed persistence of the PPP deviations and the persistence predicted from
the sticky-price model (e.g., Rogoff, 1996); and (2) the gap between the observed persistence
of the PPP deviations and the LOP deviations (e.g., Imbs et al., 2005). To this end, we
incorporate behavioral inattention along the lines of Gabaix (2014, 2020) into a simple two-
country sticky-price model. In this framework, firm managers bear the cost of paying attention
to the aggregate component of the marginal cost of their products. As a result, the full
attention to the state of the economy is no longer optimal when firms choose the prices of
goods.
        The key to solving the PPP puzzle is the complementarity between the LOP and PPP
deviations. After deriving a reduced-form solution for the LOP deviations, we show that the
LOP deviations are affected by the PPP deviations when firms pay only partial attention
to marginal cost. Thus, an increase in the persistence of the PPP deviations makes the
LOP deviations more persistent. At the same time, through the aggregation, the more
persistent LOP deviations lead to more persistent PPP deviations, further strengthening the
link between the PPP and LOP deviations.

    See Crucini and Shintani (2008) for a comprehensive empirical analysis of the persistence in the LOP
deviations.



                                                   2
   The reduced-form solution leads to a direct testable implication. Using US and Canadian
micro price data, we implement a simple test for the null hypothesis of full attention against
an alternative hypothesis of partial attention. This test is equivalent to asking whether the
good-level real exchange rate is uncorrelated with the aggregate real exchange rate after
controlling for the common driving forces, such as the nominal exchange rate and country-
specific productivity. Using various specifications, we strongly reject the null in favor of our
proposed model of behavioral inattention. We also find the estimated degree of attention to
be around 0.17, much less than the value of 1.0 under full attention.
   In the first theoretical result, our model of behavioral inattention ensures that the persis-
tence in the aggregate real exchange rate exceeds the persistence implied solely by nominal
rigidities. While the setting differs greatly, this mechanism is consistent with Ball and Romer
(1990) and Woodford (2003), who show that even small frictions in nominal price adjustment
lead to a persistent output gap when real rigidities or strategic complementarities are present.
In our model with behavioral inattention, only small nominal frictions are needed to generate
a highly persistent aggregate real exchange rate. Based on our estimates of the degree of
attention, the persistence of the aggregate real exchange rate rises to 0.74 from 0.34 in the
full attention case.
   In the second theoretical result of our model, we explain the gap between the highly
persistent PPP deviations and the less persistent LOP deviations. This gap arises from the
combination of the complementarity and the presence of idiosyncratic real shocks to the
individual price of goods. We show that both the aggregate and the good-level real exchange
rates are more persistent when complementarities are present. In contrast, real shocks at
the good level (but not country-specific real shocks) reduce persistence only for the LOP
deviations and not for the PPP deviations. This is because the aggregation across goods
eliminates the effect of real shocks at the good level. As a result, our estimates of the degree
of attention also imply a substantial gap in persistence between the PPP and LOP deviations.
In fact, we predict the persistence of the LOP deviations to be 57 percent lower than the
persistence of the PPP deviations.
   Our results relate to an extensive literature that has contributed to a better understanding
of persistent aggregate real exchange rates. For instance, Chari et al. (2002) argue that
while the sticky-price model can explain the volatility of the aggregate real exchange rate,
the persistence is less than that suggested by the data. Benigno (2004) emphasizes the
role of monetary policy rules rather than the degree of price stickiness in accounting for
the persistent aggregate real exchange rate. Later, Engel (2019) revisits Benigno (2004) and

                                               3
argues for the importance of both monetary policy rules and price stickiness. Our solution also
closely relates to Bergin and Feenstra (2001) and Kehoe and Midrigan (2007), who introduce
strategic complementarity in pricing to two-country sticky-price models in explaining the
high persistence of real exchange rates. Our explanation of the PPP puzzle does not rule out
these explanations. Instead, we focus on the importance of behavioral inattention in pricing
of firms.
    A popular explanation for the gap in persistence between aggregate (CPI-based) and
good-level real exchange rates is the heterogeneity in price adjustment at a good level, which
generates a positive bias when aggregating prices. Imbs et al. (2005) point out a positive
aggregation bias in dynamic heterogeneous panels, and Carvalho and Nechio (2011) consider
the theoretical implication of aggregation based on the sticky-price model in which the degree
of price stickiness differs across sectors. Indeed, both statistical aggregation bias and multi-
sector sticky-price models would help toward increasing the persistence of real exchange rates.
In contrast, our solution can explain the gap even if the persistence of the LOP deviations
is restricted to be common across goods. In this sense, the mechanism in our paper further
enhances the ability of existing workhorse models in the macroeconomics literature.
    The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present a simple
two-country open economy model with Calvo pricing and introduce behavioral inattention.
Section 3 introduces the reduced-form solution for the LOP deviations and discusses the
implications of behavioral inattention. In Section 4, we implement a test of behavioral inat-
tention and quantify its importance. In Section 5, we assess how much the estimated degree
of behavioral inattention can improve model predictions. Section 6 concludes.


2     The model
The economy consists of two countries. In what follows, the US and Canada represent the
home and foreign countries, respectively. Following Kehoe and Midrigan (2007) and Crucini et
al. (2010b, 2013), there is a continuum of goods and brands of each good. Goods are indexed
by i and brands are indexed by z . For each good, US brands are indexed by z  [0, 1/2] and
Canadian brands are indexed by z  (1/2, 1].
    We assume that US and Canadian consumers have identical preferences over brands of
a particular good and also across goods in the aggregate consumption basket. US prefer-
ences over the brands of good i are given by the constant elasticity-of-substitution (CES)

2.1    Households
                                                                                        
The objective of the US agent is to maximize E0            t=0    t U (ct , nt ) = E0   t=0    t (ln ct - nt ),
subject to the budget constraint given by:

                Mt + Et (t,t+1 Bt+1 ) = Wt nt + Bt + Mt-1 - Pt-1 ct-1 + Tt + t ,                            (1)

and a cash-in-advance (CIA) constraint, Mt  Pt ct . Here, E0 (·) denotes the expectation
operator conditional on the information available in period 0,   (0, 1), and  > 0. In
addition, we suppress the state contingencies for notational convenience. On the right-hand
side of the budget constraint (1), the household supplies hours worked nt , receives nominal
wages Wt for hours worked, carries bonds Bt into period t, as well as any cash that remained
in period t - 1, Mt-1 - Pt-1 ct-1 . The household also receives nominal transfers from the US
government, Tt , and nominal profits from US firms, t . In (1), the aggregate price Pt is given
                      1
             1-      1-
by Pt =    Pit  di        , where Pit is the price index for good i. This is a CES aggregate over
                                    1
brands: Pit =      Pit (z )1- dz   1-
                                        . The left-hand side of (1) represents the nominal value of
the total wealth of the household. The household allocates the wealth into state-contingent
nominal bond holdings Bt+1 brought into period t + 1 and money balances Mt . The CIA
constraint requires nominal money balances for expenditure which is made at the end of the
period t. The CIA always binds with equality in equilibrium.
   Canadian households solve the analogous maximization problem. We assume complete
markets for state-contingent financial claims across the US and Canada and the financial
claims are denominated in US dollars. Thus, we convert their US dollar bond holdings into
Canadian dollars at the spot nominal exchange rate, St . The Canadian households are subject
to budget constraint,
                                                  
                     Et (t,t+1 Bt +1 )           Bt
             Mt +                      = Wt nt +    + Mt                      
                                                        -1 - Pt-1 ct-1 + Tt + t .                           (2)
                           St                    St



                                                    5
and the CIA constraint, Mt  Pt ct.
       The first-order conditions are standard. For the US households, we have Wt /Pt = ct
and t,t+1 =  [(ct+1 /ct )-1 (Pt /Pt+1 )], where t,t+1 is the nominal stochastic discount factor.
For Canadian households, we have Wt /Pt = c                         -1                
                                           t and t,t+1 =  [(ct+1 /ct ) St Pt /(St+1 Pt+1 )].
The consumption Euler equations differ because Canadians buy state-contingent bonds de-
nominated in US dollars.
       Define the aggregate real exchange rate as qt = St Pt /Pt . The Euler equations imply
qt+1 (c                                                                  
       t+1 /ct+1 ) = qt (ct /ct ) = ... = q0 (c0 /c0 ). Normalizing q0 (c0 /c0 ) to unity yields
                                                                                                2



                                                            ct
                                                 qt =            .                                           (3)

2.2        Firms
The US firm specializes in the production of brand z  [0, 1/2] of good i and employs nit (z )
hours of labor. They will produce output according to the production function yit (z ) =
ait nit (z ), where ait is labor productivity specific to good i and to all US firms that produce
that good. US firms produce brands on the first-half of the unit continuum, z  [0, 1/2].
Thus, for example, all firms that produce beer in the US share the same labor productivity.
                                              
The production function of Canadian firms is yit (z ) = a    
                                                         it nit (z ), for z  (1/2, 1].
       Goods that are shipped between the US and Canada are subject to iceberg trade costs,
 . In addition, all goods are perishable. Thus, production of good i undertaken in the US is
exhausted between US and Canadian consumption, with Canadian consumption bearing the
iceberg trade cost:
                             cit (z ) + (1 +  )cit (z ) = yit (z ), for z  [0, 1/2] .                        (4)

Similarly, production of good i undertaken in Canada is exhausted between Canadian and
US consumption, with US consumption bearing the iceberg trade cost:

                             (1 +  )cit (z ) + c           
                                                it (z ) = yit (z ), for z  (1/2, 1].                         (5)


2.3        Price setting
We introduce the inattention of firms into an otherwise standard two-country model with
Calvo pricing. Firms have the opportunity to change their prices with a constant probability,
   2
       The condition relies on our preference assumptions. Later, we relax these assumptions in Section 4.



                                                        6
as in Calvo (1983) and Yun (1996). Firms set prices in the buyers' currency, referred to in the
literature as local currency pricing. We first present the pricing decision of fully attentive firms
and then relax this assumption following the approach in Gabaix (2014, 2020). Because the
pricing problem of Canadian firms is analogous, we limit our exposition to pricing decisions
made by US firms.

2.3.1       Fully attentive firms

We first specify the fully attentive firm's pricing decision. Let xt be a generic variable. We
                                                              ^t = ln xt - ln x
define the log deviation of xt from the steady-state level as x               ¯, where x
                                                                                       ¯ is
the steady-state level of xt , so that we express xt = x
                                                       ¯ exp(^
                                                             xt ). Using this expression, we
write the US firm's real profits of selling goods in the US market as [pit (z ) - wt /ait ]cit (z ) =
{p           pit (z )] - w
 ¯i (z ) exp[^                 ^t - a

written as cit (z ) = (¯       ¯i )- {-[exp(^

captures the degree of price stickiness. Along with the assumption that steady-state inflation
is zero, a fully attentive US firm chooses p

in each period. The cost of providing a unit of the good to a Canadian consumer is higher
by the amount of the iceberg trade cost  . The real exchange rate in the second line of the
equation converts the cost in terms of Canadian goods to compare it to the relative price
pit (z ). When discounting the US firm's real profits in each period, qt+k in the first line of (8)
converts these profits in terms of the US goods.

2.3.2      Inattentive firms

We now consider the firm's maximization problem when a firm is less than fully attentive to
the state variables that enter into its objective function. This problem is called the "sparse
max" because Gabaix (2014) originally developed the model in which the economic agents
respond to only a limited number of variables out of numerous variables.
      In our model, a firm's marginal cost is a function of aggregate variables including the real
wage and the real exchange rate, as well as microeconomic variables, such as good-specific
productivity shocks. For simplicity, we assume that the firm is fully attentive to its own
productivity but possibly less attentive to the aggregate variables.
      Let us augment (6) with the degree of attention mH  [0, 1] and introduce the "attention-

increases expected profits, a benefit, but being more attentive is costly. We employ the

      In the attention-augmented objective function, we do not explicitly introduce mH as a coefficient on
   k
   l=1 t+l in (7). This is because we examine the log-linearized first-order condition for the optimal prices.
When we take the log-linearization, the presence of mH in (7) does not matter for the first-order terms.
Further, nor do we explicitly introduce "cognitive discounting" as in Gabaix (2020). Gabaix (2020) assumes
that the effect of k period-ahead economic variables on the agent's expectations is weakened relative to the
rational agent's expectations, in addition to the degree of attention. In the present model setup, however, we
can show that the presence of cognitive discounting does not matter for our results.

The solution of the first step is given by mH = H /(H + ). In the second step, the firm
chooses the optimal price (11), given the solution of the first step.7
       In this sparse max, the choice of mH = H /(H + ) = 0 is excluded as long as V ar(^
                                                                                        µHt ) >
0, which implies H > 0. Gabaix (2014) showed that in the case of a quadratic cost function,
the selected degree of attention is zero if and only if there is no uncertainty in the variables
to which the economic agents pay only partial attention.8 In addition, in the special case of
 = 0, mH = H /(H + ) = 1 is selected because  = 0 means that there is no cost of paying
attention. For these reasons, in the following analysis, we focus on the case of mH  (0, 1].
As we discuss later, these assumptions are convenient for our objective of accounting for the
PPP puzzle because they ensure the stationarity of the PPP and LOP deviations.
       Note that we can also introduce inattention to the idiosyncratic productivity and derive
the expressions similar to (13) and (14). Nevertheless, we focus on the case that firms are fully
attentive to their productivity but are inattentive to the aggregate component for three rea-
sons. First, in general, the level of uncertainty matters for the size of the degree of attention.
Naturally, the volatility of the idiosyncratic shock can be much higher than the aggregate
shocks. In this case, H for the idiosyncratic productivity would be much larger than H
for the aggregate component of the marginal cost, meaning that the degree of attention to
the idiosyncratic variable is closer to unity than that to the aggregate variable. Second,
firms may have easier access to information on their variables rather than the macroeconomic
variables. In this case,  for their productivity may be much lower than  for the aggregate
shock, such as monetary shocks. Thus, the degree of attention to the idiosyncratic variable is
   7
     In Appendix A.2, we derive (13) and (14) that are relevant to US firms selling in US markets. The
appendix also describes the remaining sparse max for US firms selling abroad and Canadian firms selling in
the Canadian and US markets.

     Gabaix (2014) discusses the properties of the selected degree of attention using not only the quadratic
cost function but also the other functional forms of the cost function.


                                                     10
again closer to unity. Finally, our test of behavioral inattention in Section 4 can still detect
the inattention to the aggregate variable even if we allow inattention to their idiosyncratic
productivity. In other words, our test is fully robust to the presence of inattention to their
idiosyncratic productivity. In this sense, the full attention to idiosyncratic productivity is a
convenient assumption for focusing on the presence of inattention to the aggregate variable.


2.4       Equilibrium
The monetary authority in each country determines the national stock of money. Following
Kehoe and Midrigan (2007), we assume that the log of the money supply follows a random
walk:

                                         ln Mt = ln Mt-1 + M
                                                           t ,                                          (15)
                                                                   M
                                         ln Mt = ln Mt-1 + t ,                                          (16)

                     
where M     M
      t and t are zero-mean i.i.d. shocks. Importantly, the stochastic processes, com-
bined with (3) and the CIA constraints, imply a nominal exchange rate that follows a random
walk, which is empirically plausible. In particular, we have St = Mt /Mt from (3) and the
                                                                                                     
CIA constraints. This equation leads to ln St = ln St-1 + n         n   M   M
                                                          t , where t = t - t is the
shock to the nominal exchange rate. We simply call n
                                                   t the nominal shock.
       For simplicity, we assume that the log labor productivity also follows a zero-mean i.i.d.

to equal nominal transfers from the government to domestic residents: Tt = Mt - Mt-1

     Later we consider an alternative stochastic process for productivity, but the empirical results from the
test of behavioral inattention are unaffected.

Here, the expression reflects the forward-looking properties in the Calvo pricing and  affects
the extent to which firms place weights on the expected marginal cost. Derivation of the
second equality is provided in Appendix A.3. The optimal price set by US firms for the
Canadian market is given by:

In (27), we employ the assumption of a symmetry between the US and Canada. That is, the
degrees of attention in the production of domestically consumed goods are identical in the
US and Canada, such that mF = mH . Likewise, the degrees of attention in the production
of exported goods are also identical, such that mH = mF .
   Recall that the PPP deviation, or the aggregate real exchange rate, is defined by qt =
St Pt /Pt . Similarly, the LOP deviation, or the good-level real exchange rate, is defined by
           
qit = St Pit /Pit . Using pit and pit , q
                                        ^it is expressed as

                                          q

   We combine (20) - (28), and the CIA constraints to obtain the expression for the good-
level real exchange rate. The following proposition summarizes the dynamics of the good-level
real exchange rate.

Proposition 1 Under the preferences given by U (c, n) = ln c - n, the CIA constraints,
the stochastic processes of money supply (15) and (16), the stochastic processes of the labor
productivity (17) and (18), and the Calvo pricing with the degree of price stickiness   (0, 1),
the stochastic process of the good-level real exchange rate is given by:

Proof. See Appendix A.4.

       This stochastic process for the good-level real exchange rate generalizes the simple stochas-
tic process considered by Kehoe and Midrigan (2007) who emphasized the importance of
nominal shocks. They showed that under the fully attentive rational expectations model, the
good-level real exchange rate follows an autoregressive process of order one (AR(1)) driven
by the nominal shock n
                     t:
                                       ln qit =  ln qit-1 + n
                                                            t.                                       (31)

This equation is a special case of (29) with m = 1 and  = 0.10 To gain some intuition
                                               
behind (31), recall that ln qit = ln St + ln Pit - ln Pit . Suppose that money supply increases
unexpectedly in the US. While the unexpected increase in the domestic money supply keeps
  
Pit constant, it increases St and Pit . Notice that the nominal exchange rate is free to adjust,
while the adjustment of Pit is slow because of sticky prices. As a result, the increase in Pit
only partially offsets the increase in St . The extent of the offsetting effect depends on . If
  0, a change in Pit perfectly offsets the increase in St , meaning that the nominal shock is
irrelevant for the real exchange rate. If   1, Pit never moves, meaning that the good-level
real exchange rate keeps track of the nominal exchange rate, which follows a random walk.
       Let us compare the stochastic processes for the good-level real exchange rates between
the cases m = 1 and 0 < m < 1.11 For comparison purposes, we maintain the assumption of
 = 0. If firms are only partially attentive to the aggregate component of the marginal cost
(i.e., 0 < m < 1), the good-level real exchange rate has the aggregate real exchange rate on
the right-hand side:

                            ln qit =  ln qit-1 + (1 - m)(1 - ) ln qt + n
                                                                       t.                            (32)
   Note that  = 0 if and only if  = 0 (i.e., no trade cost) from the definition of  = 1/(1 + (1 +  )1- ).
  10
  11
   Note that m is the mean of the degrees of attention mH and mF . Because 0 <  < 1 holds for   [0, ),
m = 1 holds only if all US and Canadian firms are completely attentive to the aggregate component of their
marginal costs.




                                                   14
The intuition behind the appearance of the aggregate real exchange rate in (32) lies in the
responses of relative prices p       ^
                             ^it and p it to aggregate shocks. If firms become less attentive to
the aggregate components of the marginal cost, relative prices are more invariant to aggregate
shocks. The more invariant a relative price, the more the firm anchors its nominal prices to
the aggregate price level. The link between the good-level and the aggregate price indices
leads to a link between the good-level and the aggregate real exchange rates.
       It should be noted that there is a single common driving force in both (31) and (32)
because the aggregate real exchange rate that additionally enters in (32) is also driven by the
nominal shock. Indeed, aggregating ln qit over i yields12

                                                                     
                      ln qt =                     ln qt-1 +                  n  .                                  (33)
                                1 - (1 - m)(1 - )           1 - (1 - m)(1 - ) t

Using (33), we can see that the impact multiplier of nominal shocks on the good-level real
                                                                    (1-m)(1-)
exchange rate increases from  in (31) to  × (1 +                   1-(1-m)(1-)
                                                                               )    in (32). In other words, the
behavioral inattention changes the stochastic process of the good-level real exchange rate but
not the source of its variations.
       When  > 0, a real shock represented by r
                                              it appears in the stochastic process as an
additional driving force. Stressing the importance of real shocks, Crucini et al. (2010b, 2013)
extended the Kehoe and Midrigan (2007) model to incorporate idiosyncratic productivity
shocks. Under the fully attentive rational expectations, their model implies:

                                ln qit =  ln qit-1 + n                r
                                                     t + (1 - )(1 -  )it .                                         (34)

This equation is a special case of (29) under m = 1. To understand the intuition behind the
                                                             
role of real shocks, again recall that ln qit = ln St + ln Pit - ln Pit . Positive productivity shocks
                                               
in the US firms producing good i reduce both Pit and Pit because the US firms sell their
goods in both countries. However, the home bias generated by trade cost will decrease Pit
            
more than Pit . This effect results in an appreciation of qit . For the case of 0 < m < 1, (33)
continues to hold unless aggregate real shocks are introduced. In the process of aggregating
  12                                                                                           1
     To derive the stochastic process, we integrate (29) across good i. In aggregation, i=0 ln qit di = ln qt holds
from the definition of the good-level real exchange rate. From the definition of qit , ln qit = ln qt + ln pit - ln pit .
                                                                                       1                 1
For the US relative prices, the integral of the relative price over i is zero because i=0 ln pit di = i=0 ln Pit di -
                                                                                1
ln Pt = 0. The same result holds for the Canadian relative price so that i=0 ln p     it di = 0. These results lead
     1
to i=0 ln qit di = ln qt . The resulting equation is ln qt =  ln qt-1 + (1 - )(1 - m) ln qt + n   t . Simplifying the
above equation, we obtain (33).



                                                          15
the good-level real exchange rates, all idiosyncratic real shocks are washed out in the integral
                    1
over i because        r di
                   i=0 it
                             = 0.
       To summarize, behavioral inattention generates a new term that affects the good-level real
exchange rate, namely, the aggregate real exchange rate. Time-dependent pricing models of
the good-level and aggregate real exchange rates without the behavioral inattention have
been theoretically developed and empirically assessed by Kehoe and Midrigan (2007) and
Crucini et al. (2010b, 2013), among many others. However, the importance of the behavioral
inattention has not been tested in the context of LOP deviations. In the next section, we use
a rich international dataset on good-level real exchange rates to test the model of behavioral
inattention.


4        A test of behavioral inattention

4.1       Methodology
In this section, we consider testing the null hypothesis of m = 1 (full attention), against the
                                                               ~it = ln qit / (qit-1 St /St-1 ) =
alternative hypothesis of m < 1 (partial attention). Define ln q
                                                
ln qit -  ln qit-1 -  ln St and ln q
                                   ~t = ln(qt /qt ) = (1 - ) ln qt . We estimate the following
panel regression model:
                                    ln q
                                       ~it =  +  ln q
                                                    ~t +  Xit + uit ,                                (35)

where ,  , and  are regression coefficients, Xit is a vector of the control variables, and uit
is the error term. This regression is motivated by (29) because it can be written as

                                                 ~t + (1 - )(1 -  )r
                                ~it = (1 - m) ln q
                             ln q                                  it ,                              (36)

where the nominal shock n
                        t in (29) is replaced by  ln St because the (log) nominal exchange
rate follows a random walk with an increment n
                                             t . To implement the regression, we construct
ln q          ~t using the micro evidence of  obtained by Nakamura and Steinsson (2008).13
   ~it and ln q
The error term uit represents an i.i.d. real shock r
                                                   it and is uncorrelated with the regressor
   ~t = (1 - ) ln qt because r
ln q                         it does not show up in (33). Therefore, we estimate (35) using
ordinary least squares (OLS). The control variables Xit here may include time-invariant fixed
effects or other time-varying components, such as common productivity differentials across
  13
    Alternatively, we can use the estimates of  obtained by Bils and Klenow (2004) and Klenow and Kryvtsov
(2008). However, our main findings are robust, even if our  is replaced by their estimates.

countries, which we discuss later.
   The key idea is the equivalence of testing the full attention hypothesis and checking the
                                                  ~t in (35) because (36) suggests that  = 1 - m =
statistical significance of the coefficient on ln q
0 if firms are fully attentive. When the null hypothesis of  = 0 is rejected in favor of the
alternative hypothesis of  > 0, the data are consistent with the presence of inattentive firms.
Note that because the nominal exchange rate is the common driving force of the good-level
and aggregate real exchange rates (ln qit and ln qt ), the two variables are expected to be highly
correlated to each other. In our regression, however, both good-level and real exchange rates
are modified so that two variables (ln q
                                       ~it and ln q
                                                  ~t ) are correlated only when the degree of
attention is less than unity. As an important by-product of the regression (35), the degree of
attention m can be obtained as m  ^ =1-   ^, where ^ is an OLS estimator of  .
   Some remarks are in order. First, we can generalize the stochastic process of labor produc-
tivity from a simple i.i.d. process to a more realistic process that allows for a nonstationary
stochastic trend and a stationary but serially correlated component. Let us assume that labor
productivity is given by:



                                         ln ait = t + t + it ,                                     (37)
                                         ln a             
                                             it = t + t + it .                                     (38)

Here, the labor productivity consists of three components: a global component t , a country-
                         
specific component t (or t ), and a good-specific component it (or it ). In this gen-
                                                                                                    
eralized setting, global and country-specific components follow t - t-1 =                   j =0 bj t-j ,
                                                                                   
t =    j =0   d j           
                  t-j , and t =   j =0   d j                                       
                                             t-j , respectively, where t , t , and t are i.i.d. shocks.
This error structure implies that the productivities in both countries are nonstationary, but
share a common stochastic trend (or the two variables are cointegrated). Because only the
relative labor productivity ln ait - ln ait matters in the dynamics of LOP deviations, the global
component becomes irrelevant in our analysis. However, this is not the case for the country-
specific component, in which case, regression (35) requires modification. For example, if t
    
and t each follow an AR(1) process with AR coefficient  and firms are fully attentive to
      
t and t , (36) should be modified to

                                           (1 - )(1 -  ) r
                   ~it = (1 - m) ln q
                ln q                ~t +                t + (1 - )(1 -  )r
                                                                         it ,                      (39)
                                              1 - 


                                                    17
      r       
where t = t - t . The only difference between (36) and (39) is that the latter includes the
                     r
new control variable t . We can obtain a similar equation even if we include additional lags
in the process of the country-specific component.
       Second, even if we additionally introduce the inattention to the idiosyncratic productivity,
our regression framework of testing behavioral inattention (to the aggregate variable) remains
valid. The stochastic process for the good-level real exchange rate (29) needs to be slightly
modified because ln qit becomes less sensitive to r                             r
                                                  it . A smaller coefficient on it in (29),
however, does not change our regression equation (35).
       Finally, an alternative way of testing m = 1 is to regress ln qit directly on ln qt with
additional regressors ln qit-1 and  ln St . The estimation equation is given by:

                                  ln qit =  +  ln qt +  Xit + uit ,                              (40)

where  in (40) corresponds to (1 - m)(1 - ) in (29). The control variables Xit in (40) now
include ln qit-1 and  ln St . Note that  = (1 - m)(1 - ) = 0 corresponds to m = 1 provided
 < 1. Therefore, a test of  = 0 against  > 0 in (40) is equivalent to the test of the fully
attentive hypothesis. Unlike the case of (35), however, the presence of a lagged dependent
variable in the right-hand side of (40) implies a dynamic panel structure. Therefore, dynamic
panel regression estimators, such as the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator
of Arellano and Bond (1991), need to be employed in place of OLS (see e.g., Crucini and
Shintani, 2008 and Crucini et al., 2010a).14


4.2       Data
We use the retail price data from the Worldwide Cost of Living Survey compiled by the
Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), which entails an extensive annual survey of international
retail prices. The survey reports all the prices of individual goods in local currency terms,
conducted by a single agency in a consistent manner over time. The coverage of goods
and services is substantial in breadth and thus overlaps with the typical urban consumption
basket tabulated by national statistical agencies.15 In our analysis, the number of goods and
services is 274. Recent studies using these data include Engel and Rogers (2004), Crucini
and Shintani (2008), Bergin et al. (2013), Crucini and Yilmazkuday (2014), Andrade and
  14
    In Appendix A.5, we report the empirical results based on this alternative strategy.
  15
    See Rogers (2007) for details on the comparison between EIU data and the consumer price index data
from national statistical agencies.

Zachariadis (2016), and Crucini and Landry (2019).
       The data contain prices in multiple cities over 1990­2015. Our analysis focuses on US­
Canadian city pairs. We use these city pairs from the two countries. In our data, there are
16 US and 4 Canadian cities.16 This results in 64 unique cross-country city pairs. However,
because some of the US cities have many missing values in the early 90s, our data are an un-
balanced panel.17 Nevertheless, the total number of observations available for our regressions
exceeds 350,000.
       We compute the log of qijt for each year (t = 1990, ..., 2015), each good (i = 1, ..., 274),
and each international city pair (j = 1, ..., 64). The prices used to construct the good-level
real exchange rates are the prices in a US city (expressed in US dollars) and the prices in a
Canadian city (expressed in Canadian dollars). We use the spot USD/CAD dollar exchange
rates taken from the EIU data to convert prices to common currency units. The EIU records
the nominal exchange rate at the end of the week of the price survey. This means that the
nominal exchange rate may differ across Canadian cities if the timing of the price survey
differs between the two cities. We confirm that the timings of the price survey in Calgary and
in the remaining Canadian cities were different from 2003 to 2014. Across other Canadian
cities, the USD/CAD exchange rate is common in all periods.18 Figure 1 plots two kernel
density estimates of the bilateral good-level real exchange rates pooling all goods and services,
one for the first year of the sample (1990) and the other for the last year of the sample (2015).
For our regression and empirical tests that follow, we augment the micro price data with the
aggregate bilateral real exchange rate computed from the official CPI indices, which the EIU
also reports.
       When we allow for the general stochastic process of labor productivity (37) and (38), we
need to control for the difference in the country-specific components in the labor productivity
r                                    r
t (= t - t ) in (39). As a proxy for t , we utilize the difference in real GDP per hour worked

      The US cities are Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Honolulu, Houston, Lexington, Los An-
geles, Miami, Minneapolis, New York, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington DC. The Canadian
cities are Calgary, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver.

      In particular, the survey only includes the data for Honolulu in 1992 and Lexington and Minneapolis
have only been included in the list of cities since 1998.

      As we discuss later, we adjust our regressions to account for this difference in timing.

4.3       Estimation results
Table 1 provides the estimation results for (35). In computing ln q
                                                                  ~ijt and ln q
                                                                              ~t , we calibrate
 at 0.34. This value of  is obtained by transforming the median monthly frequencies
of price changes for the US economy reported in Nakamura and Steinsson (2008) into the
in frequencies of price changes at an annual rate.19
       The table reports the estimates of  from regression (35) with the standard errors. To
control for unobserved heterogeneity in the LOP deviations, we include two types of fixed
effects. One is the good-specific fixed effects and the other is the city-pair-specific fixed
effects. Thus, columns (1)­(4) differ from each other in terms of alternative combinations
of these fixed effects.20 In addition, we control for the country-specific component of labor
             r
productivity t in columns (5)­(8) of the table, motivated by (39). In all regressions, we
control for the difference in timing of the price survey in Calgary by adding dummy variables
that take a value of one if a city pair includes Calgary in 2003, 2004, ..., or 2014.21
   Overall,  ^ is around 0.8, and much larger than zero, which is the value under the full
attention hypothesis. Because the standard error of the coefficient is around 0.03, the null
hypothesis of full attention ( = 0) is significantly rejected against the alternative hypothesis
of partial attention ( > 0).22 Our results for the test of behavioral inattention are robust to
the presence of fixed effects (see columns (2)­(4)), and to the inclusion of the log-difference in
labor productivity as a control variable (see columns (5)­(8)). Interpreted through the lens of
our theoretical model, these results suggest that firms are not fully attentive to the aggregate
components of marginal costs in making their pricing decisions. The table also reports the
                              ^ (= 1 - 
estimated degree of attention m        ^). The point estimates of m range from 0.15 to 0.20.
  19
      We transform the monthly median frequency of price changes in Nakamura and Steinsson (2008) into the
annual in frequency of price changes  as follows. Let f be the (monthly) median frequency of price changes
calculated in Nakamura and Steinsson (2008). If the price of a good is kept unchanged for 12 months under
                                                                                                                 12
our assumption of sticky prices, the probability of not being able to change prices within a year is (1 - f ) .
Nakamura and Steinsson (2008) report that the median frequency of price changes in all sectors during 1998­
2005 is 8.7 percent. Using the above formula, the annual infrequency of price changes  is calculated as
            12                12
 = (1 - f ) = (1 - 0.087) = 0.34.
   20
      While we do not report the result, we also allow for a fixed effect that is specific to both good i and city
pair j . We find that the estimated  is not substantially different.
   21
      The difference in timing of the price survey causes the aggregate real exchange rate to be city-pair-
                                             k       k
and year-specific. More specifically, let qt   and St   be the aggregate real exchange rate and the nominal
                                                                                                      k
exchange rate for a city pair k that involves Calgary in a year during 2003­2014. Here, ln qt           is given by
    k         k                                      k         k         k                          k          k
ln qt = ln St + ln Pt - ln Pt . We can express ln qt as ln qt = (ln St - ln St ) + ln qt and ln qijt as ln qijt   =
      k
(ln St - ln St ) + ln qijt where the variables without the superscript k are variables in the other city pairs.
                                                                       k
Therefore, this dummy variable can control for the presence of ln St     - ln St in our samples.
   22
      We report the standard errors clustered by goods, but the null hypothesis is also rejected even if the
standard errors are clustered by city pairs or years.


                                                        20
       Table 2 points to the estimation results when the calibrated  differs across goods. While
our model assumes the degree of price stickiness common across goods, the previous empirical
studies on sticky prices report the heterogeneity in the frequency of price changes. Thus, we
transform each good-specific monthly frequency of price changes reported in Nakamura and
Steinsson (2008) into the good-specific infrequency of price changes and construct ln q
                                                                                      ~ijt =
                                          i
ln qijt - i ln qijt-1 - i  ln St and ln q
                                        ~t  = (1 - i ) ln qt for good i.23 Even when we allow
for the good-specific degree of price stickiness, the null hypothesis of full attention is again
significantly rejected and m
                           ^ ranges between 0.11 and 0.24.


5        Explaining the PPP puzzle
In the previous section, we provided strong evidence for behavioral inattention using micro
price data. We now turn to the implications of this finding for the PPP puzzle.
       Let q be the first-order autocorrelation of aggregate real exchange rates. Because the AR
coefficient in (33) corresponds to the first-order autocorrelation, let us rewrite (33) as:

                                       ln qt = q ln qt-1 + q n
                                                             t,                                      (41)

where q = /[1 - (1 - m)(1 - )]. In the following proposition, we now discuss Rogoff's
(1996) PPP puzzle.

Proposition 2 Under the same assumptions in Proposition 1,

                                                q  ,                                                 (42)

provided m  (0, 1] and   (0, 1). The equality holds if and only if m = 1

Proof. It follows from the fact that (1 - m)(1 - )  1, where (42) holds with the equality
if and only if m = 1.

       Proposition 2 implies that the presence of behavioral inattention helps with the resolution
of Rogoff's (1996) PPP puzzle. That is, the aggregate real exchange rate is more persistent
than the degree of price stickiness implies. Without behavioral inattention (i.e., m = 1), q
is equal to . However, if firms are inattentive (i.e., m < 1), q becomes strictly greater than
  23
    See also Crucini et al. (2010a, 2010b, 2013), Hickey and Jacks (2011), and Elberg (2016) who emphasize
heterogeneity in price stickiness in research on the LOP.


                                                   21
. In the extreme case of m  0, the aggregate real exchange rate can even follow a random
walk, as q  1. Therefore, even when the nominal frictions are small, the model with a
small m can explain a highly persistent aggregate real exchange rate.
      We rule out the case of flexible price ( = 0) in Propositions 1 and 2 because (41) suggests
that  = 0 leads to no PPP deviations, even in the short run (ln qt = 0 for all t). Our model
thus requires nominal rigidities as the external source of the persistence of the aggregate real
exchange rate. We can understand this feature of our model in the context of real rigidities
in Ball and Romer (1990) or as a form of strategic complementarity as in Woodford (2003).
Using a closed-economy model, Ball and Romer (1990) show that real rigidities are insufficient
to create real effects of nominal shocks. They argue that a combination of real rigidities and
a small friction in the nominal price adjustment matters for the real effect of a nominal shock.
In our model, a combination of behavioral inattention and a small friction in the nominal
price adjustment could generate a substantially persistent aggregate real exchange rate.
      The left panel of Figure 2 plots q against m  (0, 1]. We report the cases of  = 0.34
(the solid line) and 0.68 (the dashed line) to assess the impact of changes in . Starting from
q =  when m = 1, q increases monotonically as m increases. The persistence becomes
closer to unity as m approaches zero. For example, the curve for  = 0.34 shows that q = 0.34
when m = 1. However, if we use m = 0.17, the mean of the estimated degrees of attention in
Tables 1 and 2, the same line indicates that q = 0.74.
      The right panel of the same figure illustrates the q to  ratio, which is defined as:

                                         q            1
                                           =                    .                                      (43)
                                             1 - (1 - m) (1 - )

This ratio measures the extent to which inattention amplifies the persistence of the aggregate
real exchange rate explained solely by nominal rigidities under full attention. The figure
suggests that the q to  ratio can be quite large depending on m. When m = 0.17, the PPP
deviations are more than twice as persistent as what is predicted only by the degree of price
stickiness (q / = 2.20).
      Let us evaluate how much the estimated degree of inattention can explain the half-life of
the aggregate real exchange rate. The upper panel of Table 3 compares the half-lives and the
first-order autocorrelations of ln qt between the models with and without full attention.24 We
also report the half-lives and the first-order autocorrelations reported in previous empirical
studies in the column headed "Data." In particular, Rogoff (1996) concluded that the half-life
 24
      The half-lives are calculated using the formula for the AR(1) process given by - ln(2)/ ln q .


                                                       22
estimated by previous studies is 3­5 years. This range of half-life is roughly equivalent to
0.79­0.87 in terms of the first-order autocorrelation.
   We reconfirm that the model with full attention performs poorly. When m = 1, the first-
order autocorrelation of the aggregate real exchange rate is only 0.34 because q =  = 0.34.
This low first-order autocorrelation translates into a very short half-life of 0.64 years. These
predictions are inconsistent with the estimated persistence of the aggregate real exchange
rates as the half-life of 0.64 years is far below the half-life of 3­5 years in the aggregate real
exchange rate.
   By contrast, the model with a relatively low degree of attention explains the persistence
of the aggregate real exchange rate quite well. For example, when we use the lowest point
estimate (specification (2) in Table 2), m = 0.11, the model predicts that the half-life of the
aggregate real exchange rate is 3.7 years, which falls in the range of 3­5 years.
   We next turn to the good-level real exchange rate. We let qi be the first-order auto-
correlation of the good-level real exchange rate implied by (29). The following proposition
describes the relationship between the persistence of the good-level real exchange rates and
that of the aggregate real exchange rate, as predicted by the behavioral model.

Proposition 3 Under the same assumptions in Proposition 1,

                                            q  qi ,                                          (44)

provided m  (0, 1],   (0, 1),   [0, ),   (1, ), and r /n  [0, ). The equality
holds if m = 1,  = 0, or r /n = 0.

Proof. See Appendix A.6.

   Proposition 3 explains the stylized fact that good-level real exchange rates are much less
persistent than the aggregate real exchange rate. (Imbs et al. 2005; Crucini and Shintani
2008). Importantly, we obtain this aggregation result without relying on the "aggregation
bias" pointed out by Imbs et al. (2005). They emphasized that the heterogeneity in the
persistence of the good-level real exchange rates induces a positive bias in the persistence of
the aggregate real exchange rate. Using multisector sticky-price models with heterogeneity
in the degree of price stickiness, Carvalho and Nechio (2011) successfully explain the positive
bias. By contrast, our model intentionally assumes homogeneity in the persistence across
goods. Nevertheless, our model can qualitatively explain the gap in persistence between the
aggregate and the good-level real exchange rates.

                                               23
       Once again, the value of m plays a crucial role in generating the gap between q and qi .
This point can be further investigated from the q to qi ratio defined by:

                                    q              1
                                       =                     A
                                                                 ,                                      (45)
                                    qi   1 - (1 - m) (1 - ) 1+ A


where
                                                                              2
                                          2
                                                  1 - 2
                                                     2 q  2             r
                            A = (1 - ) (1 -  )  2                                 .                     (46)
                                                q (1 - 2 )              n
The derivation is in Appendix A.6. Similar to the q to  ratio in (43), the q to qi ratio
indicates that q = qi if m = 1. Therefore, combined with the result from (43), full attention
leads to the complete failure to explain the PPP puzzle: q = qi = . If firms are inattentive
(i.e., m < 1), qi is strictly less than q .
       What is necessary for explaining the gap between q and qi is real friction. More specif-
ically, trade cost ( ) needs to be strictly positive and the elasticity of substitution across
brands () needs to be larger than one for the q to qi ratio (45) to be strictly greater than
one. If  = 0 or   1, there is no home bias ( = 1/ 1 + (1 +  )1- = 1/2) so that
 = 2 - 1 = 0. According to (46), either  = 0 or   1 makes A zero and thus (45)
becomes one. Likewise, r /n , namely the standard deviation ratio of real shocks (r
                                                                                  it ) to
nominal shocks (n
                t ), in (46) needs to be strictly positive. If the nominal shock fully dom-
inates the real shock such that r /n  0, A is again zero, such that the model fails to
generate the gap between q and qi .
       To assess the effect of m on the gap between q and qi , we calibrate the parameters in
(45) and (46). For the parameters of real frictions, we set  to 74 percent from Anderson and
van Wincoop (2004) and  to 4 from Broda and Weinstein (2006).25 , 26 Using these values, we
obtain the degree of home bias  of 0.84, which is roughly consistent with the parameter for
home bias used in the literature.27 The resulting calibrated value of  becomes 0.68. Crucini
et al. (2013) found that r /n = 5 is a sensible estimate of the standard deviation ratio,
based on the sectoral real exchange rate data in Europe. The households' discount factor 
  25
      Using US data, Anderson and van Wincoop (2004) argue that the transportation costs are 21 percent and
that the border-related trade barriers are 44 percent. Using these values, they calculate total international
trade costs as 0.74(= 1.21 × 1.44 - 1).
   26
      Broda and Weinstein (2006) report that the medians of the elasticities of substitution during 1990­2001
are 3.1 at the seven-digit level of the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) and 2.7 at the
five-digit level of the SITC.
   27
      For example, Chari et al. (2002) calibrate the degree of home bias as 0.76, while Steinsson (2008) uses
0.94.



                                                     24
is set at 0.98 and the degree of price stickiness  is set to 0.34.
   The left panel of Figure 3 plots qi against m  (0, 1] in the dashed line. It also includes the
curve for q with  = 0.34 taken from the solid line in Figure 2. As suggested by Proposition
3, the curve for qi is always located below the curve for q . Recall that the lower bound of
q is (= 0.34) at m = 1. This property is preserved for qi because q = qi =  hold at
m = 1.
   The right panel of Figure 3 indicates that the q to qi ratio is hump shaped against
m  (0, 1]. The q to qi ratio is one, when m  0 or m = 1. We reconfirm this from the left
panel of the same figure. When m is either zero or one, we have q = qi so that q /qi = 1
holds. However, when 0 < m < 1, the q to qi ratio exceeds unity. Indeed, when m is set to
0.17, the mean of m
                  ^ , the q to qi ratio amounts to 1.57, indicating that the LOP deviations
are 57 percent less persistent than the PPP deviations.
   Using the above-calibrated parameters and the estimated degree of attention, we assess
how much the model can explain the gap in persistence between the aggregate and the good-
level real exchange rates. The lower panel of Table 3 presents the predicted half-lives and the
first-order autocorrelations of the good-level real exchange rate. In the rightmost column, we
report the half-lives and the first-order autocorrelations of the good-level real exchange rates
taken from Crucini and Shintani (2008). The observed half-lives range between 1.0 and 1.6
years and the corresponding first-order autocorrelations range between 0.51 and 0.65.
   We can see from the table that the model with behavioral inattention (m < 1) performs
much better than the model with full attention in explaining the half-life of the good-level
real exchange rates. In contrast to 0.64 years under m = 1, the half-life is 0.93 years under
m = 0.17. If we set m at 0.11, the half-life is 1.22 years. Thus, the model well explains the
gap in persistence between the aggregate and the good-level real exchange rates. In the data,
the half-life of the LOP deviations is at most 1.6 years, but that in the PPP deviations is
at least 3 years so that there seems to be a gap of around 2 years between them. Based on
the estimated values of m, the half-lives predicted from our model are between 0.82 and 1.22
years for the former and between 1.83 and 3.70 years for the latter, suggesting the gap of 1.01
to 2.48 years between them.
   Before closing this section, two remarks are in order. First, it is straightforward to combine
Propositions 2 and 3 to obtain the qi to  ratio that measures the amplification from  to




                                               25
qi . In particular, using (43) and (45), we have

                                                      A
                            qi   1 - (1 - m) (1 - ) 1+ A
                               =                          1.                              (47)
                                    1 - (1 - m) (1 - )

Given that the equality is excluded as long as A > 0 and m < 1, the persistence of the
good-level real exchange rate exceeds . We can reconfirm this inequality from the left panel
of Figure 3. The dashed line for qi is always located above the dotted line for . The result
is consistent with Kehoe and Midrigan's (2007) finding that the observed persistence of the
good-level real exchange rate often exceeds the degree of price stickiness.
    Second, our model assumes quasi-linear preferences U (c, n) = ln c - n, but the estimates
of m are robust even when we replace these with the more general constant-relative-risk-
aversion (CRRA) form. In this case, firms expect a dynamic path for the labor supply from
the time of price setting to the infinite future, and the good-level real exchange rate does
not have a simple reduced-form solution. However, as shown in Appendix A.7, we can still
conduct a test for behavioral inattention and obtain the degree of attention by employing
the instrumental variables estimator under CRRA preferences. Our test rejects the null
hypothesis of full attention and the estimated values of degree of attention are very close to
the results shown in Tables 1 and 2.


6     Conclusion
In this paper, we offer a possible explanation for two empirical anomalies. First, the observed
PPP deviations are much more persistent than the theoretical predictions given by the stan-
dard model of nominal rigidities in prices. Second, the micro price evidence suggests that the
deviations from the LOP are often less persistent than the PPP deviations. To reconcile the
PPP and LOP evidence, we adapt the model of behavioral inattention in Gabaix (2014) to a
simple two-country, sticky-price model. We show that pricing by inattentive firms generates
the complementarity between the LOP and PPP deviations, which is the key to accounting
for the puzzling behavior of real exchange rates.
    Using international price data for US and Canadian cities, we implement a test of be-
havioral inattention and quantify its importance. We find strong evidence consistent with
behavioral inattention. Our model produces an aggregate real exchange rate that is more
than twice as persistent as the real exchange rate explained only by sticky prices under the
estimated degree of attention. With additional calibrated parameters, our model also predicts

                                              26
that the persistence of the LOP deviations is less than two-thirds of the persistence of the
PPP deviations.
   Based upon our examination of the behavioral inattention hypothesis, it seems plausible
that it plays a comparable role to other real rigidities in the existing real exchange rate
literature while also amplifying some prominent existing mechanisms such as sticky prices.
The avenues for further exploration appear to be quite promising.

A.1         The derivation of the objective function for the pricing deci-
            sion
To derive (6) and (7), we begin with the standard expression.28 The objective function of US
firms that sell their brand in US markets is given by:
                                        
                                                                                     Wt+k
                        vit (z ) = Et          k t,t+k (1/Pt+k ) Pit (z ) -                cit,t+k (z ),                    (48)
                                        k=0
                                                                                     ait+k

subject to the demand function by US consumers for brand z of good i conditional on the
firm having last reset its price in period t:
                                                                           -
                                                                Pit (z )
                                               cit,t+k (z ) =                  cit+k ,                                      (49)
                                                                Pit+k

where z  [0, 1/2].
       Using the definitions of pit (z ), wt , and pit , we rewrite (48) as:

                                        
                                                          Pt             wt+k Pt+k
                       vit (z ) = Et           k t,t+k        pit (z ) -           cit,t+k (z ).                            (50)
                                        k=0
                                                         Pt+k            ait+k Pt

       Next, for a generic variable xt , we express xt as xt = x
                                                               ¯ exp(^           ^t = ln xt - ln x
                                                                     xt ), where x               ¯
and x
    ¯ is the steady-state value of xt . In addition, by assumption, Pt+k /Pt and ait are both
unity in the steady state. Rewriting (50) yields (6):

                                                                                           
                       k   Pt
 vit (z ) = Et      t,t+k                   pit (z )] - w
                               ¯i (z ) exp [^

                                                                                                      ^it+k         cit,t+k (z ),
               k=0
                          Pt+k                                                            l=0


                           k                                    k                                          k
where Pt+k /Pt =           l=1   Pt+l /Pt+l-1 = exp             l=1   ln (Pt+l /Pt+l-1 ) = exp             l=1   t+l . For the
demand function, we can rewrite (49) as cit,t+k (z ) = [Pit (z )/Pit+k ]- cit+k = [(Pit (z )/Pt )/(Pit+k /Pt+k )×
(Pt /Pt+k )]- cit+k = [(pit (z )/pit+k )(Pt /Pt+k )]- cit+k . Using the log deviation, we can derive
(7):
                                                -                               k

   We next work on the derivation of (8) and (9). When US firms sell their brands in
Canadian markets, they set the price in the local currency. Under this assumption, the
objective function of these firms is
                               
                                                                                       Wt+k 
             vit (z ) = Et          k t,t+k (1/Pt+k ) St+k Pit (z ) - (1 +  )                c (z ),             (52)
                              k=0
                                                                                       ait+k it+k

subject to the demand function by Canadian consumers:

                                                                     -

   Using the definitions of p                                       
                             it (z ) = Pit (z )/Pt and pit = Pit /Pt , we rewrite (48) as follows:

Equation (9) can be derived from (53) in the same way as the derivation of (7) from (49).
   We can similarly derive the objective function of Canadian firms indexed by z  (1/2, 1].

A.2      The sparse max
Following Gabaix (2014), we assume that firms choose the degree of attention. Equations
(13) and (14) correspond to the case of US firms that sell their goods in the US market. The
US firms' objective function for choosing mH is based on the second-order Taylor expansion
of EvHi [pHi (µ            ^ Ht , 1] - EvHi [pHi (µ
              ^ Ht , mH ), µ                      ^ Ht , 1), µ
                                                             ^ Ht , 1] around µ
                                                                              ^ Ht = 0, which is the loss of
profits of choosing the price distorted by partial attention. In this appendix, we derive (13)
and (14).


                                                            32
   To obtain (13) and (14), we first take the approximation of EvHi [pHi (µ
                                                                          ^ Ht , mH ), µ

Here, the profit of the firm is evaluated at mH = 1 (which appears in the last augment in
vHi (·), but the price is distorted by mH = 1. We then evaluate the approximated equation at
mH = 1. The second-order approximation of EvHi [pHi (µ

When we evaluate the profits in (55) at mH = 1 but not the prices, (55) can be substituted
into (54). Then, together with (56), we now simplify (54) to:

While firms can reduce the loss of paying partial attention (59) by paying more attention,
they also have to pay costs of increasing attention, which we specify as a quadratic cost
function. Formally, the choice of attention for US firms that sell their goods in US markets
is characterized by:

                 1                                                      2 vHi

                                                                                                µHt ).

   The remaining sparse max can analogously be defined. The sparse max for US firms
selling their goods in Canadian markets is

Next, the sparse max for Canadian firms selling their goods in Canadian markets is

          min       (1 - m   2

                                                                                             V ar(^ F t ).
         mF [0,1] 2

By symmetry, we can easily show that                           
                                     F = H , which reconfirms mF = mH . the sparse
max for Canadian firms selling their goods in US markets is

                   1                                                    2 vF i [0, 0, 1]
              min    (1 - mF )2 F + m2 , where F = -                                        V ar(^
                                                                                                 µF t ).
          mF [0,1] 2               2 F                                     p  ^2F it



                                                      34
Again, by symmetry, we have F =             
                                H and mF = mH .

to t = ln Mt /Mt-1 - ^                              ^t + t = ln Mt /Mt-1 = M

result, (61) becomes

A.4      Proof of Proposition 1
We begin by (28), q
                  ^it = q    ^
                        ^t + p it - p
                                    ^it . From (3), the log deviation of the real exchange rate is

                                              q         ^
                                                   ^t - c
                                              ^t = c      t.                                 (63)

Thus, q
      ^it can be rewritten as:

                                     q      p
                                     ^it = (^     ^
                                             it - c        pit - c
                                                    t ) - (^     ^t ).                       (64)

                                ^it - c
   In what follows, we focus on p            ^
                                      ^t and p      ^
                                               it - c t to derive (29). Equation (24) implies


                 ^it - c
                 p                               popt
                             pit-1 - t ) + (1 - )^
                       ^t = (^                    it - c
                                                       ^t
                              pit-1 - c
                           = (^       ^t-1 ) - (^                 popt
                                                ct + t ) + (1 - )(^it - c
                                                                        ^t ).                (65)

          ct + t in (65) is equal to M
Note that ^                          t because of the CIA constraint of US households
and the money supply process (15). Substituting this result yields

                       ^it - c
                       p     ^t = (^       ^t-1 ) - M
                                   pit-1 - c                   popt
                                                    t + (1 - )(^it - c
                                                                     ^t ).                   (66)

           ^
Similarly, p      ^
             it - c t is given by:

                                                                      
                      ^
                      p      ^
                        it - c      p
                               t = (^       ^
                                     it-1 - c
                                                      M
                                              t-1 ) - t          popt
                                                        + (1 - )(^it    ^
                                                                       -c t ).               (67)

Substituting (66) and (67) into (64) yields an expression for q
                                                              ^it :

                                                              
                     q     ^it-1 + n
                     ^it = q       t + (1 - )            ^opt
                                                         p it   ^
                                                               -c     ^opt
                                                                  t - p it - c
                                                                             ^t   ,          (68)

                       
where n   M   M
      t = t - t .
   We next focus on the expression inside the bracket on the right-hand side of (68). Using
                                       ^opt
(20), (23), (25), and (63), we rewrite p it as


                              ^opt
                              p       ^t - (1 -  )[ a
                                it = mc                          a
                                                    ^it + (1 -  )^ it ],                     (69)

where the relative price index is determined by the aggregate demand c
                                                                     ^t and the weighted
average of labor productivity. In the equation, we also use the degree of attention m defined


                                                    37
by (30). We then subtract c
                          ^t from both sides of (69) to get

                  t from (63), it = it - it = ait - ait from (17) and (18), and  = 2 - 1.
   Substituting the above equation into (68) yields

Here, q
      ^it = ln qit and q
                       ^t = ln qt because ln q
                                             ¯i = ln q
                                                     ¯ = 0 from the symmetry between the
two countries. In particular, the symmetry ensures that ln q             ¯ = 0 and that
                                                                  ¯ - ln c

ln q
   ¯i = ln q  ¯
           ¯+ p i -p
                   ¯i = 0. Therefore, (72) is equivalent to (29) in Proposition 1.


A.5     Estimation results for (40)
Table A.1 reports the estimation results for (40) by GMM. We report the results of four
specifications. In specifications (2) and (4), we impose the restriction that the coefficients
on ln qit-1 and  ln St as control variables are the same as each other. This is because (29)
indicates that ln qit-1 and n
                            t =  ln St have the same coefficient. Specifications (3) and (4)
                                                                       r
differ from specifications (1) and (2) in that the regressions include t as a control variable.
   The table indicates that, in all regressions, the null hypothesis that  = 0 in (40) is
statistically rejected. In addition, the estimates of  are all positive, consistent with the
theory. Therefore, even if we directly regress ln qijt on ln qt , the data are consistent with the
partial attention of 0 < m < 1.

A.6.1       Proof of Proposition 3

As a preparation, we rewrite (41) in terms of the log deviation:

The variance of q

Equation (86) means that qi is the weighted average of q and . When we combine Propo-
sition 2, namely q  , with (86), it immediately follows that q  qi  .

                                             41
A.6.2       Derivation of (45) and (46)

Using q = /(1 - ), eliminate  from (86):

                       qi =  q + (1 -  ) (1 - ) q = q [1 -  (1 -  )] .                             (88)

Recall (74) and the definition of ~. Then, (87) becomes (46):

                                                                          2

                           A = (1 - ) (1 -  )  2                              .                    (89)
                                               q (1 - 2 )            n

From  = 1/ (1 + A), 1 -  = A/(1 + A). In addition, recall that  = (1 - )(1 - m).
Therefore, (88) implies
                                  q              1
                                     =                     A

A.7        The model with CRRA preferences
Let us assume more general CRRA preferences: U (c, n) = c1- /(1 -  ) - n1+ /(1 + ).
We modify the first-order conditions for households to allow for the degree of relative risk
aversion. Under  = 1, the first-order conditions imply St = (Mt /Mt ) (Pt /Pt )1- .
       If we maintain the assumption that the money supply follows a random walk, the equation
for St leads to the nominal exchange rate growth that is predictable through the inflation of
the two countries.30 Because this is inconsistent with the exchange-rate disconnect puzzle,
we replace this assumption by the new assumption on the money growth rate:

                                               -1     1
                                    ln Mt =        t + M ,                                         (91)
                                                       t
                                                - 1  1 M
                                   ln Mt     =     t + t .                                         (92)
                                                      

Under (91) and (92), the nominal exchange rate continues to follow a random walk.31
  30                                                                                   
     In particular, the nominal exchange rate growth is given by st = nt + (1 -  )(t - t ), meaning that
       
t - t can help forecast st .
  31
     To see this, note that the nominal exchange rate growth is given by: st =  ( ln Mt -  ln Mt ) +
                                                                                                    
(1 -  ) (t - t   ). Substituting (91) and (92) into the above equation yields st = ( - 1) (t - t     )+
                      M    M      n
(1 -  ) (t - t ) + t - t = t .




                                                  42
   Using the CIA constraints, we can rewrite (91) and (92) as:

                                     ct+k + t+k = M
                                     ^            t+k ,                                         (93)
                                                               
                                     c
                                     ^            M
                                      t+k + t+k = t+k ,                                         (94)

for k > 0. Later, we utilize (93) and (94) for deriving the estimation equation.

A.7.1    The derivation of the estimation equation

To derive the estimation equation, we follow the same procedure as the derivation of (29).
When  = 1, the international risk-sharing condition (3) is replaced by qt = (ct /c   
                                                                                  t ) . Com-
bining its log-linearized expression with (28), q
                                                ^it can be written as

                                  q      p
                                  ^it = (^      ^
                                          it -  c        pit -  c
                                                  t ) - (^      ^t ).                           (95)

               ^it -  c
   We focus on p             ^
                      ^t and p     ^
                               t - c t and obtain the expression for q
                                                                     ^it using (95). Note that
(24) remains valid even under the CRRA preferences. Therefore, we subtract  c
                                                                            ^t from both
sides of (24) and arrange terms to get

                   ^it -  c
                   p      ^t =  (^        ^t-1 ) - M
                                 pit-1 -  c                   ^opt
                                                   t + (1 - ) p it -  c
                                                                      ^t ,                      (96)

                  ct + t by M
where we replace  ^         t using (93). Analogously, (26) remains valid under the
CRRA preferences. Using (26), we have

                                                                     
                   ^
                   p       ^
                     it -  c      p
                             t = (^        ^
                                   it-1 -  c
                                                     M
                                             t-1 ) - t          popt
                                                       + (1 - )(^it    ^
                                                                      -c t ).                   (97)

Therefore, the good-level real exchange rate is

                                                   
                    q     ^it-1 + n
                    ^it = q                   popt
                                  t + (1 - )[(^it     ^
                                                    - c       popt
                                                       t ) - (^it -  c
                                                                     ^t )].                     (98)

Equations (96)­(98) generalize (66)­(68), respectively.
   We next focus on the expression inside the brackets on the right-hand side of (98). For

w
^t is no longer equal to c
                         ^t but is now given by w

forward-looking terms for labor supply. If  = 0, these forward-looking terms disappear, and

                                                     44
the equation coincides with (72). Under our assumptions,  does not appear in (105). More
importantly,  does not affect the coefficient on the aggregate real exchange rate.
   As in the proof of Proposition 2, the symmetry between the two countries implies that
q
¯i = q
     ¯ = 1, and thus q
                     ^it = ln qit and q
                                      ^t = ln qt . Likewise, the symmetry implies the same
steady-state labor supply between the two countries: n ¯  , leading to n
                                                     ¯=n                    ^
                                                                       ^t - n                 
                                                                              t = ln nt - ln nt .
Substitution of these equations into the above equation leads to

            ln qit =  ln qit-1 + (1 - )(1 - m) ln qt + n                  r
                                                         t + (1 - )(1 -  )it                  (106)

which generalizes (29).
   To derive the estimation equation for our empirical analysis, we use the definition of q
                                                                                          ~it
and q
    ~t and further rewrite (106) as

                                                            (1 - )(1 -  )
                           ~t + (1 - )(1 -  )r
          ~it = (1 - m) ln q
       ln q                                  it - m                  - 1
                                                                          (ln nt - ln nt ),

or equivalently,

        ~it -  Et ln q
     ln q            ~it+1 = (1 - m)(ln q
                                        ~t -  Et ln q

where Xit includes the log-difference in labor supply ln nt - ln nt and  includes -(1 - )(1 -
 )m as an element. Note that OLS is no longer a valid estimation because uit now
                           ~it+1 - Et ln q
includes forecast error ln q                          ~t+1 - Et ln q
                                         ~it+1 and ln q            ~t+1 . We thus use the instrument
for estimation. For the data source of ln nt - ln nt , we take the indices of total hours worked
from OECD.Stat with the base year 2010.
   Table A.2 reports the estimation results based on (108). We use a common  in speci-
fications (1) and (2) and the good-specific  in specifications (3) and (4). In addition, we
instrument ln q~
               ~t by ln q                                         ~
                        ~t-1 in specifications (1) and (3) and ln q
                                                                  ~t-1 in specifications (2) and


                                                45
(4). In all cases, the null hypothesis of full attention, namely  = 0, is significantly rejected.
The estimated values of m are also very close to each other, suggesting robustness to changes
in the assumption of preferences.

     NOTES: Regressions estimated using panel data for 274 items and 64 US and Canadian city-pairs over 26 years. Standard errors are clustered
     by goods in parentheses below the coefficients. The dependent variable is ln qijt - (ln qijt-1 -  ln St ), where  is calibrated at 0.34. The table
     reports the regression coefficients on (1 - ) ln qt . Each specification includes dummy variables that control for the difference in timing of the price
     survey in Calgary over 2003­2014. In columns (5)­(8), we control for the difference in the log of real GDP per hour worked. Each column reports
     the estimate of m along with the p-value for the null of m = 1. The "Adj. R2 " denotes the adjusted R-squared.

NOTES: The table reports the half-lives (denoted "HL") and the first-order autocorrelations (denoted q
and qi ) of the real exchange rates predicted by the model. The unit of half-lives is a year. To calculate
the predicted values in the table, we use the calibrated values of  = 0.34,  = 0.74,  = 4, r /s = 5,
and  = 0.98. The computed persistence measures are based on m    ^ = 0.237 (the largest estimate in Tables 1
and 2), m^ = 0.174 (the mean of the estimates in Tables 1 and 2), and m  ^ = 0.106 (the smallest estimate in
Tables 1 and 2), together with the model with full attention (m = 1) for reference. The rightmost column
reports estimates from previous studies for comparison. For the aggregate real exchange rate, we take the
range of the half-lives from Rogoff (1996) and compute the implied first-order autocorrelations from the half-
lives. For the good-level real exchange rate, we take the median estimate of the half-lives and the first-order
autocorrelations of all goods provided in Table 4 of Crucini and Shintani (2008).

NOTES: The estimation equation is given by (40). Following Arellano and Bond (1991), we regress  ln qijt
on the lagged dependent variable  ln qijt-1 ,  ln qt , 2 ln St along with the control variables used in the
benchmark regressions. In specifications (2) and (4), we impose the parameter restrictions that the coefficients
on ln qijt-1 and  ln St are the same. In specifications (3) and (4), we control for the difference in the log of
real GDP per hour worked. As suggested by Arellano and Bond (1991), the levels of the lagged dependent
variables are used for instruments, depending on the period of observation. The test for the over-identifying
restrictions is also reported in which the degrees of freedom for the chi-squared distribution under the null
are 299 in specifications (1) and (3) and 300 in specifications (2) and (4). See the notes to Table 1 for the
remaining details.
