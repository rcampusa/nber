The Institutions of Monetary Policy
Mervyn King
NBER Working Paper No. 10400
March 2004
JEL No. E0, G0, H0
                                            ABSTRACT


I argue that it is useful to think about the optimal design of monetary institutions using the insights

from the theory of incomplete contracts. The core of the monetary policy problem is the uncertainty

about future social decisions resulting from the impossibility and the undesirability of committing

our successors to any given monetary policy strategy. The impossibility stems from the observation

that collective decisions cannot be enforced so that it is impossible to commit to future collective

decisions. The undesirability reflects the fact that we cannot articulate all possible future states of

the world. Monetary institutions expand the possibility frontier of the technology of collective

decisions by raising the costs of making inefficient deviationsng from pre-announced paths.

Institutions also become repositories of experience and knowledge to facilitate learning about the

economic environment and communication to society as a whole. I illustrate the importance of

institutional design for the operation of monetary policy by reference to three case studies: the

collapse of exchange rate regimes in Brazil and the United Kingdom; currency arrangements in Iraq

and their reform after the 2003 war; and the relationship between central banks and governments

when the zero constraint on nominal interest rates is binding.
