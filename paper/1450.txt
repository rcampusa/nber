                  The Changing Cyclical Variability of
                 Economic Activity in the United States


                                   ABSTRACT



          This paper examines the changing cyclical variability of economic

activity in the United States. It first shows that the decline in variability

since World War II cannot be explained by changes in the composition of economic

activity or by the avoidance of financial panics. We then show that increased

automatic stabilization by the government, and the increased availability of

private credit after World War II combined to stabilize consumption and reduce

the variability of aggregate demand. The main argument of the paper holds that

greater price rigidity in recent times may have contributed to economic stabil-

 ity by preventing destabilizing deflations and inflations. Empirical evidence

is presented to support this proposition.

          Perhaps the most striking feature of business cycles is that

their amplitude varies widely from era to era and from country to country.

While there do seem to be striking regularities in the pattern of covaria—

tion exhibited by variables connected with the business cycle, there are

large changes in the magnitude of the cycle itself. These differences in

cyclical variation should properly be a subject of study by economists.

The existence of these differences suggests that "universal" models

of business cycles——models which neglect institutional determinants of.

business cycle behavior——will not be adequate to explain the phenomenon

of the business cycle.

          This paper extends discussions by Burns (1960) and Baily

(1978) of the changing extent of cyclical variability in the American

economy. We seek to link this changing variability to changing institutional

factors. In the process, we are led to a view of the role of price flexi-

bility in cyclical fluctuations which, while consistent with Keynes's own

views, diverges sharply from the views characteristic both of modern

Keynesians and of classical macro—economists of the new and old schools.

          Our paper begins with an examination of the extent of cyclical

variability over different parts of the 1893—1982 period. Using a variety

of measures of variability and several different statistical techniques,

clear evidence emerges that the amplitude of cyclical fluctuations is much

lower after than it was before World War II. This result holds even if

the Great Depression is excluded from the pre—World War II sample period.




                                 —1—
             There is weak evidence that output shocks have had more persistence

    in the post—World War II than in the pre—Worid War II period. This casts

    doubt on the hypothesis that the successful application of discretionary

    stabilization policy is a significant cause of improved post—World War II

    macro—economic performance. A number of structural explanations for this

    phenomenon, including the declining role of agriculture, the increasing

    role of government, and the declining share of investment, have been suggested.

    Our examination of the data indicates that only the increasing role of

    government can account for even a small part of the decline in the cyclical

    variability of output and employment that is observed when the pre— and post

    World War II periods are compared.

              A clear distinction between the patterns of pre— and post—World

    War II data is the larger size of aggregate demand shocks during the earlier

    interval. We attribute this to two factors. First, the growth of government

    between the two eras led to significant changes in the relationship between

    disposable income and GNP. The existence of a large and progressive tax

    system in the post—World War II period tended to mitigate cyclical fluctua-

    tions in disposable income. This effect was accentuated by the growth of

    counter—cyclical entitlement programs, such as unemployment insurance.

    But large fluctuations in disposable income do not necessarily have any

    consequences for the behavior of aggregate demand if all consumers can

    borrow and lend freely. Hence the importance of the second major factor:

    a decline in the fraction of consumption accounted for by liquidity—constrained

    households.   Growth in the availability of consumer credit of various
-




    types led to a reduction in the number of consumers who were forced to cut

    back their consumption as a result of transitory declines in asposable

    income. These two factors combined to substantially reduce the Keynesian

                                      —2—
    multiplier,-'and therefore to enhance stability.

              Most of the major institutional changes in the economy during this

    century have had the effect of making the economy less "Wairasian." Both

    the size of the government and the extent of government regulation have

    increased markedly. Labor and product markets have become more concentrated

    with the growth to significance of unions and conglomerates. The attachment

    between workers and firms was less and wage flexibility was greater in

    magnitude before World War II than it has been after. In sum, the pre—

    World War II economy was much closer to the perfectly competitive, atomistic

    ideal of economic theory than was the post—World War II economy.

              Conventional macro—economic theory of both the Keynesian and

    classical variety suggests that macro—economic performance should have been

    better in the pre-Worid War II economy because it was relatively free of

    institutional rigidities and imperfections. Yet this was not the case.

    We raise the possibility that the increasing institutionalization of the

    economy may have contributed to macro—economic stability by preventing

    destabilizing deflations, and by facilitating private arrangements to smooth

    production and employment. This possibility, noted by Keynes, has been

    largely ignored by both American Keynesian and classical macro—economistS.'

    The much greater cyclical variance in real interest rates observed in the

    pre—World War II period is a piece of evidence in favor of this alternative

    hypothesis. Further evidence on the importance of this Keynes effect in

    explaining the changing character of the business cycle is provided by

-
    an investigation of vector auto—regression systems.

         The paper is organized as follows: Section I profiles the

changing size of cyclical fluctuations over the 1893—1982 period. Section II

discusses the role of stabilization policies maccounting for the decline

in output variability in the post—War period. Section III examines the

relationship between the "Walrasian" character if the economy, price

flexibility and output flexibility. Section IV discusses a number of sources

of evidence suggesting that the increasing institutionalization of the

economy may have contributed to economic stability. Section V offers a

short restatement of our conclusions.

    I.       THE CHANGING CYCLICAL VARIABILITY OF OUTPUT


                The sharp reduction in the size of cyclical fluctuations in output

    and employment between the pre— and post—World War II periods has been

    noted many times. In his amazingly prescient 1959 Presidential Address to the

    American Economic Association Arthur Burns noted that "its [the business

    cycle's] impact on the lives and fortunes of individuals has been substan-

    tially reduced in our generation.... There is no parallel for such a sequence

    of mild —   or   such a sequence of brief contractions, at least during the past

    hundred years in our own country." Figures 1 and 2 respectively plot the

    rate of change of annual GNP and the percentage deviation of GNP from trend

    over the 1893—1982 period. They show clearly the declining variability of

    real output.

                An indication of the magnitude of the decline in cyclical variability

    is provided by a comparison of the peak to trough decline in output between

    pre— and post—War recessions as defined by the NBER chronology. During the

    post—War period, the median decline was 0.2 percent and the maximum decline

    was 1.8 percent during the 1973—1975 recession. During the 1893—1940 period

    the median decline was 3.8 percent and the maximum decline was 37 percent

    between 1929 and l933.' Similar conclusions are obtained using data on

    employment or industrial production. For example, the median decline from

    peak to trough in industrial production was 12 percent during the 1893—1940

    period compared to a maximum decline in industrial production of 9 percent

-
    during   the post—War period.

                A somewhat more systematic examination of the changing variability

    of GNP is presented in Table 1. Three alternative measuresQ.f variability

are used. The first is the standard deviation of the growth rate of quarterly

GNP as estimated by Gordon (1982 a). The second is the standard deviation

of the output gap as estimated using Gordon's natural GNP estimates. The

third measure is the standard deviation of the residuals when a continuous

piecewise—exponential trend is fit through the GNP series. Estimates of

volatility over a number of sub—intervals are presented. The 1915—1918 and

1941—46 periods are omitted because of the special effects of wars on economic

activity. We also omit the four year aftermath of World War I because rapid

inflation and subsequent deflation make this period uncharacteristic of

the remaining Mierican economic experience.

          Regardless of which volatility measure is used, the conclusion is

that output was more variable before World War II than after it. By all

three measures output variability was about three times as great in the

earlier interval. Surprisingly, the much ballyhooed increase in economic

turbulence during the l970s barely shows up in the data. Apparently, the

1970s were turbulent only in comparison to the remarkably placid 1960s.

The data on the 1893—1915 period make it clear that the greater volatility

of output during the pre—War period was not just a reflection of the Depres-

sion. However, using either measure of volatility in the level of GNP there

is a noticeable increase in volatility between the 1893—1915 and the 1923—

1940 subperiods. This is wholly a consequence of the protracted downturn

in output represented by the Depression. No increase in the standard de-

viation of GNP changes appears because this measure places more weight on

high frequency fluctuations.

          There remain the questions of whether the declining.sariabilitY

in real GNP documented in Table 1 is statistically significant, and whether

                                 —9—
it reflects a decrease in the amount of statistical noise in the GNP figures,

rather than a real change. Neither possibility seems very likely to us.

          It is not clear how one should go about determining the statistical

significance of the differences shown in Table 1. Output movements are ser-

ially correlated and all tests of significance require some explicit model

of the process generating output. We will simply note that if successive

observations are treated as independent normal random variables, then the

hypothesis that the variance in output is constant can be rejected at a

level of confidence of less than .1 percent for annual data and .01 percent

for quarterly data.

          It is certainly true that the GNP data——particularly for 1893 to 1915——

are somewhat shaky. Gordon's quarterly data series is based on annual

estimates originally constructed by Kuznets and Kendrick. Kuznets, at least,

did not regard his data for the period before 1919 with confidence. He

sought to divert people into studying his estimates in the form of five— or

ten—year moving averages, and he was reluctant to publish his annual estimates.

It seems likely, however, that the deficiencies in the data lead us to

underestimate rather than overestimate the extent of cyclical variation in

the pre—World War I economy. The original annual estimates assume that the

relation between commodity production and GNP before 1909 is the same as the

mean relation from 1919 to 1939. The estimates thus damp out independent

variation in services and transportation that is uncorrelated with commodity

production. Moreover, a recent reworking of the commodity production figures

that underlie these estimates suggests that the original annual estimates

give too high values to investment during the exceptionallY dpressed 1890's
                                                                     sma1i.'

On balance, we are led to conclude that the decline in the size of economic

fluctuations between the pre— and post—World War II periods is a real

phenomenon, a phenomenon that economists should be able to explain.


Accounting Explanations

           One natural starting place in an investigation of the declining

volatility of GNP is to look separately at its different components. Perhaps

output has become more stable over time because the stable components

in GNP have grown relative to the unstable ones. In particular, government——

which is a—cyclic——has grown greatly in importance over the last century.

and agriculture, which is notoriously unstable, has shrunk rapidly as a

share of GNP.-' It has also been suggested that the share of durable goods

in GNP has declined over time. Since the demand for durable goods is

volatile, this is also a potential explanation for the decline in the

volatility of GI'JP.

           Table 2 presents some evidence on these issues. It does not appear

that the changing composition of GNP can account for most of the decline

in the magnitude of output fluctuations. The percentage variability in

year—to—year changes in our estimate of private non—farm GNP declined by

56 percent between 1893—1940 and 1947—1982 compared to 67 percent for total

GNP. The variance of non—agricultural GNP is only slightly less than the

variance in total GNP, even in the 1893—1915 period. This somewhat surprising

result occurs because the value of agricultural products demanded is

actually slightly less variable than all other commodity groups except for

non—agricultural perishables. The increased decline in the relative variability


6/This idea is a relatively recent one. In the 1949 conference that is
  the ancestor of this one, Kuznets referred to the neat coincidence of
  the simultaneous rise of a—cyclic services and decline of a—cyclic
  agriculture. See Simon Kuznets, "Comment," on Joseph A. Schuinpeter
  "Historical Approach to Business Cycles," in Anderson (1951).
                                 — 11 —
of total GNP is due primarily to the rise of government purchases, which

go from approximately 5 percent of GNP in 1900 to approximately 15 percent

of GNP today. Government purchases exert a stabilizing influence in Table 2

because the measure of variability used (year—to—year changes)

filters out the massive swings in government expenditure in the post—World

War II period associated with military purchases which occur at longer than

business cycle frequences.

          The last column of Table 2 shows that the standard deviation of

annual percentage changes in consumption has declined dramatically from

5.5 percent in the 1893—1940 period to 1.8 percent in the post—War period.

This development occurred despite a substantial increase —    detailed   in the Gordon

and Veitch paper in this volume —   in   the share of consumer durables in con-

sumption between the two periods. This suggests that the decreasing share

of durable goods in GNP cannot account for a large part of the decline in

the variance in output fluctuations. Moreover, the paper by Gordon and Veitch

in this volume shows that if consumer durables are included then there has

been no secular downwards trend in the share of GNP attributable to investment.

          We have also examined a number of breakdowns of GNP by component

including its industrial composition and the standard national income account-

ing breakdown into consumption, investment, government and net exports.

None of these exercises contributed significantly to explaining the declining

volatility of output, and so they are not detailed any further here.


Financial Panics and Nonetarist Explanations

        Many economists have argued that a major cause of the United States's

superior macroeconomic performance since World War II has be the smoother

path followed by the money stock. According to this line of thought, the

Federal Reserve Board has done a good (albeit not perfect) job in the post-

War period. It has kept the money stock from exhibiting the substantial

year—to—year swings which characterized earlier periods.

          The problem with this line of argument is that monetary aggregates

are in general endogenous variables. It is very hard to determine whether

movements in the money stock are causes or consequences of movements in

output. This is particularly true for the period of the gold standard,

during which the relation between the monetary base and the money stock was

very loose. Therefore, in order to examine monetaryliquidity approaches

to the business cycle, we concentrate our analysis on a class of events——

financial panics——that appear likely to be exogenous with respect to output,

and that are associated with substantial declines in the money stock. We

conclude below that, since financial panics cannot account for a significant

fraction of output variance before World War I, although they do account

for a significant part of the variance in the money stock, fluctuations

in monetary aggregates are perhaps best viewed as consequences of output

fluctuations. Arguments (like the one above) that regard the smoother growth

of aggregates as a cause of reduced variability rely on weak empirical support.

          It is also important to study financial panics because a large

body of thought from Bagehot (1873) to Bernanke (1983) places stress on

the importance of a smoothly running financial system for good macro-

economic performance and on the serious real consequences of collapses

in the chain of financial intermediation.

          This line of argument has typically run as follows: the financial

sector is unstable——subject to sudden sharp increases in the demand for

liquidity——in the absence of a lender of last resort. Financ, it is


                                 — 14 —
     suggested, bears a strong analogy to musical chairs; the last one to the

    bank during a panic walks away empty—handed. Therefore a financial system

    that lacks a lender of last resort will be prone to a collapse, to a sudden

    reduction in the amount of credit available and a sudden increase in the

    price of whatever credit is available.

                When it occurs, this financial collapse has serious real conse-

     quences. The division of labor, the successful functioning of specialized

    enterprises, depends upon the existence of a credit system:    agents must be

    able to quickly and cheaply acquire the resources to enable them to separate

    the time of purchase from the time of sale. In the aftermath of a panic

    there is a lower degree of financial sophistication, there are fewer possible

    paths of intermediation. This is, in some sense, a reduction in the "natural"

    level of output. With the financial system paralyzed as a result of the

    preceding panic, production opportunities that would be profitable if there

    were a high level of intermediation are not profitable at the lower level of

    intermediation prevailing.

               This point of view is supported by Sprague's narrative history of

    merican financial crises (Sprague, 1910), where Sprague recounts, to give

    just one example, how the unwillingness of banks to extend credit for

    trans—Atlantic shipments during the panic of 1873 threatened the "cessation

    of commodity exports," and how the news of this financial stringency in

    New York "partially paralyzed" the movement of crops in the midwest (pp. 58—61).

    This point of view is also supported by Bernanke (1983), who points out the
-
    striking   correlation between financial crises during the downward slide of

    the Great Depression and reductions in output in excess of what one would

    have predicted from the behavior of the money stock alone.


                                       — 15 —
          To test the adequacy of this hypothesis of the important role

played by financial panics we examine the effect of removing panic periods

on various measures of macro—economic stability. We focus on the period

from 1890—1913, before the founding of the Fed when panics should have had

their greatest impact. According to one formulation of the point of view,

periods immediately after financial panics have lower levels of "equilibrium"

output. Therefore, under this formulation, the variance of real GNP about

trend should be significantly lower if the immediate aftermath of panics

is excluded from analysis.

          According to an alternative formulation, panics occur at the ends

of periods of "overtrading," of "speculation." Therefore the periods im-

mediately before panics are periods of abnormally high output, and the

aftermath of the panic——which sees the decline of output back to trend and

then below trend to its trough——is not necessarily characterized by an

excessively high variance of real GNP about trend. But in this case the

aftermath of panics should show an excessively large and negative average

value for the rate of change of real GNP: if the decline from overfull

output to some level of low—intermediation equilibrium is to be ascribed

to the panic the decline must take place quickly, before the financial system

recovers its ability to provide credit. In the limit, if the economy

grew at a constant rate except for panic—induced declines, then excluding

panic periods would reduce the variance of the rate of growth to zero.

In practice, one would still expect the exclusion of the large negative

growth rates during panics to reduce the calculated variance of the

growth rate.


                                 — 16 —
           We considered two possible ways to identify panics. First, there

is the list of major panics which Sprague considers important enough to

devote a chapter to in his book. In the period from 1890 to 1910, from

the beginning of the Gordon output series to the publication of Sprague's

book, Sprague finds incidents worth a chapter occurring in August, 1890,

May   through   July, 1893, and October, 1907. An alternative, less judgmental

definition of a "panic"—--as a time in which either there is a (month—to—month)

lump of one percentage point in the coiiercial paper rate or in which banks

cease paying out deposits at par——produces twelve panics in the relevant

period: 1890:4, 1893:2, 1893:3, 1896:1, 1896:3, 1898:2, 1899:4, 1901:2,

1903:2, 1905:4, 1907:4, and 1909:4. Note that two of these less judgmentally

defined panics, 1893:2 and 1893:3, are really all part of one single distur-

bance according to Sprague.

           Given these two lists of panics, we calculated variances for both

the logarithm of output and the quarterly rate of change of output for several

different sets of intervals. First for the entire 1890—1913 interval, then

for the interval with the panic quarters and with three quarters on each

side of them removed, for the interval with the panic quarter and one quarter

on each side removed, and lastly with the panic quarter and the two following

quarters removed. The results were as shown in Table 3.

           Given the results of this simple exercise, it is hard to argue that

there is any way in which more than 20 percent of the standard deviation of

either output or its rate of change could be ascribed to the influence of

financial panics. Since nearly 40 percent of the variance in nominal mone-

tary grwoth is attributable to panic periods, this suggests tht financial

and monetary shocks are less important sources of depression than we had

suspected. Note that this exercise places an upper bound on the influence

of financial panics: if whatever causes steep recessions also increases

the probability of financial panics the pattern shown in Table 3 could be

generated easily without any direct path of transmission from financial

panics to the macro—economy.

               Are the numbers generated by the above exercise reasonable?

Is there any way to rationalize the apparent lack of strong links between

financial uproar and real recession? We believe that the conclusions of

the above exercise are reasonable, because the effects of financial panics

upon the rest of the real economy are smaller than is usually realized.


The 1907 Panic

           We illustrate this by considering in some detail one typical panic.

Consider the panic of 1907, which occurred two quarters into a recession

that saw a year—over—year decline in output of approximately 6.4 percent.

This panic was marked by the typical features of Sprague's major panics:

nominal interest rates suddenly increase, banks outside of New York City

attempt to reduce their loan portfolios, everyone scrambles for liquidity,

banks refuse to pay out cash on demand at par to depositors, and "business

activity" slumps by 26 percent from the quarter before to two quarters

after the panic (see Sprague, 1910).

           But what is most interesting is the small magnitude of the move-

ments in the variables that link the financial sector to real businesses.

When   banks   refuse to pay out cash for deposits at par, $1.00 in bank deposits

suddenly becomes a commodity with a cash price; in the panic of 1907, the

"price" of deposits followed the smooth path given in Table 4. Similarly,

with the breakdown of the regular system of intermediation, $l,OO0.00 in

deposits in New York suddenly became a commodity with a price in Philadelphia

or St. Louis.
                                     — 19 —
          These deviations from par are all small, taking the values as of

10/26 (they are within the normal range) as a basis for comparison. Even at

the height of the crisis a bank in St. Louis could still obtain deposits in

New York by paying a premium of less than 1 percent. Similarly, the premium

required on cash to make depositors willing to keep their deposits in banks

never rose above three percent.

          It is likely that these prices do not give a good idea of the

full extent of the panic. Agents may well have attempted to preserve the

good will of their traditional customers by continuing to trade with them

on "normal" terms of trade; "new" customers may have faced prices

significantly further from par than those given above. It is clear

that the deviations from par values of bank deposits could have had

a decisive effect on the profitability of any enterprise only if it were

leveraged to an extraordinary degree. If the quantity of credit were

rationed to familiar customers at "normal" prices, the panic could have

had significant real effects without these effects leaving their traces

in the numbers of Table 4.

          But the quantity of credit outstanding was not significantly

reduced during the panic of 1907, at least according to Sprague. Between

August 22 and December 3, the volume of loans outstanding decreased by

only two percent. Sprague concludes that for the crisis of 1907 at least

"it seems fair to assume that positive loan contraction was a comparatively

slight disturbing factor." The fall in output from August to December

was far greater, proportionately, than the decline in credit outstanding.

          Moreover, the New York Clearing House banks, the linchpins of the

financial system, increased their loans——from 712 to 775 million dollars.

could not have had severe repercussions on the level of real output.

         How, in the face of the scramble for liquidity on the part of

depositors that was one of the major characteristics of the panic, did banks

manage to avoid a major contraction in the volume of loans? Two ways——the

first was the suspension of cash payments to depositors at par that has al-

ready been mentioned. The second way was by the creation of new reserves

by the banking system. On the assumption that privately—created reserves

functioned as the equal of high—powered money, private actions increased the

monetary base by 10 percent during the later months of the panic. Privately

created reserves were of limited acceptability, it is true, but within the

banking system the $238,000,000 of large—denomination certificates issued

by the New York Clearing House and backed by the long—run assets of the

Clearing House banks functioned perfectly well as high—powered money. And

these $238,000,000 of extra reserves were also augmented by $23,000,000 of

small clearing house certificates, by $12,000,000 of clearing house checks,

by $14,000,000 of cashiers' checks, and by $47,000,000 of manufactuers' pay

checks——all of which functioned in at least some spheres as substitutes

for currency (see Andrew (1908), reprinted in Sprague (1910)).

          The small changes in the prices of financial resources during the

panic of 1907 and the quick action of private agents to take over the func-

tion of the nonexistent lender of last resort——the function of providing

additional reserves——seem to indicate that the merican national banking

system had developed a pattern of behavior by the panic of 1907 which kept

financial stringency from having devastating effects on the real economy.--"

          These considerations lead us to doubt that the reduced volatility

of output during the post—War period was primarily the resultôf the avoidance

of financial panics. We do not mean however to imply that panics never

had real effects. In particular, during the Great Depression when the

presence of the Fed discouraged banks from taking collective action to

avoid disastrous consequences, but the Fed itself was passive, financial

panics may well have played an important role. But the view that financial

panics were a principal cause of economic instability in the pre—World

War II period does not seem to be strongly supported. This finding weakens

the monetarist argument linking output variability to erratic monetary

growth, by showing that only relatively little of the variability in output

observed before World War II can be linked to exogenous changes in the

money stock. We return to the question of changing monetary policy in

Section IV.

          The analysis so far suggests that it is unlikely that either

structural or monetary factors can account for the decline in the variability

of output since World War II. The one plausible lead that we have uncovered

is the increasing role of government. We investigate the role of stabili-

zation policy in the next section.

    II.      THE EFFECTS OF STABILIZATION POLICIES


                    A major difference between the pre— and post—World War II periods

    was the government's acceptance after World War II of an obligation to

    stabilize the economy. This obligation was recognized by statute in the

    Employment Act of 1946 and pragmatically in the speeches and actions of

    various high officials. It is natural to conjecture that this change in

    attitudes and policies contributed to the decline in the volatility of output

    observed in the post—World War II period. It is also frequently argued that

    automatic stabilization in the form of a progressive tax system and counter—

    cyclical expenditure measures such as unemployment insurance have contributed

    to enhanced economic stability by reducing the multiplier. Econometric ex-

    ercises support this hypothesis: Hickman and Coents (1976) estimates of the

    real autonomous expenditures impact multiplier drop from 3.23 in the inter—War

    period to 1.88 in the post—War period. This section examines the contribution

    of both automatic fiscal stabilizers, and discretionary policies in explain-

    ing the post—War improvement in economic performance.


    Automatic Stabilizers

                    The traditional argument that automatic stabilization has improved

    macro—economic performance emphasizes the role of taxes and transfers in

    mitigating the effects of changes in GNP on disposable income.'

                    This account is less satisfactory than it appears at first. Modern

    theories of the consumption function presume the ability on the part of

    consumers to smooth out fluctuations in disposable income by borrowing

-
    and lending. If consumers, in fact, possess this ability, it is not clear

    why the government's smoothing the path of disposable income through

    fiscal actions should have real effects. Automatic stabilization policies

          (1978).

will have important real effects only if a sizeable fraction of consumption

represents purchases by liquidity constrained consumers. Thus establishing

the existence of liquidity constrained consumers is necessary to a

demonstration of the efficacy of automatic stabilization policy. But

this discussion raises another possibility. Perhaps the multiplier has

changed over time because the fraction of liquidity constrained consumers

has declined due to growth in the availability of consumer credit.

                This subsection explores these issues. We begin by documenting

over time, and then we turn to an examination of the importance of

liquidity constraints.

               We have already emphasized the importance of the increasing size

of government. The extent to which this growth has changed the nexus between

CNP and disposable income can be seen in Table 5 which reports the results of

regressions of disposable income on GNP for various sub—periods of the 1898—

1982 interval. We use slightly different subperiods here than in the pre-

ceding sections because data on disposable income do not go all the way back

to 1890. The results indicate a dramatic change in the relationship between

the pre— and post—War periods. During the 1949—1982 interval a marginal

dollar of GNP raised disposable income by $.39 compared to $.82 during the

pre—War period. There is no strong evidence of any change between the pre—

World War I and the interwar period in the share of GNP changes which fall

on disposable income.

               The changing relationship between GNP and disposable income is

well illustrated by the two recent serious U.S. recessions. During the

          Fiscal policies are not the only determinant of the linkage

between GNP and disposable income. Other considerations including the

cyclical effects on the distribution of factor incomes, and corporate

payout policies also impinge on the relationship. We briefly examined

these issues but were able to find little evidence suggesting that changes

in these other factors have worked to stabilize disposable income in the

post—War period. We thus credit fiscal policies with almost all the changes

shown in Table 5. This conclusion runs somewhat counter to Burns' (1960)

somewhat impressionistic discussion but we do not pursue the issue here.

          The foregoing discussion is relevant to the behavior of real

economic activity only if liquidity constraints are an important factor

in the determination of aggregate consumption. To identify the extent of

liquidity constraints we model aggregate consumption as a combination of

the consumption of unconstrained consumers whose consumption evolves

according to a random walk as specified in Hall (1978), and liquidity

constrained consumers whose consumption is assumed to be a constant

fraction of disposable income.

          For convenience we work with the data in logarithmic form.2" We pos-

tulate that consumption on non—durable goods and services evolves according to:

(8)       Ct =   Ct'   + Tn(YD)

where Cr" represents unconstrained consumption and m indicates approximately

the fraction of disposable income spent by liquidity constrained consumers.

  overidentifying restrictions present in the model presented below were
  more frequently rejected.

The polar case where in=O gives rise to the pure permanent income hypothesis.

When m=l consumption just depends on current disposable income.

          The argument of Hall (1978) implies, assuming that the real rate

of return can be approximated as a constant, that

          C   =
                  b1C1 +
where     is uncorrelated with any information available at time t—l.

          In order to estimate m we proceed as follows. First we assume

that YD evolves according to a second order autoregression process.

That is

          YD =                    + 2't—2 +       + U

                  p0 + PiYD   1

Combining (8) and (9) and (10) we obtain the estimable equation:

(11)      Ct = b0   + biCi + m[0      + (p1 —
                                                bi)YD 1 +   p2YD 2 + P3(t)]

where e is a residual that is uncorrelated with the         variables on the right

hand side of (11). Now (10) and (11) can be estimated jointly to yield

estimates of m. The overidentifying restrictions implied by the model

can be tested by estimating (10) and (11) in unconstrained fashion.

          Estimates of both restricted and unrestricted forms of the system

(10) and (11) using annual data on the consumption of non—durables and

services are presented in Table 6 for various intervals. The results

for the pre—War periods are quite striking. For the interval 1899—1916

the data support the hypothesis that essentially all consumption was done

by liquidity constrained consumers. Moreover, the overidentifying restric-

tions implied by the model are accepted comfortably. The results for the

entire pre—War period are also supportive of this conclusion though they

are less satisfactory. In the constrained equation case theoint estimate

of m is 1.4 which is implausibly large. The overidentifying restrictions

are also less well satisfied. These less satisfactory results probably

occur because our autoregression is not a satisfactory predictor of future

income during the Depression. When (in results not shown) the Depression

years are dropped from the sample but the 1920s are included, the results

look very much like those for the 1899—1916 interval.

         Unfortunately, the extent of liquidity constraints in the post-

War process is difficult to gauge because disposable income was not far

from following a random walk. However, the point estimates of both the

constrained and unconstrained versions of the model suggest that some but

not all consumers were liquidity constrained. Unfortunately, the data have

the power to reject neither of the interesting polar hypotheses. Hence

nothing definitive can be   said)'
          Taken together these estimates confirm that liquidity constraints

matter for aggregate consumption, as already asserted by Flavin (1981).

This suggests a role for automatic stabilizers in explaining why output

was less volatile in the post—War period. They also indicate however

that progress in financial intermediation may have contributed to stability

by enhancing the consumer's ability to smooth fluctuations in income by

borrowing. Certainly households have had much easier access to liquidity

in the post—War than in the pre—War period. The most striking rise is

in the volume of consumer credit outstanding: from $6 billion in 1945

or 5 percent of consumption to $380 billion or 23 percent of consumption

in 1982. The growth of nonf arm mortgage debt has also been remarkable:

from $27 billion or 54 percent of consumption in 1934 to $1,548 billion or

82 percent of consumption in 1982. By and large, before World War II American

households had (except for some mortgages and loans intendedto support

the leveraged purchase of securities) little access to credit markets. Ac-

cording to Robert A. Gordon's paper in Anderson (1951), the post—World War I

construction boom was primarily an apartment —   not   a single family house — boom.

Since World War II households have had a great deal of access. It would be

surprising If this structural shift had had no macro—economic effects.


Discretionary Stabilization Policy

        The most direct way of examining the efficacy of discretionary stabi—

lization policies would be to examine whether or not discretionary policy was

counter—cyclical in the post—War period, and to estimate its effects. This

is much easier said than done. Distinguishing the discretionary from the auto-

matic component of policy is difficult to do. Moreover, given uncertainties

about lags, gauging the effects of policies is also problematic. Exercises

such as the one performed by Eckstein and Sinai in this volume tend to suggest

that monetary policy caused at least as many recessions as it prevented, and

do not find much evidence for the success of discretionary fiscal policies.

We do not attempt such an exercise here. Rather we turn to a less direct

test of the possible efficacy of discretionary stabilization policies.

        The essential idea of our test is as follows. The variance in real

GNP depends on both the size of initial shocks to it, and the extent to which

they persist. Discretionary stabilization policies presumably work by re-

ducing the persistence of shocks to GNP, not by limiting the size of initial

shocks. Thus if discretionary stabilization policies became more efficacious

in the post—War period one would expect to see a decline in the persistence

of output shocks during this interval.

        Table 7 presents estimated impulse response functions for GNP for

various intervals. The variance of shocks is also presented. All cal-

culations are based on autoregressions of annual GNP     data.T The

calculations reveal that if anything the persistence of output fluctuations

increased between the pre—World War I and post—World War II periods.

Conconimitantly, the decline in the variance of output shocks between the

two intervals exceeds the decline in the variance of real GNP. Thus the

data provide little support for discretionary stabilization policy argument.

          A more subtle form of the discretionary policy argument, noted

in Baily (1978), runs as follows. Whether or not stabilization policy is

actually efficacious, it is perceived as effective. Because recessions are

expected to be short, consumers and investors do not cut back on spending

plans as much as they otherwise would. The prophecy is therefore self—

fulfilling and the economy is more stable. This argument is also put

forth to explain greater wage and price rigidity in the post—War period.

It is suggested that because the economy is expected to return to equilib-

rium more quickly workers and producers feel less pressure to cut wages

and prices in the face of shortfalls in demand. This argument like the

more direct one predicts that serial correlation in output should have

declined in the post—War period. As just noted, this prediction is refuted

by the data.

          The pattern followed by stock market prices provides a further

way to test arguments about confidence in the face of economic downturns

if one is willing to accept the following two assumptions: first, that

the expectations implicit in the stock market's guesses about the discounted

value of the future profitability of American enterprise are the same

as the expectations of those who decide on investment. We recognize

the weakness of this support of our argument, but we see no way to avoid

making it that will allow us to use the information found in the pattern


                                 — 33 —
of stock prices. Second, that the relation between the profitability

of those companies counted in stock market averages and the macro—economic

performance of the economy has remained constant. As a test of this

second assumption, we examined the cyclical variability of dividends

paid by companies listed in the Standard and Poor's 500 index; we cannot

find any significant changes in the cyclical flexibility of dividends,

and so we are led to tentatively accept this second assumption.

          The stock market is a leading indicator. It typically reaches

its real peak several quarters before output. The agents whose expectations

set prices in the stock market know that a recession is coming. The

magnitude of the decline in profitability that they expect can be seen

in the magnitude of the decline in the stock market. And so the elasticity

of the level of the stock market with respect to future values of the GNP

gap is a measure of the "sanguinity" of stock market investors, is a

measure of the subjective probability assigned to the possibility that

the recession may be the beginning of a deep, long period of subnormal

output rather than a short, shallow correction to the economy.

          Accordingly, we regressed the log of the real value of two stock

market indices (the Dow—Jones industrial and Standard and Poor's composite)

on a quadratic in time and on five, six, and nine leads (for quarterly data)

of the difference between the log of GNP and the log of natural GNP.

We also corrected for (substantial) serial correlation. Because the

behavior of the two indices was nearly identical, only the S&P results

are reported here. The parameter of interest is E B.

          Interpretations of these results, which are displayed in Table 8,

are dubious, because the exceptionally large degree of serial correlation

in the residuals tells us that whatever is moving stock prices (1) does

not follow a simple trend, and (2) dominates those movements induced by

the near—term (within two years) cyclical outlook. There is also an

errors—in—variables problem here: the value of the independent GNP gap

used is the ex—post realized value, rather than the ex—ante expected value.

To the degree that agents do not correctly forecast the near—term cyclical

outlook, the estimates of the sum of the lag coefficients are not consistent.

          Nevertheless, simple inspection of the various sums of the lead

coefficients does not lend support to the hypothesis of the increasing

"sanguinity" of investors. A given cyclical movement in the GNP gap over

the two years to come seems to be preceded by a relative decline in the

stock market that is, if anything, larger since World War II than it was

before. A given expected decline in real GNP relative to trend seems

to be associated with a slightly greater decline in the discounted value

of future profits——as measured by the stock market——than before World War II.

This simple exercise seems to indicate that those investing in the stock

market do not expect the same initial decline in GNP to be recouped more

quickly——due to government stabilization policies——after World War II

than before World War II.

          The analysis in this section suggests that automatic stabilizers

have contributed to the reduction in the variance of GNP that has been

observed since World War II. There is little evidence that discretionary

policies have played an important role. Indeed, the persistence of output

shocks has actually increased. But it seems unlikely that automatic stabili-

zation can account for the whole of the decline in the variance of output.

The declines in the volatility of investment that have been observed since


                                 — 36 —
the War exceed the declines in the volatility of consumption. Moreover,

quantitative estimates of the change in the Keynesian multiplier such as

those provided by Hickman and Coen (1976), are not large enough to account

for a three fold decline in the variance of output shocks reported in Table 7.

We therefore turn in the next section to an examination of other structural

changes which may   contribute   to explaining the declining variance of output.

III.   PRICE AND OUTPUT FLEXIBILITY


            Some common contemporary explanations of business cycles focus on

the role of institutional factors which lead to deviations from the atom—

istic competitive model of classical economic theory. For example, long

term nominal labor contracts are sometimes invoked to explain how nominal

shocks can have real effects on economic activity. Alternatively, long

term attachments between workers and firms combined with asymmetrical inf or—

mation——in a phrase, implicit contracts——are sometimes invoked to account for

involuntary unemployment and cyclical fluctuations.

            The evidence presented in that section suggests that this focus

may well be misplaced. We show in the first part of this section that, in

a variety of ways, the American economy has become much less "Wairasian"

over the same century that has also seen a pronounced trend toward greater

macro—economic stability. This suggests that the sources of economic

instability do not lie in the non—Walrasian character of certain economic

institutions)1 We then demonstrate that plausible macro—economic models

imply that increased price rigidity will increase rather than reduce

macro—economic stability. Finally, we suggest that price flexibility

by raising real interest rates may have exacerbated the 1929—1933 economic

downturn.

            The extent to which the economy was "Wairasian" in the past is

obviously impossible to gauge precisely. Market power depends not only

on the extent of concentration in product and labor markets, but also on


 12/Of course it is possible that, as argued by John Taylor in his paper in
    this volume, increasing price rigidity did exacerbate cycljcal fluctuations,
    but this influence was more than offset by other factors. We return to
    Taylor's analysis in section IV.

                                    — 38 -
factors such as costs of search and the extent of information asymmetries.

All these factors share the characteristic of being very hard to quantify.

However, the available evidence suggests that the American economy was

significantly more competitive prior to World War II than it has been since

the war.

           One indicator is the increased role of government after World War II.

The share of GNP passing through the public sector rose from approximately

4 percent around 1900 to approximately 10 percent in 1929—1937 and to about

16 percent by 1970. Of potentially greater importance is the greatly increased

scope of government regulation: by the estimates of Nutter and Einhorn

(1969), close to 22 percent of GNP produced in 1958 was produced in sectors

of the economy in which government was a predominant presence. And this

estimate predates the rise in the l960s and l970s of what is termed the

"regulatory state.

           A similar conclusion is suggested by the available data on industri-

al concentration. The percent of national income originating in proprietor-

ships dropped from 28 percent in 1929 to 18 percent in 1969. In 1918,

35 percent of total manufacturing assets were held by the nation's 100 largest

manufacturing corporations. Their share had reached 49 percent by 1970.

           Perhaps the most dramatic changes have occurred in the character of

the labor market. Some information on the changing character of labor markets

is presented in Table 9. A clear pattern emerges. Long term contracts were

essentially nonexistent prior to the passage of the Wagner Act. A small pro-

portion of workers were in unions, and the prevailing political climate

offered unions few of the sources of institutionalized strength that legal

procedures gave them in the post—War period. The share of unionized non—farm

workers was only 9 percent in 1930 compared to 29 percent in 1950. Likewise

the fraction of workers in institutionalized settings has increased

dramatically. The fraction working on farms has fallen from 38 percent in

1900 to 3 percent in 1970, and, in 1900, close to half of all farmers were

owner—operators. And the fraction of workers in white—collar jobs has

increased from 17 percent in 1900 to 48 percent in 1970. This is an interest-

ing statistic in light of the fact that a substantial proportion of white—

collar workers are engaged in what one might call non—market—oriented coor-

dination of production.

         Perhaps the strongest evidence of the changing character of labor

markets comes from information on separations. Ross (1958) examines the

argument that a new industrial feudalism developed in the U.S. following

World War II. As Table 10 indicates, the quit rate in manufacturing (the

only sector on which data is available) declines from over 6 percent before

World War I to close to 2 percent recently. The total separation rate

declined by about 42 percent between 1920—23 and 1973—79, implying an equal

percentage increase in average manufacturing job tenure. Even though most

turnover involves the young, these data still are indicative of a substan-

tial increase over time in the importance of something that might be called

job—specific human capital, and therefore in implicit long term labor

contracts.

             Quantifying the extent of deviations from the Wairasian ideal due

to more subtle factors such as increased labor market specialization,

and increased product differentiation is obviously not possible. However

a number of factors suggest those factors have increased in importance.

than the GNP suggesting a greater role in firms facing downward sloping

product demand areas. The educational level of the work force has expanded

greatly, as has the number of different occupations. To gauge the extent

of imperfections in today's economy, one need only ask how many firms are

indifferent to selling more output at prevailing prices? Or, how many workers

are indifferent to losing their jobs.

            It seems very likely that increased economic stability has been a

iwIiir'1-   rf fh.Q4 (lU'(l   TtQ -   PDr'mii,t tfP1 TfQ k'ttTgSfl T.7(VkPrQ
and firms, for example, slow the response of employment to fluctuations

in demand. This in turn reduces the extent to which demand shocks are

propagated by increasing the stability of disposable income. More formally,

it is possible to demonstrate in a variety of implicit contracting models

that because of workers' desire for insurance, employment is more stable

than it would be if a Wairasian equilibrium were attained every period.

Likewise, increasing conglomeration of firms, and the resulting increased

reliance on internal finance reduces the liquidity effects of economic

downturns. It is also natural to conjecture that regulatory policies

are likely to keep the output of regulated firms at relatively stable levels.

            It is unquestionably the case that price volatility in the American

economy declined in conjunction with the changes discussed above. The

standard deviation of annual rates of inflation from trend was 1.5 percent

for 1949—1982, compared with 2.4 percent for 1893—1915 and 4.8 percent

for 1923—1940. It is less clear whether wages and prices have become

more flexible in response to output shocks of a given size. Cagan (1975)

and Sachs (1980) report that wholesale prices have been less sensitive

to movements in aggregate demand during the postwar period. However,


                                      — 43 —
Schultze (1980) argues that there was little change in the sensitivity of

prices — measured by the non—farm GNP deflator — between the pre— and post-

War periods. Gordon (1980) finds that the initial response of prices to

nominal demand has not changed, but notes the increasing persistence of

inflation in the post—War period)-"

          It is not easy to make a coherent interpretation of these findings.

We suspect that there has been a small decline in short—run price flexibility

(a decline in the slope of the short—run aggregate supply curve), but that

this decline has been so small that it is not apparent in the less sensitive

GNP deflator and can be seen only in measures of producer prices. We do

conclude that there has been an increase in the persistence of price

movements. Below, we present a simple model to analyze the effect of an

increase in such persistence on macro—economic performance. Before examining

this issue, it is important to emphasize that the evidence presented in

the preceding section suggests that greater price rigidity in the post—War

period cannot be attributed to greater certainty that downturns would be

temporary. This possibility is refuted by the evidence suggesting that

output shocks have become more not less persistent and that the sensitivity

of the stock market to output shocks has if anything declined.


Is Price Flexibility Destabilizing?

          In the remainder of this section, we entertain the hypothesis

that greater price flexibility in the pre—World War II period was a cause

of greater instability in output. This is, of course, the exact opposite

of the canonical Keynesian nominal—rigidities point of view which leads,

in John Taylor's words, to the assertion that "less flexible wages and

prices should lead to a deterioration of macroeconomic performance."


13/And Schultze also finds increasing persistence after 1967, which he
   interprets as a shift in the inflation norm.
                                 — 44 —
But John Maynard Keynes disagreed, and in Keynes (1936) argued against

this very proposition, claiming instead that:


           it would be much better that wages should be rigidly
           fixed and deemed incapable of material changes, than
           that depression should be accompanied by a gradual
           downward tendency of money—wages, a further moderate
           wage reduction being expected to signalize each increase
           of, say, one percent in the amount of unemployment.
           For example, the effect of an expectation that wages
           are going to sag by, say, two percent in the coming year
           will be roughly equivalent to the effect of a rise of
           two percent in the amount of interest payable for the
           same period. (quoted in Tobin (1975))


Keynes seeks to argue that the simple solution to involuntary unemployment —

lowering   the nominal wage —   will   not work. For the economy is not a static

object converging to a stationary equilibrium. The lowering of wages (and

prices) required to get the quantity of real balances up to its full—em-

ployment equilibrium value itself creates an additional intertemporal

disequilibrium. For changes in the aggregate price level disturb what is

perhaps the single most important price in the whole economy, the real

interest rate.

           This point of view deserves a more formal examination, which we

provide within the framework of a simple macro—economic model. The

model highlights the fact that it is the ex—ante real —      not   the nominal —

interest   rate that should enter into the determination of investment.

It also provides for a distinction between price flexibility and price

persistence stressed by Gordon (1980).

           We treat all variables (except interest and inflation rates)

as log deviations from trends. Solving out an IS—LM system, where the




                                       — 45 —
nominal interest rate enters the LM equation and the real interest rate

enters the IS equation, yields an aggregate demand curve of the form:

             =                  + 2(Ep+1 —       +
(12)
                 1(m                                 Ct

We model expectations by assuming perfect foresight on the part of investors:

(13)      Etpt÷l =    t+l
          The aggregate supply side of the model is somewhat more complex.

An easy way to model the independent dimensions of short—run price flexibility

and of price persistence is to adopt a multiperiod nominal contract framework.

Workers are divided into n+l equal groups. Group j negotiates an n+l

period contract, with a fixed nominal wage, in all periods for which

(t)d n+l =           That is, using superscripts to denote worker groups:


(14)      W41 = W       ,   j   (t)d n+l


(15)             =     +    1    (W(J_1)mod n+l —    'mod n+l   )
                                                                    +


In the contract period, group j's nominal wage is renegotiated for the next

n+l periods. The wage rise won by group j in these negotiations is the

average of the wage rise won by the other n groups in their negotiations

plus or minus a term (czq) which is supposed to capture the effect of labor

market tightness. In their negotiations, workers are backward—looking.

Since we are working within the Keynesian tradition, we do not think that

this is an important defect in the mode1)' Moreover, any attempt to model

the wage determination process fully within an optimizing framework would

be hopelessly complex.


14/In subsequent work, we hope to examine the issues here within a model
   like that of Taylor (1979) where contracts are partly forward and partly
   backward looking. It seems unlikely that this will alter qualitative
   conclusions.

In   this framework, increases in the contract period — n+l — can be inter-

preted as increases in price persistence. Increases in the labor—market

conditions coefficient —           increases   in c — can be interpreted as increases

in short—run aggregate price flexibility. Because the model is designed

to highlight the effects of inflation on output, it has no role for

discretionary fiscal policy and no source of shocks other than                                 ,   the
shock to aggregate demand. We take monetary policy to be completely non—

accomodative: m is equal to its trend value (zero) always. This rules out

the possibility that the driving force behind economic instabflity is inap-

propriate government policy (a bad monetary reaction function) rather than

the internal dynamics of the model itself. We wish to use this model to show

only that the conventional wisdom holding that an increase in nominal rigidi-

ties (either in the form of a smaller response of wages to labor market

conditions or in the form of a longer contract period — more "persistence)

is harmful to macro—economic stability, rests on shaky theoretical foundations.

the volatility of output declines. This result implies that increasing

wage flexibility by reducing the length of the contract period might well

worsen macro—economic performance. This inference is strengthened by

noting that increasing the length of the contract period increases the

likelihood that the economy will be stable at all. Third, increases in

the sensitivity of current wages to output have an ambiguous effect on

the volatility of output.

          These results are entirely attributable to the fact that the real

interest rate — and   so L11
                         Ep — enters    into the determination of aggregate

demand.

          The model considered here is obviously highly stylized. No role

is allowed for lagged responses of output or money demand to changes in

real interest rates. Deflation has no direct effect on aggregate demand,

operating only through its impact on real interest rates. Thus, the

distributional effects emphasized by Tobin (1975) are suppressed entirely.

Perhaps most importantly, we assume no response of monetary or fiscal

policy variables to demand shocks. This exercise hardly proves that

price flexibility increased the volatility of economic activity prior

to World War II. But it does strongly suggest that deviations of the real

interest rates from its general equilibrium value caused by the process

of equilibration in product and labor markets, may contribute as much

or more to economic instability as deviations in product prices or wages

from their static equilibrium values.

          It might be objected that our analysis here misses the point since

we assume an aggregate supply mechanism which implies that a change in

the monetary rule could have a long run effect on output. Sucti an objection


                                 — 50 —
is made by McCallum (1983) to analyses similar to the one presented here.

This objection is miplaced. At one level, the criticism is irrelevant

since we do not use our model to consider alternative monetary rules.

At a more fundamental level, it ignores the need for economic theory to

provide a theory of how prices move to clear markets. As Fisher (1983)

and others have eloquently argued it is insufficient to assert that

economies will always reach their Wairasian equilibria, without describing

how they get there. Some sort of price—adjustment equation like (18) is

an indispensible part of any fully articulated economic model.

          A macroeconomic view that places stress on the dangerous potential

for destabilizing deflation present under a regime of flexible prices can

avoid some of the problems that economists have traditionally encountered

while trying to analyze the origins of the Great Depression in the U.S.

Economists like Temin (1974), who attempt to account for the Great Depression

by a decline in exogenous spending induced by falling "animal spirits," have

a difficult time explaining why those who make investment decisions sudden-

ly become more pessimistic. Without making reference to the destabilizing

effects of deflation, it is also difficult to account for rising real

interest rates in the face of an autonomous decline in spending.

         Economists like Friedman and Schwartz (1963), who attempt to ac-

count for the Great Depression in terms of an inappropriately contractionary

monetary policy, have a difficult time accounting for the behavior of the

real money supply. As Figure 3 shows, the real money supply actually

increased slightly between 1929 and 1933 while output was falling by close

to 50 percent. Since aggregate demand should be closely linked to the

real money supply, it is hard to see how a monetary impulse could have

a monetary impulse could have caused the Depression without ever reducing

real money balances. Moreover, without making reference to the effects

of deflation, it is hard to explain why nominal interest rates fell in

the face of a monetary shock.

         More generally evidence for the view that increased price flexi-

bility is destabilizing comes from an examination of the changing behavior

of real interest rates plotted in Figure 4. The standard deviation of ex—post

real rates on an annual basis was 3.10 percent in the 1893—1915 interval, com-

pared to .57 percent in the 1949—1970 interval and 1.37 percent in the

1971—1982 interval.-' Before 1979, the highest real interest rate observed

on a quarterly basis was 6 percent in 1974, and in only five quarters in

the pre—1979 post—World War II period were real rates greater than 4 per-

cent observed. On the other hand, real rates greater than 6 percent

occurred in every single reference—cycle recession (except 1903—04) during

the pre—Worid War I period. It seems clear that these variations in real

rates should have contributed greatly to economic instability.




17/The behavior of real rats since 1979 is, in the context of the rest of
   the post—World War II period, anomalous. A glance at recent real rates
   seems to suggest that Mierican economic policymakers are attempting to
   restore the pattern of real rates characteristic of the l890s.

IV.    IS AGGREGATE PRICE FLEXIBILITY DISTABILIZING?


          In section III we argued that in the standard aggregate demand—

aggregate supply framework there are no strong theoretical reasons for

believing that a small increase in aggregate price flexibility — defined

either as an increase in the responsiveness of wages to labor market

conditions or as a decrease in tpersistencett —   would reduce the variance

of output. We also expressed our suspicion that, in the United States,

the relationship between price and output flexibility goes the other way

from that typically assumed. We suggested that some of the relative

macro—economic good fortune of the United States since World War II can

be traced to the possibility that a flatter short run aggregate supply

curve dampens fluctuations in the real interest rate and so dampens

fluctuations in output.

          We put forth this potential explanation because the other mech-

anisms that we have identified cannot account for all of the decline in

the variability of output from the pre— to the post—War period. The

rising share of government expenditures can account for a small fraction

of the decline in variance, and the smoothing of purchases of consumer

non—durables and services as a result of automatic stabilizers and commer-

cial credit can account for a significant portion. But there remains a

substantial decline in the relative variance of "long—term" expenditures —

construction,   business investment, and consumer durable purchases —   that   is

documented in Robert Gordon and John Veitch's paper in this volume. The

standard explanation is that this decline in the variability of "long—term"

expenditures is due to the expectation of successful stabi1iztion policy.

But, since we cannot find the traces in other economic variables that we

                                   — 55 —
expected to find if this were indeed the correct explanation, we believe

that the decline in the variance of "long—term" expenditures needs further

explanation. And since "long—term" expenditures are, in theory, very

much dependent on the real interest rate, we advance the hypothesis that

the primary channel through which price flexibility affects macro—economic

performance is through the instability induced by aggregate price flexibility

in the real interest rate.


John Taylor's Analysis

           John Taylor in his contribution to this volume reaches exactly

the opposite conclusion, finding that improved macro—economic performance

has taken place in spite of rather than because of the increased rigidity

of wages and prices in the post—war period. Our explanation has the virtue

of parsimony. We attribute the major change in economic performance to the

major change in economic structure rather than telling a complex story

involving offsetting effects. Moreover Taylor provides no explanation of

the forces that have accounted for the huge decline in the variance of ag-

gregate demand shocks which he claims took place. As we shall argue below

Taylor's theory that monetary policy has become less accomodative over

time also seems implausible. Taylor rests his conclusions on bivariate

time series analysis of prices and output. We begin by showing that his

conclusions can be reproduced in a model where increased price flexibility

increases macro—economic instability and then turn to other aspects of

his argument.

          Begin with an aggregate demand curve similar to that in section III:




                                 — 56 —
(22)                 =
                         i(m —        + 82(Ept+i —      p)    +

and assume perfect foresight for investors:

(23)       EP+i =

Equation   (1)   contains            in order to make the timing come out right:

think of firms placing orders for investment goods this period, orders

which do not show up in output until next period.

           For simplicity, specify a simpler aggregate supply equation

than in section II;

(24)       Pt+1 — Pt = Pt        —
                                     t—l   +

The inflation rate accelerates or declerates depending on the output gap.

This aggregate supply equation is the simplest that is both "superneutral"

and exhibits "persistence."

           In order to close the model, a money supply rule is needed.

The simple assumption of section II, the assumption of no movement in the

money stock at all, will not be a satisfactory underpinning for empirical

analysis. We assume:

           m =
(24)
                     (l.X)p + Xp1
The money stock accomodates to the price level partially within the period

and fully after two periods. A value of one for X would imply no accomo—

dation within the period; a value of zero would imply complete accomodation

within the period.

           Denoting Pt                by       ,   solving   the model produces:



                     l—aX
(25)             =          t—l +
                     l_2               l_2

                                           — 57 —
                       —x
(26)              =          t-l +
                                     l_2
            Stability requires that:

(27)        X >




(28)             <


            If        follows a white—noise process with unit variance, then

solving for the inverse of the variance of output leads to the equation:



                                 +         +
(29)                         2                 (2 + l2X)2

Therefore further increases in the price flexibility parameter a are de-

stabilizing, increase the variance of output, so long as



(30)       a<                +1x
                      2     2l
But (27) and (28) imply that a must satisfy (30). In this model, the vari-

ance of output is least when a equals zero, when there is no flexibility

at all in the aggregate price level.

           Arid yet empirical analysis of a system generated by (1) through (4)

would produce results that might mimic quite closely those obtained by

Taylor for the post—War period. If the economist knew the timing of the

aggregate supply equation she might be able to recover it exactly:


31)              =
                      —i +
And if she attempted to estimate a combined aggregate demand—monetary

reaction function equation, she would come up with:

                                                                    (l—c82))
                                                                             \
                                                                                 t—2

These coefficients are too large to be taken seriously. However, their

size (but not their sign) is clearly an artifact of the model. The co-

efficients on          and t—2 are highly correlated, and the introduction

of a supply shock or of serial correlation in the demand shock would

quickly bring them down to more reasonable values —               their   large size in (32)

is due to the fact that the difference between                    and        carries

lots of information about                  .    It is interesting to note that (31)
and (32) might be rewritten as:


                =         +

(34)                  = ]Yt—l         +
                                          rr2p    2
                                                       +

which   bear a close resemblance to Taylor's (5) and (7):

                =
                    •88 +
                      =
(36)                      _1.O3tl + 73t—2
Therefore we conclude that Taylor's empirical findings are neither evidence

for nor evidence against the hypothesis that an increase in persistence

has led to an increase in stability. By assuming that the size of the

shocks is independent of the structure of the model, he can reach one

conclusion. By specifying a different underlying model — one that stresses

the role of variations in the real interest rate in producing variations

conclusions emerge

          It is a striking feature of Taylor's structural analysis that in

explaining the changes in cyclical patterns between the World War I period

and the present one, he finds that all the structural parameters in his

model change. Particularly surprising are his conclusions about monetary

policy. He finds that it has become less accommodative'under the current fiat

money regime than it was under the earlier gold standard. He attributes

the looseness of short run monetary policy under the gold standard to the

effects of foreign price shocks which should have led to specie inflows.

There are at least two important flaws in this argument. First, it is

implausible that, at a time when imports represented only about six per-

cent of GNP, foreign price shocks were the principal source of inflation

shocks, especially using the GNP deflator to measure prices. Second, analyses

of the gold standard surveyed in Bordo and Schwartz (1984), have made it clear

that short—run specie flows in response to price shocks were negligible

during the gold standard period. There thus seems to be little evidence

for the monetary policy assumptions necessary to drive Taylor's conclusions.


Reduced Form Evidence: Theory

          In this sub—section we present some empirical evidence to back the

hypothesis that price rigidity has contributed to macro—economic stability.

We had hoped to estimate a simple structural model, and thus to test

whether the data supported our hypothesis by testing whether the parameters


18/Taylor's finding that output is a decreasing function of past inflation
   is not evidence that the positive effect — through the real interest
   rate — of inflation on output is small. For Taylor's negative coefficient
   is for an equation that is itself not structural, that is a combination
   of the aggregate demand equation and the monetary policy reaction function.

                                 — 60 —
of the structural model fell in a region in which aggregate price flexibility

was destabilizing on the margin. But we are unable to do so. Attempts

at estimation repeatedly failed to converge or converged to unstable para-

meter values. We appear to have been unable to nest our hypothesis in

a structural model which is both tractable, in the sense of being simple

enough for us to gain some analytic understanding of its properties, and

believable, in the sense of not being rejected out of hand by the data.

          Since the restrictions we found necessary to formulate a model

that we could understand and interpret served also to destroy the fit of

the model with the data, we shifted to non—structural estimation. The

current practice among economists seeking to draw conclusions that are

not highly sensitive to minor changes in the underlying model is to use

vector autoregressions and to plot the resulting impulse response functions.

In such an analysis, a positive response of output to an inflation shock

might be taken as evidence in favor of our approach.

          We have run analyses along these lines, but find problems in

interpreting the impulse response functions as evidence for any position

since we have no good idea what an ttinflation shock" is, what actual

economic processes it represents. Therefore we also present (quasi—)

reduced forms for output, and argue that the pattern of coefficients that

emerges is hard to justify with any underlying theoretical model other

than our hypothesis.

          According to the mainstream Keynesian macro—economic approaches,

the primary determinants of output are three: lagged output, (lagged)

real money balances —   operating   through wealth and liquidity effects —

and the nominal interest rate. Lower real money balances choke off

aggregate demand in general, and higher nominal interest rates reduce

                                    — 61 —
the demand for investment goods in particular. Whether one believes

that rea:Lbalances are only a passive indicator of nominal interest rates,

credit conditions, and animal spirits; or that interest rates are only

an index of the underlying determinant, real balances; it remains true

that output should be, in any kind of reduced form, a positive function

of (present and) lagged real balances and a negative function of (present

and) lagged interest rates.

            Implicit in the mainstream view is a "Keynesian" picture of

price adjustment. Changes in real balances or nominal interest rates

cause disturbances in aggregate demand. Because in the aggregate quantity

adjusts more quickly than price, the changes in the movement of the price

level associated with changes in real balances and in interest rates

show up —   in   the time period relevant to the study of business cycles —

only   after the movement in output. In the mainstream view, the price

level responds to its own lagged values and to the level of nominal

demand. The mainstream view cannot account for a significant positive

link running from prices to output without abandoning the "Keynesian"

interpretation of the relative speeds of price and quantity adjustment

that is its foundation. There is one set of events which, according to

the mainstream view, should generate a correlation between present price

movements and future output. This is the case of the "supply shock," in

which present jumps in prices are associated with declines in future output.

But this produces a correlation with the opposite sign from that expected

according to a real interest rate centered theory.

            The explanation for output fluctuations usually given by classi-

cal economists follows these lines: some agents (workers, not firms)

misperceive relative prices. They believe that the real wage is higher

                                     — 62   —
(or lower) than it really is and so work more (or less) than is optimal.

If there ae intermediate goods in the production process, it is possible

to claim that output depends on both the degree of relative price mis-

perception and on lagged production of intermediate goods, on lagged output.

This line of thought produces a Lucas aggregate supply function:

(37)         =       — Et      +

Note that the new classical approach predicts that, in a reduced form of

output on lagged output, present and lagged prices, and other variables,

the only variables that can enter with positive coefficients are lagged

output. Lagged prices are useless as predictors of Pt —   Et   ipt, and

should, in the new classical framework, not enter into the reduced form

at al1)' Therefore we conclude that a significant positive effect of

lagged prices on present output is a phenomenon that fits easily into

neither the mainstream nor the new classical view of the macroeconomy.

And we believe that the existence of such a positive effect is evidence

in favor of an older view of business cycles, a view that places special

stress on the role of the real interest rate.

          With these theoretical observations in mind, we estimated vector

auto—regressions for a variety of periods and specifications on quarterly

data taken from Gordon (l982a) and annual data taken from Friedman and

Schwartz (1983). The results provide some evidence in favor of our

hypothesis. A price innovation has, looking at the impulse response

functions, a positive effect on future output. And, in the reduced form

for output, lagged price enters with a generally positive coefficient.


19/According to the new classical view of things, shocks have persistent
   effects even though lagged prices are not in the equation for q . Past
   prices affect past output, and past output enters the equation that

          We find this significant. According to the view that places

stress on the importance of nominal rigidities in causing business cycles,

price innovations have to (when nominal balances are held constant) have

a negative effect on future output. Deflation should raise the real money

stock and thus increase output. But the equations indicate, in support

of our more dynamic view, that deflation may itself lower output.


Reduced Form Evidence:      Empirical Results

          The first set of vector autoregressions estimates the following

three equation system:

                                                                                  p 1
          q       =     0   0    O23       q       +        A(L)      q    +     C
                                                                                     q
        ij            Lo 0       0       j[ij           L             ij       [c.j
where A(L) is a 3 x 3 matrix polynomial of order five in the lag operator.

The variables in this autoregression are

          q—   the output ratio, real GNP/natural real GNP

               the quarter—to—quarter inflation rate

          1—      the commercial paper rate.                    All data are taken from
                                                                Gordon (1982a).

          Note that the arrangement of the variables in the VAR is such as

to minimize the potential impact of any innovation in p. Only that part of

which is uncorrelated with
                                         E1q      and
                                                                E   1i will be counted as

an inflation innovation. Thus the risk that our interpretation of the

results Ia in error, that the VAR is reading correlations between                        and q

that are really driven by causal links from q to                    and from lagged q to q

as evidence in favor of our hypothesis, is minimized.


                                         — 64 —
          The VAR was initially estimated for time periods 1893:1—1915—4,

1923:1—1940—4, and 1949:1—1982—4. This particular three—variable system

was chosen because there is no quarterly data on the money stock available

before 1907. Thus, there are not enough data to estimate a VAR including

the money stock for any pre—Worid War I period. We are reluctant to base

any arguments on a comparison of the post—World War II period with the

interwar period alone. The Great Depression represents an extraordinary

cumulation of shocks and so is probably not well studied using the VAR

methodology.

          An objection to estimating this particular system might be made

along the following lines: the choice of variables —     output,   inflation,

and interest rates —   implies   that the effects attributed to the inflation

variable are only the effects of movements in accomodated inflation.

Unaccomodated movements in inflation will, because the interest rate is

an index of the real money stock, also appear as movements in interest

rates. And so some of the depressing effect of price rises on output

will appear as an effect of interest rate movements on output.

          Two facts militate against this argument. First, it implies

that the contemporaneous correlation between inflation and interest

rates should be positive, that "013 should be greater than zero. Instead,

"013 is less than zero (although not significantly so).

          Second, the equations were also estimated for the four equation

system consisting of inflation, the commercial paper rate, the output

ratio, and the detrended nominal money stock. The variables were so

ordered as to give the maximum potential scope to the monetary innovation,

the second place to the output innovation, the third place to the


                                     — 65 —
interest rate innovation, and the least potential scope to the inflation

innovation-s

           Quasi reduced form equations for output are shown in Table 12.

Impulse responses of output to an inflation innovation are plotted in

Figures 5 and 6.

           We note two things from these empirical results. First, this

methodology is not suited to the interwar period. The interwar period

is so strongly dominated by the Great Depression that all correlations

are warped: the decline of the nominal interest rate during the onset

of the Depression is the only variable the model can latch onto to account

for the depression, hence the excessively large difference in the coefficients

on the first and second lag of the interest rate. If one turns back to

Figure 2, this should come as no surprise. The Great Depression was a

unique event, and attempts to analyze the entire interwar period are, in

essence, attempts to generalize from a sample of one.

           Second, both the coefficients on lagged inflation in the output

equation and the impulse responses of output to an inflation shock are

positive and, in general, significant at at least the .90 level. This

correlation is not easy to explain within either the new classical

framework or the mainstream framework. The hypothesis urged here with its

emphasis on real interest rate effects does provide a natural explanation.

           This belief is bolstered by additional equations run (but not

reported). For various combinations of interest rates, inflation rates,

output ratios, real and nominal money stocks, the only equation which

failed to generate a positive correlation between inflation innovations

and future output and positive terms on lagged prices in the output

equation was a VAR which included no interest rate variable — only the

output ratio, inflation, and the nominal money stock. Furthermore, the

effect of lagged inflation innovations on output is significantly greater

for the four—variable system for those two post—World War II periods

which do not include the supply—shock ridden l970s. This tends to support

of our hypothesis. The 1970s were dominated by supply shocks, by dis-

turbances that first raised    and then reduced q. These shifts in the

short run aggregate supply schedule should mask the effects we are looking

do reduce the positive effect for the period 1949:1—1982—4, and that this

masking is only partial encourages us to think that we are correctly

interpreting our VARs and that the effect of price innovations is, in the

United States today, strongly procyclical.

            To sum up: an unstructured analysis of the correlations between

macro—economic variables carried out by means of VAR5 produces a finding —

inflation   innovations have a positive effect on future output —   that   is

hard to interpret from either an equilibrium business cycle or a nominal

rigidities perspective. We cannot think of other convincing reasons

for this association besides the one we advocate: changes in the aggregate

price level produce changes in the real cost of capital which have effects

on the level of expenditures on items that have a high interest elasticity

of present value. Thus deflation at the beginning of a recession would

deepen the recession by causing a further cutback in investment. This

correlation suggests reducing nominal price rigidity would not diminish the

seriousness of business cycles.

V.      CONCLUSIONS


          This paper began by suggesting that the large change in the

variance of output between the pre— and post—War periods was a fact that

should be explicicable within a satisfactory business cycle theory.

We then argued that a number of factors frequently alleged to have led

to greater stability including structural changes in the economy, dis-

cretionary stabilization policy and the avoidance of financial panics,

probably contributed relatively little to enhanced stability. We conclude

that the two principal factors promoting economic stability have been

greater public and private efforts to smooth consumption and the increasing

rigidity of prices. We attribute the latter development to the increasing

institutionalization of the economy.
