                                               ABSTRACT

This study examines the effect of changes in the vintage distribution of cardiovascular system drugs
on hospitalization and mortality due to cardiovascular disease using longitudinal country-level data.
The vintage of a drug is the first year in which it was marketed anywhere in the world. We use annual
data on the utilization of over 1100 cardiovascular drugs (active ingredients) in 20 OECD countries
during the period 1995-2003.

Countries with larger increases in the share of cardiovascular drug doses that contained post-1990
or post-1995 ingredients had smaller increases in the cardiovascular disease hospital discharge rate,
controlling for the quantity of cardiovascular medications consumed per person, the use of other medical
innovations (CT scanners & MRI units), potential risk factors (average consumption of calories, tobacco,
and alcohol), and demographic variables (population size & age structure, income, and educational
attainment). The estimates also indicate that use of newer cardiovascular drugs has reduced average
length of stay and the age-adjusted cardiovascular mortality rate, but not the number of potential years
of life lost due to cardiovascular disease before age 70 per 100,000 population.

The estimates indicate that if drug vintage had not increased during 1995-2004, hospitalization and
mortality would have been higher in 2004. We estimate that per capita expenditure on cardiovascular
hospital stays would have been 70% ($89) higher in 2004 had drug vintage not increased during 1995-2004.
Per capita expenditure on cardiovascular drugs would have been lower in 2004 had drug vintage not
increased during 1995-2004. But our estimate of the increase in expenditure on cardiovascular hospital
stays is about 3.7 times as large as our estimate of the reduction in per capita expenditure for cardiovascular
drugs that would have occurred ($24).

       New drugs tend to be more expensive than old drugs. Many people might
therefore expect greater use of new drugs to increase total medical expenditure. This is
not necessarily the case, however. If new drugs are more effective than older drugs, use
of newer drugs might reduce other medical (e.g. hospital) expenditure more than it
increases drug expenditure.
       A number of previous studies have investigated the hypothesis that use of newer
drugs has reduced other medical expenditure. Some of these studies have investigated
whether new drugs in general—i.e., drugs in all therapeutic classes and for all diseases—
have reduced other medical expenditure. These studies have used a variety of
methodologies and kinds of data. Lichtenberg (2001) examined condition-by-patient-
level data from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Lichtenberg (2006a)
examined longitudinal state-level data from the period 1997-2003, and Lichtenberg
(2007a) examined longitudinal disease-level data from the period 1990-2003. All three
of these studies, which were based on U.S. data, provided support for the hypothesis that,
overall, using newer drugs has reduced other types of medical expenditure, particularly
hospital expenditure.
       Other studies have examined specific classes of drugs. Miller et al (2005)
investigated whether use of newer cardiovascular drugs reduced other medical
expenditure. They concluded that there was no relationship between use of newer drugs
and non-drug expenditure. However Lichtenberg (2006b) argued that their analysis had
some serious flaws, and that their conclusions should be viewed with considerable
skepticism. In particular, they controlled for factors that should not have been controlled
for, and they controlled poorly for factors that should have been controlled for.
       Weisfeldt and Zieman (2007) surveyed evidence from clinical trials about drug
and device efficacy in the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease and heart
failure during the period 1970-2010. They concluded that pharmaceutical agents played
a major role in prevention of atheroscierosis and its consequences (heart attack, stroke,
and heart failure), and that the marked reduction in cardiovascular disease and its
consequences was largely driven by the development and implementation of drugs for
long-term use and by complicated and costly procedures and operations for acute disease
management. Two other lessons that emerged from their survey of the clinical literature
                                                                                                           4

are worth noting here. First, the introduction of new drugs within a class may improve
the health of the population, even if newer agents do not strictly dominate older agents
(i.e., they are not superior for every patient), because not all members of the population
benefit similarly from the use of specific agents in a particular drug class.1 Second,
evidence from clinical trials showing the efficacy of a drug may first be published many
years after the class was launched. For example, according to Weisfeldt and Zieman,
evidence from clinical trials showing the efficacy of aldosterone antagonists for
preventing and treating coronary heart disease was first published in 1999, 39 years after
the first drug in the class (spironolactone) was approved by the FDA.2
           This study will examine the effect of changes in the vintage distribution of
cardiovascular system drugs on hospitalization and mortality due to cardiovascular
disease using longitudinal country-level data. The vintage of a drug is defined as the year
in which the drug was first sold anywhere in the world. The concept of vintage has
hardly been used in health economics, but it is well established in both theoretical and
empirical analysis in other areas of economics.3
           We will use annual data on the utilization of over 1100 cardiovascular drugs
(active ingredients) in 20 OECD countries during the period 1995-2004. Cardiovascular
drugs comprise the largest therapeutic class of drugs, in terms of expenditure, in 13 key
global markets IMS Health (2006). Heart disease was the most frequent cause of
hospitalization in the U.S. in 1999 (Popovic and Hall (2001)).
           Section I of this paper describes the econometric models that we will estimate.
Data sources and descriptive statistics are discussed in Section II. Empirical results are

 Thus, the introduction of new statins might have benefited patients even though Zhou et al (2006)
concluded from published statin randomized placebo-controlled trials that pravastatin, simvastatin, and
atorvastatin, when used at their standard dosages, showed no statistically significant difference in their
effect on long-term cardiovascular prevention. Moreover Cannon et al (2004) found that patients taking 80
milligrams of atorvastatin (launched in January 1997) were 16% less likely to die, have a heart attack,
undergo bypass or angioplasty surgery, or develop worsening chest pain than those taking 40 milligrams of
pravastatin (launched in October 1989).

    The class includes just one other drug: eplerenone, which was approved by the FDA in 2002.

  See Boucekkine et al (2006) for a brief survey of the theoretical literature on vintage capital. Empirical
studies by Hulten (1992), Bahk and Gort (1993), and Sakellaris and Wilson (2004) have demonstrated that
the vintage of capital equipment has an important effect on productivity in manufacturing.

presented in Section III. Implications of the estimates are considered in Section IV. The
final section presents a summary.


I. Methodology


        We will estimate models of the following form, using longitudinal country-level
data:
        ln Yit = β rx_vintit + γ Zit + αi + δt + εit                   (1)
where
     Yit = a measure of hospital use or mortality due to cardiovascular disease in
          country i (i = 1,…,21) in year t (t = 1995,…,2003)
rx_vintit = a measure of the vintage distribution of cardiovascular system (ATC class C)
          drugs used in country i in year t
     Zit = other potential determinants of hospital use or mortality due to
          cardiovascular disease in country i in year t
      αi = a fixed effect for country i
      δt = a fixed effect for year t

Since the model includes country and year fixed effects, it is a difference-in-differences
model. Negative and significant estimates of β would indicate that, ceteris paribus,
countries with above-average increases in cardiovascular drug vintage had above-average
declines (or below-average increases) in cardiovascular hospital use and mortality.
        This model is static: it is predicated on the assumption that hospital use and
mortality depend on contemporaneous values of drug vintage and other variables. In
reality, health outcomes might depend on lagged as well as contemporaneous values of
the explanatory variables.4 But there are two practical reasons to estimate a static model.
First, the time-series is relatively short, since 1995 is the first year for which the drug data
are available. Including lagged vintage would therefore significantly reduce the number
of sample observations. Second, many of the explanatory variables exhibit high serial
correlation. This makes precise identification of the lag structure challenging, and would
cause multicollinearity if lagged as well as current values of regressors were included.

 Weisfeldt and Zieman (2007) observe that, unlike therapies used in infectious diseases, cardiovascular
agents offer no rapid "cure." Rather, they prevent or reduce the progression of disease when ingested
continuously.

Dependent variables


    We will estimate models of the following measures of hospital use or mortality due to
cardiovascular disease:
    •    The number of hospital discharges5 in which the principal diagnosis was
         cardiovascular disease per 100,000 population (n_discharges)
    •    Average length of stay6 in hospital discharges in which the principal diagnosis
         was cardiovascular disease (alos)
    •    The number of hospital days in which the principal diagnosis was cardiovascular
         disease per 100,000 population (n_days = n_discharges * alos)
    •    The (age-standardized) number of deaths caused by diseases of the circulatory
         system7 per 100,000 population (n_deaths)
    •    Potential years of life lost due to diseases of the circulatory system before age 70
         per 100,000 population8 (pyll)

Measures of the vintage distribution of cardiovascular system drugs

    We will use two different measures of the vintage distribution of cardiovascular
system drugs. Both are based on the following general definition of drug vintage:

    rx_vintit = Σd n_unitsdit f(launch_yeard) / Σd n_unitsdit

where

    n_unitsdit = the number of standard units9 of cardiovascular drug d sold in country i
               in year t

5
  Discharge is the formal release of an in-patient from an acute care institution after a period of
"hospitalization". It includes deaths in hospitals, but excludes same-day separations and transfers to other
care units within the same institution. However, the following countries include at least some same-day
separations: Austria, Czech Republic, France, Hungary, New Zealand and the United States.
6
  Average length of stay (ALOS) is calculated by dividing the number of days stayed (from the date of
admission in an in-patient institution) by the number of discharges (including deaths).
7
  The age-standardized number of deaths is calculated as the population times the age-standardized death
rate. The latter is calculated by the OECD Secretariat, using the total OECD population for 1980 as the
reference population. The age-standardized death rates are necessary for comparing the level of mortality
across countries and over time since they take into account the differences in age structure of the
populations.
8
  Potential years of life lost (PYLL) is a summary measure of premature mortality which provides an
explicit way of weighting deaths occurring at younger ages, which are, a priori, preventable. The
calculation of PYLL involves summing up deaths occurring at each age and multiplying this with the
number of remaining years to live up to a selected age limit. The limit of 70 years has been chosen for the
calculations in OECD Health Data. In order to assure cross- country and trend comparison, the PYLL are
standardized for each country i and each year t.
9
  A standard unit is equivalent to a standard dose of medication (Aldonas (2005)). Standard Units (SU) are
determined by taking the number of counting units (e.g. actual number of ml in a bottle) and dividing it by
                                                                                                               7

launch_yeard = the year of initial world launch of cardiovascular drug d

The two measures are based on two different forms of the function f(launch_yeard):

           f1(launch_yeard) = 1 if launch_yeard > 1995
                            = 0 if launch_yeard < 1995

           f2(launch_yeard) = 1 if launch_yeard > 1990
                            = 0 if launch_yeard < 1990

The two corresponding measures of cardiovascular drug vintage are:

    rx_post1995%it = Σd n_unitsdit f1(launch_yeard) / Σd n_unitsdit
                   = the fraction of standard units whose active ingredients
                   were launched after 1995

    rx_post1990%it = Σd n_unitsdit f2(launch_yeard) / Σd n_unitsdit
                   = the fraction of standard units whose active ingredients
                   were launched after 1990

Other potential determinants of hospital use or mortality due to cardiovascular disease

         In addition to cardiovascular drug vintage, the models of cardiovascular
hospitalization and mortality we estimate will include several other types of explanatory
variables: the quantity of cardiovascular medications consumed per person; indicators of
the use of other medical innovations (CT scanners & MRI units); indicators of potentially
important cardiovascular risk factor (calories consumed per person per day and per capita
expenditure on tobacco and alcohol); and demographic variables (population size & age
structure, income, and educational attainment). In particular, the models will include the
following covariates:

     ln(n_cv_suit) = the log of the number of standard units of cardiovascular drugs
                    per person
      ln(ct_scanit) = the log of the number of computed tomography scanners per
                    million population
          ln(mriit) = the log of the number of magnetic resonance imaging units per
                    million population




the smallest common dose of a product as defined by IMS Health. For example, oral solids have an SU of
one tablet or capsule, whereas for syrup forms it is 5ml and for injectable forms it is one ampoule or vial.

      ln(caloriesit) = the log of the average number of calories consumed per person
                     per day10
      ln(tobaccoit) = the log of per capita expenditure on tobacco (in PPP US dollars)
       ln(alcoholit) = the log of per capita expenditure on alcohol (in PPP US dollars)
           ln(popit) = the log of the population
     age_ge_65%it = the fraction of the population age 65 and over
           ln(gdpit) = the log of per capita GDP
       edu_low%it = the fraction of the population with education at or below the
                     lower secondary level (ISCED11 0/1/2)
       edu_mid%it = the fraction of the population with education at the upper
                     secondary or post-secondary, non-tertiary level (ISCED 3/4)
      edu_max%it = the fraction of the population with education at the tertiary level
                     (ISCED 5A/6)12

Cardiovascular disease prevalence. Ideally, we could control directly for the prevalence
of cardiovascular disease, i.e. the fraction of the population at risk for cardiovascular
hospitalization or death. Unfortunately, reliable data on the prevalence of cardiovascular
disease, by country and year, are not available.13 The cardiovascular drug utilization rate
(n_cv_su) may control, to some extent, for the cardiovascular disease prevalence rate, but
it also reflects intensity of use among people with the disease:
          n_cv_su = su × prev
                   prev  pop

An increase in the cardiovascular disease prevalence rate (prev / pop) would increase
cardiovascular hospitalization and mortality, but an increase in treatment intensity (su /
prev) might be expected to reduce cardiovascular hospitalization and mortality. Hence,
the net effect of an increase in per capita consumption of cardiovascular drugs on
cardiovascular hospitalization and mortality is theoretically ambiguous. As indicated

10
   The main data source is the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Nutrition database
(FAOSTAT). See http://faostat.fao.org/.
11
   ISCED denotes the International Standard Classification of Education from 1997. ISCED 5B (programs
at the tertiary level that focus on practical, technical or occupational skills for direct entry into the labor
market) is the omitted category.
12
   The omitted education category is the fraction of the population with education at the ISCED 5B level.
These programs are typically shorter than those of ISCED 5A and focus on practical, technical or
occupational skills for direct entry into the labor market, although some theoretical foundations may be
covered in the respective programs. They have a minimum duration of two years full-time equivalent at the
tertiary level.
13
   HIV/AIDS and cancer are the only chronic diseases for which there are reasonably reliable longitudinal
estimates of disease prevalence, due to the existence of disease registries. Lichtenberg (2006c, 2007b) uses
these data to investigate the effects of pharmaceutical use and innovation on the survival rates of
HIV/AIDS and cancer patients in the U.S.
                                                                                                          9

above, we also control for per capita income and educational attainment, which may
influence both disease prevalence and the quality of disease management, hence the rate
of cardiovascular hospitalization and mortality.
Cardiovascular risk factors. Instead of, or in addition to, controlling for cardiovascular
disease prevalence, it is desirable to control for cardiovascular disease risk factors.
Advanced age, obesity and smoking are known to be cardiovascular disease risk factors.
Our models of hospital utilization will control for the fraction of the population age 65
and over.14 The OECD Health Data 2006 database contains some information about the
prevalence of obesity and tobacco use. Unfortunately, the data on these indicators are
quite incomplete. For example, data on obesity are available for only 37% (59 out of
159) of the country-year observations in our sample; data on tobacco use were available
for 57% (91 out of 159) of the observations. Including a measure of obesity in the model
would reduce the number of residual degrees of freedom by 83% (from 111 to 19).
Therefore the basic models we estimate will not include measures of obesity. However
we will control for an important (and frequently reported) determinant of obesity: calories
consumed per person per day. We will also control for per capita expenditure (in PPP US
dollars) on tobacco and on alcohol; data on these variables were obtained from the OECD
Annual National Accounts database.
Other medical innovation. Weisfeldt and Zieman (2007) found that the marked reduction
in cardiovascular disease and its consequences was largely driven by complicated and
costly procedures and operations for acute disease management as well as by the
development and implementation of drugs for long-term use. It would therefore be ideal
to control for the rate of adoption of non-pharmaceutical as well as pharmaceutical
medical innovations relevant to cardiovascular disease.
         The OECD Health Data 2006 database contains five indicators of non-
pharmaceutical medical technology. Data on all of these indicators are quite incomplete.
We will control for the use of two medical technologies: CT scanners and MRI units.
These are the two technologies with the least incomplete data, and that are most relevant



14
  Our models of cardiovascular mortality will not control for the fraction of the population age 65 and
over, because the mortality measures are age-adjusted.
                                                                                                         10

to the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease.15 Over 73,000 articles in
MEDLINE refer to both “Cardiovascular Diseases” and either “Tomography, X-Ray
Computed” or “Magnetic Resonance Imaging”.16 However CT scanners and MRI units
are also used to diagnose many other diseases. These measures may not adequately
control for non-pharmaceutical cardiovascular disease innovation.
         If pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical cardiovascular disease innovation are
“complements” (i.e., they are positively correlated across countries), estimates of β could
be biased away from zero. On the other hand, if pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical
innovation are “substitutes” (i.e., they are negatively correlated across countries),
estimates of β could be biased towards zero. It is not possible to determine the sign of
the correlation between pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical cardiovascular disease
innovation across countries, but it is possible to determine the sign of this correlation
across U.S. states. Using data on the two largest public health insurance programs, we
constructed the following indicators of the adoption of pharmaceutical and non-
pharmaceutical (i.e. surgical) cardiovascular disease innovations by state in 2004:

        rx_post1995%s,2004 = the fraction of Medicaid17 cardiovascular drug
                           prescriptions in state s in 2004 whose active
                           ingredients were approved by the FDA after 1995
        rx_post1990%s,2004 = the fraction of Medicaid cardiovascular drug
                           prescriptions in state s in 2004 whose active

      surg_post1995%s,2004 = the fraction of Medicare major cardiovascular
                           surgical procedures18 in state s in 2004 with
                           procedure codes established by the American
                           Medical Association after 1995

   The other three technologies are radiation therapy equipment, lithotriptors, and mammographs.

17
   Medicaid is a health insurance program available only to certain low-income individuals and families
who fit into an eligibility group that is recognized by federal and state law. There were about 82 million
Medicaid cardiovascular drug prescriptions in 2004.
18
   Medicare is a health insurance program for people age 65 or older, people under age 65 with certain
disabilities, and people of all ages with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring
dialysis or a kidney transplant). There were about 4 million Medicare major cardiovascular procedures
performed in 2004. Major cardiovascular surgical procedures are procedures with Berenson-Eggers Type
of Service (BETOS) codes P2A through P2F, i.e CABG, aneurysm repair, thromboendarterectomy,
coronary angioplasty (PTCA), pacemaker insertion, and other major cardiovascular procedures. See

The data used to construct these measures were obtained from a number of sources.19 As
discussed in Lichtenberg (2007b), the surgery innovation measures are probably less
reliable than the drug innovation measures, because FDA approval of a drug is a more
meaningful indicator than AMA establishment of a new surgical procedure code. In
particular, some procedures with “new” procedure codes may be just relabeled or
reclassified old procedures, rather than true innovations.
         The following table shows the correlations across states (N = 50) between the
pharmaceutical and surgical innovation measures, both unweighted and weighted by the
number of prescriptions (n_rx) or the number of major surgical procedures (n_proc):
                                                  unweighted          weight=n_rx         weight=n_proc
 corr(rx_post1990, surg_post1990)                   -0.129              -0.213                -0.180
 p-value                                            0.378                0.142                0.217

 corr(rx_post1995, surg_post1995)                    -0.229               -0.473                -0.257
 p-value                                             0.113                0.001                 0.075

All six correlation coefficients are negative, and one is highly significant. This suggests
that, within the U.S., pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical cardiovascular disease
innovation may be substitutes rather than complements. Therefore, failure to control
adequately for non-pharmaceutical cardiovascular disease innovation is more likely to
bias estimates of β towards zero than away from zero.

II. Data sources and descriptive statistics


          Data on cardiovascular drug use (number of standard units), by pharmaceutical
subclass, active ingredient, country, and year, were provided by IMS Health. There are
over 1100 ingredients in 29 subclasses in ATC C. About 1.5 trillion standard units were
sold in all classes combined in the 21 countries during 1995-2005. Table 1 shows
illustrative data, by ingredient, for one subclass (C10A cholesterol & triglyceride
regulators) in one country (the U.S.) in one year (2005).
          The 'launch date' is the date when a product was first made available to the market
(although there are circumstances when the launch date is considered to be the date when
the first pack was included in the IMS data, or first accrued sales). The world launch date
of some ingredients is unknown. Many of these ingredients are naturally occurring. The
fraction of standard units with missing launch dates declined from 12% in 1995 to 6% in
2005.
          Two features of the data are worth noting. First, a given ingredient may appear in
several subclasses. Second, a given product may contain several ingredients. To avoid
giving too much weight to combination products when calculating mean vintage, we used
a two-step procedure to calculate mean vintage. First, we used the ingredient-level data
to calculate mean vintage in each subclass, country, and year. Then, we used the
subclass-level data to calculate mean vintage in each country and year, weighting by the
number of sub-class SUs (not the sum of the number of ingredient SUs within the sub-
class).
          The mean vintage of cardiovascular drugs varies considerably across countries.
Figure 1 shows post-1995 SUs as a percentage of total SUs in 2004, by country. In the
top 5 countries, at least 13% of SUs were post-1995 SUs. In the bottom 4, only 1% of
SUs were post-1995 SUs. It is not surprising that these are the emerging economies of
Eastern Europe. However there are also sharp differences in cardiovascular drug vintage
between countries that are otherwise similar. Switzerland’s post-1995 share (11%) is
more than twice as high as Austria’s (5%). Australia’s post-1995 share (20%) is four
times as large as New Zealand’s (5%). Table 2 further documents these differences by
                                                                                                         13

showing the top 10 (ranked by number of SUs) cardiovascular drugs in these four
countries in 2005. Descriptive statistics for all variables are shown in Table 3.


III. Empirical results


        Estimates of eq. (1) based on the first measure of cardiovascular drug vintage
(rx_post1995%, the fraction of standard units whose active ingredients were launched
after 1995) are shown in Table 4. Estimates based on the second measure of
cardiovascular drug vintage (rx_post1990%) are shown in Table 5.
        First we will discuss the estimates shown in Table 4. In model 1, the dependent
variable is the log of the number of cardiovascular disease hospital discharges per
100,000 population. The rx_post1995% coefficient is negative and highly significant (p-
value < .0001). This signifies that countries with larger increases in the share of
cardiovascular drug SUs that were post-1995 SUs had smaller increases in the
cardiovascular disease hospital discharge rate, ceteris paribus.
        The coefficient on per capita cardiovascular drug use is not significantly different
from zero. As noted above, the net effect of an increase in per capita consumption of
cardiovascular drugs on cardiovascular hospitalization is theoretically ambiguous.
        Coefficients on four of the covariates are statistically significant (p-value < .05).
The coefficient on age_ge_65% is positive and significant, as one would expect:
cardiovascular hospital utilization increases when the fraction of the population that is
elderly rises. The coefficient on the log of the number of CT scanners per million
population is also positive and significant. This is consistent with the view that some
diagnostic innovations may increase utilization of hospital care.20 Increased consumption
of tobacco is also positively associated with cardiovascular hospital utilization, but
calorie consumption is inversely related to cardiovascular hospital utilization.
        The dependent variable in model 2 is the log of average length of cardiovascular
disease hospital stays. Once again, the rx_post1995% coefficient is negative and
significant (p-value = .03). This implies that using newer drugs has reduced average


20
  The Kaiser Family Foundation (2007), citing Rettig (1994), says that “advances in medical technology
have contributed to rising overall U.S. health care spending.”
                                                                                                         14

length of stay. The coefficient on GDP is also negative and significant: average length of
stay has declined faster in countries with higher growth in per capita GDP. Length of
stay is positively correlated with calorie and alcohol consumption, but negatively
correlated with tobacco consumption. The fact that the coefficient on edu_max% is
positive and significant suggests that ALOS has declined more slowly in countries where
the fraction of the population that is highly educated has increased the most.21 However
the implied effect of education on ALOS is quite small: if the entire population shifted
from the low education to the maximum education category, ALOS would increase by
less than 4%.
        The dependent variable in model 3 is the log of the number of hospital days in
which the principal diagnosis was cardiovascular disease per 100,000 population. The
coefficients in model 3 are equal to the sums of the coefficients in models 1 and 2. Once
again, the rx_post1995% coefficient is negative and highly significant. The only other
variables whose coefficients are significant are ln(ct_scan), age_ge_65%, and
edu_max%.
        The dependent variable in model 4 is the (age-standardized) number of deaths
caused by diseases of the circulatory system per 100,000 population. The drug vintage
coefficient is also negative and highly significant (p-value = .0059) in this model. This
implies that using newer cardiovascular drugs has reduced the age-adjusted
cardiovascular disease mortality rate. The coefficient on per capita drug consumption is
positive and significant. Presumably this is because increased per capita cardiovascular
drug consumption is indicative of increased cardiovascular disease prevalence. The
coefficient on ln(calories) is positive and significant at the 10% level. This may reflect
the effect of obesity on cardiovascular mortality. The education coefficients are
significant, but the implied effect of changes in the educational attainment distribution on
cardiovascular mortality is quite small.
        The dependent variable in model 5 is the log of the number of potential years of
life lost due to cardiovascular disease before age 70 per 100,000 population. This
measure gives a great deal of weight to deaths that occur well before the age of 70, and

21
  Lichtenberg (2007c) finds a positive association across U.S. states between per capita hospital
expenditure growth and growth in educational attainment during the period 1991-2004, controlling for a
number of other factors.
                                                                                             15

no weight to deaths that occur after the age of 70. This is the only model in which the
drug vintage coefficient is not statistically significant.
        To summarize, estimates based on one measure of cardiovascular drug vintage—
the fraction of standard units whose active ingredients were launched after 1995—are
consistent with the hypothesis that use of newer cardiovascular drugs has reduced the
number of cardiovascular hospital discharges, average length of stay, and hospital days.
The estimates also indicate that use of newer cardiovascular drugs has reduced the age-
adjusted cardiovascular mortality rate, but not the number of potential years of life lost
due to cardiovascular disease before age 70 per 100,000 population. Table 5 shows that
similar results are obtained when we use an alternative measure of cardiovascular drug
vintage—the fraction of standard units whose active ingredients were launched after
1990.


IV. Implications of the estimates


        During the period 1995-2004, the mean vintage of cardiovascular drugs increased:
the mean fraction of post-1995 drugs increased from 0.0% to 9.6%, and the mean fraction
of post-1990 drugs increased from 1.4% to 14.7%. The vintage coefficient estimates
presented in Tables 4 and 5 imply that this increase in vintage reduced the cardiovascular
hospitalization rate, length of stay, and age-adjusted mortality. In other words, if drug
vintage had not increased during 1995-2004, the number of hospital discharges, hospital
days, and deaths would have been higher in 2004. The magnitudes of the implied
increases are shown in Table 6. The two vintage measures yield similar estimates of the
increase in the number of discharges in 2004 had there been no increase in vintage after
1995. The mean of these estimates is 51%. The mean estimate of the increase in average
length of stay is 12%, and of the increase in hospital days is 70%.
        We estimate that per capita expenditure for cardiovascular hospital stays would
have been $89 higher in 2004 had drug vintage not increased during 1995-2004. This is
how we derived this estimate. In 2004, mean per capita expenditure on hospital care for
all diagnostic categories in OECD countries was $926. We estimate that cardiovascular
                                                                                            16

hospitalizations account for about 14% of total hospital expenditure.22 Hence mean per
capita expenditure on cardiovascular hospital care in OECD countries was $128 (= 14% *
$926). The vintage coefficient estimates imply that, absent the 1995-2004 increase in
drug vintage, there would have been 70% more cardiovascular hospital days in 2004.
Hence per capita expenditure for cardiovascular hospital stays would have been $89 (=
70% * $128) higher had drug vintage not increased.
           It is reasonable to expect that per capita expenditure on cardiovascular drugs
would have been lower in 2004 had drug vintage not increased during 1995-2004. The
OECD Health Data 2006 database contains some information on sales of pharmaceutical
products by selected Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) groups, based on retail
prices. In particular, it contains information about per capita sales of cardiovascular
system drugs, in U.S. PPP dollars. To assess the effect of cardiovascular drug vintage on
per capita expenditure on cardiovascular drugs, we estimated the following model:


           ln(cardio_rx_expendit) = π rx_vintit + γ ln(n_cv_suit) + αi + δt + εit


Estimates of π based on the two different drug vintage measures are shown in Table 7.
Both estimates are positive and significant, as one would expect: countries with larger
increases in the share of SUs that were for post-1995 or post-1990 drugs had larger
increases in per capita drug expenditure, conditional on growth in the number of SUs per
capita.
           To be conservative, we will use the larger (more negative) estimate of the
reduction in 2004 per capita drug expenditure that would have occurred had drug vintage
not increased after 1995: 25.1%. Mean per capita expenditure on all prescription drugs in
OECD countries was $477 in 2004. Cardiovascular drug expenditure accounted for
about 20% of total drug expenditure, so per capita expenditure on cardiovascular drugs in
OECD countries was $95 (= 20% * $477) in 2004. The more conservative estimate
implies that per capita cardiovascular drug expenditure would have been $24 (= 25.1% *
$95) lower in 2004 had drug vintage not increased after 1995. Our estimate of the
increase in per capita expenditure for cardiovascular hospital stays that would occurred

22
     Cardiovascular hospitalizations account for about 14% of total hospital bed days.
                                                                                            17

had drug vintage not increased ($89) is about 3.7 times as large as our estimate of the
reduction in per capita expenditure for cardiovascular drugs that would have occurred
($24).
V. Summary


         This study has examined the effect of changes in the vintage distribution of
cardiovascular system drugs on hospitalization and mortality due to cardiovascular
disease using longitudinal country-level data on 20 OECD countries during the period
1995-2003.
         Countries with larger increases in the share of cardiovascular drug SUs that were
post-1995 SUs had smaller increases in the cardiovascular disease hospital discharge rate,
controlling for the quantity of cardiovascular medications consumed per person, the use
of other medical innovations (CT scanners & MRI units), consumption of calories,
tobacco, and alcohol, and demographic variables (population size & age structure,
income, and educational attainment). The estimates also indicate that use of newer
cardiovascular drugs has reduced average length of stay and the age-adjusted
cardiovascular mortality rate, but not the number of potential years of life lost due to
cardiovascular disease before age 70 per 100,000 population.
         The estimates indicate that if drug vintage had not increased during 1995-2004,
hospitalization and mortality would have been higher in 2004. We estimate that per
capita expenditure on cardiovascular hospital stays would have been 70% ($89) higher in
2004 had drug vintage not increased during 1995-2004. Per capita expenditure on
cardiovascular drugs would have been lower in 2004 had drug vintage not increased
during 1995-2004. But our estimate of the increase in expenditure on cardiovascular
hospital stays is about 3.7 times as large as our estimate of the reduction in per capita
expenditure for cardiovascular drugs that would have occurred ($24).
         Although our data on hospital use and especially on drug utilization were quite
complete and reliable, data on cardiovascular risk factors were less complete. We can
think of little reason to expect these risk factors to be correlated with drug vintage,
conditional on income, education, and average rate of drug utilization (which we control
                                                                                        18

for). Nevertheless, obtaining better information on these risk factors would certainly be
desirable.
