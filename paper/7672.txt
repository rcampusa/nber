The Timing of Purchases and Aggregate Fluctuations
John V. Leahy and Joseph Zeira
NBER Working Paper No. 7672
April 2000
JEL No. E21, E32

                                          ABSTRACT


       This paper analyzes how the decision of when to buy a durable good affects both non-durable
consumption and business cycle dynamics. At the individual level, we show that the timing of
durable goods purchases plays an important role in smoothing consumption over time. In the
benchmark case, the time at which the agent purchases the durable good is the only variable that
reacts to changes in wealth, while other variables, such as the consumption of non-durables or the
amount of the durable that the individual purchases, remain unchanged. At the aggregate level, we
show that timing decisions can serve as a mechanism for the amplification and propagation of
aggregate shocks. A decline in wealth causes individuals to delay their durable goods purchases
which reduces demand dramatically for some time.
