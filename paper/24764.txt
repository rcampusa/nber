The Ethnic Segregation of Immigrants in the United States from 1850 to 1940

                                         ABSTRACT

We provide the first estimates of ethnic segregation between 1850 and 1940 that cover the entire
United States and are consistent across time and space. To do so, we adapt the Logan-Parman
method to immigrants by measuring segregation based on the nativity of the next-door neighbor.
In addition to providing a consistent measure of segregation, we also document new patterns such
as the high levels of segregation in rural areas, in small factory towns and for non-European
sources. Early 20th century immigrants spatially assimilated at a slow rate, leaving immigrants’
lived experience distinct from natives for decades after arrival.

         It is well known that immigrants are not randomly distributed across a country; rather,

they tend to cluster near each other and end up segregated from the native born. This pattern

has led to an extensive literature exploring the causes of ethnic segregation and consequences

for employment, intermarriage and second-language acquisition. 1 Much of this evidence comes

from American history, when the United States received immigrants from a wide variety of

sources in the 19th and early 20th centuries (e.g., Lieberson, 1963; Lieberson, 1980; Cutler et

al., 2008a). Yet despite the importance of ethnic segregation, there are still issues with the first-

order problem of measuring segregation: due to several data limitations, there are still no

consistent and comprehensive time series of ethnic segregation during the Age of Mass

Migration and beyond (1850-1940).

         Most segregation measures are based on how immigrants and natives are allocated

across different sub-city areas, such as across city wards, census tracts or enumeration districts.

Unfortunately, these measures fail to cover key segments of the migrant population outside of

the major urban centers. In particular, rural segregation has been routinely ignored despite rural

areas containing half of the migrant population in the 19th century. Even when measures do

cover urban areas, comparing segregation across cities and census years can be problematic

because the sub-city area is not always consistently sized across time and space. This problem

is especially severe with the city ward, the most-used unit in the pre-1940 segregation literature

(Shertzer et al., 2016). 2 Since much of the literature relies on the city ward, we still do not have


1
  There is a long sociology literature on segregation, primarily associated with Duncan and Lieberson (1959),
Lieberson (1963), and Massey and Denton (1988). Economists have studied the effects of immigrant networks or
ethnic enclaves on various economic outcomes (e.g., Munshi, 2003; Damm, 2009; Edin et al., 2003; Cutler et al.,
2008b). A common finding is that, after taking selection into account, living in an enclave, in terms of a higher
fraction or total number of foreign born in an area, increases immigrant earnings and wages. Beaman (2011)
argues that the effect varies for recent arrivals and longer-established arrivals since recent arrivals are in more
direct competition with new arrivals. However, evidence from the 19th and early 20th century Norwegians suggests
that enclaves worsened economic outcomes (Eriksson 2018).
2
  Moreover, the city ward is often too large to detect segregation at local levels, which has led others to use the
much smaller enumeration districts or census tracts (Cutler et al., 2008a; Hershberg, 1976; Logan and Zhang,
2012). While district-based measures are a vast improvement over those based on the city ward, census tracts are
only available after 1940, and enumeration districts are not available prior to 1880. Therefore, they do not help
provide a consistent measure of segregation between 1850 and 1940.

                                                                                                                 2
high-quality information on how segregation changed for the key periods of immigration, such

as during high inflow years for the Irish following the Great Famine and for Southern and

Eastern Europeans prior to World War I.

         To address these problems, we take a simple approach to build the first panel of ethnic

segregation that both covers the entire United States and is comparable across time and space:

we measure segregation based on whether the next-door neighbor was native born. This next-

door neighbor method was first used by Trevon D. Logan and John M. Parman (2017a), who

applied it to black-white segregation in the 1880 and 1940 full-count Censuses. The key

innovation of the measure is to exploit the fact that historical censuses were taken on a line

such that neighbors are listed immediately next to each other on the enumeration page (Agresti,

1980). The resulting neighbor-based measure is advantageous relative to other measures in that

it is straightforward and intuitive, is consistent across time and space, covers rural and urban

areas, and is straightforward to implement. Instead of using race as the basis for the in- and

out-group as in Logan and Parman (2017a, 2017b), we use country of birth for the in-group

and the native-born for the out-group, and then apply this measure to each full-count census

between 1850 and 1940. 3

         The neighbor-based measure reveals several new insights on ethnic segregation

throughout American history. First, the most highly segregated areas in the United States were

not the main entry ports of New York, Boston and Philadelphia; rather, they were smaller

factory towns and rural areas that were heavily reliant on migrant labor. Some of the highest

levels of segregation were for Irish in Lowell, Massachusetts, and Austro-Hungarians in

Passaic, New Jersey. Farming communities in the 19th century were also highly segregated,

especially for Scandinavians – they even nearly reached the urban segregation levels for




3
  We also calculate segregation from those born in a different country (rather than segregation from those born
in the United States), and find similar qualitative results. See Appendix D.

                                                                                                                  3
Italians and Russians in the early 20th century. The high levels of rural segregation suggest that

segregation was not purely an urban phenomenon that reflected industrial composition, anti-

immigrant residential policies or city structure; rather, segregation emerged since enclaves

provided economic and social benefits for new arrivals.

       Since the neighbor-based measure is consistent across time and space, it allows us to

compare segregation across well-known enclaves in American history. For example, the Irish

in 1850 Boston were slightly more segregated than Italians in 1910 New York. However, both

Irish and Italians were less segregated than Russian and Polish immigrants in 1900 Chicago.

While the segregation of Europeans has long been of interest, another contribution of the

measure is that it covers immigrants from non-European sources, such as those arriving from

Mexico and China. The Chinese were among the most highly segregated ethnicities in the 19th

century; in fact, Chinese segregation in 1880 San Francisco is the highest segregation level for

the entire 1850 to 1940 period. Mexican segregation was also high but was more similar to that

of Southern Europeans; therefore, Mexicans were not uniquely segregated despite the

substantial discrimination that faced Mexicans in the early 20th century.

       While the neighbor-based measure provides a more comprehensive and consistent

depiction of segregation than previous work, it does not overturn conclusions from prior studies

on major cities; in fact, it confirms a few speculations already in the literature. First, we show

that, on average, pre-1870 segregation levels for Western Europeans were high, but they were

nowhere near that of Southern and Eastern Europeans in the early 20th century (with the

exception of the Irish in mid-19th century Boston). Second, we confirm that Southern and

Eastern European segregation steadily decreased between 1910 and 1940, a pattern long

expected but never conclusively shown due to the switch from ward-based to tract-based

measures in 1940 (Cutler et al., 2008a; Lieberson, 1963). However, the fall in segregation is

less steep when one measures segregation from third-generation natives. The downward trend


                                                                                                4
in ethnic segregation in the early 20th century contrasts with an upward trend in black-white

segregation shown by Logan and Parman (2017a, 2017b), a pattern also recognized previously

– but here we show it applies to both rural and urban areas across the entire country (Lieberson,

1963; Lieberson, 1980; Cutler et al., 1999; Cutler et al., 2008a).

         While the fall in ethnic segregation after 1910 suggests that immigrants spatially

assimilated rapidly by quickly moving out of immigrant neighborhoods after arrival, this was

not the case. Using linked census data from the 1910-1930 censuses, we show that only 40

percent of 1905-1909 European households had a native-born neighbor at arrival. 4 This is in

comparison with 90 percent of native-born households with a native-born neighbor. After a

decade of duration in the United States, this gap between the native- and foreign-born closed

slightly from 50 to 41 percentage points, reflecting that immigrants did spatially assimilate, but

at a slow rate. A slow rate of spatial assimilation is consistent with a lack of convergence in

occupational distributions for many source countries between 1900 and 1920 (Abramitzky,

Boustan and Eriksson, 2014); yet it contrasts with the quick rate of social assimilation after

arrival in terms of English acquisition, immigrants adopting Anglicized names and immigrants

naming their children with Anglicized names (Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson, 2016;

Biavaschi et al., 2017; Ward, 2018). Therefore, despite the social assimilation of immigrants,

immigrants’ average lived experience was quite distinct from that of the native born.

    I.      Overview of literature on historical segregation measures

         One of the earliest studies to quantify ethnic segregation also demonstrates a key

limitation of the literature. Stanley Lieberson (1963) measured ethnic segregation in ten major

cities and showed that segregation fell between 1910 and 1920, and also between 1930 and

1950. However, the problem is that one cannot directly compare the 1910-1920 and 1930-1950

 The linked census data is from Ward (2018), who applied the Feigenbaum (2016) linking method to immigrants
between 1910 and 1930.

                                                                                                         5
periods because segregation is calculated with city wards in the earlier period and with census

tracts in the later period. 5 Besides the fact that city wards may be gerrymandered to reflect

ethnic neighborhoods, they can also be over 10 times larger than census tracts and therefore

hide segregation; indeed, tract-level racial segregation measures yield dissimilarity scores

about 15 points higher than ward-level measures (Cutler et al., 1999). Unfortunately, census

tracts did not become available for the entire United States until 1940; before this, they were

only available in a select group of cities as in the Lieberson (1963) study. Because of this switch

from city wards to census tracts, David Cutler, Edward Glaeser and Jacob Vigdor (2008a), who

provide a long-run series of ethnic segregation between 1910 and 2000, show no absolute fall

in dissimilarity between 1910 and 1940. This may lead a naïve reader to conclude the

dissimilarity-based segregation did not fall in the early 20th century. 6 Cutler et al. and Lieberson

are careful to note this measurement issue with city wards and census tracts in text, but the true

drop in ethnic segregation in the early 20th century has not been conclusively established.

         The problem of using city wards to measure segregation is well known; therefore, many

have resorted to census manuscripts to calculate segregation at finer levels of geography.

However, this method is quite costly and therefore has been employed by only a few

researchers (e.g. Thernstrom, 1973; Kantrowitz, 1979; Zunz, 1982). 7 The most comprehensive

study using this method was the Philadelphia Social History Project, which plotted the

addresses of over 2.5 million Philadelphians between 1850 and 1880 (Hershberg, 1976). 8 After


5
  Census tracts are not available for all cities until the 1940 census. Lieberson (1963) is not the first to calculate
dissimilarity measures, but is the first to do it for several different cities. Duncan and Lieberson (1959) calculate
measures for Chicago across time.
6
  Cutler et al. (2008) show a fall in isolation-based segregation between 1910 and 1940. See Massey and Denton
(1988) for a discussion of different segregation measures, including the isolation and dissimilarity index.
7
  White et al. (1994) use the 1 in 250 sample from the 1910 Census to explore whether sampled households on
either side of the immigrant were foreign or native born, under the assumption that individuals 250 people apart
was a good proxy for a neighbor. Our study improves on White et al. (1994) by filling in this 250-person gap with
the full-count data; furthermore, we use full-count data from multiple censuses to estimate the trend in segregation
over time, as opposed to White et al.’s (1994) snapshot of 1910.
8
  More recently, the work of John Logan and various co-authors have continued this detailed work of mapping
addresses, but so far this primarily involves the 1880 census (e.g., Logan and Shin, 2016; Logan and Martinez,
2018; Spielman and Logan, 2013).

                                                                                                                    6
projecting 1930 census tract boundaries onto mid-19th century maps, Hershberg et al. (1981)

document that dissimilarity levels were low for Irish and German migrants in 1850 at about

0.30, but then then increased slightly to 0.35 in 1880. A small increase in dissimilarity-based

segregation may be surprising given the large inflows of Irish and Germans after 1850;

unfortunately, evidence on segregation for the years between 1850 and 1880 outside of

Philadelphia is scarce.

       This detailed evidence from Philadelphia has led to a consensus that segregation levels

were lower in the earlier stages of the Age of Mass Migration and were higher for Southern

and Eastern European sources – yet Philadelphia may not be representative of the entire

country. Recent efforts to digitize entire censuses allow researchers to look beyond

Philadelphia; for example, John Logan and Weiwei Zhang (2012) use the full-count 1880

census to estimate segregation measures for 67 cities across the country. They calculate

segregation measures using enumeration districts, which are about the size of a census tract –

a vast improvement over the city ward due to the enumeration district’s size and comparability

with tract-based measures. After exploring cities outside of Philadelphia, they confirm that

segregation levels were relatively low for “old” sources in 1880 compared with “new” sources

in the early 20th century. However, Logan and Zhang also show that the variation in

dissimilarity measures across cities was wide, which suggests that the city by city studies prior

to 1880 may not be informative of the national average. While using enumeration districts to

measure dissimilarity is promising, unfortunately enumeration districts do not exist prior to

1880, so one cannot use them to extend segregation measures back to 1850.

       Even though measurement of segregation improves when researchers exploit census

manuscripts, the literature has ignored segregation outside of larger cities. The literature’s

focus on cities partially reflects that most immigrants settled there in the 20th century, and also

that it is difficult to calculate a dissimilarity index in an area without city wards. However,


                                                                                                 7
about half of immigrants lived in rural areas in the 19th century, leaving a large gap in the

literature. Rural settlement was especially common for Northern and Western Europeans in the

Midwest, where many small towns today are still connected with the ethnic identity formed in

the past – such as for the Dutch in Holland, Michigan, and the Swiss in Berne, Indiana.

Immigrants who lived in less populated areas did not just work in agriculture, but also in mining

and manufacturing; these industries relied on cheap labor from abroad in both the 19th and 20th

centuries. Yet we still do not know the extent of segregation outside the major cities.

          Our paper continues the trend of using newly digitized census files to measure ethnic

segregation. Since we observe everyone who is enumerated, we can exploit the census

manuscripts to fix the major measurement issues in the literature. First, we cover more areas,

including rural communities and smaller towns. Second, we measure segregation for decades

and cities previously unquantified, particularly during the first major wave of immigration

between 1850 and 1880 in cities outside of Philadelphia. Third, we provide measures that are

comparable across time and space, and do not depend on inconsistently sized city wards.

Finally, we measure segregation for non-European sources from Mexico and China, which has

been overlooked in the literature. All of this can be done due to the digitization of full-count

census files between 1850 and 1940.

    II.       Applying the Logan-Parman method to immigrants between 1850 and 1940

          We use full-count Census data between 1850 and 1940 to measure ethnic segregation.

This data is available from IPUMS at the University of Minnesota Population Center (Ruggles

et al., 2017) and was accessed at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). 9 We

measure segregation based on the country of birth of the next-door neighbor’s household head,

which we can observe because, starting with the 1850 Census, the census was taken “on a line”



9
 Currently, the University of Minnesota has cleaned and released versions of the 1850 and 1880 Censuses and
preliminary versions of the 1900 to 1940 United States Censuses. We clean the 1860 and 1870 Censuses as
described in Appendix A.

                                                                                                         8
such that households listed next to each other on a census page are reasonable proxies for next-

door neighbors (Logan and Parman, 2017a). Censuses prior to 1850, while also available from

IPUMS, do not record country of birth; moreover, they were not enumerated on a line (Agresti,

1980). We do not use the 1890 Census because most of the original manuscripts were lost in a

fire. 10

           We measure segregation of the foreign-born following Logan and Parman’s (2017a)

method for black-white segregation with a few simple modifications: primarily, instead of

using race for the in- and out-group, we use a specific country of birth for the in-group (which

we refer to as ethnicity) and the native born for the out-group. 11 There are several other ways

one could create in-groups and out-groups. For example, between 1880 and 1930 we have

further information on mother and father’s country of birth, so for these censuses we can

alternatively define the out-group as US-born to two US-born parents. We could also define

the out-group as all others from a different country of birth, not just the native born. We do this

in Appendix D, which shows similar qualitative results for most countries as our preferred out-

group of the native born. We focus on using the native born as the out-group to be consistent

with the ethnic segregation literature (e.g., Lieberson, 1963). The literature focuses on

segregation from the native born since this is related to other types of social and economic

assimilation, such as moving out of enclaves to take advantage of better economic opportunities

or public amenities, or linguistic assimilation through contact with natives. Here we will briefly




10
   One should keep in mind that a fundamental limitation of the data is that we cannot estimate segregation for
those not enumerated. Hacker (2013) estimates that under-enumeration in the census was common, where about
4 to 7 percent of the native-born white population was not counted between 1850 and 1930. Hacker does not
estimate under-enumeration of the foreign-born population since one cannot fully separate undercount estimates
from return migration estimates; however, the standard assumption is that under-enumeration of immigrants is
more severe due to difficulties resulting from language barriers or the more transient nature of the immigrant
population. If those who were not enumerated were more segregated than those enumerated, then we would
underestimate the true level of segregation between 1850 and 1940.
11
   It would be preferable to measure segregation by language group, but this is unavailable across the 1850 to
1940 period.

                                                                                                             9
describe the segregation measure, but those interested in more detailed information should

reference Appendix B.

        To create the neighbor-based segregation measure, we first keep the household head,

dropping those in non-households and other non-heads in the household. In other words, we

measure the segregation of households and not the segregation of individuals. This is a non-

trivial restriction since immigrants were also non-family members such as boarders or servants,

and also lived in non-household institutions such as employee camps. For example, about 90

percent of the migrant population lived in households between 1850 and 1940, leaving 10

percent in non-households. 12 Of those in households, about 10 percent were non-relatives of

the head. 13 Moreover, by keeping the household head, we do not account for the birth place of

the spouse. We will explore the robustness of the measure to keeping others in the household

and non-households in Appendix C, but we will keep to household heads now so our measures

are comparable to racial segregation measures from Logan and Parman (2017a, 2017b). While

keeping only household heads may be problematic, we find similar segregation estimates when

accounting for others in the household.

        After keeping household heads and defining the nativity of the household based on the

head, we then identify those on the same census page and sort them by line number such that

the households listed next to each other proxy for a next-door neighbor. 14 After this sorting,

we create a variable which indicates whether either of the next-door household heads are native

born, a variable on the extensive margin rather than the intensive margin of how many

neighbors were native born.




12
   This is based on authors’ calculation from IPUMS, with a low of 85.9 percent in 1850 and a high of 94.8
percent in 1940.
13
   This is based on authors’ calculation from IPUMS, with a high of 17.4 percent in 1850 and a low of 5.3

14
   We sort by the y-coordinate position in the raw full-count census files in 1860 and 1870 when line number is
not available.

         Given this information on the next-door neighbors, for each county and country of birth

we know (1) the number of foreign-born households, (2) the number of native-born households,

and (3) the number of foreign-born households with a native-born neighbor. The neighbor-

based measure uses these values in a formula to compare the observed level of segregation to

extremes of random assignment or complete segregation. 15

         To calculate the segregation measure 𝜂𝜂𝑐𝑐 for country of birth c, the number of foreign-

born individuals with at least one native-born neighbor (𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 ) is compared with the

expected number under the conditions of either random household location (𝐸𝐸[𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 ]) or

complete segregation from the native born �𝐸𝐸 �𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 ��. Complete segregation from the

native born suggests that the ethnic neighborhood (enumerated on a line) is surrounded by

foreign-born households from other countries of birth. Therefore, complete segregation would

lead to zero native-born neighbors (𝐸𝐸 �𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑐𝑐 � = 0). 16 See Appendix B for the formula for

�𝐸𝐸�𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 ��. The segregation measure typically ranges from zero to one, where one indicates

perfect segregation and zero indicates random assignment of neighbors and thus complete

integration. While the measure can be calculated for any level of geography, in this paper we

present measures at the county/city-level since we wish to describe the broad trends of

segregation.




15
   This measure can be conceptualized as a measure of evenness across households in a county or city, similar to
the dissimilarity index (Massey and Denton, 1988; Logan and Parman, 2017a). The neighbor-based measure
captures complete segregation and integration well when there are more than ten foreign-born households, but
can be noisy with less than ten households (Logan and Parman, 2017a). For this paper we will primarily focus on
the national trends in segregation and the level of segregation in cities and rural counties with more than 1,000
ethnic households rather than segregation for very small immigrant communities.
16
   This is not true for counties or cities where the foreign born come entirely from one country of birth and no
others; however, this rarely happened. For example, it does not occur in the 1880 full-count census.

                                                                                                                11
          To provide an idea of how the segregation measure works, consider the example of

Italians in 1910 Manhattan. According to our data, there were 66,428 Italian households,

190,006 native-born households and 576,557 total households in 1910 Manhattan. Under

random assignment, one would expect to observe about 32,422 Italian household heads with at

least one next-door native-born neighbor (see Appendix B for formula). However, we only

observe 9,684 Italians that have at least one native-born neighbor. Under the other extreme of

complete segregation, one would expect zero native-born neighbors since Italians would be

clustered along a line with non-Italian foreign-born households (such as a German or Polish

household) on either side of this counterfactual Italian neighborhood. After plugging these

numbers into Equation (1), our segregation measure for Italians in 1910 Manhattan is 0.701.

          While the segregation measure commonly ranges between zero and one, we document

several important cases when the segregation measure goes below zero. A segregation level

below zero indicates that immigrants lived closer to the native born than they would under

random assignment. This occurs primarily because first-generation immigrants were more

likely to live near second-generation individuals from the same origin rather than first-

generation immigrants from a different origin. Due to this issue, we sometimes measure

negative levels in major cities for long-established sources such as Germans in New York in

1930; however, we never measure a negative level segregation of immigrants from the third

generation (i.e., native born to native-born parents). Unfortunately, we cannot observe the third

generation for all years, but only between 1880 and 1930. Nevertheless, one should interpret a

negative level of segregation as a population living closer to the native born than under random

assignment.

   III.      The Ethnic Segregation of Immigrants between 1850 and 1940

   A. Measures by source country




                                                                                              12
         Figure 1 presents trends in segregation levels from 1850 to 1940 after grouping

countries of birth into either Western, Northern, Eastern or Southern European. 17 The neighbor-

based measure immediately confirms a few inferences in the literature, although here we show

the national trend while the literature has been limited to urban areas. First, the segregation of

Western Europeans during their peak immigration period in the mid-19th century was less than

that of Southern and Eastern Europeans during their peak period in the early 20th century. Early

Western Europeans (i.e., English, Irish and Germans) started in 1850 with a segregation level

of 0.34. On the other hand, Southern and Eastern European segregation levels were about 0.53-

0.56 between 1900 and 1910. Therefore, the different immigrant waves had distinct

experiences in the United States; this may reflect that Southern and Eastern Europeans entered

a more highly urbanized country while earlier arrivals often moved to (less segregated) rural

areas. We will explicitly measure differences in urban and rural segregation later.

         A second lesson from Figure 1 is that segregation trended downward for all sources

after 1910, indicating that immigrants became more integrated with the native-born population

during the early 20th century. This trend has long been suspected but never confirmed due to

the switch from ward-based to tract-based measures in 1940; here, we are able to confirm it

with a consistent measure between 1910 and 1940. Declining segregation after 1910 is almost

certainly because of the significant drop in inflows due to World War I and the immigration

quotas. That is, if new arrivals were the most segregated, then a smaller fraction of new arrivals

in the migrant stock would lead to a lower level of segregation. We will later directly show

with linked data that new arrivals were indeed the most segregated. Yet a compositional shift




17
  Germany is included in Western Europe. We code countries per IPUMS bpl codes: codes starting with 40 are
Northern Europe, 41 or 42 are Western, 43 is Southern, 45 or 46 are Eastern, except for Germany. Note that
Austria is included in Eastern Europe. To create the national trends by group (i.e. Western, Northern, Eastern or
Southern), we first calculate the segregation for each county, city and country of birth. We then aggregate these
scores to the national and group-level after weighting by the number of foreign-born households from that country
of birth.

                                                                                                             13
towards fewer recent arrivals does not explain the downfall after 1910 since segregation also

fell for groups who stayed more than 10 years (see Appendix Figure A1).

          A third insight from Figure 1 is that Northern Europeans, a group often ignored in the

segregation literature due to their rural residence, were highly segregated in the mid-19th

century. We measure their level of segregation at 0.50 in 1850 – slightly higher than Southern

and Eastern European segregation in 1920. High levels of rural segregation imply that ethnic

clustering was not purely an urban phenomenon during the Age of Mass Migration; rather,

immigrants clustered for cultural and financial benefits. After their high levels of segregation

in the mid-19th century, Northern European segregation steadily decreased in the following

decades, most rapidly after 1880. Interestingly, Northern European segregation decreased

when inflows increased in the 19th century, which is the exact opposite relationship for inflows

and segregation for Southern and Eastern Europeans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Therefore, the relationship between inflows and overall segregation levels may not be so clear

cut. 18

          We further split the broad regions of Western, Northern, Eastern or Southern European

into 12 selected countries of birth in Figure 2 (see Table A1 for underlying estimates for all

countries). 19 This figure reveals starker differences across source countries than for the

aggregated regions of Northern, Western, Southern and Eastern Europe. For example, English

immigrants were the least segregated of all sources and remained at a low level of segregation

throughout the entire period. In fact, English immigrants were perfectly integrated with native

born in some decades, perhaps because most native born were descendants of England during


18
   There is a quadratic relationship between fraction of foreign born in a county/city and segregation within our
dataset, as shown in Figure A2, suggesting that higher inflows and thus a larger fraction of immigrants in a
county is associated with more segregation.
19
   We group Austria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia together to form Asutria/Hungary. We also group Russia,
Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania together to form Russia/Poland. It would be better to group people by
mother’s tongue, which separates Jewish immigrants from other sources, but this is not available across all
decades.



                                                                                                             14
the mid-19th century. Standing out on the opposite end of the segregation spectrum was

Norway, which was much more segregated than its Northern European counterparts of

Denmark or Sweden.

       Mexican and Chinese immigrants were highly segregated, but not much more so than

Italians or Russians/Poles during their peak of immigration between 1900 and 1910. The peak

of segregation for Mexicans was at 0.44 in 1920, the first decade immediately following the

Mexican Revolution when hundreds of thousands fled the country for safety; yet many

economic migrants came at the same time and worked in segregated mining towns and farming

areas. Mexican segregation, like European segregation, fell following the 1920s, reflecting the

mass movement back to Mexico due to the Great Depression and deportations. On the other

hand, the peak of Chinese segregation was earlier in 1870 at 0.67 when there were relatively

few Chinese household heads (~11,000). The segregation of Chinese fell in the next few

decades to a low of 0.24 in 1920, lower than the level for Southern and Eastern Europeans.

Therefore, the Chinese were indeed highly segregated, but primarily only in the 19th century.

   B. Restricting the out-group to Third-Generation Native born

       A common problem for ethnic segregation studies is that measured segregation may

decrease as immigrants’ native-born children age and live near the first generation; in this case,

a next-door neighbor may be native born, but also have the same ancestry. This pattern may

explain the strong downward trend in segregation during the 20th century as sources became

more established in the United States. To account for this possibility, we use information on

mother and father’s country of birth when available between 1880 and 1930. Given that we can

identify the third generation – that is, US-born to two US-born parents – we recalculate the

segregation measures as the first generation’s segregation from the third generation.




                                                                                               15
           The results when measuring segregation from the third generation are also plotted in

Figure 2. 20 The figure confirms that immigrants were less likely to live next to the third

generation than to the second generation. For example, German segregation from the second

generation was 0.26 in 1880, but 0.51 from the third generation, nearly twice the magnitude –

and also higher than 1880 Italian segregation from the second generation (0.40). Italy’s

segregation from the second generation was 0.59 in 1910, while segregation from the third

generation was 0.76. Another key point when measuring segregation from the third generation

is that the low levels of segregation observed for Western Europeans between 1920 and 1940

are somewhat misleading: while we observed a segregation level of near zero for Germans and

English in 1930, this masks segregation from the third generation of 0.30 for England and 0.41

for Germany. This suggests that areas that were mixed immigrant-native communities were

often communities of people from the same ancestral background.

           Not only were immigrants more segregated from the third generation than from the

second generation, but also segregation from the third generation trended downward more

slowly over time. For example, Italian segregation from the second generation fell 0.23 points

between 1910 and 1930 (from 0.59 to 0.36), while segregation from the third generation fell

only 0.10 points (from 0.76 to 0.66). It is possible that the fall in ethnic segregation was even

less steep if one could measure segregation from the fourth-plus generation, or those with

American-born parents and four American-born grandparents, but grandparent’s country of

birth is not observed. Yet at the same time measuring segregation from higher-order

generations is not as informative since intermarriage was relatively common and immigrants

socially assimilated relatively quickly in terms speaking English and adopting Americanized

names (Abramitzky et al., 2016; Alba, 1985; Wildsmith et al., 2003).

       C. Comparison to Black-White segregation


20
     See Table A2 for the numbers underlying segregation from the third generation.

                                                                                              16
        Segregation levels for immigrants were high for some ethnicities, but how did these

levels and trends compare to those of black-white segregation? This is a common question in

the literature, dating back to early work from Lieberson (1963, 1980); thus, it is worth quickly

reviewing results from dissimilarity and isolation measures already in the literature. First,

black-white segregation was about equal to Southern and Eastern European ethnic segregation

in 1910 (Cutler et al., 1999; Cutler et al., 2008a). 21 Following 1910, black-white segregation

and ethnic segregation diverged such that black-white segregation increased and Southern and

Eastern European ethnic segregation decreased. However, these comparisons come from select

cities and miss the large set of African Americans and foreign born who lived in rural areas.

Given that we follow Logan and Parman’s (2017a) methodology to measure segregation, it is

straightforward to compare our estimates of ethnic segregation to their estimates of black-white

segregation from 1880 to 1940.

        The neighbor-based measure confirms the prior literature in that ethnic and black-white

segregation levels started out similar in 1910, but then diverged afterwards. Logan and Parman

(2017b) measure black-white segregation at about 0.58 in 1910, which was similar to our

measures of ethnic segregation for Southern Europeans (0.56) and Eastern Europeans (0.54).

However, if one measures ethnic segregation from the third generation instead of from the

second generation, then ethnic segregation for Southern and Eastern Europeans (0.75-0.77)

was much higher than black-white segregation in 1910. Of course, these national levels mask

significant variation by city and source country where black-white segregation was higher than

ethnic segregation, as pointed out by Lieberson (1980).




21
  Cutler et al. (2008, Figure 4) show that ethnic segregation for Greece, Hungary, Italy and Russia was between
0.45 and 0.55 in 1910, while Cutler et al. (1999, Figure 1) show that black-white segregation was about 0.52 in
1910. Also see Cutler et al. (2005) for a direct comparison on black-white and new immigrant isolation indices.
However, note that Lieberson (1963) shows that while black-white segregation was higher than ethnic segregation
on average, this did not hold for every city in the early 1900s.

                                                                                                            17
        From this roughly equal level of ethnic and black-white segregation in 1910, the

neighbor-based measure shows that black-white segregation increased, while ethnic

segregation decreased. In 1940, Logan and Parman (2017b) calculate black-white segregation

at 0.67, which was much higher than Southern and Eastern European segregation from the

second generation at 0.18-0.21. Segregation levels for Asians and Mexicans were also lower

than for African Americans in 1940, showing that African Americans were unique among

racial and ethnic groups for their high levels of segregation in the middle of the 20th century.

     D. Measuring Segregation across Urban and Rural Areas

        In this section, we turn to document something which has been routinely ignored in the

literature: segregation in rural areas. We are primarily interested in how the magnitude of

segregation differed across rural and urban areas. We can further examine the trend in

segregation levels across urban and rural areas, which may indicate whether urban

phenomenon, such as the rise of mass transit or urban factories, led to increased segregation

between 1850 and 1940. If segregation trended similarly in rural and urban areas, then this

suggests that cultural or demographic factors were more influential, such as a preference for

living in an ethnic community.

        Figure 3 plots segregation by rural and urban counties for the same 12 source countries

between 1850 and 1940. 22 The figure demonstrates two key points. First, rural segregation for

Western and Northern Europeans was often higher than urban segregation. This was especially

true between 1850 and 1880 when rural Norwegians, Swedes, and the Dutch were more

segregated than their urban counterparts. The level of segregation in rural areas could be quite

high – Dutch rural segregation in 1850 was higher than Irish urban segregation at the same

time, which may be surprising since this included the infamous Irish slums in Boston and New



22
  See Table A3 for underlying numbers in Figure 3. Following Logan and Parman (2017a), we define counties to
be urban if more than 25 percent of the population lived in an IPUMS-defined urban area, which are cities and
incorporated areas with more than 2,500 residents.

                                                                                                          18
York during the Great Famine (Anbinder, 2001; Handlin, 1959). Moreover, Dutch rural

segregation in the mid-19th century was near that of Southern and Eastern European urban

segregation between 1900 and 1910. Overall, rural America in the 19th century was highly

segregated.

       Based on the national trends by ethnicity in Figure 3, segregation in urban areas mostly

trended with segregation in rural areas. At face value, this suggests that segregation trends

during the Age of Mass Migration reflect factors other than just urban phenomenon. Yet Figure

3 also shows that urban segregation increased more rapidly than rural segregation between

1880 and 1910 for many Southern and Eastern European sources. An increase in urban

segregation for these groups may reflect factors specific to these ethnicities, such as their higher

participation in factory employment or the effects of mass transit allowing immigrants and

natives to sort into different areas. Differential trends in rural and urban areas may also simply

reflect a mechanical relationship where inflows were more likely to locate in urban areas and

a higher proportion of recently arrived immigrants leads to a higher segregation level.

Ultimately more research is needed to explore these trends across rural and urban areas; rather

the primary insight from Figure 3 is that segregation was often higher in rural areas than in

urban areas in the 19th century.

   E. The most segregated areas in America, 1850-1940

       Urban phenomena clearly did play a role in residential patterns since some of the most

highly segregated towns in our dataset were factory towns. Table 1 lists the cities with the

highest segregation levels by year for ethnicities which had over 1,000 household heads in

town – thus, the list includes both major and minor cities. The most highly segregated cities

across the entire 1850 to 1940 period were not the major entry points of New York and Boston,

but rather textiles towns; for example, the Irish in 1850 Lowell and Lawrence, Massachusetts

were highly segregated. One of the most segregated ethnicities and cities in the entire dataset


                                                                                                 19
is Austro-Hungarians in 1900 Passaic, New Jersey (0.908). Other highly segregated

manufacturing towns were Bridgeport, Connecticut, and Buffalo, New York. Yet

manufacturing hubs do not completely dominate the list of most segregated ethnicities and

towns. Chinese immigrants in 1880 San Francisco were also highly segregated—the highest

level of segregation of all cities and years in Table 1 (0.919), perhaps indicating that

discriminatory factors led to significant segregation given the anti-Chinese sentiment that led

to the 1882 Exclusion Act.

        The major entry ports are largely absent from the list of the most segregated cities in

Table 1. This may be surprising since new arrivals were often the most segregated. To uncover

the segregation level of larger cities, which has been the dominant interest of the literature, we

limit the sample to cities with a sizeable ethnic population in Table 2. 23 Based on this list of

large cities, the Irish in Boston were the most highly segregated ethnicity between 1850 and

1880, reflecting those fleeing the Great Famine and its aftermath. Yet even the Irish in mid-

19th century Boston were not as highly segregated as the Irish in the small factory towns outside

of Boston, as we saw from Table 1. For example, the level of segregation for Irish in 1850

Boston was 0.692, while it was 0.801 in Lowell in the same year. At the opposite end, the

English in New York City had a negative level of segregation in 1860, indicating that they were

more likely to live next to a US-born household than next to a foreign-born household from

Germany or Ireland.

        Some of the highest segregation levels in large cities between 1850 and 1940 were for

“new” source immigrants in the early 20th century rather than “old” sources during the 19th

century. This is consistent with evidence from Philadelphia in the 19th and 20th centuries, but

our data broadens the result to other cities (Hershberg et al., 1981). But the high levels of




23
  We keep cities with more than 10,000 immigrant households from an ethnicity, except for 1850, which we limit
to more than 8,000 households. We adopt a lower threshold in 1850 since the migrant stock was smaller.

                                                                                                           20
segregation did not persist long into the 20th century; after the immigration quotas were enacted

in the 1920s, New York City almost entirely fell off the list of most segregated cities. Instead

of the standard Northeastern and Midwestern cities dominating the list, Mexicans in El Paso

topped the list in 1930, reflecting the changing composition of arrivals due to the quotas.

Besides these entry points of New York and El Paso, several large cities in the Midwest were

highly segregated, such as Germans in Cincinnati, Saint Louis and Chicago, and immigrants

from Poland/Russia in 1900 Chicago.

       The most highly segregated urban areas were smaller towns associated with

manufacturing, but how did segregation in these factory towns compare to segregation in rural

areas? Table 3 lists the most segregated rural counties between 1850 and 1940 (here a rural

county has less than 25 percent of the population in an urban area). Classic ethnic rural

communities appear on this list, such as the Dutch in 1860 Ottawa County, Michigan, where

the town of Holland is located. Norwegian farming communities in Minnesota and Wisconsin

also top the list during Norway’s high inflow periods between 1860 and 1880. In fact, the most

highly segregated ethnicity in a rural county was Norwegians in Otter Trail County, Minnesota

at 0.722 – more segregated from native-born households than the 1850 Irish in Boston.

       Not all highly segregated rural counties were associated with farming; in fact, by the

turn of the 20th century, the most segregated rural counties were in areas associated with coal

mining and steel production in Western Pennsylvania. These counties topped the list between

1900 and 1940, including Somerset, Indiana, Fayette and Westmoreland County. Segregation

in these rural counties was so high that it rivalled that of New York and Boston. Besides these

mining areas in the Northeast, mining and agriculture in the American Southwest also led to

high segregation levels for Mexicans in New Mexico and California.

   F. Robustness of segregation trends




                                                                                              21
         In the appendix, we gauge the robustness of these segregation patterns to alternative

measures. One potential issue with the segregation measure is that it is based on household

heads, which therefore misses those in non-households or non-household heads. This is

nontrivial since many immigrants lived as boarders in houses or in mining or railroad camps,

or had native-born spouses. In Appendix C, we present alternate national trends based on the

proportion of adult native-born on a census page, which includes all individuals older than 18,

rather than just household heads. The resulting estimates from this “page-based” measure has

a correlation of 0.941 with the main household-based measure. Therefore, the results from the

page-based method are consistent with most results from the neighbor-based measure; for

example, the relative levels and trends by country of birth are similar, as well as the levels and

trends across rural and urban areas.

         Another approach one could take is to change the out-group from the native born to

those from any other country of birth. Our approach of measuring segregation from the native

born is like that of Lieberson (1963); however, an immigrant population highly segregated from

natives may be more integrated with immigrants from other sources. In Appendix D, we present

results on segregation from any other country of birth, which show mostly the same trends as

our preferred measure; the correlation between segregation from the native-born and

segregation from all other countries is 0.837. However, Eastern European segregation does

depend on the out-group since they were highly segregated from the native-born, but relatively

integrated with immigrants from other countries. It is possible that there were stages of spatial

assimilation for some sources where one first lived near fellow countrymen, then near

immigrants from other sources, and then near the native born. It is also possible that for Eastern

Europeans, segregation by country of birth is a poor measure of ethnic group since they do not

coincide well with linguistic group.

   IV.      The Spatial Assimilation of Immigrants


                                                                                               22
         The national trends from the aggregated neighbor-based segregation measures show

that segregation tended to rise and fall with inflows during the 20th century, especially

following World War I and the immigration quotas. This suggests that immigrants arrived

highly segregated but then eventually moved out of the enclave as they became more socially

assimilated; however, it could also be that those highly segregated returned home and therefore

the overall segregation level fell. In this section, we estimate the rate at which immigrants

moved closer to the native born with individual-level data that follows 1900-1919 arrivals for

up to 20 years after arrival. 24 The individual-level data is advantageous since we can simply

use the indicator variable for whether a next-door household head is native born, rather than

the aggregated measure to the county level; thus we are able to capture spatial assimilation due

to movements within the county – key to the Park-Burgess (1925) model of spatial assimilation

due to movement from the center to the outer rings of the city. We also use the fraction of

adults on the page that are native born, which has the advantage of including both non-

household heads and non-relatives in the segregation measure. 25 Both measures lead to the

same qualitative results.

         The longitudinal data takes the population of 18- to 40-year-old European males in the

1910 and 1920 censuses who arrived in the last ten years, and then tracks them ten years later

to the next census. 26 The final dataset includes 103,392 male immigrants linked from 1910 to


24
   Our approach to estimating spatial assimilation closely mirrors that of Vigdor (2010), who shows with 1900-
1930 census data that the fraction of foreign born in the city ward lowers as immigrants stay more years in the
country. However, this result may be biased if temporary migrants were more likely to live in wards with a high
fraction of foreign born. We improve on this work by using longitudinal data rather than repeated cross sections,
which eliminates the possibility of selective return migration driving an increase in spatial assimilation
(Abramitzky et al., 2014). Further, we can measure spatial integration at a much finer level (at the census page
rather than city ward).
25
   Another reason why we measure spatial assimilation with the native-born composition on the page instead of
our main segregation measure is because our main measure captures segregation from the native-born, which is
not applicable to the native born. In other words, the in-group would be the same as the out-group for the native
born. Without a segregation outcome for the native born, we cannot account for decadal and aging effects as in a
traditional assimilation regression. Nevertheless, we show the raw means of county-level segregation measures
for immigrants in the longitudinal data in Table A4. The initial segregation level drops by about one-third to one-
fourth from decade to decade, which is consistent with the general argument that spatial assimilation was not rapid
in the first two decades of stay.
26
   Those who arrived in the same year as the census are excluded since it does not capture the full cohort.

                                                                                                               23
1920, and 113,799 linked from 1920-1930. The data was created based on machine-learning

techniques from James Feigenbaum (2016) and was first presented in detail in Ward (2018).

Given that linking tends to produce non-random samples, the sample is weighted to be

representative on observables according to the census (Bailey et al., 2017). 27 To estimate the

rate of spatial assimilation, or the rate at which immigrants converged to natives in

neighborhood composition, we pool the immigrant panel with a one percent random samples

of male natives from the 1910 to 1930 censuses and from the same birth cohorts. When

calculating the fraction of native born on the census page for an individual, we leave out that

individual so that we do not mechanically have a gap in the fraction of native born on the page

between immigrants and natives.

         Table 4 splits the 1900-1919 arrivals in the panel data into five-year cohorts, and shows

that recent arrivals arrived highly segregated from the native-born population. For example

with 1905-1909 arrivals, only 34 percent of adults on the same page were native-born.

Alternatively, 41 percent of next-door household heads were native born. After starting at this

low point, immigrants were more likely to live near native-born neighbors by the next decade;

for 1905-1909 arrivals, the fraction of native-born neighbors increased from 34 percent to 45

percent. Importantly, since we have a panel, this increase over time is not driven by the

selective return of those with fewer native-born neighbors. Overall the data suggests that

immigrants spatially integrated with natives after more years of duration, but not by much. In

fact, the increase was far less when measuring segregation from native-born with native-born




27
   After linking, the linked sample is weighted to be representative based on the predicted likelihood of being in
the linked sample, following the methodology of Bailey et al. (2017). It is weighted to be representative with
respect to the ending census since this census contains the same population (i.e., migrants who stayed at least ten
years); if we weighted the linked sample to be representative with respect to the first census, then the sample
would be weighted to reflect observables of temporary migrants and permanent migrants. This weighting
regression is done for each ethnicity and weights by age, region of residence, literacy, marital status, ability to
speak English, year of arrival, and occupational group (farmer, professional, sales, semi-skilled, low-skilled
service, and laborer). The final weights are scaled to match the country of birth distribution in the cross section,
similar to Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson (2014).

                                                                                                                24
parents; instead of going from 34 to 45 percent, the fraction of 3rd-generation natives increased

from 17 to 23 percent.

         Immigrants were more likely to live near native-born individuals in the decades after

arrival, but even after 20 years of stay, they still had quite different neighborhood compositions

than the average native-born male. Since over 90 percent of native-born males had a native-

born neighbor, about double the number for immigrants, the gap between immigrants and

natives in the fraction of native-born in the neighborhood was large. The gap between natives

and immigrants decreased from 50 percentage points to 41 percentage points for the 1905-1909

cohort between the 1910 and 1920 censuses, or by about 20 percent. Of course, part of the

reason why the gap is so large is because immigrants located in different areas of the country

than natives, but a sizable gap remains even within county: while the across county gap in

fraction of native-born on the page was 50 percentage points for the 1905-1909 arrivals, the

within county gap was 36 percentage points. 28

         We can further use the panel data in combination with repeated cross sections to gauge

selection into return migration; since the panel contains only permanent migrants and the cross

sections contain both permanent and temporary migrants, the difference between the panel and

cross sections recovers characteristics of temporary migrants (Abramitzky et al., 2014). 29

Figure 4 plots the assimilation profile for both the panel and for a repeated cross section using

a standard assimilation specification in the literature (Borjas, 1985). 30 The spatial assimilation


28
   See Figure A3 and Table A6.
29
   We append a 1 percent sample of foreign-born male household heads aged 18 to 50 from the 1910-1930
censuses to measure the likelihood that the next-door neighbor is native born. We also append a 1 percent sample
of foreign-born males (not just household heads) aged 18 to 50 for measuring the fraction of the page that is native
born. We only keep immigrants from the same countries of birth as the panel, which primarily drops immigrants
from Asia, Canada, and Mexico.
30
   To estimate the assimilation profile, we run the following regression separately for the panel and the repeated
cross sections:
                                                           𝚤𝚤𝚤𝚤𝚤𝚤 = 𝑓𝑓(𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                                              𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑦𝑦�
where 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the fraction of adults on the census page that are native born for individual i in arrival cohort c in
year t. We also use an indicator variable for whether one of the next-door household heads is native born. The
variable 𝑦𝑦� 𝚤𝚤𝚤𝚤𝚤𝚤 is the predicted likelihood of having a native-born neighbor based on an auxiliary regression of 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐
on age and year fixed effects using a sample of only native-born individuals. When controlling for geography, we

                                                                                                                         25
profile clearly shows the slow convergence in neighborhood composition between immigrants

and natives over the first twenty years of stay. Based on the comparison of the panel and cross

sectional data, return migrants came from more highly segregated neighborhoods since the

cross section estimates a larger gap at arrival than the panel (58.4 percentage points versus 50.1

percentage points). Negative selection into return migration on the native-born composition of

the neighborhood is consistent with evidence that return migrants were negatively selected on

occupational status, English fluency and skill (Abramitzky et al., 2014; Ward, 2017; Ward,

2018). According to Panel B, the magnitude of negative selection into return migration was

roughly constant across the 1900 to 1919 cohorts since the gap between the repeated cross-

sectional estimates and panel estimates is also roughly constant. However, immigrants who

came in the 1910s arrived more integrated with the native born than for those entering in the

1900s, perhaps because there were lower inflows during the 1910s due to travel interruptions

from World War I.

         While immigrants on average arrived highly segregated from natives and did not

converge at a quick rate, this masks heterogeneity by source country in Figure 5. Consistent

with the county-level segregation measure, the individual-level panel data shows that Southern

and Eastern Europeans arrived the most highly segregated, while those from Northern

Europeans and England arrived less segregated. While the size of the initial gaps varied across

source countries, the convergence of gaps was similar across sources such that there was little

to no closure after 16 to 20 years of stay. Overall, the evidence from the panel data confirms

that immigrants’ experience in the United States during the early 20th century was distinct from

that of natives, despite immigrants having a similar level of occupational status and


also include state and county fixed effects. Therefore 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑦𝑦�
                                                                    𝚤𝚤𝚤𝚤𝚤𝚤 is the gap between natives and immigrants in
neighborhood composition, where a negative number indicates that foreigners have fewer native born on the same
page. We model the gap in spatial outcomes as a function of a 4th-order polynomial function of years in the United
States, and cohort of arrival as fixed effects for five-year groups (i.e., 1900-1904; 1905-1909; 1910-1914; 1915-
1919). We plot an estimated profile for the 1900-1904 cohort in Figure 4 Panel A, and the cohort effects in Panel
B.

   V.      Conclusions

        In this paper, we document the ethnic segregation of immigrants between 1850 and

1940 based on the nativity of the next-door neighbor. Our measure adapts the method first

introduced by Logan and Parman (2017a) to immigrants. The neighbor-based segregation

measure reveals several new results, such as the high levels of rural segregation during the 19th

century and for Chinese and Mexican immigrants. It also provides several comparisons that are

consistent over time and space, such as the result that rural Norwegians were more segregated

than the urban Irish in 1850. Further, it shows that the most segregated areas were smaller

factory towns, places that were mostly ignored by the broader literature since there were no

city wards to calculate a traditional dissimilarity or isolation index. While the neighbor-based

measure broadens our knowledge on segregation by covering more areas and time periods, it

does not overturn prior results from from city ward/census tract-based studies, such as the

decrease in segregation during the early 20th century and that “new” sources tended to more

segregated during the early 20th century than “old” sources in the 19th century (Cutler et al.,

2008a; Hershberg et al. 1981; Lieberson, 1963).

        Our primary aim is to present the measure the broad segregation patterns between 1850

and 1940. By limiting ourselves to a birds-eye view of segregation, we do not explore the rich

detail for specific ethnicities, cities, counties or time periods. For instance, there is little

knowledge about the causes and consequences of segregation during the high immigration

period prior to the Civil War, when German and Irish immigrants arrived after fleeing famine

and political violence. More research could be done on the effects of segregation; for example,

one could estimate how social and economic assimilation depended upon on arriving in a

highly segregated neighborhood, or the effect of segregation on subsequent generations’


                                                                                              27
outcomes. 31 These effects could vary by rural and urban communities as well. One could also

relate the measure to the public economics literature, for example by exploring how public

good provision, such as the quality of schools or the implementation of mass transit, was related

to ethnic segregation. Given the extensive detail in the newly digitized census manuscripts,

there is much to explore.




31
  For example, Logan and Parman (and co-authors) use their segregation measure to pursue an extensive research
agenda on black-white segregation, including estimating the association between segregation and lynching (Cook,
Logan and Parman, 2017), home ownership (2017b), mortality (2017c) and present-day intergenerational mobility
(Andrews et al., 2017).

native-born parents, after correcting for age and period fixed effects with natives. The figure is split by ethnicity, which is measured by the mother
tongue variable in the 1920 census.

                                                                                                                                                   37

Appendix A. Further details on cleaning the data

        We use the full-count data between 1850 and 1940 from the University of Minnesota
Population Center. At the time of writing this paper, the 1850, 1880 and 1900-1940 censuses
have been cleaned; the 1900 to 1940 are cleaned on a preliminary basis. 32 Therefore, we need
to clean the 1860 and 1870 Censuses ourselves. The primary variables we are interested in
cleaning are country of birth, county, city and household head. The process of cleaning the
1860 and 1870 datasets are described in further detail below.

    •   County of birth

        To clean the country of birth strings, we rely heavily on the strings already cleaned by
the University of Minnesota Population Center for the 1850, 1880 and 1900 to 1940 full-count
data. We create files that yield the most common country of birth codes (BPL) for each country
of birth string (BPLSTR).

        Armed with these files, we simply merge them to the uncleaned censuses starting with
the nearest year – for example, the 1860 uncleaned census to the cleaned BPLSTR codes from
1850. For BPLSTR that are unmatched, we merge them onto later cleaned census files to update
the BPL codes. For this process, we merge first to the 1880 or 1850, depending on closeness
in time, and then to the 1900 to 1940 Census files. This is because border changes following
World War I cause the pre-World War I censuses to be more reliable for assigning BPL codes.
However, boundary changes do not bias results in text since we group countries by large region
(i.e. Eastern Europe is one group).

        After this initial pass, we have cleaned 99 percent of the country of birth strings.
Following this, we tabulated a list of strings for each census and cleaned those which appeared
more than 100 times. These were more common in the earlier censuses in the mid-19th century
when individuals would sometimes list a town or a state within Germany. For country of birth
strings which appeared less than 100 times, we left their country (bpl code) as missing and
dropped them from the dataset.

    •   Page indicators

        We need to identify all immigrants who live next to each other on the same page. Rather
than identify census page by NARA roll, reel and page, we used the codes for image id in the

32
   There is some evidence that group quarters variables have some inaccuracies in the full-count data, which
may bias the household measure.

                                                                                                               51
uncleaned data to determine whether an individual was on the same page. The image id is a
code that Ancestry.com uses that combines string information from roll and page number, so
it yields the same information but in one succinct variable. There are some instances in the
Censuses where the page information was clearly inaccurate as there were over 50 households
listed on a page. On the extreme end, there were 20,000 households listed on the same page in
the 1860 Census, a problem that could not be fixed by resorting to information about the NARA
roll or page number; however, this is not problematic for our main next-door measure.
Moreover, the 1880 census include both sides of the census sheet to be on the same page,
yielding of an average of about 100 individuals per sheet rather than the 50 in other censuses.
While this does not strongly bias results, it may influence results in our robustness check of a
“page-based” measure in Appendix C. Therefore, we sort by serial number and person number
to ensure that we are capturing households in order and then create “synthetic pages” the start
anew after 50 people.

   •   Relationship to head

       We keep only the head of the household for our main segregation measure, but
information about household head prior to the 1880 census was not explicitly listed in the
Census. However, family numbers are provided within the raw data, which appears to separate
individuals by household and not by nuclear family. Therefore, we keep the first family
member listed in the 1860 and 1870 censuses to proxy for the household head.

   •   Identifying Households and Group Quarters

We do not have institutional or group quarters identifiers for the unclean censuses in 1860 and
1870. IPUMS codes group quarters based on the number of unrelated members in the
household, typically if there are more than ten individuals who are unrelated to the household
head. For 1860 and 1870, lacking relationship string data, we simply keep the first listed
household member and drop households if there are more than twenty individuals in a family
number who have different surnames.

   •   County

       We merge the uncleaned county strings with the ICPSR county codes, which we
referenced from the IPUMS website. https://usa.ipums.org/usa/volii/ICPSR.shtml

   •   City


                                                                                             52
       For city, we merge the uncleaned strings with the IPUMS city codes.
https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/CITY#codes_section. There are a few times where
a city in earlier census years is part of a city in later years; for example, Northern Liberties, PA
was coded as a separate city in 1850, but was later a part of Philadelphia. To consistently code
cities, we include smaller cities as part of the main city; this occurs for Brooklyn as part of
New York City, Georgetown as part of Washington DC, and Kensington, Mayamensing,
Northern Liberties, Southwark and Spring Garden as part of Philadelphia.

   •   Urban

       Urban status is not provided in the uncleaned census files. Following Logan and Parman
(2017a), we define a county as urban as those with greater than 25 percent of the population
living in an urban area, as defined by the IPUMS variable URBAN. We calculate the fraction
of a county in an urban area using the 1850 to 1940 IPUMS samples.

   •   Country groupings

       One issue when presenting results by country of birth is that countries change borders
over time, especially before and after World War I. We make the following groupings

       1. Russia / Poland includes Russia, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania
       2. Austria / Hungary includes Austria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia




                                                                                                 53
Appendix B. Measuring ethnic segregation

       We follow Logan and Parman (2017a) for creating the segregation measure, but we
make a few distinct changes to the formulas. The reason why we change the formula is because
unlike black-white segregation which has two defined groups (black or white), ethnic
segregation has multiple groups (Irish, German, Russian, etc.). Black and white are mutually
exclusive sets where the union (mostly) forms the population prior to 1940; however, the union
of immigrants from a certain country of birth and the native born do not form the entire
population. Yet much of the following discussion closely follows Appendix 1 in Logan and
Parman (2017).

       The formula we use in the main results to calculate segregation measures is as follows:

                                       𝐸𝐸�𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 � − 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐                     (1)
                            𝜂𝜂𝑐𝑐 =
                                     𝐸𝐸�𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 � − 𝐸𝐸(𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 )


where 𝐸𝐸�𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 � is the expected number of immigrants who have a native-born neighbor
under random assignment, 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 is the number of immigrants from country c who are
observed to have a native-born neighbor, and 𝐸𝐸(𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 ) is the expected number of

immigrants who have a native-born neighbor under complete segregation. Remember that only
household heads are included in these numbers. While the expected number of native-born
neighbors seems like a straightforward concept, one must adjust for the fact we observe two
neighboring households for those in the center of the census manuscript, but only one
neighboring household for those at the top or bottom.

       Let us define the following variables:

   •   𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐,𝑁𝑁=2 – number of immigrants from country c with 2 observed neighbors
   •   𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐,𝑁𝑁=1 – number of immigrants from country c with 1 observed neighbor
   •   𝑛𝑛𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 – number of immigrants from all countries
   •   𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 – number of all households in area. Note that 𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 − 𝑛𝑛𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 is the number of native
       born

The expected number of immigrants from a country of birth c with a native-born neighbor
under random assignment is as follows:



                                                                                                      54
𝐸𝐸�𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 � = 𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐,𝑁𝑁=2 ∙ 𝑝𝑝(𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛ℎ𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏|𝑁𝑁 = 2) + 𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐,𝑁𝑁=1 ∙ 𝑝𝑝(𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛ℎ𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏|𝑁𝑁 = 1)                           (B1)

                                           𝑛𝑛𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 − 1 𝑛𝑛𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 − 2                           𝑛𝑛𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 − 1
                 = 𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐,𝑁𝑁=2 �1 − �                    ��            �� + 𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐,𝑁𝑁=1 �1 − �            ��
                                           𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 − 1 𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 − 2                      𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 − 1


       The logic behind the formula is under random assignment and for those with two observed
                                                                                                                                         𝑛𝑛𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 −1
       neighbors, the probability of having a foreign-born neighbor on one side is �                                                                 � and the
                                                                                                                                         𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 −1
                                                                                                           𝑛𝑛𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 −1         𝑛𝑛𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 −2
       probability of having foreign born neighbors on both sides is �                                                  ��               �. Since we are
                                                                                                           𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎   −1 𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 −2

       interested in the case where an immigrant has at least one native-born neighbor, the probability
       of this occurring for an immigrant with two neighbors is simply one minus the probability of
                                                                         𝑛𝑛𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 −1         𝑛𝑛𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 −2
       having two foreign-born neighbors, or �1 − �                                   ��               ��. It is straightforward to modify
                                                                         𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎   −1 𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 −2

       this formula where instead of measuring segregation of the foreign born of country c from
       natives, measuring their segregation from those outside the country of birth. This would change
                                                       𝑛𝑛𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 −1
       the formula to where instead of                               measuring the likelihood a next-door neighbor was
                                                       𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 −1
                           𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 −1
       foreign-born,      𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 −1
                                        would measure the likelihood a next-door neighbor was from the same

       country of birth.

                 Now we turn to calculate the expected number of native-born neighbors under complete
       segregation, or 𝐸𝐸(𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 ). Complete segregation from natives would occur if all immigrants

       from an ethnicity lived together along a line, leaving the two households on the sides of the
       neighborhood being either native-born or from a different country of birth. Complete
       segregation from the native born implies that the two households on either side are from
       different countries of birth; for example, an Irish neighborhood could be surrounded by German
       neighbors on both sides. Therefore, the lower bound for expected number of native-born
       neighbors 𝐸𝐸(𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 ) is equal to zero. Setting the lower bound equal to zero is not accurate

       for the special case when there are only one or no other foreign-born immigrants from another
       country living in the county. This event was uncommon, for example, not occurring in the 1880
       Census. However, if one were to calculate the measure for smaller levels of geography, such
       as the enumeration district, then there may not be immigrants from other sources in the same
       enumeration district; if so, one should resort to the Logan and Parman (2017a) method of
       calculating the lower bound.



                                                                                                                                                           55
        For the section of the paper where the native born are those who are 3rd generation, or
those who are United States born to two United States born parents, we change the numbers
that enter the formula. The number of foreign born remains as the number who are first
generation; however, the number of native born are is simply the number of third generation
natives in the area.




                                                                                            56
Appendix C. An alternative measure of segregation that includes non-household heads

The page-based measure

        The main measure of segregation is based on whether either of the next-door neighbor
household heads are native born. This measure necessarily drops non-household heads, such
as spouses, parents or servants. Moreover, the method drops non-households such as mining
and railroad camps, poor houses and universities. Therefore, the household measure may
provide an incomplete picture of interaction with the native born for the average immigrant.

        We take an alternative approach to measuring segregation that does not require
dropping non-households and non-household heads in the household. The approach is based
on whether the foreign born are located on the same page as the native born, rather than whether
the next-door head was native born. If the foreign born are not evenly spread throughout a
county, then they will not appear on the same pages as the native born. Those on the census
page are in close proximity since the census was taken on a line. The alternative segregation
measure we use is the same basic formula for the main measure of segregation as in Equation
(1):

                                        𝐸𝐸�𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 � − 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐                    (C1)
                             𝛿𝛿𝑐𝑐 =
                                      𝐸𝐸�𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 � − 𝐸𝐸(𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 )


For this measure, now 𝐸𝐸�𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 � is the expected fraction of native-born on the page within
a county or city under random assignment. This is simply the total number of native-born in
the city or county divided by the total number of pages. For this measure, we only include those
aged 18 and older to reduce child-rearing bias. The variable 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 is the observed fraction
of native-born individuals on the page for immigrants from source country c, and 𝐸𝐸(𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 )

is the expected fraction of native-born on the page under complete segregation. Similar in the

main section, we treat 𝐸𝐸 �𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 � = 0 since the foreign-born would be located either entirely

on pages with other foreign born from the same country, or foreign born from a different
country. Each foreign-born individual on a page has the same difference between the expected
number and total number of native on the page; to aggregate the measure to the county level,
we simply weight the measure by the number of foreign-born individuals on the page.

        This “page-based” measure is similar in spirit to the next-door neighbor measure, but it
captures segregation in a slightly different way. Besides the difference between using

                                                                                                    57
individuals instead of households, the page-based measure also measures segregation on the
intensive margin of how many native-born does one live near, rather than just whether the
individual lives near a native-born individual or not. We compare this page-based measure with
the main household-based measure in Table C1, and show that the correlation between the two
measures is 0.941. See Figure C1 for the binscatter relationship between the main household-
based measure and this page-based measure. The difference between the measures could reflect
a difference in measuring segregation, or the fact that we are able to include non-household
heads and non-households in the measure; when calculate the “page-based” measure with only
households, then the correlation with the main neighbor-based measure is 0.953. Therefore, the
measures are closely related but do have slightly different results.

       We present the page-based segregation trends by country of birth in Figure C2, which
plots both trends for segregation from the 2nd-plus generation and segregation from the 3rd-plus
generation. The broad relative levels and trends from the page-based measure are roughly the
same as the neighbor-based measure. First, segregation levels are higher for Southern and
Eastern Europeans at the turn of the 20th century relative to Western and Northern Europeans
in the mid-19th century. Second, segregation trended to decrease past 1910 for all sources, and
increased for Southern and Eastern Europeans between 1880 and 1910. Third, Chinese and
Mexican segregation are relatively high, though the maximum levels are slightly lower than
that of Southern and Eastern Europeans. The segregation trends by rural and urban areas are
shown in Figure C3, which also demonstrate that trends were similar over time across rural and
urban areas (except for Ireland). Moreover, segregation levels for Northern Europeans were
very high in the mid-19th century. However, note that the levels of segregation across the page-
based and neighbor-based measure are different, which is discussed more in the next section.

Appendix D. Measuring Segregation from the Out-group

       Our preferred measure of segregation is based on immigrants’ (from a given country c)
segregation from the native-born; that is, the in-group is based on country of birth, and the out-
group are those born in the United States. Rather than using native-born as the out-group, one
could use individuals from all other countries besides country c as the out-group. The fix for
this in the formulas from Appendix B is simple: instead of counting the number of foreign-
born with a native-born neighbor household head, we count the number of foreign-born with
an out-group neighbor household head.

       There are a few advantages for measuring segregation from other countries of birth
rather than segregation from the native born; primarily, one does not measure negative levels
of segregation for larger populations as we have done with our preferred measure. For example,
we measure a negative level of segregation for Germans in New York City in 1940 because
they were more likely to live next to a native-born household head than under random
assignment. This is because Germans were more likely to next to US-born individuals rather
than other non-German immigrants (e.g., from Southern or Eastern Europe). A negative level
of segregation is not typical among standard segregation measures, such as the dissimilarity or
isolation index. However, we prefer the main measure in text because we believe that living
near the native-born is more relevant for measuring assimilation rather than segregation from
the out-group; however, both measures are clearly informative for understanding immigrants’
lived experience in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

       In Figure D1, we present the segregation trends for our preferred measure and when
measuring segregation from the out-group; this figure mirrors that of Figure 3. There are a few
important differences in the trends and levels between the two measures. First, Eastern
Europeans have a smaller level of segregation from the out-group than they do from the native
born, and therefore were not as highly segregated from other individuals as southern
Europeans. However, part of this may be because an immigrant from a given ethnicity or
language may hail from different countries of birth; for example, Jewish immigrants from
Russia/Poland, Germany, or Austria may live near each other and lower the measured level of
segregation from other countries of birth. However, the level of segregation also falls for
Southern Europeans, indicating that they also were less segregated from all others compared
with segregated from the native born. Given that segregation levels are lower for Southern and
Eastern Europeans when measuring segregation from the out-group, this leaves Chinese


                                                                                               62
immigrants as one of the most segregated sources, especially in the 19th century. Despite the
level of segregation being lower for some sources, trends over time are largely similar.
