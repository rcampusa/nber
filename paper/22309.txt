                                         ABSTRACT

The standard Beckerian analysis of marriage market equilibrium assumes that allocation within
marriage implements agreements made in the marriage market. This paper investigates marriage
market equilibrium when allocation within marriage is determined by bargaining in marriage and
compares that model with the standard model. When bargaining in marriage determines
allocation within marriage, the marriage market is the first stage of a two-stage game. The second
stage, bargaining in marriage, determines allocation within each marriage. This analysis is
consistent with any bargaining model with a unique equilibrium as well as with Becker's "altruist
model," the model that underlies the Rotten Kid Theorem. Marriage-market participants are
assumed to rank prospective spouses on the basis of the allocations they foresee emerging from
bargaining in marriage. The first stage game, the marriage market, determines both who marries
and, among those who marry, who marries whom (assortative marriage). When bargaining in
marriage determines allocation within marriage, the appropriate framework for analyzing
marriage market equilibrium is the Gale-Shapley matching model, not the Koopmans-Beckmann
assignment model. These models have different implications for who marries, for who marries
whom, and for the Pareto efficiency of marriage market equilibrium.

                          Marriage Market Equilibrium

                 Robert A. Pollak, Washington University in St. Louis and NBER



        The standard Beckerian analysis of marriage market equilibrium assumes that allocation

within marriage implements agreements that the prospective spouses made in the marriage market.

That is, prospective spouses make Binding Agreements in the Marriage Market (BAMM) that

determine allocation within marriage. I investigate marriage market equilibrium under the

alternative assumption that Bargaining In Marriage (BIM) determines allocation within marriage.

In addition to the usual focus on who marries whom (i.e., assortative marriage), I emphasize the

implications of BAMM and BIM for who marries and who does not, a salient issue in the light of

concern about the retreat from marriage. I show that BAMM and BIM can have different

implications for who marries and who does not, and, among those who marry, for who marries

whom.

        When allocation within marriage is determined by BIM, the marriage market is the first

stage of a two-stage game that is solved by backwards induction. Bargaining in marriage, the

second stage, determines allocation within each marriage. The marriage market, the first stage,

determines both who marries and who marries whom. Prospective spouses, when they meet in the

marriage market, are assumed to foresee the outcome of BIM. Taking account of the payoffs

associated with these outcomes, each man has a ranking of all women and each woman has a

ranking of all men. Under these assumptions, BIM implies that the appropriate mathematical

framework for analyzing the marriage market is the Gale-Shapley matching model. With additional

assumptions, BAMM implies that the appropriate mathematical framework for analyzing the
marriage market is the Koopmans-Beckmann assignment model.
                                                                    2


          Econometric evidence and casual empiricism support the claim that BIM rather than

BAMM determines allocation within marriage. Traditional "unitary" models treated households as

economic agents that maximized a household utility function subject to a household budget

constraint. Unitary models imply that spouses "pool" their resources. Schultz (1990) and Thomas

(1990) were the first to realize that whether control over resources within marriage affects

allocation within marriage provides a test of the unitary model against bargaining models of

marriage. There is now a wide consensus that control over resources does affect allocation within

marriage -- see, for example, Lundberg, Pollak, and Wales (1997), Duflo (2000, 2003), Attanasio

and Lechene (2002), and Ward-Batts (2008). For surveys, see Lundberg and Pollak (2008), Duflo

(2012) and Doss (2013).

          The analysis of marriage market equilibrium with BIM does not depend on the precise

specification of the second-stage bargaining game but is consistent with all bargaining models that

uniquely determine the payoffs of prospective spouses in every possible marriage. These include

Nash bargaining, generalized Nash bargaining, and a wide range of cooperative and noncooperative

bargaining models. They also includes Becker's altruist model, the model that underlies the Rotten

Kid Theorem, in which one spouse has the power to impose his or her preferred allocation subject

to the other's participation constraint. Becker uses the altruist model to analyze allocation within

marriage as well as allocation between parents and children. The "nightlight" example, introduced

in passing by Becker (1981, 1991 p. 284) and elaborated by Bergstrom (1989) to clarify an

important analytical point about the crucial role of transferable utility in the altruist model, has the

unfortunate effect of trivializing the model's important insight: in societies in which wives have

little or no bargaining power, allocation within marriage will reflect husbands' preferences.1 The

altruism model has historical and, in some societies, contemporary relevance, but it is not a

plausible model for analyzing allocation within marriage in contemporary Europe or North

America. Although the altruist model can be treated as a special case of a bargaining model in

which one spouse has a monopoly on bargaining power, I treat it separately because it represents a

conceptually distinct approach to allocation within marriage.

       Another difference between BAMM and BIM, important for the analysis of the marriage

market as an institution, is that BIM allows Pareto inefficient equilibria while BAMM does not.

With BIM, marriage market equilibria need not be Pareto efficient even if bargaining leads all

couples to Pareto-efficient allocations within marriage, as it must with cooperative bargaining or the

altruist model. The intuition is simple: with BIM or the altruist model, a husband with "too much"

bargaining power can appropriate the lion's share of marital output. Of course this must leave his

wife with at least as much as she would have if she left the marriage, but it can leave her with less

than she would have if she had remained unmarried. Foreseeing this, a prospective wife would

refuse such a marriage.

       In section 1 I discuss marriage market equilibrium with BAMM and in section 2 marriage

market equilibrium with BIM. Section 3 shows that BAMM and BIM can have different

implications for both assortative marriage (i.e., who marries whom) and for who marries and who

does not. Section 4 discusses three cases in which, it has been argued, marriage market equilibrium

under BAMM and BIM coincide -- costless divorce, prenuptial agreements, and premarital

transfers. I argue that none of these justify using BAMM to analyze marriage market equilibrium.

Section 5 pulls together three loose ends: the Pareto efficiency of marriage market equilibrium, the

need to distinguish between BAMM and BIM in search models, and the treatment of cohabitation

as an alternative to marriage and to living alone. Section 6 is a brief conclusion.2

1. Marriage Market Equilibrium with Binding Agreements in the Marriage Market (BAMM)

          The Beckerian analysis of marriage market equilibrium assumes that prospective spouses

can make BAMM and that these agreements are costlessly enforceable. Because these agreements

determine allocation within marriage, they leave no scope for BIM or for Becker's altruist model.

Lam (1988), Choo and Siow (2006), Browning, Chiappori and Weiss (2014), and Siow (2015)

provide important elaborations of the Beckerian model. I focus on Becker's original discussion

because the more recent elaborations are irrelevant to and sometimes distract from the conceptual

issues I raise.

     Marriage market equilibrium has two related aspects: the matching or assignment of women to

men (or, equivalently, of men to women) -- that is, who marries and who marries whom -- and the

"payoffs" received by each marriage market participant. As McElroy (1997) argues, the marriage

market literature has generally emphasized the matching or assignment aspect and has treated the

payoffs primarily as a mechanism for achieving the equilibrium matching. With BAMM, the

payoffs corresponding to marriage market equilibrium must satisfy conditions that relate the payoffs

married individuals receive to the payoffs they would receive as unmarried individuals and to the

payoffs they would be offered by other potential spouses. The comparison with the payoffs they

would receive as unmarried individuals is an individual rationality condition: to enter marriage,

individuals must receive payoffs at least as great as those they would receive as unmarried


2
  Following the mainstream of the marriage market literature, I restrict attention to heterosexual monogamous unions. Gale and
Shapley (1962) distinguish between matching problems with two classes of agents (e.g., men and women; colleges and students;
workers and firms) and those with one class of agents (e.g., the "roommate problem: An even number of boys wish to divide up into
pairs of roommates.") They establish the existence of equilibrium in matching problems with two classes of agents and show that the
conditions that ensure existence with two classes of agents do not ensure existence with one class of agents. Thus, the restriction to
heterosexual unions reflects the mathematical requirements of matching models. Unlike the restriction to heterosexual unions, the
restriction to monogamy is a modeling choice. The analysis of many-to-one matchings is well developed and there is ample precedent
for considering polygamous marriage markets (Becker, 1991, p. 87). Indeed, Becker's Treatise on the Family begins the discussion of
marriage with a chapter on "Polygamy and Monogamy in Marriage Markets," famously arguing that polygamy benefits women.
                                                                5


individuals. An equilibrium assignment satisfies two additional conditions: (1) no one is willing to

offer an unmarried individual enough to induce that individual to marry and (2) no one is willing to

offer a married individual enough to bid that individual away from his or her assigned spouse.

    Bids are binding. In the Treatise Becker writes: “The analysis of equilibrium sorting developed

in this chapter has assumed that all divisions of outputs between mates are feasible” (1991, p. 126).

This sentence should be read as a restatement of the assumption that prospective spouses can make

binding agreements in the marriage market. Becker and Murphy (2000, Chapter 4) provide an

explicit statement of the binding agreement assumption: “...the marriage market allows ...

[unmarried individuals] to bid for different spouses by offering a larger or smaller share of the

output they would produce together” (p. 31).

    Becker's exposition of BAMM relies heavily on three auxiliary assumptions. First, although the

bargaining process is unspecified, prospective spouses are assumed to bargain to Pareto efficient

agreements.3 Cooperative bargaining ensures Pareto efficiency, but efficiency also can emerge from

noncooperative bargaining. Competition in a marriage market in which all prospective spouses

meet one another instantaneously places bounds on the set of payoffs that can emerge from

bargaining and, in the limit, competition may entirely eliminate any role bargaining.

    Second, Becker explicitly assumes that households produce a single output that must be
allocated between the spouses. The single output assumption meshes well with the household

production framework and with the emphasis on supermodularity in the analysis of assorative

marriage. Becker asserts that his analysis does not require "transferable utility" or any other

assumption about preferences.4 Shapley and Shubik (1971) show that the analysis applies not only
with a single output but also with transferable utility; Bergstrom (1997) provides a thorough

3
 Farrell (1987) discusses the assumptions required to ensure that bargaining leads to Pareto efficient agreements.
4
 Becker (1973, p 816) writes: "Moreover, my concentration on the output and distribution of Z [the aggregate commodity] does not
presuppose transferable utilities, the same preference function for different members of the same household, or other special
assumptions about preferences."
                                                   6


discussion of the model and of the interpretation of transferable utility.

    Third, but less important than the other two auxiliary assumptions, Becker assumes "marriage

dominance." Marriage dominance is the assumption that every possible marriage produces a

"surplus" -- more than the sum of the outputs the spouses could produce as unmarried individuals.

Becker provides a succinct statement of the marriage dominance hypothesis: “... the

complementarity between men and women and the differences between their comparative

advantages imply that both men and women are better off married..." (p. 110). I return to marriage

dominance in section 3 when I discuss who marries and who does not.

        The assignment model of Koopmans and Beckmann (1957) is the mathematical foundation

of the Beckerian marriage market analysis with a single output or transferable utility. Koopmans

and Beckmann analyze the problem of a social planner assigning industrial plants to locations so as

to maximize total output. The statement of the problem presupposes that all plants produce the

same product. Becker (1973, 1991) was the first to recognize that, with BAMM and a single output,

the assignment model could be used to analyze marriage market equilibrium. The equilibrium

matching maximizes the sum of outputs over all possible marriages and the Koopmans-Beckmann

assignment model reduces the task of finding the equilibrium matching to a linear programming

problem. That is, the output-maximizing assignment of spouses corresponds to equilibrium in a

competitive market, where the "prices" are "imputations" in the dual of the social planner's

maximization problem. Although the equilibrium matching is essentially unique, the corresponding

payoffs or imputations (i.e., the division of output between spouses) are not. As the number and

density of marriage market participants increases, however, the requirements of equilibrium in the

marriage market place increasingly tight bounds on imputations.

        The following numerical example, borrowed from Becker (1991, p. 111), involves 2 men

and 2 women and illustrates the implications of BAMM with a single output and marriage
                                                                  7


dominance. The matrix showing the output of each of the four possible marriages is reproduced

below:

                               F1                   F2

                    M1         8                    4

                    M2         9                    7



The numbers in the matrix are the excess output over the sum of the outputs prospective spouses

could produce as unmarried individuals.5 Referring to this example, Becker writes: "Although the

maximum output of a marriage is produced by a marriage between M2 and F1, the optimal sorting

is (M1, F1) and (M2, F2)" (1991, p. 111). He continues, "This example illustrates that the marriage

market chooses not the maximum output of any single marriage but the maximum sum of the

outputs over all marriages, just as competitive product markets maximize the sum of the outputs

over all firms” (p. 112).6 As I show in section 3, the conclusion that the equilibrium sorting is (M1,

F1) and (M2, F2) depends crucially on BAMM and need not hold with BIM or with Becker's

altruist model.

          With BAMM the crucial assumption is that bids are not cheap talk. Auxiliary assumptions

substantially simplify the analysis and allow the use of the Koopmans-Beckmann assignment
model, but BAMM requires neither Pareto-efficient bargaining in the marriage market, nor a single

output, nor transferable utility, nor that all marriage market participants meet one another

instantaneously. If we also assume marriage dominance, then the maximum number of

(monogamous) marriages will form. Hence, with this assumption the analysis necessarily focuses

on assortative marriage (i.e., who marries whom) rather than on who marries and who does not. But

5
  Although Becker refers to the elements of the matrix as "outputs," they are outputs only if we assume that all unmarried individuals
produce 0 output.
6
  As this quotation makes clear, Becker is concerned not only with the planner's problem of optimal sorting but also with marriage
market equilibrium.
                                                                 8


the conclusion that the maximum number of marriages will form depends not only on marriage

dominance (“both men and women are better off married”) but also on BAMM. That is, prospective

spouses, when they meet in the marriage market, make binding agreements that specify each

spouse's share of marital output.

2. Marriage Market Equilibrium with Bargaining in Marriage (BIM)

     In their celebrated 1962 paper "College Admission and the Stability of Marriage" Gale and

Shapley proposed and analyzed the first matching model.7 They assumed that each man has a

ranking of all women and each woman a ranking of all men, treating remaining unmarried as an

additional alternative ranked by all men and by all women. These rankings were primitives of the

model.

     I generalize Gale-Shapley by allowing the rankings to depend on the allocations individuals

foresee resulting from BIM or from the altruist model. I assume that prospective spouses

understand that allocation within marriage will be determined by BIM or, alternatively, by the

altruist, and that they foresee the allocations that will emerge. Allocation within each possible

marriage is rigid and inflexible in the sense that marriage market participants can do nothing to alter

it. Hence, associated with each potential marriage partner is an allocation within that marriage.8

     If each man associates an allocation with every possible marriage, he can rank the women in the
marriage market. Similarly, if each woman associates an allocation with every possible marriage,

she can rank the men in the marriage market. In general, these rankings depend on both the

allocations and on the identity of the prospective spouse, but to facilitate comparisons with BAMM,


7
 Roth and Sotomayor (1990) provide the definitive exposition and analysis of matching models.
8
 Prenuptial agreements and premarital transfers affect allocation within marriage and, hence, from the perspective of marriage market
participants, allocation within marriage is not completely rigid and inflexible. If such agreements or transfers were common, were
used primarily to manipulate allocation within marriage, and led to BIM payoffs that mimicked BAMM imputations, then BAMM
equilibrium would hold even though BIM determined allocation within marriage. In section 4 I argue that prenuptial agreements and
premarital transfers are not common and are not used primarily to manipulate allocation within marriage and, hence, that they do not
provide a plausible rationale for using BAMM to analyze marriage equilibrium.
                                                                     9


I assume they depend only on the allocations. Using these rankings, and treating remaining

unmarried as an additional alternative available to both men and women, the Gale-Shapley

matching model applies directly to the analysis of marriage market equilibrium.

          Gale and Shapley proposed an intuitively appealing equilibrium concept for matching

models, a “stable matching,” defined by two properties:

(i)       no married individual prefers being unmarried to his or her current assignment, and

(ii)      no two individuals of opposite sexes prefer being married to each other to their current

          assignments. (This language covers the case in which the current assignment is being

          unmarried as well as the case in which it is being married.)

Because Gale and Shapley treat remaining unmarried as a marriage market assignment, they ensure

that the marriage market participation constraint is satisfied: in a stable matching individuals are

never assigned to marriages they regard as worse than remaining unmarried. Gale and Shapley

showed that a stable matching exists if each individual's ranking is an ordering.9

          Two additional points about marriage market equilibrium with BIM or the altruist model

deserve mention. First, without additional assumptions, stable matchings (i.e., the equilibrium

assignment of women to men) need not be unique. When there are multiple equilibria and

individuals' preferences are strict, the payoffs associated with different stable matchings differ
systematically.10 Second, the Gale-Shapley analysis does not depend on and is not simplified by

assuming a single output or on transferable utility. I retain these assumptions only to facilitate

comparisons between BAMM and BIM or the altruist model.

          The Gale-Shapley model is compatible with all bargaining models that uniquely determine

allocation within marriage. Nash bargaining, the workhorse of the family bargaining literature, is

9
  Stronger results such as the lattice structure of stable matchings depend on assuming that preferences are strict (i.e., ruling out
indifference).
10
   Roth and Sotomayor investigate the systematic differences in payoffs when there are multiple equilibria. Eeckhout (2000)
establishes a sufficient condition for uniqueness.
                                                                  10


the obvious example. Regardless of whether the threat point is external to the marriage (as in

divorce-threat bargaining) or internal to the marriage (as in separate-spheres bargaining), Nash

bargaining uniquely determines allocations in every possible marriage and, hence, allows us to

apply the Gale-Shapley matching model.11 In Nash bargaining, the outside option and bargaining

power are identical; in generalized Nash bargaining, they are distinct.

          Early expositions of the "collective model" interpreted distribution within marriage as

reflecting bargaining power in marriage, but more recent expositions have interpreted distribution

as reflecting conditions in the marriage market. For example Browning, Bourguignon, Chiappori,

and Lechene (1994) motivate the collective model's assumption of Pareto efficiency in marriage by

noting that the marital environment possesses characteristics likely to promote efficient outcomes in

repeated noncooperative games: a long-term relationship, relatively good information, and a stable

bargaining environment.12 Browning, Chiappori, and Weiss (2014) argue that with costless divorce

or the ability to make prenuptial agreements or premarital transfers, the marriage market equilibria

with BAMM and BIM coincide. I discuss these claims in section 4.

          Becker's altruist model, like bargaining models of marriage, leads to the Gale-Shapley

matching model. In the altruist model one spouse -- for definiteness, the husband -- has the power

to impose his preferred allocation, subject to his wife's participation constraint. Pollak (1985)
argues that the altruist model is observationally equivalent to an ultimatum game in which the

husband can confront the wife with a take-it-or-leave-it offer. The husband need not offer his wife

more than her reservation payoff -- her payoff if she were to leave the marriage. If the husband has


11
   In divorce-threat models such as those of Manser and Brown (1980) and McElroy and Horney (1981), bargaining power depends
on the payoffs of the spouses if the marriage were to end. In the separate-spheres model of Lundberg and Pollak (1993), bargaining
power depends on a threat point that is internal to the marriage -- a noncooperative equilibrium that reflects control over resources
and norms regarding gender roles.
12
   Lundberg and Pollak (2003) argue that Pareto efficiency is less plausible in dynamic environments where big up-front decisions
(e.g., about where to live or whether to have another child) affect future bargaining power. And, as McElroy (1997) points out,
because the collective model does not specify an explicit bargaining model, the analysis of bargaining power lies beyond its scope.
                                                                   11


the power to determine allocation within marriage subject to his wife's participation constraint, then

the wife's payoff in marriage depends on this participation constraint, the resource constraint, and

on the weight the husband places on the wife's well-being (i.e., how “altruistic” he is). Because the

altruist model takes an ongoing marriage as its starting point, the relevant participation constraint

depends on the cost of divorce, including the prospects for subsequent reentry into the marriage

market.13 Viewed from the perspective of the marriage market, individual rationality implies that no

one would enter a marriage unless the payoff were greater than the payoff from remaining

unmarried. Viewed from the perspective of an ongoing marriage, individual rationality implies that

no one would remain in a marriage unless the payoff was greater than the payoff from leaving. In

the altruist model, a husband has the power to impose an allocation that is worse for the wife than

remaining unmarried, provided the allocation would leave her better off than divorce.

3. Implications of BAMM and BIM for Marriage Market Equilibrium

          BAMM, BIM, and the altruist model differ in their implications for who marries, for who

marries whom, and for the payoffs to marriage market participants. In section 3A I discuss

assortative marriage (i.e., who marries whom), and in section 3B who marries and who does not.

All three marriage market models -- BAMM, BIM, and the altruist model -- provide internally

consistent accounts of both allocation within marriage and marriage market equilibrium. Hence, the

choice among them must turn on empirical rather than theoretical considerations -- on which

provides the best account of allocation within marriage and marriage market equilibrium in a

particular time and place.



13
  A careful reader will have noticed that there are two participation constraints: the "marriage market participation constraint" (i.e.,
the constraint facing unmarried individuals) and the “ongoing marriage participation constraint" (i.e., the constraint facing those
currently married). With BAMM, allocation within marriage is determined in the marriage market and constrained by the marriage
market participation constraint. With BIM or the altruist model, for those currently married, allocation within marriage is determined
within marriage and constrained by the ongoing marriage participation constraint; for those currently unmarried, both participation
constraints play roles in the decision to enter marriage.

A. Implications for Assortative Marriage

         Without acknowledging that he has done so, Becker reinterprets the Gale-Shapley model by

allowing each man's ranking of women and each woman's ranking of men to depend on the

division of output within marriage.14 Becker's reinterpretation is a significant innovation because

it provides the bridge connecting the Gale-Shapley model and economics.

         Becker then introduces an additional assumption that is a roadblock, vitiating the power

of his innovation. Becker assumes that “all men receive the same fraction of output in all

possible matches” (p. 126). If all men receive the same fraction of output in all possible matches,

then the analysis of allocation within marriage becomes a project for anthropologists or

sociologists, not for economists. Not surprisingly, the Gale-Shapley matching model plays no

further role in the Treatise and Becker bases his analysis of marriage market equilibrium on

BAMM and the Koopmans-Beckmann assignment model.

         Becker contrasts BAMM, with its assumption of “flexible prices” with marriage market

analysis based on the Gale-Shapley matching model which he describes as assuming that the

division of output between spouses is “inflexible” (p. 126) or “rigid” (p. 133). Characterizing Gale-

Shapley, Becker writes: “These [Gale-Shapley] models...assume...that the division of outputs in any

marriage is not determined by the marriage market and is completely rigid” (p. 127). These two

distinct assumptions -- "not determined by the marriage market" and "completely rigid" -- obscure

Becker's innovation: the introduction of outputs and the division of output into the Gale-Shapley

matching model.




14
  In Gale-Shapley these rankings are primitives of the model. Gale and Shapley describe the marriage problem in three concise
sentences: "A certain community consists of n men and n women. Each person ranks those of the opposite sex in accordance with
his or her preferences. We seek a satisfactory way of marrying off all members of the community." The generalization to unequal
numbers of men and women is straightforward.

       A modified version of Becker's numerical example illustrates the difference between

BAMM and BIM. Becker's original matrix showing the output of each of the four possible

marriages is given by

                        F1             F2

               M1       8              4

               M2       9              7

With BAMM, the equilibrium matches are those on the diagonal: (M1,F1) and (M2,F2).

       With BIM, the equilibrium matches depend on allocation within each of the 4 possible

marriages. The entries in the following matrix represent hypothetical allocations within each

marriage corresponding to BIM. (From the standpoint of marriage market equilibrium, the specific

bargaining model that leads to these allocations is irrelevant.) The first number in each parenthesis

is the payoff to the husband (the row player) and the second the payoff to the wife (the column

player). For each marriage, the sum of payoffs is the total shown in Becker's matrix.



                        F1                     F2

               M1       (4.5, 3.5)             (3, 1)

               M2       (5.0, 4.0)             (4, 3)



In this example the equilibrium with BIM corresponds to the off-diagonal matches, (M2,F1) and

(M1,F2). (Because (M2,F1) gives both M2 and F1 higher payoffs than any other marriage, they

marry each other.) That is, in this example BAMM and BIM imply different patterns of assortative

marriage. And, of course, we can reinterpret the payoffs in this example as emerging from the

altruist model and conclude that BAMM and the altruist model can imply different patterns of

assortative marriage.

B. Implications for Who Marries and Who Does Not

          The retreat from marriage of the past half century as well as what historical demographers

call the "European marriage pattern" signal the need to treat nonmarriage as a feature of marriage

market equilibrium. Yet economists studying marriage markets have virtually ignored nonmarriage

and focused almost exclusively on the pattern of assortative marriage (i.e., among those who marry,

who marries whom). After briefly discussing the late 20th century retreat from marriage and the

European marriage pattern, I compare the implications of BAMM with those of BIM and the

altruist model for who marries and who does not. With marriage dominance, there are at least as

many marriages with BAMM as with BIM or the altruist model.Without marriage dominance,

however, there may be more marriages with BIM or the altruist model.

          The retreat from marriage since the 1950s is well documented. The United States and other

developed countries have experienced delayed marriage and rising propensities to divorce.

Comparing US cohorts born in 1950-55 with those born in 1957-64, the fraction ever married by

their mid 40s declined from 89.5 percent to 86.8 percent.15 Increases in the relative wages of

women, improvements in household technology, greater availability of market substitutes for

commodities that were traditionally produced within the household, and increased social and legal

acceptability of cohabitation and nonmarital fertility have reduced the importance of gains to
marriage based on the traditional gendered pattern of specialization and exchange.16 As the

importance of the traditional gains to marriage has decreased, the returns to parental investment in

children's human capital have increased. Lundberg and Pollak (2014, 2015) and Lundberg, Pollak

15
   Aughinbaugh, Robles, and Sun (2013) calculate the figures for the 1957-64 cohort from the National Longitudinal Survey 1979
(NLSY79) for those ever married by age 46. Stevenson and Wolfers (2007) calculate the figures for the 1950-55 cohort from the
Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) for those ever married by age 45. For recent changes in marriage, divorce,
cohabitation, and childbearing in the US, see Bailey, Guldi, and Hershbein (2014), Kennedy and Ruggles (2014), Lundberg and
Pollak (2014, 2015), Lundberg, Pollak and Stearns (2016), and Stevenson and Wolfers (2007); for Europe, see Klüsener, Perelli-
Harris, and Sánchez Gassen (2013), and Perelli-Harris et al., (2010).
16
   In contrast to the usual emphasis on gender specialization and production complementarities as the source of gains to marriage,
Stevenson and Wolfers (2007) emphasize the increasing importance of consumption complementarities ("hedonic marriage").
                                                              15


and Stearns (2016) argue that couples, especially college graduate couples, use marriage as a

commitment device to bind themselves and each other to a strategy of high levels of joint

investment in their children.

         Before the retreat from marriage of the past half century became evident, historical

demographers identified a European marriage pattern characterized by a high proportion of both

men and women who never marry. The demographer John Hajnal (1965), describing Europe for

two centuries prior to 1940, wrote: “The distinctive marks of the 'European' pattern are (1) a high

age at marriage and (2) a high proportion of people who never marry at all” (p. 101). Hajnal

acknowledged that the marriage pattern he identified might more accurately be described as the

“Western European pattern." He wrote: “The European pattern extended all over Europe to the west

of a line running roughly from Leningrad (as it is now called) to Trieste.”17 Lee and Feng (1999)

contrast the Chinese marriage pattern with the European pattern: “While 15 percent of Western

females continue to remain unmarried at age 40, only 1 percent of Chinese females are unmarried at

age 30” (pp. 67-68).18

         Unlike demographers, economists have paid little attention to nonmarriage except when

discussing polygyny or when there are unequal numbers of men and women. Indeed, an auxiliary

assumption often imposed in the standard marriage market model, BAMM, implies that in
equilibrium there cannot be both unmarried men and unmarried women, a property I call "universal

marriage." With BAMM universal marriage follows from "marriage dominance" -- the assumption

that any man and any woman would produce more as a married couple than the sum of the outputs

they would produce as unmarried individuals. We can restate marriage dominance by saying that

every possible marriage produces a "surplus" -- where the surplus is defined as the difference


17
  Wrigley (2014) surveys subsequent research on the European marriage pattern.
18
  Lee and Feng (1999, p 68, Table 2) show the percentage of Chinese women never married by age 30 for various locations from the
17th century to the present. The percentages range from 0 to 4 percent.
                                                                  16


between the output of the marriage and the sum of the outputs the spouses would produce as

unmarried individuals.19

          With BIM, the number of marriages depends on allocation within marriage as well as on the

productivity of marriage compared with the productivity of unmarried individuals. Hence, with

BIM, marriage dominance does not imply universal marriage. Unless the allocation that would

emerge from BIM would make both prospective spouses better off (or at least not worse off) than

they would be if the couple did not marry, they will not marry. Indeed, even with marriage

dominance, BIM is consistent with marriage market equilibria in which no one marries even though

all marriages produce a surplus. (Suppose that in each possible marriage the man prefers an

allocation that would make the woman worse off than nonmarriage, and that husbands have

sufficient bargaining power to impose this allocation. Realizing this, the women refuse to marry so

that in equilibrium no one marries.)

          With marriage dominance and BAMM, the maximum possible number of marriages form;

hence, with marriage dominance, at least as many marriages form with BAMM as with BIM.

Without marriage dominance, however, there may be more marriages with BIM. Consider the

following 2 x 2 example in which one of the four possible marriages -- in this example (M2,F2) --

fails to produce a surplus.

                               F1                   F2

                    M1         20                    5

                    M2          5                   -1

With BAMM, there is only one marriage: (M1, F1). With BIM, marriage market equilibrium

depends on allocations within each possible marriage. Suppose that BIM would lead to the

following allocations:

19
  The notions of marriage dominance and surplus extend readily from the single output case to transferable utility. Later in this
section I reformulate marriage dominance to avoid these restrictions.
                                                                   17


                               F1                             F2

                    M1         (19, 1)                          (3, 2)

                    M2         (2, 3)                         (-.5, -.5)



With these allocations, two marriages will form: (M1, F2) and (M2, F1). Hence, in this example,

BIM leads to more marriages than BAMM.

          Because the altruist model can be interpreted as a polar case of a bargaining model in which

one spouse has all the bargaining power, the argument above shows that the altruist model can also

lead to more marriages than BAMM. That is, with marriage dominance, at least as many marriages

form with BAMM as with the altruist model, but without marriage dominance more marriages may

form with the altruist model than with BAMM.

                                                                 ***

          Nonmarriage has two possible explanations: an empty "bargaining set" and "contracting

problems," that is, the inability of prospective spouses to make binding agreements in the marriage

market.20 With a single output or transferable utility the bargaining set is nonempty if the marriage

generates a surplus -- meaning, in the single output case, that the marriage produces more than the

sum of the outputs the spouses could produce as unmarried individuals. To generalize marriage
dominance beyond the single output or transferable utility cases, imagine a social planner

determines allocation within each marriage, subject to the resource constraints corresponding to the

couple's resources and technology. The generalization of marriage dominance postulates that, for

any man and any woman, there are gains to marriage in the sense that the social planner could find

an allocation that both prospective spouses would prefer to never marrying. This definition of

generalized marriage dominance requires neither a single output, nor transferable utility, nor any

20
   A third possible explanation, search frictions, is ruled out by the assumption that everyone in the marriage market meets everyone
else instantaneously.
                                                   18


other restriction on preferences. Whether the bargaining set is empty is independent of whether

allocation within marriage is determined by BAMM, BIM or the altruist model. With BAMM, and

without the intervention of a social planner, prospective spouses can attain all allocations in the

bargaining set. Hence, with BAMM generalized marriage dominance implies universal marriage.

With BIM or the altruist model, however, at most one of these allocations is attainable, so BIM and

generalized marriage dominance do not imply universal marriage.

        An empty bargaining set for some subset of possible marriages is plausible. Because the

traditional sources of gains from marriage have weakened over the past 60 years, it is more likely

now than in the past that the bargaining set corresponding to the marriage of a randomly chosen

man with a randomly chosen woman will be empty. For example, for many of the severely

disadvantaged unmarried parents described in Edin and Nelson (2013), the bargaining set appears

to be empty.

        With marriage dominance, only contracting problems can explain the presence of both

unmarried men and unmarried women in marriage market equilibrium. BIM and the altruist model

are consistent with contracting problems, while BAMM is not. Under US law, provisions of

contracts specifying allocation within marriage are not legally enforceable. In section 4B I discuss

how the provisions of prenuptial agreements that are legally enforceable influence allocation within

marriage.

        In the absence of legally enforceable agreements, self-enforcing agreements, informal rules

and social norms must play crucial roles. Lundberg and Pollak (2007, p. 16) suggest that the

weakening of traditional gender roles over the past half century has reduced the ability of couples to

make self-enforcing agreements (e.g., regarding sexual fidelity, the sharing of child care

responsibilities) in part because the traditional gender-based division of labor is no longer a self-

enforcing Nash equilibrium. Even if norms are sticky and lag behind changes in the relative earning
                                                                   19


capacities of men and women, in the long run norms may adjust to new economic and social

realities. If they do, then the retreat from marriage may be a disequilibrium phenomenon.21

            The social science literature provides some support for the hypothesis that contracting

problems explain some portion of the retreat from marriage. Furstenberg (2001) points to a

breakdown in the consensus regarding appropriate gender roles as a barrier to marriage, particularly

for African-Americans. Sevilla-Sanz (2005) suggests that peer pressure is likely to provide support

for traditional gender roles. Edin and Kefalas (2005, p. 118) report that poor women fear that

marriage “activates traditional gender roles” and choose to maintain their independence by not

marrying the fathers of their children. Ethnographic research emerging from the Fragile Families

Study finds that unmarried mothers identify "lack of trust" and, in particular, fear of male infidelity,

as a major barrier to marriage (Gibson-Davis, Edin, and McLanahan, 2005). Contracting problems

may also explain the low marriage and fertility rates in Japan and Southern Europe. Sevilla-Sanz

(2010) shows that these are countries with conservative gender norms in which women’s education

levels and wage rates have risen rapidly. Although economists might expect to see departures from

the traditional gendered division of childcare and other household tasks, these countries have

instead experienced sharp declines in marriage and in fertility. These declines may reflect

contracting problems -- the inability of prospective spouses to make binding agreements in the

marriage market. But they may instead reflect an empty bargaining set: departures from traditional

gender roles that would make marriage acceptable to young women might make it unacceptable to

young men.

            The extent to which the retreat from marriage reflects an empty bargaining set rather than

the inability of prospective spouses to make binding agreements in the marriage market is an open

question the answer to which may differ from one country to another and, within countries, from

     Goldscheider, Bernhardt, and Lappegård, (2015) reach a similar conclusion by a different route.
                                                  20


one group to another. Indeed, even for cohabiting couples with joint children, we do not know the

extent to which nonmarriage reflects the reluctance of fathers rather than the reluctance of mothers

to marry.

4. Costless Divorce, Prenuptial Agreements, and Premarital Transfers

       The BIM marriage market equilibrium coincides with the BAMM marriage market

equilibrium for the "right" configuration of bargaining power. Browning, Chiappori and Weiss

(2014, pp. 311-314) argue that prospective spouses can use prenuptial agreements and premarital

transfers to manipulate bargaining power. This possibility, they argue, provides a rationale for using

BAMM to analyze marriage market equilibrium even when BIM determines allocation within

marriage. I disagree. This section is a response to their argument.

       There are several difficulties. The threshold difficulty is that in order for the BIM

equilibrium to mimic the BAMM equilibrium the configuration of bargaining power must lead to a

pattern of payoffs that mimics the BAMM imputations. This does not imply that all couples must

make prenuptial agreements or premarital transfers -- indeed, with no such agreements or transfers,

the BIM payoffs may happen to mimic the BAMM imputations. The amount of manipulation

required to align BIM payoffs with BAMM imputations depends on the "distance" between the

unmanipulated BIM payoffs and the BAMM imputations.

   The ability of prospective spouses to use prenuptial agreements and premarital transfers to

manipulate the BIM payoffs implies that these payoffs are not as "rigid and inflexible" as I have

thus far assumed. Yet it is implausible that prenuptial agreements or premarital transfers will lead to

a pattern of payoffs that mimic BAMM imputations for two reasons. The first is empirical: few

couples make prenuptial agreements and premarital transfers. The second is theoretical: in addition

to making prenuptial agreements or premarital transfers, the terms of the agreements and the

magnitudes of the transfers must be calibrated to achieve the payoffs required to mimic the BAMM
                                                  21


imputations. The conventional wisdom, however, is that couples making such agreements or

transfers typically do so to protect the interests of children from previous relationships or to protect

their own interests in the event of divorce, not to manipulate allocation within marriage. Hence, it is

unlikely, although not impossible, that prenuptial agreements and premarital transfers will lead to

the pattern of payoffs required to mimic the BAMM imputations. This is not to deny the possibility

that premarital agreements or premarital transfers could conceivably manipulate bargaining power

so that BIM payoffs would mimic BAMM imputations. The issue is whether this possibility is great

enough to justify BAMM analysis in a BIM world.

    Browning, Chiappori and Weiss also argue that costless divorce will lead to BIM payoffs that

mimic BAMM imputations. The difficulty here that costless divorce is an oxymoron: costless

divorce negates commitment, and commitment is the essential feature that distinguishes marriage

from cohabitation and cohabitation from casual sex. Furthermore, to replicate the BAMM

equilibrium requires not only costless divorce but also "costless" reentry into the marriage market --

that is, divorced individuals must be able to reenter the marriage market on the same terms as

before they were married.

    I discuss costless divorce in section 4A, prenuptial agreements in section 4B, and premarital

transfers in section 4C.

A. Costless Divorce

    The assumption of "costless divorce," which I interpret broadly to include "costless reentry" into

the marriage market, makes BAMM and BIM equivalent by assuming away commitment. Becker

(1991, p. 30/31) provides a clear statement of the traditional rationale for commitment in marriage

and posits that marriage is defined by long-term commitment: "Since married women have been

specialized to childbearing and other domestic activities, they have demanded long-term 'contracts'

from their husbands to protect them against abandonment and other adversities. Virtually all
                                                 22


societies have developed long-term protection for married women: one can even say that 'marriage'

is defined by a long-term commitment between a man and a woman." Although divorce has

become less costly over the past 60 years, long-term commitment remains an essential feature of

marriage. Marriage functions as a commitment device only because divorce is costly.

       Costless reentry into the marriage market means that prospective spouses do not distinguish

between previously-married and never-married individuals. A more fundamental distinction is

arguably between parents and nonparents and, among parents, between custodial and noncustodial

parents. Reentry into the marriage market is no doubt easier for women without children than for

mothers, especially mothers with custody of minor children. Similarly, reentry is presumably easier

for men, especially men with neither custody of minor children nor child support obligations.

Because mothers are more likely than fathers to be custodial parents, and because children are more

readily observable than child support obligations, reentry into the marriage market is likely to be

more difficult for mothers than for fathers. But the difficulty of reentry presumably also depends on

the fraction of those seeking to (re)enter the marriage/ partner market who also have custody of

children or child support obligations.

   Prior to the mid-19th century, divorce was very rare. For example, Stone (1990) writes: "It must

never be forgotten that England in the early modern period was neither a separating nor a divorcing

society: death was virtually the sole agent for dissolving marriage" (p. 2). Becker cites Rowntree

and Carrier for the fact that "There were fewer than two (!) divorces per year in England from 1800

to 1850..." (1991, p. 374, Becker's exclamation point). The 1857 Divorce Act substantially

liberalized divorce law in England and Wales, yet the number of divorces per year remained under

1000 until the First World War (see Stone (1990, Table 13.1)). The liberalization of divorce law in

England and the United States in the mid 19th century did not permit married couples to dissolve
                                                                  23


their marriages by mutual consent.22

     At least in theory, in every US state prior to 1970 divorce required a finding of fault (e.g.,

adultery; a felony conviction; cruelty). In practice, there were substantial differences among states

and over time in the difficulty of getting a divorce and spouses who wanted to divorce would often

collude to obtain a fault-based divorce. The landscape changed with the "divorce revolution" that

included various combinations of no-fault and unilateral divorce. No-fault divorce first became

available in California in 1970 and most other states followed suit rapidly. New York, the last state

to adopt no-fault divorce, did so in 2010.23

B. Prenuptial Agreements

          Prenuptial agreements cannot specify allocation within marriage or, more precisely, US

courts will not enforce such provisions. Courts will oversee the dissolution of marriages, but they

will not supervise ongoing marriages. The legal scholar Saul Levmore (1995) memorably

characterizes this rule as "love it or leave it."24 The legally enforceable provisions of prenuptial

agreements are those specifying the disposition of assets following the death of a spouse and the

division of income and assets following divorce. Of course, these legally enforceable provisions of

prenuptial agreements do affect allocation within marriage.

          Prenuptial agreements were originally about the disposition of assets following the death of
a spouse and could not be used to contract around state divorce laws. The ability of prospective

spouses to enter into enforceable agreements that constrain the authority of courts to specify the

terms of divorce is less than 50 years old, and such agreements cannot limit the authority of courts

22
   Desertion, however, was an outside option, especially in 19th century America. Hartog (2000) writes, "The United States was an
unimaginably large country, and many could disappear permanently from discarded pasts.... Bigamy or, rather, serial monogamy
(without divorce or death) was a common social experience in early America” (p. 87).
23
   For a discussion of the effect of no-fault and unilateral divorce on divorce rates and references to the extensive literature, see
Stevenson and Wolfers (2007).
24
   Hartog (2000) provides a fascinating account of McGurie v. McGuire, the case usually cited for the proposition that courts will not
intervene in ongoing marriages. Whether such provisions should be enforceable is debated (see, for example, Case (2011) and Pollak
(2011).
                                                                 24


to decide on child custody and child support. The legal scholar Jill Hasday (2014) writes: "Before

the 1970s, courts often refused to enforce agreements that determined in advance how spouses

would divide assets and pay support at divorce. Judicial opinions declared that such agreements

were contrary to public policy and void on the theory that the agreements anticipated and facilitated

divorce" (p. 75; footnotes citing cases omitted).

          In the absence of a prenuptial agreement, state divorce laws specify the default terms for

ending a marriage. Rosenbury (2005) finds that divorce laws differ substantially across states and

that the differences go well beyond the distinction between community property and separate

property states.25 Most separate property states require "equitable distribution" of "marital property"

following divorce, but Rosenbury emphasizes that the definition of marital property differs from

one state to another. Prenuptial agreements allow prospective spouses to contract around the

provisions the divorce laws of their state. In the light of empirical research establishing the

importance of default rules in other contexts, it is no surprise that prospective spouses seldom make

prenuptial agreements.26

          The threshold difficulty with invoking prenuptial agreements to argue that the BAMM

marriage market equilibrium will hold when BIM determines allocation within marriage is

empirical: few prospective spouses make prenuptial agreements. The conventional wisdom is that
in first marriages about 5 percent of couples make prenuptial agreements, and that in second and

higher order marriages this figure rises to about 20 percent. These figures are suspect. Marston

(1997), an article in the Stanford Law Review, is often cited for both figures. She attributes the 5

percent figure to Belsky (1996), an article in Money magazine, which cites no source. She attributes
the 20 percent figure to Sigler (1994), an article in the Connecticut Probate Law Journal that

Wisconsin.

   On default rules, see, for example, Beshears, Choi, Laibson, and Madrian (2009) or, for a popular account, Thaler and Sunstein
(2008).
                                                                 25


attributes the 20 percent figure to Stark (1993), an article in Money magazine, which cites no

source.

          Prenuptial agreements can now specify the disposition of assets following the death of a

spouse and the division of assets and sometimes the division of earnings following divorce.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that prenuptial agreements are used primarily by wealthy prospective

spouses seeking to protect the inheritance interests of their children from previous relationships or

to protect their own interests in the event of divorce. Prenuptial agreements designed primarily for

these purposes also affect allocation within marriage, but we would not expect prenuptial

agreements intended to protect children from previous marriages or to protect prospective spouses

in the event of divorce would also replicate the allocations corresponding to BAMM.

          A theoretical analysis of the effect of prenuptial agreements on allocation within marriage

requires specifying a bargaining model or a class of such models. With divorce-threat bargaining, as

the name suggests, divorce is both the outside option and the threat point. The theoretical difficulty

with divorce-threat bargaining models is the assumption that a spouse whose current allocation is

more favorable than divorce can use the threat of divorce to bargain for even more favorable

allocation. In the language of noncooperative game theory, such a threat lacks credibility.27 Thus,

the claim that prenuptial agreements provide a mechanism that prospective spouses can use to
control allocation within marriage implicitly assume divorce-threat bargaining while failing to

address the credibility of the divorce threat.

          In other bargaining models, such as Generalized Nash bargaining or the separate spheres

bargaining model of Lundberg and Pollak (1993), divorce is not the threat point and prenuptial

agreements operate only through the outside option. In such models, prenuptial agreements affect

allocation within marriage only by restricting the set of bargaining solutions that satisfy individual

27
  Less formally, the legal scholar Robert Ellickson (2006, 2008) argues that what he calls the "end game" is relatively unimportant in
ongoing marriages and other coresidential unions.

rationality.

C. Premarital Transfers

        As with prenuptial agreements, the threshold difficulty with invoking premarital transfers to

argue that BAMM results hold when BIM determines allocation within marriage is empirical. We

can imagine a world in which premarital transfers are common, but there is no evidence that they

are in ours.

        Premarital transfers raise interesting theoretical issues because they operate not only through

the outside option but also through bargaining power. I distinguish between the case in which

prospective spouses have sufficient initial wealth to make the transfers required to replicate the

allocation corresponding to BAMM and the case in which they do not. If prospective spouses have

sufficient initial wealth to make the premarital transfers required to achieve the BAMM allocation,

one prospective spouse simply makes a gift to the other. If the couple subsequently marries, then

one effect of the transfer is to alter the distribution of assets in the event of divorce (i.e., the

premarital transfer changes the outside option). The other effect is to alter bargaining power within

marriage through the effect on control over resources within marriage: during the life of the

marriage, the premarital transfer converts investment income of one spouse into investment income

of the other.

        If a prospective spouse -- for definiteness, the husband -- lacks sufficient initial wealth to

make the required premarital transfers, he can borrow against his future earnings to make the

required transfer, thus converting his future labor income into his wife’s future investment income.

When the borrowing rate exceeds the rate of return at which she can invest, however, borrowing to

make the premarital transfer reduces the couple's income.

        Prospective spouses contemplating premarital transfers might seek to protect themselves

with premarital contracts (e.g., specifying what would happen if the marriage failed to take place or
                                                                    27


lasted only briefly), and such contracts might be similar in complexity to prenuptial agreements.

Premarital transfers also have tax or at least tax reporting consequences.28

5. Three Loose Ends

          In this section I first discuss the Pareto efficiency of marriage market equilibrium (section

5A) and then the relevance of the distinction between BAMM and BIM in search models (section

5B). In section 5C I sketch a generalization of the marriage market analysis from situations in

which there are two alternative living arrangements (e.g., living alone; marriage) to situations in

which there are three alternative living arrangements (e.g., living alone, cohabitation, and marriage).

A. Pareto Efficiency

     Pareto efficiency is a central concern of economics. With BAMM Pareto efficiency of both

marriage market equilibrium and allocation within marriage follow from the twin assumptions that

prospective spouses can make binding agreements and that bargaining leads to Pareto efficient

allocations. With BIM and the altruist model, inefficient marriage market equilibria are possible

even if allocation in every possible marriage is Pareto efficient. Indeed, because we know that

BAMM maximizes the sum of outputs over all possible marriages, if BAMM and BIM imply

different marriage market equilibria, then the pattern corresponding to BIM must be Pareto

inefficient. The same reasoning applies to BAMM and the altruist model.

     With BIM, if bargaining is a cooperative game, then the Pareto efficiency of allocation within

each marriage is guaranteed. If, on the other hand, bargaining is noncooperative, then allocation

within marriage may be Pareto inefficient. Hence, with BIM Pareto efficiency may fail for one or

both of two reasons: because of inefficiency in allocation within marriage or because of inefficiency


28
   In the US, the gift tax and the estate tax are integrated to limit the ability of wealthy individuals to avoid estate taxes by making
inter vivos transfers. In 2016 the US federal estate tax applies only to estates over $5.45 million for an individual; gifts to any person
other than a spouse totaling in excess of $14,000 in a single year must be reported to the Internal Revenue Service. Thus, individuals
wealthy enough to be concerned about the estate tax consequences of transfers may prefer prenuptial agreements to premarital
transfers.
                                                                  28


in the marriage market.29 With the altruist model, allocation within every possible marriage is

Pareto efficient, so the only possible source of inefficiency is the marriage market.

B. Search

     The distinction between BAMM and BIM is crucial in search models as well as in marriage

markets in which participants meet one another instantaneously. BAMM and BIM can imply

different equilibria, although the details depend on the search protocol. The "one draw" search

specification of Konrad and Lommerud (2010) provides a transparent and tractable illustration

because it assumes away most of the complications of search and allows us to focus on the

interactions between prospective spouses when they meet in the marriage market. In the one-draw

specification, a man and a woman are drawn at random and offered a take-it-or-leave-it choice:

marry each other or never marry. With BAMM, marriage dominance, and the usual Coasian

assumption about bargaining, every randomly chosen couple will agree on an allocation that both

prefer to remaining unmarried. Without marriage dominance, they will agree on an allocation and

marry if the bargaining set is nonempty. In the one-draw specification, all allocations in the

bargaining set are possible equilibria. With BIM, even if bargaining in marriage will lead to a

Pareto efficient allocation, the allocations prospective spouses foresee emerging from bargaining in

marriage may be worse for one of them than never marrying. A similar possibility arises with the

altruist model.

C. Cohabitation

     Virtually all marriage market models ignore cohabitation.30 The standard theory of marriage

recognizes only two possible living arrangements: "marriage" and "living alone." In this section I


29
   Lundberg and Pollak (2003) argue that inefficient allocation within marriage is especially plausible in dynamic settings in which
bargaining power in later periods depends on actions taken in earlier periods and spouses are unable to make binding agreements
within marriage.
30
   Indeed, virtually all economic discussions of marriage ignore cohabitation. Exceptions include Brien, Lillard, and Stern (2006),
Lundberg and Pollak (2014, 2015) and Lundberg, Pollak, and Stearns (2016).
                                                                   29


sketch a generalization of the dichotomous matching model to a trichotomous model, treating

cohabitation as an additional living arrangement, distinct from both marriage and living alone. The

existence of equilibrium in the trichotomous framework follows from essentially the same

argument used in the dichotomous framework.

       We can reinterpret the trichotomous framework as one in which couples choose between living

alone and two forms of marriage. In Arizona, Arkansas, and Louisiana marrying couples choose

between "standard marriage" and "covenant marriage," an option that requires premarital

counseling and makes ending marriage more difficult by limiting the grounds for divorce.31 In

France and in Italy, marrying couples must choose between two marital property regimes: common

(i.e., community) property and separate property.32

       BAMM generalizes in the obvious way to a trichotomous model in which allocation in each

possible match is determined by binding agreements in the matching market. To generalize BIM,

first consider the case in which preferences are primitives of the model and in which each woman

(man) has preferences not simply over men (women) but over whether the match with a particular

man (women) is marriage or cohabitation. For example, if there are two men, the preferences of a

woman might be

            marry man 1

            cohabit with man 2

            live alone

            cohabit with man 1

            marry man 2

If there are Nm men, each woman ranks 2Nm + 1 alternatives (marriage to each man; cohabitation

with each man; living alone). Similarly, each man has preferences not simply over women but over

31
     For covenant marriage, see Cherlin (2009).
32
     For France, see Laferrère (2001); for Italy, Bayot and Voena (2015).
                                                  30


whether the match type is marriage or cohabitation. If there are Nf women, then each man ranks 2Nf

+ 1 alternatives. In a different context, Hatfield and Milgrom (2005) show that under these

assumptions the Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm converges, establishing the existence

of a stable matching.

       Now suppose the rankings are not primitives of the model but depend on the type of union

(i.e., marriage or cohabitation) and on allocations that matching market participants foresee

emerging from bargaining in each possible marriage and in each possible cohabitation.33 Under

these assumptions, each woman (man) has a ranking of the 2Nm + 1 alternatives (marriage to each

man; cohabitation with each man; living alone). Similarly, each man has a ranking over the 2Nf + 1

alternatives. Thus, the dichotomous matching model based on bargaining in each possible marriage

generalizes to a trichotomous matching model based on bargaining in each possible match type.

6. Conclusion

       The standard Beckerian analysis assumes that prospective spouses make binding

agreements in the marriage market (BAMM) and that these agreements determine allocation within

marriage. The alternative approaches, bargaining in marriage (BIM) and the altruist model, assume

that allocation within marriage is determined within marriage rather than before marriage.
         With BAMM and a single output or transferable utility, the appropriate framework for

analyzing marriage market equilibrium is the Koopmans-Beckmann assignment model. With BIM,

or the altruist model, the marriage market is the first stage of a two-stage game that must be solved

by backwards induction. The second stage, BIM or the altruist model, determines allocation within

each marriage. Marriage market participants' rankings of prospective spouses depend on the

allocations they foresee emerging from bargaining. The first stage, the marriage market itself,

determines who marries and who does not and, for those who marry, it determines who marries
                                                                   31

whom (assortative marriage). With BIM or the altruist model, the appropriate framework for

analyzing marriage market equilibrium is the Gale-Shapley matching model. The analysis does not

require and is not substantially simplified by assuming a single output or transferable utility.

            Gale and Shapley treated individuals' rankings of prospective spouses as primitives of the

model. Becker reinterpreted the Gale-Shapley model to allow rankings to depend on allocation

within marriage, but Becker's reinterpretation of Gale-Shapley also assumed that the division of

marital output between husbands and wives is the same in all marriages. On the basis of this

identical division assumption, Becker dismissed the Gale-Shapley model as unsuitable for

analyzing marriage market equilibrium. But requiring the same division across all couples is an

arbitrary and unnecessarily restriction. Allowing the rankings to depend on the allocations that

individuals foresee emerging from bargaining in each possible marriage, I analyze marriage market

equilibrium using the Gale-Shapley matching model. I show that BAMM, BIM, and the altruist

model can have different implications for who marries and, among those who marry, for who

marries whom.




33
     Rankings can also depend on the identity of the prospective spouse/partner.
