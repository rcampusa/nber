                                         ABSTRACT

It is well documented that individuals do not spend SNAP benefits smoothly over the month after
receipt. Rather, recipients spend a disproportionate share of benefits at the beginning of the
benefit month. This has costs for recipients and stores. There is also evidence that other income
streams, such as Social Security and paychecks, are not spent smoothly. The presence of these
other income streams may bias estimates of the effects of this SNAP cycle on consumption for
working SNAP beneficiaries and those who receive other government benefits. We use data from
USDA’s National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey to explore how the SNAP
cycle is affected by accounting for these other income streams. We find suggestive evidence that
the cycle is more pronounced for workers who are paid on a weekly or monthly basis, but little
evidence that cycles in other income streams mitigate or exacerbate the SNAP cycle.

1     Introduction

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) accounts for roughly
10% of total U.S. food-at-home (FAH) spending and makes up almost half
of food-at-home expenditure for low-income households (Wilde 2012). Prior
work has documented that SNAP participants do not behave as neoclassical
theory suggests by smoothly spending their predictable SNAP benefits over
the benefit month. Rather, participants redeem a large share of benefits im-
mediately upon receipt (Caster and Henke 2011). This phenomenon—where
recipients disproportionately spend their SNAP benefits when they are dis-
bursed at the start of the benefit month —is known as the SNAP cycle.
Evidence suggests that this “SNAP cycle” is adverse for consumers. The
bunching of purchases by SNAP recipients on particular days may impose
congestion costs on retailers. For example, they may need to stock certain
goods or need more workers on days when SNAP is disbursed.
    Most SNAP recipients receive income from other sources but prior work
has studied SNAP receipt and food spending in isolation. Here, we focus on
several other sources of income: wages, other means-tested safety-net pro-
grams, and social-insurance programs. Much like SNAP, paychecks and other
government benefits reflect lumpy influxes of resources to the household—
though wages and other benefits are not limited to being spent on food. Pay-
checks arrive at different frequencies across jurisdictions. In fact, a number
of states have laws specifying how often some workers must be paid. Berniell


                                      1
(2018) shows that differences in laws regarding paycheck timing drive differ-
ences in aggregate economic activity—low pay frequency states experience
more pronounced within-month business cycles.
   This leads to our first research question: Does the paycheck cycle mitigate
or exacerbate the SNAP cycle? Specifically we ask, does the SNAP cycle look
different in states where, by law, paychecks arrive more frequently than in
states where paychecks arrive less frequently? Our second research question
is motivated by the fact that many SNAP recipients participate in other
government programs and these programs also induce cycles in expenditures.
We investigate whether the SNAP cycle is affected by household receipt of
other means-tested cash welfare or social insurance programs. In addition, we
consider whether these payment streams have interactive effects on spending.
Finally, we explore whether variables that predict the degree to which SNAP
households are economically constrained affect the magnitude of the SNAP
cycle.
   A priori it is not obvious how SNAP, paycheck, and other benefit cycles
interact. Other sources of income might mitigate the SNAP cycle. Earning
a paycheck or receiving benefits from other sources loosens the household
budget constraint. Further, above a certain level, wages mechanically reduce
the value of the SNAP entitlement, which in turn reduces SNAP spending in
total and as a share of overall food spending. In this way, earning a wage or
getting other welfare or social insurance should reduce the magnitude of the
SNAP cycle. If this were the case, then prior work might have underestimated


                                      2
the true magnitude of the SNAP cycle for some by estimating an average
effect over households who receive a paycheck and those who do not. On
the other hand, to the extent that the timing of SNAP benefit issuance
overlaps with receipt of paychecks, welfare, or social insurance payments,
prior estimates of the SNAP cycle may be too large. Further, participants in
some social welfare programs—e.g. Supplemental Security Income (SSI)—
are likely to have few alternative sources of income, suggesting they may be
more economically constrained than are workers.
       Prior work ignores these, potentially confounding, income streams. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to explore the interactive effects
of SNAP disbursals and paychecks, welfare, and social insurance payments.
This is possible because our unique data set—FoodAPS—combines high-
frequency daily expenditure data, rather than the weekly or monthly averages
used in some previous work, with administrative data on SNAP participation
and the exact date of SNAP benefit disbursal. Taken together, these features
suggest our work will be less prone to measurement error than prior studies
based on monthly spending data or inferred SNAP receipt dates from self-
reports of SNAP participation, which is under-reported in many surveys (e.g.,
Meyer, Mok, and Sullivan 2015).1
       The paper proceeds as follows. We review some of the prior literature on
   1
    Note that with most states staggering benefit disbursal dates in recent years based
on variables like the first letter of the last name of the case head, it is unlikely that
researchers can correctly assign the timing of a family’s SNAP receipt without some access
to administrative data which is rare or exact birth dates, which are uncommon in public-
use survey data.

expenditure cycles in Section 2. We describe our data on food spending in
Section 3. Section 4 presents descriptive preliminary evidence on the SNAP
cycle. Section 5 describes our empirical approach and presents our main
results. Section 6 concludes.



2     Background

Prior work has found that changes in spending over the SNAP benefit month
translate into changes in consumption, with potential health consequences.
Wilde and Ranney (2000) and Shapiro (2005) show that expenditure cycles
induces comparable cycles in consumption, with calorie intake falling across
the SNAP benefit month. Todd (2016) documents the same pattern in more
recent data. Hamrick and Andrews (2016) show that SNAP recipients are
more likely to report days with no eating at the end of the SNAP benefit
month. Finally, Seligman et al. (2014) link being at the end of the benefit
month to increased hospitalization for illnesses associated with food intake.
    In addition, SNAP disbursal patterns may change the kinds of foods peo-
ple buy. Forward-looking households who are shopping for an entire month
may shift expenditure towards less healthful shelf-stable food and away from
healthier but perishable foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables. The once
per month SNAP disbursal pattern has also been shown to shift shopping
patterns between outlet types. Damon, King and Leibtag (2013) find shifts
from grocery stores to convenience stores over the benefit month. Further,


                                      4
Cheng and Beatty (2016) shows the unit prices paid by SNAP participants
decrease over the benefit cycle.
      The SNAP cycle—where recipients spend the bulk of their SNAP bene-
fits in the few days after benefits are disbursed—may also impose costs on
retailers through increased staffing needs, congestion, and stock-outs. When
Illinois reduced the number of days on which benefits were disbursed, retailers
complained about shortages.2 This echoes press accounts during the Great
Recession of demand spikes at midnight on the day that SNAP benefits were
distributed. In theory, retailers with market power might leverage this to
raise prices when benefits are disbursed. However, Hastings and Washington
(2010) and Goldin, Homonoff, and Meckel (2018) find little evidence that
retailers are extracting profits by raising prices despite predictable increases
in expenditure by SNAP recipients at the start of the benefit month.
      Concern about the adverse effects of the SNAP cycle has led almost all
states to stagger disbursal dates over the course of the month. Individuals
are assigned a receipt day during the month related to their case number,
birth date, or Social Security number. For example, a state might distribute
benefits on the day of the month corresponding to the first or last digit of a
household’s case number. This may reduce the costs imposed by the presence
of the SNAP cycle for retailers but does not address issues faced by recipients.
In response, some authors and policy makers advocate for moving to a twice

monthly disbursement cycle (e.g., Just 2006).
   Expenditure responses to paycheck arrival have also been documented.
Work by Stephens (2006) shows that expenditures increase immediately upon
receipt of a paycheck, which translate into increases in expenditure on fresh
foods as well as food-away-from-home. In this paper, we leverage exogenous
variation in the drivers of the frequency of income receipt. Most states reg-
ulate the minimum frequency with which workers must be paid. Appendix
Table 2 lists the paycheck timing laws for 2012, using information provided
by the Department of Labor. These laws are meant to protect workers. In
practice, they mean there are states where workers must be paid at least
2 times a month (bimonthly), once every 2 weeks (biweekly or 26 times a
year), or once a week (weekly or 52 times a year). Some states have no laws,
and others set frequencies which vary by occupation. We hypothesize that
workers receiving SNAP in states with laws requiring more frequent pay will
be less constrained by the once-monthly disbursal of SNAP.
   Expenditure cycles related to benefit receipt from other social programs,
notably Social Security, are also well established. For example, Stephens
(2003) shows that expenditure patterns vary according to when benefits are
received, with food-away-from-home spending being significantly more likely
on the day of Social Security receipt. Berniell (2018) shows this pattern
still holds now that the timing of Social Security receipt depends on date of
birth. We exploit the fact that the Social Security Administration has a set
calendar determining when Social Security Old Age and Disability Insurance


                                     6
payments and Supplemental Security Income payments are made (and that
this varies across months).



3     Data

We use data from the USDA’s National Household Food Acquisition and
Purchase Survey (FoodAPS). FoodAPS is a nationally-representative survey
that collected comprehensive data on American household food purchases
and acquisitions. A total of 4,826 households participated in the survey
between April 2012 and January 2013. The data contain information on all
foods and drinks obtained for at-home consumption (food-at-home—FAH)
and meals, snacks, and drinks obtained for outside home consumption (food-
away-from-home—FAFH) during a one-week survey period. The FAH data
typically include food obtained from grocery stores, farmers’ markets, food
pantries, and other outlets. The FAFH part includes meals and drinks that
were consumed at restaurants, fast-food establishments, schools, working
places, and so on. Given our focus on the effects of SNAP disbursal, all of
our analysis is done on a sample of SNAP-recipient households.
    Through two in-person interviews, the primary respondent for each household—
chosen to be the main food shopper or meal planner—provided detailed de-
mographic information for every household member as well as information on
household food-shopping. The main food shopper identified the store where
their household did their primary food shopping. During the survey week,


                                     7
households kept a food diary in which they logged each food acquisition,
referred to as a food event (e.g., grocery-shopping trip for FAH or a meal
eaten out for FAFH). For each event, households were asked to record the
location and date as well as the total cost of the food acquired. To capture
food-at-home events, households were given hand-held scanners to scan the
universal product codes (UPCs) and were asked to keep receipts. When they
could not scan the barcodes or a receipt was missing, households were asked
to record the information in food diaries. For food-away-from-home events,
each adult and child ages 11–17 was given a diary in which to record prices
paid (inclusive of tax and tip) and quantities. Parents recorded information
for younger children. During post-processing of the data, survey adminis-
trators sorted food items into specific food groups using scanned barcodes
and product descriptions. FoodAPS assigned food-group codes to individual
items. Food-group codes are then used to match the items to USDA nutri-
ent databases. Thus, FoodAPS gathered detailed information for individual
food items including package size, price, coupon usage, and food category.
FoodAPS also contains geocoded addresses for the food-acquisition events,
enabling calculations of the straight line distance to the food outlets for each
household.3 Our analysis combines the households’ FAH and FAFH expen-
ditures into daily total expenditures. We include $0s for days when no food
acquisitions for cash or SNAP benefits occurred.
   3
     The distances are measured from the interviewee’s home to the location of the stores
visited, and thus do not represent the actual distance that households traveled, as trips
to acquire food may not start from home.



                                           8
      FoodAPS has three features that make it well suited to answering our
central question: How does the SNAP cycle interact with other expendi-
ture cycles? First, FoodAPS includes data from a large sample of SNAP-
participating households. Households were asked about their current SNAP-
participation status during the initial interview. FoodAPS checked self-
reported survey responses against state SNAP administrative databases for
interviewees who consented to the check—and nearly all consented. Admin-
istrative records were used to determine participation status when discrepan-
cies between self-reports and administrative records occurred. For the very
small number of households who did not consent, the survey response was
used to determine participation status. To avoid biases caused by misclas-
sifying SNAP participation, we retain only those SNAP households whose
participation status was confirmed by administrative records.4 Thus, we rely
on an administrative measure that is far less likely to suffer from measure-
ment error than most other studies that use self-reports. During the initial
interview (prior to the survey week) households were also asked about the
most recent date on which they had received SNAP benefits. For respondents
who did not self-report a date of last receipt, or whose date of last receipt
was more than a month before the first survey day, FoodAPS filled it in with
the information from the state SNAP administrative databases if available.
Using this SNAP receipt date and the diary dates, we calculated the number
of days since the date of benefit receipt. In this paper, we use day one to
  4
      This resulted in omitting 239 households.

indicate the day of benefit arrival and day 31 to indicate the last possible
day of the cycle. Our analysis sample consists of 1,388 SNAP households
that reported their most recent benefit receipt. Appendix Table 1 reports
the December 2012 benefit disbursal schedules for each state.
   The second important feature of the restricted version of the FoodAPS
data is that we observe a household’s state of residence. This allows us to
link households to their state’s payday requirement laws (U.S. Department
of Labor). The US Department of Labor’s Division of Wages and Hours re-
ports the presence (if any) of payday rules for each state—these are reported
in Appendix Table 2. We classified households into groups with different
payday requirements, including monthly payments, semi-monthly payments,
biweekly, and no payday requirement as well as a “multiple laws apply”
group. Semi-monthly laws require that employees be paid at least twice a
month. Biweekly laws require that they be paid at least every other week.
“Multiple laws apply” means there is more than one law in place. As noted
above, we use this information to explore whether state pay laws affect the
SNAP cycle in food acquisition for working households.
   Finally, FoodAPS provides rich household and individual demographic
data, as well as information on earnings, use of social insurance programs,
and cash welfare receipt. This allows us to explore how the SNAP cycle
varies for workers and non-workers respectively. FoodAPS also asks workers
how frequently they were paid, so we can also see if there is variation in the
SNAP cycle according to when workers report being paid. As noted above,


                                     10
the timing of payment of social insurance benefits and welfare benefits affects
expenditures (Stephens 2003; Berniell 2018) and we explore the extent to
which the SNAP cycle varies by household receipt of welfare and/or social
insurance.


Characteristics of the sample

Table 1 presents household summary statistics for our sample, weighted to be
nationally representative. Column 1 shows means and standard deviations
for the full sample. The sample consists of all households with at least 1 adult
between 18 and 64, who reported the time when they last received SNAP, and
for whom the administrative data confirmed they received SNAP benefits.
The unit of observation is the household and the characteristics are those
of the main shopper if there is more than one adult in the household. Not
surprisingly, most respondents are female. The majority of the respondents
are black or white, although these categories are not mutually exclusive.
Given the data are nationally representative, it is not surprising that there is
considerable variation in the respondent’s level of education, and in marital
status and family type (presence of other adults, children, or seniors in the
household). Over half the sample households, 58%, had at least one worker
in the household.
   Lower panels of the table report the prevalence of pay regulations in our
sample. About 21% of the households live in a state with no rules, 21% are
in a state with semi-monthly rules, 12% have monthly rules, 4% biweekly

                                      11
rules, and 42% live in states with a variety of rules. This lines up well with
data from the BLS’s Current Employment Statistics which collects informa-
tion about the frequency with which private businesses pay their employees.
In 2013, 32.4% paid their employees weekly, 36.5% biweekly, 19.8% semi-
monthly, and 11.3% monthly (Burgess 2014). Turning to the self-reports of
payment frequency, among 731 households with a worker, 65% report being
paid monthly, 7% semi-monthly, 5% biweekly, and 14% weekly. The next
panel reports the receipt of any social insurance or safety-net benefits by
the household—about half of families get some benefit. Finally, we report
distance to the most used store. 53% of the households’ distance to their
primary store is less than or equal the median distance while 47% are more
than the mean distance from their primary store. (Note that the median is
estimated on the full sample.)
   In our analyses, we use the following demographic characteristics as con-
trols: the number of adults, children, or seniors in the household; and
race/ethnicity, gender, and marital status of the primary respondent. In
addition, each household member age 16 or older was asked to fill out an in-
come worksheet that gathered income information from all sources. Income
information was reported at the individual level by the household’s primary
respondent with the aid of the income worksheet filled by the individual
household members. For a given household, we identified family members
who received Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Old Age Social Security
Income (OASS), Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), or other retire-


                                     12
ment and disability income, and attached this variable to the household. We
combined this information with food purchase dates and state benefit distri-
bution schedules for those programs and estimated the benefit receipt cycle
for those households.5
       Our final sample includes 1,388 households that purchased any FAH or
FAFH during the survey week (excluding missing values) and received SNAP.
In all analyses, we aggregated the total expenditures for each FAH and FAFH
event by survey day, and include $0 for the day when there were no food
events on that day. Our key dependent variables are either the level of
spending on a given day or the share of total expenditures that occurred on
a given day during the survey.
       Our key explanatory variable is a dummy for whether the diary day falls
during the first week of the SNAP benefit month (“first week of SNAP cy-
cle”). The omitted category is whether the diary day falls during weeks
two through four of the SNAP benefit month. In keeping with prior work
documenting a SNAP cycle, we expect acquisition amounts and acquisition
shares to be higher during the first week. Columns 2 and 3 of Table 1 report
summary statistics for the treated diary days (days during the first week)
                                                                      6
and control diary days (days during the last 3 weeks).                    Column 4 reports
   5
     We also include household WIC receipt in our measure of households obtaining gov-
ernment benefits but cannot look at WIC cycles due to a lack of information about state
rules regarding WIC disbursal.
   6
     If a week is split, we allocate the share of the weight for that household to the relevant
row. So, if 2 days were during week 1 and 5 during week 2, 2/7 of the household weight
would be applied to the observation for constructing the column 2 mean, and 5/7 the
column 3 mean.



                                              13
the p-value for a test of equality of means between the two groups. Our
research design depends on the fact that the interview date is quasi-random.
We can check this, at least in part, by testing whether the observable char-
acteristics in columns 2 and 3 are statistically significantly different from one
another. There do not appear to be systematic differences between house-
holds interviewed during either period. The one exception is the share of the
sample where the respondent has “some college, less than bachelor degree”
is slightly lower for households interviewed during the first week—29% vs
35%—and the difference is statistically significant at the 10% level. This
bolsters our faith in the research design.



4     SNAP Cycle by Demographics and Other

      Characteristics

We begin with simple descriptive graphs of food spending over the benefit
month. Figure 1(A) displays expenditures by day of the SNAP benefit month
for our main sample using the set of controls described above and a dummy
for each day in the cycle. The solid line is the coefficient on the day of the
SNAP benefit month and the dashed lines are the lower and upper bounds
of the pointwise 95% confidence intervals. Figure 1(B) repeats the exercise
where the outcome variable is the share of weekly expenditures by day of the




                                       14
SNAP cycle.7 Figures 1(A) and 1(B) show the well-known pattern of food
spending over the SNAP cycle in our data. Households spend considerably
more on the first day of the cycle—nearly $80 compared to an average that
quickly falls to $10 or less after 2 or 3 days. The expenditure share graph
tells much the same story. On the first day of the SNAP cycle households
spend on the order of 45% of weekly food expenditure, which quickly falls to
under 20% although there is a puzzling bump in expenditure around 25 days
into the cycle.8    9


       Figures 2(A) and 2(B) split the sample into households in which someone
works and households in which no one works. The average income for working
households is $2,967 while the average income for households where no one
works is $1,086. As food is a normal good, it is not surprising that total food
spending in working households is higher. However, expenditure pattern is
similar, suggesting that the presence of paycheck cycles does not drive the
observed SNAP cycle. The SNAP cycles in shares for households with and
without workers in Figure 2(B) are even closer to one another those in levels
and the qualitative patterns are directly comparable.
       Next, we consider how the receipt of various income types affects the cycle.
   7
     Note that we observe total food expenditure over a single week—so daily expenditure
shares are shares of expenditure over the week long survey period. As a result weekly
shares over the month will sum to more than 100%.
   8
     We have spent considerable effort trying to understand this spike. It seems to be
most prominent among the no-worker households, but none of the other cycle controls we
include (not even those for SSI/OASI/SSDI disbursal) seem to explain this spike.
   9
     We looked at the households that had their data collection overlap with the day when
they received beneftis. We observed a clear jump in both expenditures and expenditure
shares on the benefit receipt day.



                                           15
Figures 3(A) and 3(B) split the sample according to the pay frequency laws in
the household’s state of residence. First, we note that each sample and both
outcomes exhibit the characteristic SNAP cycle. However, when measured in
expenditure shares, the spike on the first day is more pronounced in biweekly
states than in the monthly or no-pay rule states. Figures 4(A) and (B)
split the sample according to the self-reported pay frequency for households
with workers rather than using pay frequency laws as above.10 These figures
clearly show that, for working households who are paid biweekly, there is a
second spike in expenditures and expenditure shares later in the SNAP cycle
- consistent with increased food spending after paycheck receipt.
       Finally Figures 5(A) and 5(B) show the SNAP cycles after splitting the
data into samples of households with receipt of WIC, SSI, SSDI, or Old Age
Social Security and those households without. The SNAP cycle patterns
remain similar for these two groups of households. Our final set of descriptive
figures cuts the sample by the household’s distance to their primary food
store. Again, the cycles are remarkably similar.
       Next we turn to regression analysis to see if these descriptive patterns are
borne out when we systematically assess the SNAP cycle.

    Appendix Table 3 shows the correlation between the pay laws and the self-reported
pay frequency. It is positive in that people report being paid more frequently when the
laws are more stringent, but it is not large.

5     Empirical Strategy

We now formalize the graphical intuition developed above but aggregate our
key variable of interest into week of the SNAP cycle—this reduces the di-
mensionality of the problem and facilitates hypothesis testing. We model
either expenditures per day or the expenditure share per day in the following
regression equation.


yid = α+β·SNAPWK1id +Weekdayk +Holidayl +Day-of-Diaryd +Xi ·γ+id (1)

where yid is either expenditures or expenditure shares for household i on day
d of the acquisition data (with days with no purchases included as $0 or a 0
share). The coefficient of interest is β on the dummy variable SNAPWK1,
which is 1 if household i on acquisition day d is in the first week of their
SNAP benefit month.
    We also control for the day of the week k, for diary day d, for household i,
and whether it is a holiday (Holidayl ). Finally, to control for survey fatigue,
we include dummies for survey day Day-of-Diaryd (i.e., day 1 through 7 of
the food diary).
    Xi is a vector of controls for the household including the number of chil-
dren, adults, and seniors as well as household income. Xi also includes
characteristics of the primary respondent such as gender, race, education,
and marital status. In some specifications, we choose to include household



                                       17
fixed effects (although they do not appear in the equation)—in which case we
omit the controls Xi . When controls are included, we also include state fixed
effects, so comparisons are within state. When the household fixed effects
(FE) are included, then the SNAPWK1 dummy is identified off households
where some days of their diary week are in the first SNAP week and some are
in other weeks. All specifications are at the diary day level and all regression
weight each day with the household weight divided by 7 to get nationally
representative numbers. Standard errors are clustered at the household level
to allow for arbitrary correlations across acquisition days but we note that
the results are robust to clustering at the state level as well as at the PSU
level (which better reflects the complex sample design).
   Above, we showed the observable demographic characteristics are bal-
anced for diary days in the first week and the other weeks. But we also want
to show that interview day is uniformly distributed in the data. Appendix
Figure 1 shows the empirical distribution of the first day of the diary in our
main sample. It is clear from this figure that the first diary day is randomly
distributed across days of the month. This provides further justification for
our assertion that in our sample, households are observed randomly through-
out the benefit month.
   Next, we turn to our regression specifications and results. Below, all
results tables follow the same pattern. Each column presents the results of a
different regression. Columns 1–3 have food expenditures as the dependent
variable while columns 4–6 show results for expenditure shares. Columns 1


                                      18
and 4 include no demographic controls but do control for day of the week,
day of the survey, and holidays. Columns 2 and 5 add the household controls
and state FE. Columns 3 and 6 include household FE.
   Table 2 presents the results of estimating equation (1) on the full sample.
Not surprisingly, regression results confirm our graphical intuition and we
find robust evidence of a SNAP cycle in food expenditure. This is consistent
with a large extant literature. If the day of acquisition is in the first week
of the cycle, the average household spends between $13 and $15 more, or
between 4% more (with and without demographic controls and state FE)
and 8% more (in the specifications with household FE).
   We now turn to our key research question, does the arrival of income from
other sources mitigate or exacerbate the SNAP cycle? We first address this
by using specifications that allow the coefficient on the dummy for the acqui-
sition day d to vary according to a set of S mutually exclusive dichotomous
household characteristics, His .

             S
             X            S
                          X
     yid =         αs +         δs · SNAPWK1id · His + Weekdayk + Holidayl +
             s=1          s=1

                            Day-of-Diaryd + Xi · β2 + id (2)



Table 3 presents the results of estimating equation (2), where the mutually
exclusive categories His are households with a worker and households with
no worker. We can then test whether the cycle differs for these 2 groups


                                            19
of households by testing whether the coefficients describing the magnitude
of the SNAP cycle in the first week are different. The F -statistic for this
test and the associated p-value are reported in the next panel of the table.
Below this, we also present the F -statistic for testing whether the intercepts
are different from one another. We also report mean spending by group and
whether it is the first week or not.
   The first column in table 3 shows that there is substantially higher spend-
ing by households with workers in the first week of the SNAP cycle as com-
pared to other weeks. They spend $14 more, compared to baseline spending
of $15 for workers in weeks 2–4. This is also true for households with no
worker, who spend $11 more, compared to a baseline of $10. However, these
coefficients are not statistically different from one another (F -statistics of
1.324, p-value of 0.25), although the means are statistically different (F -
statistic of 27.19). The patterns are similar in columns 2 and 3, with no
evidence that the SNAP cycle differs with the presence of a worker in the
household. The cycle is slightly more pronounced in specification where
household fixed effects are included, but the difference is not statistically
significant. Columns 4–6 show a similar pattern for the expenditure shares.
There is no evidence across any of the columns 4–6 that the cycle is more
pronounced for either group.
   Table 4 allows the SNAP cycle to vary by the payday regulations in
the state of residence. Again, there is some variation in the magnitude of
the coefficient on the dummy for the first week of the SNAP cycle across


                                       20
columns for expenditures, but there is no evidence that these coefficients
are statistically different (p-values range from 0.518 to 0.882). In terms of
expenditure shares, there is modest evidence of variation in the SNAP cycle.
There is little evidence of a pay cycle in the biweekly or multiple payday
requirement states—the coefficients for being in the first SNAP cycle week
are smaller in magnitude and not statistically significant for households in
these states. The p-values for the SNAP cycle coefficients being statistically
different from one another are 0.083, 0.106, and 0.101.
   Table 5 splits the sample by self-reported pay frequency of households
with workers. Here, point estimates suggest that workers who are paid
monthly are more constrained by the SNAP cycle. They spend between
$10 and $14 more in the first week of the cycle, compared to baseline spend-
ing that is lower (with no controls) in other weeks than for the other pay
periods (semi-monthly, biweekly or weekly). When looking at expenditures,
there is evidence that the weekly paid workers also show evidence of a SNAP
cycle. However, these findings are not consistent with the results for shares,
where the most robust evidence is for a SNAP cycle among those paid semi-
monthly.
   It seems reasonable to ask whether, among those with self-reported pay
dates, the SNAP cycle is more pronounced if paycheck and SNAP receipt
occur during the same week and less pronounced otherwise. To investigate
this, we run our main specification but interact the dummy for monthly
paycheck households and all other households with the “first week of SNAP


                                     21
month” variable in Appendix Table 4. We found no difference in the effects
of receiving both benefits at the same time.
   Table 6 looks at households with some WIC, SSI, SSDI, or Old Age Social
Security receipt compared to those without. Here again, there is remarkably
little difference in the magnitude of the SNAP cycles for households that
participate in other parts of the social safety net and those do not. The
coefficient on the dummy for being in the first week of the SNAP benefit
month is similar for both groups. Table 7 extends this by adding controls for
receipt of income from different streams. As in Table 6, there do not seem
to be large differences in the SNAP cycle across households receiving income
from other programs relative to those who do not.
   Our final set of results, reported in Table 8, separates the first week of
SNAP month according to whether or not the household is further from the
primary store than is the average household. Here, there is a suggestion that
those further from their primary store do more shopping—both in absolute
terms and relative to their usual spending—than those who are closer, though
results are not statistically significantly different.
   As noted above, an important advantage of the FoodAPS data is the
link to administrative records. SNAP participation is determined admin-
istratively for most of our sample. For a smaller share, we also have ad-
ministrative data on disbursal dates. Where it was possible to obtain an
administrative measure of the date of last SNAP benefit receipt, we com-
pared the main findings using the self-reported measure with results that use


                                        22
the administrative measure. Note that this reduced our sample nearly by
half. Most findings were similar for this smaller sample. The sole exception
is table 5, where the coefficient on self-reported bi-weekly paycheck receipt
is somewhat different. The coefficients are statistically significant at the 1%
level when using administrative matched benefit receipt dates, while those
are not statistically significant when using self-reported dates. For 89% of
the diary days, the self-reported date of receipt and the administrative date
of receipt lead to classifying the diary day in the same week of the SNAP
cycle.



6        Discussion and conclusion

Our initial graphical analysis suggested differences in how much households
spend on food immediately after getting their SNAP benefits according to
whether or not households had access to other sources of income and the
timing of these sources of income. However, in our regression analysis we find
only modest evidence that SNAP cycles are affected by the arrival of income
from other sources, be it wage income or income from other government
programs.
    In sum, looking at the five tables with 15 specifications each testing for
a difference in spending in the first week after SNAP benefits were received,
only 1 showed statistically significant differences at the 5% level for expen-
ditures (more of a cycle for those paid weekly when household fixed effects


                                      23
were included), and only 1 showed significant differences at the 10% level for
expenditure shares (more of a cycle for those in states with no payday rules,
monthly rules, or semi-monthly rules than for those with biweekly or multiple
rules when household fixed effects were included). These results suggest that
other sources of income neither mitigate nor exacerbate the SNAP cycle.
   While theory suggests that less constrained households should experience
less of a SNAP cycle, we find no systematic evidence that this is the case. In
part, this may be due to limitations of using a single cross-section of some
1400 households. Moreover, differences may be small and difficult to detect
given these sample sizes. The significant differences we did find suggest it
may be worth using other panel data to consider this question.
   Our results are consistent with a growing literature that finds that house-
holds differentiate between SNAP and cash (Beatty and Tuttle 2015; Hast-
ings and Shapiro 2018). If benefits were viewed as perfectly fungible the
SNAP cycle should be less pronounced in households with diverse income
streams. The evidence for a SNAP cycle is remarkably consistent across
households with different non-SNAP sources of income and timing of income
receipt in the household.

Note: This figure shows average daily expenditures over the benefit month,
where the benefit month is based on a combination of self-reported last day
of SNAP receipt and administrative dates, for 5 mutually exclusive samples.
The samples split the households according to the paycheck receipt laws in
the state of residence. Each point in each panel is the coefficient on each day
of the benefit month in regressions that also control for the day of the week,
the day of the food diary (one to seven), and whether the day is a holiday.
The regressions also control for the number of children, adults, and seniors in
the household, household income, and main respondent demographic charac-
teristics such as female, race, education, and marital status. The regressions
also includes state fixed effects. The confidence intervals are based on stan-
dard errors clustered at household level.

Note: This figure shows average daily expenditures over the benefit month,
where the benefit month is based on a combination of self-reported last day
of SNAP receipt and administrative dates, for 2 mutually exclusive samples.
The samples split the households according to whether the household is closer
or further than the median reported distance from the primary store. Each
point in each panel is the coefficient on each day of the benefit month in
regressions that also control for the day of the week, the day of the food
diary (one to seven), and whether the day is a holiday. The regressions
also control for the number of children, adults, and seniors in the household,
household income, and main respondent demographic characteristics such as
female, race, education, and marital status. The regressions also includes
state fixed effects. The confidence intervals are based on standard errors
clustered at household level.

Note: This table contains the results obtained when the dependent variables are total expenditures/expenditure shares
   and the main independent variables are dummies for whether food acquisition took place during the first week of the
   benefit month by whether the household received welfare or social insurance. The timing of the benefit month is based
   on a combination of self-reported last day of SNAP receipt and administrative dates. There are also dummies for the
   probability of receipt of SSA/SSDI/SSI on the day based on federal disbursal schedules. All regressions control for
   the day of the week, the day of the survey, and holidays. Columns (2) and (5) additionally control for the number of
   children, adults, and seniors in the household, household income, and main respondent demographic characteristics such
   as female, race, education, and marital status. Columns (2) and (5) also include state fixed effects. Columns (3) and
   (6) include household fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at household level in parentheses. * p<0.1, ** p<0.05,

Note: This table contains the results obtained when the dependent variables are total
   expenditures/expenditure shares and the main independent variables are dummies for
   the food acquisition taking place during the first week of the benefit month by self-
   reports of whether the paycheck was received monthly or on another schedules. The
   benefit month is based on self-reported last day of receipt and administrative dates. All
   regressions control for the day of the week, the day of the survey, and holidays. Columns
   (2) and (4) additionally control for the number of children, adults, and seniors in the
   household, household income, and primary respondent demographic characteristics such
   as female, race, education, highest level of education, and marital status. Columns
   (2) and (4) also include State fixed effects. Columns (3) and (6) include household

     Note: This table contains the results obtained when the dependent variables are listed as column names and the main independent
        variables is the first week of the benefit month where the benefit month is based on self-reported last day of receipt. All regressions
        control for the day of the week, the day of the survey, and holidays. Columns (2) and (4) additionally control for the number of
        children, adults, and seniors in the household, household income, and primary respondent demographic characteristics such as female,
        race, education, highest level of education, and marital status. Columns (2) and (4) also include State fixed effects. Columns (3) and
        (6) include household fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at household level in parentheses. ∗p < 0.1, ∗ ∗ p < 0.05, ∗ ∗ ∗p < 0.01.
