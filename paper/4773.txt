       I develop a model with the path of labor-market outcomes exhibiting hysteresis depending

on prior labor-market policy. The results suggest that attempts to transfer policies across

economies lead to surprising results even if current economic outcomes in the countries appear

similar. Examples of minimum wages, optimal income maintenance, and mining programs are

given. The results are applied to a discussion of overtime laws and differences in days worked

and weekly hours in the U.S. and Germany.

I. Introduction
         The increasing ease of international communications has increased

interest in comparing policies, including labor-market policies, in different

economies.t While the comparisons may have some inherent intellectual

interest, presumably their main purposes are to instruct policy makers in the

countries involved (and perhaps in other countries too) about potentially

attractive innovations that have succeeded elsewhere and that merit importing.

The ultimate goal is to broaden the menu of policy choices by providing

information on the successes and failures of the alternatives in different

countries.

         Such comparisons are implicit in the deluge of Western economists

who, beginning in the late 1980s, descended on Eastern Europe and the former

Soviet Union offering advice on economic restructuring. This was not an

example of mutual learning, of each country hoping to improve its array of

policies, but rather one of policy export. Ideally the purpose was to discover

the particular indigenous problems that might require tailoring the policies

being exported to the countries that were supposed to be aided.

         In this study I consider the potential of these exercises for generating

successful policies in the labor market. I examine in general terms the

conditions that might make one country's successful policy more or less

successfully transferable elsewhere. The analysis models various generic

policies to consider what might make an optimal policy choice in one labor

                                        1
market more or less attractive in another. Specific guidelines that can indicate

when policy transfers are more likely to be successful are then developed.

         To begin considering whether this fairly general set of considerations

is useful beyond focusing our thoughts about labor-market policy, I examine

and compare German and American policies that set restrictions on hours

worked. This leads naturally to studying differences in hours of work between

the two countries, and to the quite neglected area of variations in patterns of

hours of work per day and per week.

II. Conditions for the Transferability of Policy

         I abstract here from several international differences that will

obviously make policies that are optimal in one country suboptimal in another.

I assume throughout that there is a well-defined social welfare function (SWF),

or that policy-makers have an explicit maximand, and that these functions or

maximands are identical in each country. Clearly, if there are different

maximands, optimal policies in the face of identical shocks or conditions will

differ across countries.   Obversely, if a country's maximand changes to

approximate another's more closely, a policy is more likely to be transferred

successfully. Similarly, different technologies or endowments, including the

amount of innate talent embodied in the labor force, will also dictate that

optimal policies will differ among labor markets even in the face of identical

preferences.



                                       2
        Throughout I examine the optimal choices by one society along a

particular dimension of policy after each in a series of shocks. This is

equivalent to comparing optimal choices among otherwise identical countries

that differ only in the nature of the past choices they have made and shocks

they have faced. It enables me to isolate what generates differing optimal

policies even when tastes and technologies are identical. Moreover, it

highlights the factors (beyond the obvious differences in tastes and technology)

that produce greater differences or similarities in optimal policies.

         The general pattern of analysis considers the optimal policy choice,

P, before a first shock to the labor market occurs, the choice P' after it

occurs, and where necessary the policy P after it disappears. In each of the

examples below I explore how the choices made in response to the first shock

condition the choice of subsequent policies,thus presenting the nature of the

hysteresis in the economy.

         It should be clear that optimal policies do not differ because of any

legislative, political or bureaucratic rigidity. There are no costs of adjusting

policy in these models: Policies are changed immediately in response to

current conditions and the shock. All the results hold in long-mn equilibrium,

i.e., international differences in optimal labor-market policies are long-run

differences.




                                        3
        The specific models examined below have the same general

properties, and the processes that generate the sequence (Pt, P, P) are the

same. These are:

        1. P is chosen given the SWF, the initial technology and the initial

endowments of labor, skill and other inputs.

        2. As a result of this choice, skills and the returns to skill and raw

labor change.

        3. After this change a productivity shock occurs, essentially changing

the nature of production.

        4. In the face of this shock a new policy, P', becomes optimal and

is implemented.

        5. As a result of this new shock and of the particular choice P',

skills and the returns to skill and raw labor change again.

        6. The productivity shock disappears.

        7. In light of its disappearance a new optimal policy. P, is chosen,

P     P. The new policy differs from P because the choice P altered the

underlying set of endowments and returns.

A. Two Examples Without Externalities

         In this subsection I examine two particular labor-market policies that

produce no labor-market externalities. Consider first an effective minimum

wage wm below which no one will be employed. The policy is chosen because

society believes it is unfair for anyone to work below this wage and legislates

                                      4
its desires.2 I assume the policy has no impact on the productivity of other

workers. Its only effect is to. disemploy those whose productivity is below

      as in Meyer and Wise (1983). The SWF in this case is:

(1)               SWF = Z(Wm) H U(w) 11 U(O),
                                 IEWWm        IEW<Wm

where I assume that workers with productivity below the minimum receive an

income at some base amount set for convenience at zero, and that Z', U' > 0,

zs.,U"<o.
         The SWF in (1) is maximized at the start of Period 0 when society

chooses wmo such that:


                                      V-       U(w) -   11(0)
                   (2                 Z         IIU(w)UU(0)




where I now denote the two parts of the SWF without the subscripts. Society

chooses a minimum wage w1 to balance the gain from avoiding having

anyone paid below the minimum against the loss in social welfare of having

some workers displaced from their jobs and their earnings reduced to zero.

          Let the distribution of productivity at the start of Period 0 be uniform

on the interval [w0 - a€j2, w0   +   a0/2]. Then any worker whose productivity

is below Wmo receives zero earnings, so that a fraction [wmo -        + a0/2]/a0

of the labor force is not working. During the period of non-work from the

start to the end of Period 0, the productivity of non-employed workers

                                          5
deteriorates at the rate o. At the end of Period 0 the wage distribution for

this segment of the population is thus shifted left by & percent.

          At the start of Period 1 the economy experiences a shock that shifts

the distribution of productivity of the remaining employed workers to:

          w — f(w) =   1/a1   <   1/a0 , wmo   <   w C w0   + a1/2.
The shock could, for examples, be a skill-using technical change, or a sudden

additional accumulation of physical capital that is q-complementary with skill.

Whatever the cause, it is exactly the kind of shock that is consistent with the

widely-noted increase in the dispersion of earnings in the United States during

the 1980s (e.g., Bound and Johnson, 1992). In the face of this shock a new

minimum wage is chosen to maximize (1). With the increase in the average

wage of those workers who remained employed after the initial policy Wmo

was   imposed, the policy that maximizes (1) after the shock becomes

      >   WgO.

          The new higher minimum causes some additional workers (those for

whom wml > w >        w) to lose their jobs. Their productivity and that of
workers whose productivity at t=0 was below wmo depreciate at a rate &

during Period 1. At the end of Period I one group of nonemployed workers

has productivity on the domain [(w0 - a02)(1- 6)2, wmo(I - 6)2], another on

the domain [wmo(l - 6), wml (1 - 6)], and employed workers have productivity

ranging from wml to w0 + a1/2.



                                        6
         At the start of Period 2 the shock that stretched the distribution of

productivity to the right disappears, and the upper bound on productivity

reverts to w0 + a0/2. The minimum wage that maximizes (1) is, however, no

longer wmo. The depreciation of the skills of those who were disemployed by

the previous minimum wage policies, Wmo and wmj, has changed the
distribution of productivity from what it was at the start of both Periods 0 and

1. Even though the wages of employed workers have not changed since the

start of Period 0, the deterioration of human capital leads to a new optimum

minimum wage policy, w, that differs from Wmo In particular, the shapes

of Z and U ensure that wml > w wmo.4 The failure of the optimal
minimum to revert to its initial value stems solely from the hysteresis that is

induced by the policy itself. Were costs of adjusting the policy instrument

added to the model only the time paths, not the equilibrium optimal policies,

would differ from those presented here.

         The difference between wmo and w is within one country. But

comparing two countries in which the distributions of wages of currently

employed workers appear identical, the discussion shows that we cannot

transfer a policy from Country 0 to Country 2 on the basis of these

distributions. Transferability is only possible if we know the entir history of

the distributions of wages in the two countries or have a complete inventory

of the skills of both populations and know how those sldlls combine to

generate output and wages. Simply pointing to identical distributions of wages

                                        7
of current labor-force members is not sufficient to justify claiming that the

policy in Country 0 is appropriate for Country 2, even with identical social

welfare functions and other current indicators.

        I have demonstrated the role of policy hysteresis in labor demand in

the context of a minimum-wage policy. The model could be applied mutatis

mutandis to its close cousin, the overtime premium. If we instead base the

assumption about the depreciation of human capital on total worker-hours, the

results follow through. The policy sequence could be a 50-percent premium

for overtime hours after H" hours per week; a shock that causes society to

change standard hours to only H' - K; and, after the shock disappears, a new

policy with standard hours part way between H' and H' - K. From an initial

equilibrium the changed policy leads employers to reduce total worker-hours

(labor-demand is at least somewhat elastic), which leads to the depreciation of

human capital as total worker-hours employed drop. This depreciation leads

to a different equilibrium after the shock disappears.

        Similar hysteresis, and similarly nontransferable policies, can arise

from workers' decisions about labor supply in models of taxes and transfers

rather than the employers' decisions that underlay the hysteresis in the

previous model. Consider a balanced-budget policy that offers all workers a

guaranteed income of T and finances it by a flat-rate tax on earnings at rate

t. I assume hours per period are the same for all workers, that each person

has the same reservation wage w'(T), w" > 0, and that the i'th person will

                                      8
remain in the work force if net earnings exceed the reservation wage, i.e., if

(1 - t)w1 > w(T). Then given the distribution of wages, w1 — f(w), society's

goal is to maximize the SWF:

(3)               SWF=            HU([l-t]w1+T) .IIU(1'),
                         i€(t-t)wwCF)         IE(I-Qw<wCI)

subject to the balanced-budget condition for taxes and transfers:

                  El' {all i} =   Etw1   {i E [l-t]w >w(T)} .
         At the start of Period 0 society chooses an optimal transfer T0 and the

tax rate t0 that is dictated by the balanced-budget requirement in the face of the

labor-force withdrawal induced by the income and substitution effects created

by this policy. The skills of the fraction of the population that is induced to

leave the labor force by the choices of T0 and      deteriorate during Period 0.

         A shock occurs at the start of Period I that alters the w(T) at a given

T, for example, an exogenous change in the number of young children at

home. This leads to a new tax/transfer policy described by the set (Ti, t1).

After the shock disappears and the function w(T) shifts back to its original

form, the change in the distribution of wages/productivity that had resulted

from the deterioration of the skills of those who left the work force leads to

 a new policy, (T2, t2), that differs from (T0, tnj. The same result would be

 produced if we assumed that the shock were, as before, a temporary change

 in the distributions of wages/productivity. Also as before, the discussion




                                          9
suggests that knowledge of wage distributions at one point in time is

insufficient to justify transferring policies between countries.

B. An Example With an Externality

         A somewhat different reason for the nontransferability of policy arises

from hysteresis in the generation of externalities. Externalities induced by the

accumulation of human capital guarantee that the optimal choice of policies

that affect human capital cannot be based simply on current conditions, and

cannot merely compare current conditions among economies. Consider an

economy where production is carried on using two types of labor, L1 and 1.2

(the capital stock is ignored). There are no births and deaths, so that:



L1 are skilled workers, who must be retrained at the start of each period.

Even though it is not directly effective in production after the period when it

is given, for N periods thereafter the training does increase efficiency. It can

thus be thought of as engineering skills that make workers more productive

immediately and that also enhance society's stock of general knowledge.

         In each period the productivity of trained workers is augmented or

reduced by a random shock 0, where:

         Pr{01 = 9}   =   Pr{01
                                  = -0} =5

Accounting for all these features, output in period t is:

(4)         = H(Li ,. •., LI,t_N)F(Ltt[l +



                                       10
where Fl denotes the effective stock of durable knowledge, and F is a two-

factor production function with the standard properties, with F1 > F2 if

L1 = L2 at the mean of 0 (0 =        O).6   For simplicity let:

                                                      N
                                                  =
                                            H1        EL1..,
                                                      ItO




        Consider a myopic training policy that maximizes Y but ignores the

N-period impact (the externalities generated by training). A farsighted policy

would maximize the discounted stream of expected output, would enhance

welfare, but would not imply anything different about the hysteresis in the

choice of policy.7 The optimal myopic policy chooses LI such that:


                                       1         F1[1 + 0,      —
                                                                    F2
                      (5)                                   F
                                      H,



The optimal policy trains the marginal worker so that the value of the training

(in terms of output) through direct production and the impact on the stock of

knowledge is equal to the reduction in output when the worker is shifted out

of the unskilled work force.

         At t+ 1 a new shock to skilled workers' productivity occurs,

leading to a new optimum for the skilled work force, L+ i. Even if
      = 0, L'•1.,.i         L'1 unless 0 = °I-N• In this simple specification the
optimal policy will change with probability .5 even if the shock remains

                                            11
unchanged.8 The optimal policy will differ at t+ 1 because the history of

productivity shocks produces a different set of externalities at time t+ 1 than

existed at t.

          Were we comparing two economies (labor markets) .1 and K at a point

in time using this simple model, the optimal training policies would differ

unless:

                   N           N
                           =

The existence of externalities that arise from training requires different training

policies in countries that appear identical in terms of the nature of production

and the recent shocks that have affected the labor market. As in the other

examples the knowledge required to transfer policies optimally exceeds what

one might have thought is needed, and far exceeds the information that is

likely to be available to the policy maker.

C. Positive Implications

          Since it deals with optimal policy, this discussion would appear to

have only normative consequences. I believe it has positive implications too.

Just as one can use price theory to study phenomena that appear to result from

alleged cultural differences (Becker and Stigler, 1977), this analysis tells us

about the conditions under which we can expect imported policies to achieve

their stated goals. In particular, it implies that an optimal policy will be

transferred with greater success: 1) The more similar have been the patterns

                                        12
of shocks to the two labor markets; and 2) The more similar their past policy

choices have been.

         The comparison obviously depends on the term "similar," which

requires specificity to be useful. In the case of shocks --- to productivity or

to the distribution of wages --- greater similarity means that the time paths of

the shocks to the two labor markets have exhibited greater cross-correlation.

If policy choices have been made optimally, nothing more needs to be

considered, since the similarity of past policies has resulted from the similarity

of past shocks. If not, past departures from optimality in the country whose

policy is exported ensure that the policy will be suboptimal in the importing

country, other things equal. Obviously, importing failed policies makes little

sense.

         The general point here is in some ways qualitatively similar to the

analysis of appropriate technology in the literature on economic development

(e.g., Pack, 1988). In that discussion factor endowments that differ across

economies imply different optimal technologies. As such, the discussion

rested on static models in which policy was exogenous. The issue here is

dynamic, though, in that the analysis demonstrates that even when two

economies appear to be currently identical one country's polio)' will be

inappropriate for the other to the extent that their histories differ. This point

is also somewhat similar to the discussion of European unemployment and the

role of hysteresis in affecting current macroeconomic outcomes (e.g.,

                                        13
Blanchard and Summers, 1986; Franz, 1987). It differs from that too, for

here the differing histories have themselves resulted from different past choices

about policies, so that today's optimal policy depends on the dynamic effects

of past policy choices.

Ill. ilours Laws: United States and the Federal Republic of Germany

         In the remainder of this study I examine weeldy hours and days of

work in the Federal Republic of Germany (BRD hereafter) and the U.S. The

different outcomes are instructive because: 1) They show how two economies

at roughly the same average wage level can have sharply different patterns of

hours and days that have changed over time in different ways; 2) They indicate

how little we know about daily and weekly work schedules at a time when

rapid changes in patterns of labor-force participation may be generating

changes in consumers' demands for retail and other firms' schedules; and 3)

They may themselves result from differences in policies between the two

countries.

         Consider first the policies that might affect the mix of hours and days.

Hours laws can be very specific (e.g., limits on weekly hours of teen-age

strawberry pickers in Oregon) or quite general (e.g., general limits on weekly

hours). For the purposes of this paper I restrict the discussion to the general

cases of limits on hours per week or per day, as in the example outlined at the

end of Section II.A. The basic law on hours in the United States has been

remarkably unchanged since the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of

                                      14
1938. Workers must be paid a 50-percent premium over their regular hourly

pay (including premiums for shift work, incentive pay, etc.) on all hours in

excess of 40 per week, though in some cases (mainly governmental sub-units)

compensatory time can be provided in lieu of overtime pay. Note that there

is no daily limit on hours beyond which the overtime premium must be applied

in the U.S.

         The situation is different in the BRD. For adults long-standing

legislation limits the regular workday to 10 hours in a workweek limited to 48

hours.9 The legislative constraint is hardly relevant, as collective and other

agreements limit the normal workday to 8 hours. Note that in the ERD there

are constraints on both daily and weekly hours.

         Any differezices in outcomes may in some ways illustrate the policy

hysteresis outlined in the previous section. In particular, they could reflect the

results of differences in the histories of policies regulating hours of work in

the two countries. The extent to which this hysteresis is responsible is not

known and is not the subject of this exploratory essay. What we do know is

that simply moving to identical policies in the two countries would not

generate outcomes that are independent of their predecessor policies.

IV. Weekly and Daily Hours in the ERD and the U.S.

         There have been numerous studies of differences in working time

among industrialized countries, including the U.S. and the BRD, and of

changes in work hours over time (e.g., Blyton, 1985; Owen, 1989). More

                                        15
technical studies have examined employers' demand for workers and hours in

the context of the formal structure of production (see Hamermesh, 1993,

Chapter 3.) There has been no formal examination of substitution by

employers among additional workers, hours per week, and hours per thy, or

by workers among additional weeks per year, hours per week, and hours per

thy. The reason is very simple: Nearly all of our labor-force surveys, the

main source of the underlying information, ask questions about weekly hours,

so that information on this third margin of choice is rarely available.

         As background I consider here the available evidence on differences

and changes in weekly and daily hours in the U.S. and the BRD. Figure 1

graphs the cumulative distribution of workers by weekly hours actually worked

in the two countries for 1970 and 1990 (1989 in the BRD). Two series are

presented for the BRD in 1989, the first the standard German data, the second

from the European Labor Force Survey in which the questions resemble those

in the American Current Population Survey more closely.10 The Figure begins

at 30 hours per week because there are only tiny differences in the
distributions below 30 hours. Several facts stand out from the Figure:

         In 1970 average weekly hours were longer in the BRD than
         in the U.S. This had reversed by 1990.

         In 1970 a greater fraction of German than of American
         workers had shod workweeks. Also, a greater fraction of
         Gennan workers had long ( 45 hour) workweeks. In 1990
         the opposite was true of both short and long workweeks.



                                      16
        Except for a slight increase in the variance of weekly hours
        there was little chage in the distribution of hours in the
        U.S. over these two decades. Changes in the BRD were
         much more substantial, with a large drop in the avenge and
         variance of weekly hours.

         This information is fairly well known to students of labor markets in

the two countries. Much less known are the data on days per week in

conjunction with weekly hours worked.

         There are no published data on the hours/days distinction for the

United States. One can, however, use the 1977 Quality of Employment

Survey to generate tabulations for the U.S. on usual weekly hours and usual

days worked per week. Respondents were asked to check each day that they

usually worked, and were asked, "The 'forty-hour week' is a very common

term.... During the average week how many hours do you work, not counting

the time you take off for meals?" I believe this question elicits information on

usual hours, but that its design reduces the concentration of responses at 40

hours per week.

          A very similar table can be created for Germany using the 1990 wave

of the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP). The data on weekly hours

are the response to the question, "How many hours on average is your actual

work time [per week] including overtime?" Days are the response to the

question, "How many days per week do you usually work?" [Author's

 translations.]



                                       17
         Tabulations from the American survey are shown in Table 1, while

the German results are in Table 2. As in the data on actual weekly hours

presented in the Figure, these data show that higher percentages of American

workers have usual workweeks of less than 35 hours, or more than 47 hours,

than do their German counterparts. The distributions of days also differ, at

least in these samples: More Americans usually work fewer than 5 days, or

more than 5 days, than do German workers. There is more dispersion in both

weekly hours and days per week in the American labor force. This difference

may be another reflection of the much discussed (and infrequently directly

demonstrated) greater flexibility of the American labor market than its

European counterparts.

         There are two quite striking and hitherto unnoticed differences in

work time between the two countries. In the U.S. salaried workers are more

likely than hourly-paid workers to be working exactly five days per week. In

the BRD the opposite is the case. There is also an interesting difference in the

length of the workweek by type of worker. In the U.S. salaried workers are

more likely to be working long weeks than are hourly-paid workers, but less

likely to be working short weeks. In Germany they are more likely to be

working long weeks or short weeks -- there is much more dispersion in their

weekly schedules, both regarding days and weekly hours. Any explanation of

these differences is obviously just speculation; but one sensible story is that the

much greater extent and strength of German (blue-collar) unionism leads to

                                        I8
much greater standardization of work schedules among hourly-paid workers

than in the U.S.

        Cross-tabulations of weekly hours and days per week from the QES

data are presented in Table 3, both in total and separately for salaried and

hourly-paid workers.1' Unsurprisingly, long workweeks in terms of hours are

associated with long workweeks in terms of days. There are, though, some

workers (2.8 percent of the total) who put in no more than 40 hours per week

but who work 6 or 7 days; and 0.4 percent of the total work more than 40

hours, but fewer than 5 days per week.

         Similar tabulations can be made (on the larger samples) from the 1990

wave of the GSOEP. These are presented in Table 4 in exactly the same

format as the tabulations for the U.S. A somewhat greater percentage (4.3

percent of the total) than in the U.S. works no more than 40 hours per week

on 6 or 7 days. This is mainly the reflection of the shorter standard workweek

in the BRD. But even workers who are obviously less than full-time constitute

about the same percentages (1.3 and 1.2 percent) of the labor force in both

countries. Not surprisingly, a smaller proportion (only 0.2 percent) of

German workers work long hours on few days than in the U.S.

         Clearly, a not insignificant fraction of both the Ameridan and the

German labor forces works highly unusual schedules, either long hours on few

days, or, more commonly relatively short hours over many days per week.

This suggests there is a substantial payoff to beginning the investigation of

                                      19
hours/days choices on both sides of the labor market. That payoff is likely to

increase as the importance of goods-producing industries, with their ability to

rely on inventories of output and their need for workers' simultaneous

presence at a location containing a large capital. stock, decreases.

         The distribution of hours and days depends, of course, on the

interactions among workers' tastes, the daily fixed costs of working that they

face, and the nature of the technology that combines days, daily hours and

workers. There is unfortunately no direct evidence on employers' and

workers' weekly schedules of days and hours. In March 1989, though, the EC

conducted surveys of employers and firms in eight countries that enable us to

compare employers' and workers' weekly schedules of hours. TableS shows

the results for the BRD. Comparing the data on operating hours (from the

employers' survey) and those on contractual hours (from the workers' survey),

it seems clear that the distribution of operating hours is shifted far to the right

of the distribution of contractual hours. This leaves substantial scope for part-

time work, for workers whose weekly schedules in the same job are

dovetailed, and for overtime work. The existence of very long operating

hours in industry (less so in retail) also demonstrates the scope for and

existence of shift work.




                                        20
V. Conclusions, and the Need for Research on the Hours/Days Distinction

        In this exploratory study I have demonstrated the difficulties attendant

on transferring policies between economies. Even if current labor-market

outcomes are identical, a policy that is optimal within one country will be

suboptimal within an otherwise identical country unless the two have long

identical histories of both policies and outcomes. While the point is not

directly testable, I have attempted to illustrate differences in outcomes under

currently similar (but not identical) laws regarding overtime.

         The genesis of the differences between German and American hours

laws and contractual restrictions is beyond the scope of this analysis, and is

realty an issue in law and economics. How the time paths of these institutional

changes have affected patterns of work-days and work-hours is, though,

appropriately analyzed using the framework I have developed here. But until

we know much more about how patterns of work-days and work-hours differ

between the two countries, we cannot answer that comparative question (or

even say very much about hours policies within a country).

         The evidence presented in Section IV is the first available on

days/hours distinction. At this point all we know is that the data, which may

not be fully comparable across the two countries, suggest there is more

dispersion in weekly hours and in days worked per week in the American than

 in the German labor force. Additional work in progress (Hamermesh, 1994)

 suggests that similar differences are present when we compare the German

                                       21
data to results from larger and more recent CPS samples, and that they can in

part be explained by differences in institutional structures and economic

incentives.

         To be useful any examination of the threefold distinction in labor

input (days, hours and workers) must be based on several countries. This is

partly because policies that affect agents' choices differ among countries, so

that without accounting for their effects any conclusions based on outcomes in

one country are not generalizable. Partly too, underlying patterns of tastes,

including those that generate differences in participation, will alter equilibrium

hours and days worked. (For example, more two-worker households in one

country create more incentives for its retailers to expand opening hours.)

These considerations dictate studying these choices in more than one economy.

         This modeling and estimation should yield several outcomes: 1)

Information on patterns of and differences in days and hours of work in the

two countries; 2) Understanding the determinants of these differences in the

context of models of employers' arid workers' choices among participation (or

number of workers), days and hours; and 3) Comparisons of the impacts of

international differences in policies and institutions that affect choices about

hours and days, and the role of policy hysteresis in generating thelime paths

of these outcomes.

1. Among the many recent examples are trans-national
comparisons of the U.S. economy and labor market to those
of Australia and Sweden (Caves and Krause, 1984; Bosworth
and Rivlin, 1987).

2. This view is embodied in the Webb? notion of a social
minimum wage (Webb and Webb, 1920) and still underlies
much of the rhetoric about this policy.

3. This deterioration is consistent with a variety of evidence
on the depreciation of unused skills, including, e.g., Mincer
and Polachek, 1974.

4. The weak inequality becomes strong at all but specific
combinations of the 6 and a1.

5. This representation of the tax/transfer policy is like that in
Fair (1971).

6. The productivity shock applies only to Type 1 labor to
minimize the notation. The results are qualitatively the same
if the shock applies instead to the productivity of Type 2 labor
or to both groups' productivity.

7. The only difference in (5) is the addition of terms in
F(L11+1, L. +) i =       1,. ..N,   in the numerator of the right-
hand side.

8. If we assume a steady rate of depreciation of the
externality rather than the one-hoss shay depreciation in the
model, the probability that H1.,.1 = H1 becomes very small.
