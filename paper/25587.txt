Investigating Treatment Effects of Participating Jointly in SNAP and WIC when the Treatment
is Validated Only for SNAP

                                         ABSTRACT

USDA operates several food assistance programs aimed at alleviating food insecurity. We study
whether participation in both SNAP and WIC alleviates food insecurity compared with
participation in SNAP alone. We bound underlying causal effects by applying nonparametric
treatment effect methods that allow for endogenous selection and underrepresented program
participation when validation data are available for one program (treatment) but not the other. We
estimate average treatment effects using data from the National Household Food Acquisition and
Purchase Survey (FoodAPS). FoodAPS includes administrative data to validate SNAP
participation. Information on local food prices allows us to construct a food expenditure-based
monotone instrumental variable that does not require a typical IV exclusion restriction. Under
relatively weak monotonicity assumptions, we identify that the impact of participating in both
programs relative to SNAP alone is strictly positive, suggesting that the programs are
nonredundant. This evidence can support improved design and targeting of food programs.

1. Introduction

A household is food secure if it has access to enough food for an active, healthy life of all of its

members; it is food insecure otherwise (NRC 2006). Substantial prevalence of food insecurity in

the low-income U.S. population is a matter of public concern, since food insecurity can be

detrimental to the health and well-being of adults and children (for a literature review, see

Gundersen, Kreider, and Pepper 2011). In fact, among households with income below 130% of

the federal poverty threshold in 2016, 35.7% experienced food insecurity (Coleman-Jensen et al.

2017a, 2017b). 1

       The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers 15 domestic food assistance

programs designed to alleviate food insecurity (Oliveira 2017). Many low-income households

are eligible for and participate in more than one program. The largest and third largest programs

by expenditures are, respectively, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

($68.1 billion spent in the fiscal year 2017, 42.2 million participants on average per month) and

Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) ($5.7 billion,

7.3 million participants). 2 These two programs are the focus of our paper.

       While both SNAP and WIC are means-tested and aim to provide resources to low-income

households for the acquisition of food, they differ in several respects (Hoynes and Schanzenbach

2015; U.S. GAO 2010). SNAP offers vouchers to eligible low-income households for the

purchase of most food items. In contrast, WIC provides benefits to qualifying individuals in low-

income households for the purchase of a restricted set of foods identified to meet the specific

nutritional needs of pregnant, post-partum, and lactating women; infants; and children less than 5

years old. WIC also provides nutrition counseling and referrals for health services. Differences in

the program design may lead to synergies between SNAP and WIC. 3 For example, WIC expands

acquisition of specific foods and may lead to increased awareness of healthy food selection and

food purchases that better meet household nutritional needs. In turn, SNAP provides a wider

choice over foods. Investigating whether either program has a positive marginal effect on food
                                                                                                    4


security given participation in the other is informative about potential programmatic

redundancies and contributes to a better understanding of the overall efficacy of the food safety

net in the United States.

       In practice, the rate of food insecurity among food program recipients is substantial. In

particular, 51.2% of households on SNAP and 40.6% on WIC were food insecure in 2016.

Moreover, the rate of food insecurity among SNAP (WIC) recipients was twice (1.4 times) that

among potentially eligible, low-income nonrecipients (Coleman-Jensen et al. 2017a). These

seemingly counterintuitive associations (especially in view of the programs’ shared objective to

reduce food insecurity) provide an additional motivation for studying SNAP and WIC effects.

       Identifying causal, rather than associative, effects of any food program is challenging

because of (i) endogenous self-selection of households into the program and (ii) pervasive

underreporting of food assistance in national surveys. In particular, unobserved personal

characteristics (e.g., expected future health status) are thought to be related to both food security

and program participation. This simultaneity precludes the use of simple regression techniques

(e.g., Ordinary Least Squares) to estimate causal effects (see Gundersen and Oliveira 2001;

Jensen 2002; Fox, Hamilton, and Lin 2004; Wilde 2007; Nord and Golla 2009). Furthermore,

households are thought to systematically underreport the receipt of food assistance (e.g.,

Bollinger and David 1997; Meyer, Mok, and Sullivan 2015a; 2015b), and the propensity to

underreport may vary across households based on their observed and unobserved characteristics.

For example, Meyer et al. (2015a) find that less than 60% of SNAP benefits are recorded in

recent waves of the Current Population Survey (CPS). Bitler, Currie, and Scholz (2003) find

evidence of “severe” underreporting of WIC benefits. Under such circumstances, all of the

classical measurement error assumptions are violated, and it becomes particularly important to

locate and use any available validation information as a means to mitigate the measurement error

problem. In turn, analyzing not just one, but two programs adds an extra layer of complexity. 4
                                                                                                         5


        In this paper, we quantify how participation in both SNAP and WIC affects a household’s

probability of being food secure compared with participation in SNAP alone. To estimate causal

treatment effects, we apply nonparametric bounding methods developed by Jensen, Kreider, and

Zhylyevskyy (2018; hereafter JKZ) to address joint program participation. The application of

JKZ’s methods to available data on household food security and partially validated food program

participation status in USDA’s National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey

(FoodAPS) (see below for details) is the present paper’s contribution to the literature.

        These methods allow us to place bounds on the causal treatment effects and account for

the dual identification problems of endogenous selection and potentially misreported program

participation status when auxiliary information is available to validate self-reported participation

in one program (e.g., SNAP) but not the other (e.g., WIC). The dual identification problems pose

an obstacle to applying standard instrumental variable (IV) techniques to quantify treatment

effects, since such techniques are known to produce inconsistent estimates when an endogenous

binary treatment variable (e.g., program participation vs. nonparticipation) is mismeasured (e.g.,

Black et al. 2000; Frazis and Loewenstein 2003; Nguimkeu et al. 2017). 5 If the self-reported

indicator of participation is measured with error, it is likely that a valid instrument for receipt is

correlated with the measurement error as well. Even in the absence of measurement error, it may

still be difficult in practice to find IVs that are both valid and strong. For example, variation in

policy instruments across states that affect food assistance participation rates may be

endogenously related to food insecurity. 6 For academic studies, the nonparametric bounding

methods may often be useful to examine whether point estimates obtained under relatively strong

assumptions (e.g., using the IV approach) at least lie within bounds calculated under weaker

assumptions. From a program evaluation standpoint, if small point estimates suggest abolishing a

program, it would be reassuring to also calculate bounds and show that they rule out effect sizes

that would make the program important.
                                                                                                  6


       The approach in JKZ generalizes methods in Kreider and Hill (2009) and Kreider et al.

(2012), which accommodate binary treatments (e.g., SNAP vs. no SNAP), to handle the case of

partially ordered multiple treatments. JKZ derive sharp bounds on average treatment effects

(ATEs) that are logically consistent with the observed data, available validation information, and

imposed statistical and behavioral assumptions on the data-generating process. This

methodology differs from the multiple-programs approaches of Fraker and Moffitt (1988), Keane

and Moffitt (1998), and Brien and Swann (2001) who model participation decisions and program

effects jointly using simultaneous equations in parametric settings. While these papers also allow

for the endogeneity of program participation status, they ignore the possibility of misreported

participation and, thus, cannot address implications of such misreporting for the estimation of

true program effects. Moreover, these papers impose strong parametric assumptions (e.g., the

joint normality of regression disturbance terms) that are relaxed in JKZ’s approach.

       We apply our previously developed methods to data from FoodAPS. Among existing

nationally representative datasets, FoodAPS is particularly well suited for the analysis as it

provides self-reported household participation in SNAP and WIC and, furthermore, contains

auxiliary administrative data to validate self-reported SNAP participation. 7 We focus only on

those households that would be eligible to participate in SNAP and WIC concurrently. Given the

eligibility restrictions associated with each of the two programs, we analyze households with

income below 130% of the poverty threshold and containing a pregnant woman, or a child aged

less than five years. 8 The analytical sample contains 460 households, 37% of whom report being

on both programs.

       Our empirical analysis starts by estimating the bounds on the ATE of participating in

SNAP and WIC jointly vs. in SNAP alone under minimal assumptions. These worst-case bounds

are wide and do not allow us to sign the ATE. We then investigate how several middle ground

assumptions can narrow the worst-case bounds by restricting relationships between the latent

food security outcomes, program participation, and observed covariates. For example, we study
                                                                                                   7


the identifying power of an assumption that, on average, the probability of a favorable food

security outcome weakly rises with more household expenditures on food at home relative to

expenditures consistent with the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) (Carlson et al. 2007). Unlike standard

instrumental variables (IVs), such monotone instrumental variables (MIVs) require no

independence assumption / exclusion restriction. The trade-off is that we are only able to bound

and not point-identify causal effects. Still, when combined with the FoodAPS data, our

assumptions are strong enough to identify substantial beneficial effects of participating in

multiple food assistance programs.

       The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and

characteristics of our analytical sample. Section 3 lays out the methodological framework,

formally defines the identification problems, and employs several new sets of closed-form

analytical formulas derived in JKZ to bound ATEs given a potentially mismeasured, partially

ordered, and partially verified treatment. Our empirical results highlight the identifying power of

successively stronger nonparametric assumptions. Section 4 concludes.


2. Data


FoodAPS

       Our main data source, FoodAPS, is a recent, nationally representative survey to collect

comprehensive information about household food purchases and acquisitions. It was co-

sponsored by ERS and FNS and conducted in the field by Mathematica Policy Research. The

survey was administered on a stratified sample of 4,826 households drawn from three population

groups: SNAP households, low-income households not participating in SNAP, and higher

income households. Households participated in FoodAPS for one seven-day week between April

2012 and January 2013.

       FoodAPS captures detailed information about purchases and acquisitions of food items

intended for consumption at home and away from home, including items acquired through
                                                                                                    8


USDA’s food assistance programs, as well as the amount and source of payment for food. The

survey also collects information about household and personal attributes, including demographic

and socioeconomic characteristics, income, receipt of SNAP benefits, confirmation of SNAP

receipt through an administrative match, and self-reported WIC receipt along with information to

determine WIC eligibility.

       Among other data reported, households filled out a 10-item food security questionnaire

(referenced to the last 30 days), which is the basis for calculating raw food security scores and

assigning households to categories of food security. Using the USDA’s 30-day adult food

security scale, “food insecure” households are those with the raw score of 3 or more. 9 Those with

scores of 0, 1, or 2 are labeled as “food secure.”

       Through its Geography Component (FoodAPS-GC), the survey provides information

about the local food environment, including the location of food retailers, measures of access to

these retailers, food prices, and food-related public policies. 10 We employ FoodAPS-GC to

construct variables that can be used as MIVs. In particular, we use local food price data to

construct measures of the cost of TFP consistent with each household’s size and composition.

The TFP measures vary with respect to the geographic level of price aggregation: county vs.

stores located within 20 miles of the household. We then construct a food expenditure MIV by

dividing reported household expenditures on food at home by the TFP cost. 11


ANALYTICAL SAMPLE

We focus on FoodAPS households that would be eligible to participate in SNAP and WIC

concurrently. Our analytical sample is comprised of 460 households with income below 130% of

the poverty threshold and containing a pregnant woman, or a child aged less than five years. All

sample statistics and estimates incorporate FoodAPS household weights. It should be noted that

SNAP participation is relatively infrequent among households with higher incomes. For

example, among FoodAPS households with income between 130% and 200% of the poverty

threshold (995 cases in the FoodAPS sample), only 11.1% are confirmed participants as implied
                                                                                                    9


by the FoodAPS variable SNAPNOWADMIN. In addition, we calculate that among all FoodAPS

households, 3.2% are confirmed participants and report income greater than 130% of poverty.

Also, among SNAP-eligible FoodAPS households, as estimated by Mathematica Policy Research

using different models, the fraction of confirmed participants reporting income greater than

130% of poverty does not exceed 4.6%.

       Table 1 provides the joint distribution of our analytical sample by self-reported, current

household participation in SNAP and WIC. 12 The table shows that joint participation in the two

programs is empirically relevant: 36.7% of the households report being on both SNAP and WIC.

Also, 16.6% are reportedly on WIC but not SNAP, and 31.4% are on SNAP but not WIC. The

remaining 15.3% indicate no participation in either program.

       To ascertain SNAP participation, FoodAPS households were asked to provide consent to

be matched to SNAP administrative records (no attempt was made to validate WIC

participation). Most households consented; in fact, in our analytical sample only 2.3% of the

households withheld consent. SNAP administrative records are drawn from two distinct sources:

state SNAP caseload files and the Anti-Fraud Locator EBT Retailer Transactions (ALERT)

database. Caseload files include data on the identity of program participants, benefit amounts,

and dates of disbursement. FoodAPS households were matched to caseload records

probabilistically, using names, addresses, and phone numbers. A household was deemed to be a

true current participant if a benefits disbursement date fell on a 32-day window before the survey

date. Unfortunately, not all states covered in FoodAPS provided usable caseload data.

       The ALERT database records transactions made using SNAP EBT cards (SNAP

participants must use such cards to access program benefits). FoodAPS households reporting

SNAP usage during the survey week were probabilistically matched to ALERT by purchase

amount and store ID. The matched card’s transaction history was examined for increases in the

amount of available benefits between adjacent transactions. An increase indicates a disbursement

on a date between corresponding transaction dates. Using ALERT, a household is considered to
                                                                                                   10


be a true current SNAP participant if the matching procedure indicated a disbursement during a

36-day window before the survey date.

        Courtemanche et al. (2018), among other researchers, point out limitations of SNAP

administrative records employed in FoodAPS, including missing data and varying degree of data

quality across states. Also, the two administrative data sources sometimes disagree, perhaps in

part due to underlying timing discrepancies. Probabilistic matching may lead to error as well.

        Since studying the quality of the data linkage is not our research objective, we do not

make a determination as to which of the two administrative sources is more accurate or whether

and how one should combine them. Instead, similar to Kang and Moffitt (2018) we rely on the

ERS’s judgment and use as an indicator of the “true” current SNAP participation the FoodAPS

variable SNAPNOWHH. This variable was constructed by the ERS by combining all available

information, including administrative matches and self-reported data. Notably, when one

administrative source “confirms” participation but the other “confirms” nonparticipation,

SNAPNOWHH records SNAP status to be true participation. Also, when neither a caseload-, nor

an ALERT-based match is available, SNAPNOWHH resorts to using self-reported SNAP status.

In our analytical sample, the SNAP status of 60.2% (weighted) of the households comes from

administrative data. In the remaining 39.8% of the cases (“non-matches”), it is based on self-

reported participation. While SNAPNOWHH may still contain some measurement error, we

believe it is quite small.

        Table 2 is similar to Table 1, except that the SNAP participation indicator is now based

on SNAPNOWHH. WIC participation is still self-reported (and unverified). Compared to the

distribution in Table 1, the incorporation of administrative data about SNAP receipt leads to an

increase in the overall prevalence of SNAP participation by 5.2 percentage points. More

specifically, the prevalence of households on SNAP but not on WIC increases by 2.2 percentage

points (from 31.4% to 33.6%), while the prevalence of households on both SNAP and WIC rises

by 3 percentage points (from 36.7% to 39.7%).
                                                                                                 11


       Table 3 provides the prevalence of food security in each of four subsamples defined

according to self-reported household participation in SNAP and WIC. The rate of food security

exceeds 50% throughout, but somewhat varies across the subsamples. (The rate of food security

in the analytical sample overall is 55.0%.) Given no WIC receipt, self-reported SNAP

participation is associated with a decrease in the prevalence of food security from 53.2% to

52.2%, which is in line with a negative association between food security and SNAP found in the

literature (see Gundersen et al. 2011). When WIC is in place, however, SNAP is associated with

an increase in the food security rate from 54.5% to 58.5%. Perhaps the process of selecting into

SNAP differs depending on whether the household participates in WIC, or perhaps there are

synergies between the two programs in promoting food security. Also, the table shows that WIC

participation is always associated with more food security given a self-reported SNAP status.

       Table 4, which replaces the self-reported SNAP participation indicator with the

administratively matched one, likewise shows food security rates in excess of 50% and varying a

bit across the four subsamples. With one exception, the table indicates similar associations

between the participation indicators and food security to those implied by Table 3. The only

exception is that given no SNAP receipt, self-reported WIC participation is now associated with

less (rather than more) food security.

       Table 5 provides descriptive statistics for selected characteristics of the sample. On

average, the households contain 4.5 members (of all ages), 2.3 children (aged < 18 years), and

1.6 young children (aged 0–6 years). Average monthly household income is about $1,600,

income-to-poverty ratio is 0.75, and weekly expenditures on food at home are about $113.

Twenty-one percent of the households live in rural areas, 78% rent their residence, and 11% have

used a food pantry in the past 30 days. Primary respondents in these households are

predominantly female (88%) and just under 34 years old on average. Thirty-three percent are

Hispanic, 55% are White, 29% are Black or African American. In the sample, 32% have no high

school degree and 35% have some college education or have received a bachelor’s degree. Also,
                                                                                                12


44% are single and 29% are married; 43% are employed, 17% are looking for work, and 40% are

not working.


ANALYSIS OF PROGRAM PARTICIPATION CHOICES

       While determinants of program participation are not the focus of this paper, we perform

additional analyses to better understand why some households pick only one program when

eligible for both and why some choose SNAP only while others select WIC only. We summarize

the findings below and relegate tables with numerical results to Appendix A.

       First, we partition the analytical sample into four subsamples according to participation in

SNAP and WIC and calculate subsample descriptive statistics (Table A1). Qualitatively,

households in the WIC-only subsample tend to be larger and have higher income-to-poverty

ratios, whereas households in the SNAP-only subsample are smaller and poorer. Also, WIC-only

(SNAP-only) primary respondents are more (less) likely to be Hispanic, less (more) likely to be

Black or African American, and more (less) likely to be married. The subsamples also differ

somewhat with respect to the educational attainment and labor force participation of the primary

respondent. However, notable differences overall are few and far between.

       Second, to investigate the extent to which socioeconomic characteristics can help explain

program participation patterns, we estimate several probit models (Tables A2A and A2B).

(Explanatory variables correspond to characteristics in Tables 5 and A1.) Since not every

variable is exogenous, the results need not reflect causal relationships.

       The estimates suggest that households with higher income-to-poverty and those

containing a primary respondent with a GED are relatively more likely to pick one program

(either SNAP only, or WIC only) over both programs jointly. SNAP only is relatively more

likely to be selected over WIC only when the primary respondent is older, has some college

education, and is looking for work; and less likely to be chosen when the household has a lower

income-to-poverty ratio, includes more adults, and contains a primary respondent who is

married, Hispanic, of other race, and has an associate’s degree. When considering participation
                                                                                                    13


in a particular program at a time vs. one of three alternative participation patterns (see Tables

A2A and A2B), we find that SNAP only is relatively more likely to be picked when the primary

respondent has a GED or some college education and is older and single. In turn, WIC only is

relatively more likely to be selected by households with higher income to poverty ratio and those

with a younger, Hispanic, and married primary respondent. However, most of these findings are

statistically significant only at the 10% level.

       Overall, given the paucity of statistically strong estimates and limited explanatory power

of the probit models in general (pseudo-R2 values are modest), program participation patterns in

the analytical sample seem to be driven largely by factors other than the included socioeconomic

variables.


3. Methodology and results

GENERAL FRAMEWORK

       Applying the methods developed in JKZ, let the outcome Y = 1 indicate that a household

is food secure, with Y = 0 otherwise. Let S ∗ be an unobserved indicator of true program

participation where S ∗ = 0 denotes no participation in SNAP or WIC, S ∗ = 1 denotes participation

in SNAP alone, S ∗ = 2 denotes participation in WIC alone, and S ∗ = 3 denotes participation in

both SNAP and WIC. This treatment variable is partially ordered: S ∗ = 1 or 2 denotes some

participation in food assistance programs, while S ∗ = 0 does not, and S ∗ = 3 involves more

participation. (Since S ∗ = 1 and S ∗ = 2 represent different programs, these two treatments are not

ordered.)

       Instead of observing S* in the data, we observe its counterpart, S, which is comprised of

the household’s true SNAP participation status (based on the variable SNAPNOWHH) and self-

reported WIC participation. Even though SNAP participation status has been verified, the value

of S cannot tell us the exact value of S*. In particular, when S = 0 or S = 2, we can only conclude

that S* ∈ {0, 2}; and when S = 1 or S = 3, S* ∈ {1, 3}.
                                                                                                            14


        Using a potential outcomes framework, ATEs associated with participating in both food

assistance programs versus a single program, or compared with no participation are defined as

follows:

            ATE jk = P[Y ( S ∗ = j ) =                        1| X ] for j , k ∈ {0,1, 2,3} , j ≠ k
                                     1| X ] − P[Y ( S ∗ = k ) =                                       (1)

where Y ( S ∗ ) indicates the (latent) potential food security outcome under treatment S ∗, X denotes

any covariates of interest, and P denotes the probability of an outcome. Because there are no

regression orthogonality conditions to be satisfied in this framework, there is no need to include

covariates as a means of avoiding omitted variable bias. Instead, covariates here serve to define

the subpopulation of interest. 13 Later, we also show how one could use some covariates as MIVs

to tighten the ATE bounds. To simplify notation, we suppress the conditioning on X and write

P[Y ( S ∗ = j ) = 1] more compactly as P[Y ( j ) = 1].
        In this application, we are interested in the case of j = 3 vs. k = 1. Specifically,

=
ATE31 P=
       [Y (3) 1] − P[Y (1) =
                           1] measures how the prevalence of food security would change if

all eligible households participated in both SNAP and WIC rather than in SNAP alone. 14 One

cannot identify ATE31 without additional assumptions, even if S is accurately reported, because

the potential outcome Y ( S ∗ = 3) is observed only for households that chose to participate in both

SNAP and WIC, while Y ( S ∗ = 1) is observed only for households that chose to participate in

SNAP alone. The decomposition P[Y (3)= 1]= P[Y (3)= 1| S *= 3]P( S *= 3)

+ P[Y (3) =1| S * ≠ 3]P( S * ≠ 3) highlights the selection problem: the term P[Y=
                                                                                (3) 1| S * ≠ 3]
represents an unobserved counterfactual outcome, namely, the likelihood of food security when

participating in SNAP and WIC jointly among households that actually chose not to be on both

programs.

        As a further identification problem, households are thought to systematically underreport

program participation in national surveys, and such underreporting may be related to personal

characteristics (including the food security outcome itself). Allowing S to deviate from S *, let

          Without further assumptions, propositions in JKZ can be used to show that the marginal

impact on food security associated with participating in both SNAP and WIC, compared with

participating in SNAP alone, is bounded as follows:

or negative. Terms like P (=   S 3) are observed from the data, but the {θ } components are
                           Y 1,=

unobserved. Thus, the ATE bounds in Equation (2) are not yet operational.

          In our FoodAPS sample, we have P (Y= 1, S= 3)= 0.238, P (Y= 0, S= 1)= 0.159,

 P (Y= 0, S= 3)= 0.165, and P (Y= 1, S= 1)= 0.172. Thus, in our application, the bounds in

Equation (2) become


                                        −0.603 + Θ3,1

If participation in SNAP and WIC were accurately measured in the first place or if we could

validate participation in both programs so that the true joint program participation status would

be known to us, then setting Θ3,1

                                  and ΘUB
                                       3,1 equal to zero would reduce the bounds in Equation (2)


to Manski’s (1995) classic worst-case ATE bounds: [−0.603, 0.663].15 While obviously very
                                                                                                     16


wide, it is instructive to recognize that the data alone (if accurately measured) constrain the

possible range of ATE3,1 to improve on the range [-1,1]. Since P (=
                                                                  Y 1,=
                                                                      S 3) in Equation (2) is

greater than zero, we know that not all households participating in both SNAP and WIC are food

insecure. Also, since P=
                       (Y 0,=
                            S 1) is greater than zero, we know that participating in both

programs does not cause all households to become food secure; some were already food secure

while participating in SNAP alone. These positive probabilities raise the lower bound above -1.

Similar logic ensures that the upper bound is less than 1 (again, when SNAP and WIC

participation are accurately measured).

        In the context of food assistance programs, however, participation is thought to be

underreported. Still, the error rates Θ3,1      3,1 are logically bounded. For example, θ1
                                           and ΘUB
                                       LB                                                 −1,1



cannot exceed P (Y = 1, S ≠ 1) = 0.378, another quantity directly observed in the data. Without

knowledge about the nature and degree of reporting errors, however, nothing prevents the worst

case bounds in Equation (2) from expanding to [−1, 1], in which case they are completely

uninformative. For the upper bound, for example, θ 03,−3 could be as large as P=
                                                                               (Y 0,=
                                                                                    S 3)

= 0.165, while θ11,−1 could be as large as P (Y= 1, S= 1)= 0.172. Since θ 0−3,3 and θ1−1,1 could both be

0, the upper bound in Equation (2) attains 1. Analogously, the lower bound attains -1.


PARTIAL VALIDATION DATA IN FoodAPS

        Partial validation data in FoodAPS allow us to place informative restrictions on the

magnitudes of Θ3,1
               LB
                   and ΘUB
                        3,1 . Knowledge of whether or not a household truly participates in


SNAP is not enough to pinpoint the value of S *, which represents the true joint participation

status. In particular, confirmation of participation in SNAP merely identifies that S * ∈ {1,3}; that

is, the household might be participating in SNAP alone or in both SNAP and WIC. Similarly,

confirmation of nonparticipation in SNAP merely identifies that S * ∈ {0, 2}; the household may

have been participating in neither program or in WIC alone.

            Still, confirmation of SNAP participation status – and modifying the observed treatment

  indicator S accordingly to align with known values – allows us to eliminate many of the error

  components of Θ3,1      3,1 . Specifically, Θ3,1 ≡ (θ1 + θ1 + θ1 ) − (θ1 + θ1 + θ1 )

            Using the FoodAPS validation data, the average treatment effect bounds in Equation (2)

  Note that the error components θ11,3 − θ13,1 + θ 03,1 − θ 01,3 shift the lower and upper bound by the same

  unknown constant. In our application,

  Equation (3) are still uninformative: the ATE may still lie anywhere between -1 and 1. Thus, on

  its own, the validation of SNAP participation does not produce informative bounds here. To see

  this more clearly, it is instructive to closely examine the bounds in Equation (3). Under no
                                                                                                   18


classification error, the lower bound is elevated above -1 because some fraction of households

P (Y= 1, S= 3)= 0.238 are known to be food secure while participating in both SNAP and WIC,

while another fraction P (Y= 0, S= 1)= 0.159 are known to be food insecure while participating

in SNAP alone. The presence of these groups reveals that, at least sometimes, participation in

both programs is not harmful relative to participation in SNAP alone. Similarly, the upper bound

cannot attain 1 when some fraction of households P(Y= 0, S= 3)= 0.165 are known to be food

insecure despite participating in both programs, and some from fraction P(Y= 1, S= 1)= 0.172

are food secure despite participating only in SNAP. Thus, at least sometimes, participation in

both programs is not beneficial compared with participation in SNAP alone.

       In the presence of classification error, the difficulty is that θ=
                                                                        1

could be as large as P (Y= 0, S= 1)= 0.159. Without further assumptions to constrain the patterns

or degrees of misclassification, logically we cannot rule out the possibility that food secure

households claiming to participate in both programs were actually participating only in SNAP.

We also cannot rule out the possibility that food insecure households claiming to participate in

SNAP alone were actually participating in both programs. Setting the other error components to

zero as a worst case, the lower bound falls to -1, becoming uninformative. Similarly, the upper

bound rises to 1. While these scenarios are extreme, they help crystalize how data must be

combined with assumptions before we can make logical, informative inferences.

       FoodAPS currently does not contain information that can be used to validate WIC

participation status. 17 Thus, we cannot further constrain the four remaining error components in

Θ3,1
 LB
     and ΘUB
          3,1 using data alone. To learn anything about ATE3,1 , we need to impose additional


assumptions, such as those about the magnitudes or patterns of reporting errors. We aim to strike

a balance between making assumptions that are weak enough to be credible but strong enough to

be informative.
                                                                                                  19


NO FALSE POSITIVES

We can make further progress in bounding ATE3,1 by imposing a “no false positives” assumption

on self-reported WIC participation (recall that the administratively “corrected” SNAP

participation measure is already presumed to be accurate). Such an assumption is common in the

food assistance literature (e.g., Almada et al. 2016; Kreider, Pepper, Gundersen, and Joliffe

2012, referenced below as KPGJ) and presumes that households reporting program participation

are, in fact, true participants. In other words, we assume that P(true non-participation | reported

participation) = 0. Validation data from previous studies find only rare instances of these errors

of commission (e.g., Bollinger and David 1997; Marquis and Moore 1990). Recent papers using

FoodAPS disagree somewhat as to the magnitude of the false positive rate in the case of self-

reported SNAP participation. According to Courtemanche et al. (2018, Tables 4 and 5), the false

positive rate ranges from 4.53% to 12.17%, depending on the sample and the approach to

combining the two administrative data sources. In contrast, estimates presented by Kang and

Moffitt (2018) imply a false positive rate of less than 1%, and Meyer and Mittag (2018, Table 1)

report a rate of 1.2%. In turn, we calculate that among FoodAPS households with

administratively confirmed SNAP participation or confirmed non-participation, only 1.8% of

those reporting SNAP benefits are found not to be currently receiving them. The no false

positives assumption, as specified, implies that no household simultaneously reports participation

in a program and does not actually participate in it, which allows us to set θ=
                                                                              3,1
                                                                              0   θ=
                                                                                   1
                                                                                    3,1
                                                                                        0 in

Equation (3), and also that all misreporting of program participation comes in the form of

underreporting. 18

       Thus, under the no false positives assumption, the ATE bounds in Equation (3) shrink

further and become informative:

Note that the error components θ11,3 − θ 01,3 shift the lower and upper bound by the same unknown

constant. Taking worst cases across θ11,3 and θ 01,3 in Equation (4), JKZ show that ATE3,1 is sharply

bounded as

       These worst-case bounds are presented in Panel A (no additional assumptions) of Table

6. The bounds are very wide, with the width of 2 − P(Y =0, S =3) − P (Y =
                                                                        1, S =3). In our
           WC
sample, ATE3,1 may lie anywhere in the range [−0.762, 0.835] with a width of 1.60. We have

made important progress, however, in moving away from the [-1, 1] uninformative bounds.

Specifically, a fraction of households P (Y= 1, S= 3)= 0.238 are food secure while claiming to

participate in both programs, thus raising the lower bound away from -1. We trust their

participation responses under the no false positives assumption. Similarly, a fraction of

households P(Y= 0, S= 3)= 0.165 are food insecure despite participating in both programs,

lowering the upper bound away from 1. While it may not be immediately obvious, we should

note that households who report no program participation (S = 0) or participation in WIC only

(S = 2) are relevant for the identification of the worst-case bounds. The probability terms in

Equation (4) are defined with respect to the population of households reporting any of the four

possible program participation patterns (S = 0, 1, 2, or 3). If we had excluded households

reporting S = 0 and S = 2 from the analytical sample, we would only be able to identify

conditional probabilities of the form P(∙|S = 1 or 3), rather than the probabilities that we need. A

similar argument applies to all other bounds discussed in this paper.

        To gain an understanding of how underreporting affects uncertainty about ATE3,1 beyond

uncertainty due to unknown counterfactuals, we trace out the bounds in Equation (4) as a

function of P (=
               S * 3=
                    | Y 0,=

                                                    WC
map. The blue surface depicts the lower bound on ATE3,1 , while the yellow surface depicts the

upper bound. The planes are parallel in this case given the structure of the worst-case bounds in

Equation (4). The small red circles identify the bounds in the reference case of no classification

error, with the dashed vertical red line spanning the range of these bounds. The worst-case lower

bound in Equation (5) is attained at the bottom right corner of the blue surface, where

P( S *= 3 | Y= 0, S= 1)= 1 and P( S *= 3 | Y= 1, S= 1)= 0. The worst-case upper bound is attained

at the top left corner of the yellow surface, where P ( S *= 3 | Y= 0, S= 1)= 0 and

P( S *= 3 | Y= 1, S= 1)= 1. We will return to this figure when discussing an additional
nondifferential errors assumption and its associated 45° solid blue lines.

        One way to narrow the bounds in Panel A is to further restrict the nature of classification

errors. Suppose, for example, that underreporting of SNAP or WIC participation arises

independently of the household’s food security status. This nondifferential errors assumption

specifies that

                         P(=
                           S * j=
                                | S k=
                                     ,Y =
                                        1) P(=
                                             S * j=
                                                  | S k=
                                                       , Y 0).                                      (6)

        Evidence from FoodAPS suggests that food secure and food insecure households are

about equally likely to underreport the receipt of food assistance. 19 In this case, we can write

θ 01,3 = κθ11,3 in Equation (4), where κ ≡ P(Y =0, S =1) / P(Y =1, S =1) is observed in the data:

                        −1 + P(Y =
                                 1, S =
                                      3) + P(Y =    1) (1 − κ )θ11,3
                                               0, S =+

                                               ≤ ATE3,1 ≤                                           (7)

                          1 − P(Y =0, S =3) − P(Y= 1, S= 1) + (1 − κ )θ11,3 .


This assumption has substantial identifying power in our application, especially when κ is close

to 1. In fact, when κ = 1, which implies that half of the households reporting participation in
                                                                                                      22


SNAP alone are food secure, with the other half being food insecure, classification error ceases

to be an issue. In that case, the worst-case bounds in Equation (7) reduce to Manski’s (1995)

classic worst-case bounds in Section 3.1. Otherwise, the bounds under the nondifferential errors

assumption reduce to the bounds shown in Panel B of Table 6:


                   −1 + P(Y= 1, S= 3) + min { P(Y= 0, S= 1), P(Y= 1, S= 1)}

                                               ≤ ATE3,1

                                                        ≤                                     (7')

                     1 − P(Y =0, S =3) − min { P(Y =
                                                   0, S =1), P(Y =1, S =1)} .


       Notice the similarity between these bounds and Manski’s worst-case bounds in Equation

(2) under no measurement error (Θ3,1
                                 LB

                                       3,1 =0). When κ = 1, the bounds are identical: SNAP

verification combined with no false positives and nondifferential errors is equivalent to no

measurement error at all. When κ > 1 such that more than half of the households reporting

participation in SNAP alone are food insecure, the Table 6 Panel B upper bound is identical to

Manski’s no-errors upper bound. When κ < 1 such that more than half of the households

reporting participation in SNAP alone are food secure, the Panel B lower bound is identical to

Manski’s no-errors lower bound.

B bounds become

                                          1, S =3) + P(Y =0, S =

The worst-case bounds narrow from [−0.762,0.835] to [−0.603, 0.676] with a width of 1.28, a 32

percentage point reduction in the width. The lower bound of -0.603 is identical to Manski’s

lower bound (which presumes accurate reporting). Returning to Figure 1, the worst-case bounds

shrink as they become restricted to lie on the solid blue lines. These 45° lines impose the
                                                                                                    23


Equation (6) constraint that the true fraction of households participating in both SNAP and WIC

among those reporting participation in SNAP alone, P=
                                                    ( S * 3=
                                                           | S * 1), does not vary by food
security status, Y. In particular, the lowest feasible value of ATE3,1 is no longer at the bottom

right corner of the blue plane, and the highest feasible value is no longer at the top left corner of

the yellow plane.

       Another way to restrict the nature of classification errors in an attempt to narrow the

bounds is to assume, for example, that among households who actually participate in both

programs, those who truthfully report the receipt of SNAP benefits do not underreport WIC

participation. We defer a comprehensive exploration of such an assumption to future research.

       As a polar case, Panel C of Table 6 and Figure 2A highlight the identifying power of an

exogenous selection assumption that, on average, potential outcomes do not depend on the

realized treatment:


                                P[Y ( j )= 1]= P[Y ( j )= 1| S *= k ] ∀j , k .                (8)


This assumption would make sense if households were randomly assigned to food assistance

programs such that there were no systematic differences in household attributes across treatment

groups. In this case, the lower and upper bound planes coincide. In the absence of classification

error, the bounds collapse to a point, 0.0384, depicted by the small red circle. The closed-form

bounds across all values of the error components are provided in Panel C of Table 6. In our

application, the worst-case bounds narrow from [−0.762, 0.835] to [−0.576, 0.713] under

exogenous selection. Even though the exogeneity assumption eliminates uncertainty associated

with unknown counterfactuals, the bounds remain very wide due to potential measurement error

in WIC participation status.

       Now consider exogenous selection with nondifferential errors (Panel D of Table 6).

Figure 2B shows how the exogenous selection bounds in our application become further

constrained under the additional nondifferential errors assumption reflected by the 45° solid blue
                                                                                                      24


line. As above, this constraint imposes the restriction that P=
                                                              ( S * 3=
                                                                     | S * 1) does not vary with
food security status, Y. The added horizontal zero plane helps to see that the ATE is strictly

positive across all values of the error components. Using the closed-form bounds in Panel D of

Table 6, the average treatment effect is isolated to lie in the narrow range [0.0384, 0.0701] with

width 0.0316, nearly point-identifying the parameter. This upper bound is computed as

P (Y =1| S = 3) − P (Y =1| S =1) = 0.0701, the observed difference in food security rates between

households reporting participation in both programs vs. those reporting participation in SNAP

alone. 20


MONOTONICITY ASSUMPTIONS

        Because households choose to participate in food programs on their own accord,

exogenous selection, while an important reference case, is an untenable assumption in our

setting. Therefore, we do not impose this independence assumption in the remainder of the

analysis. Instead, we study how the Table 6 Panel A and B worst-case bounds can be narrowed

under relatively weak monotonicity restrictions such as Monotone Treatment Selection (Manski

and Pepper 2000; KPGJ) and Monotone Treatment Response (Manski 1997; KPGJ). The MTS

assumption formalizes the notion that unobserved factors related to food insecurity are likely to

be positively associated with the decision to take up food assistance. Under the MTR

assumption, participating in SNAP and WIC would not harm food security, on average,

conditional on treatment. We emphasize that both the MTS and MTR assumptions are not

specified at the individual respondent level, but rather at the level of respondent groups defined

as described in detail below. Simply put, these assumptions hold only “on average.”

        Formally, MTS in our partially-ordered treatment framework is specified as:

            P[Y ( j ) =
                      1| S* =
                            3] ≤ P[Y ( j ) =
                                           1| S* =k ] ≤ P[Y ( j ) =
                                                                  1| S* =
                                                                        0] ∀ j and k =
                                                                                     1, 2.         (9)

For each potential treatment j, we posit that the latent food security probability is (weakly) less

favorable among households that enrolled in both programs ( S * = 3) compared with only one
                                                                                                          25


program ( S * = 1 or 2), and similarly less favorable among households that enrolled in one

program compared with no program ( S * = 0). We impose no ordering between households that

enroll in only one program versus the other. The MTS assumption does not imply that any

households would be better off changing their participation status—only that those who chose to

participate in more programs start out relatively disadvantaged, on average, under any potential

treatment. We acknowledge that this relatively modest assumption could fail in some

circumstances. For example, in the case of respondents with significant mental health problems

or the homeless, true non-participation need not indicate unobservables that favor food security.

In fact, such unobservables (e.g., inability to manage one’s life affairs) may be the cause of

nonparticipation and also detrimental to food security. If such cases comprise a substantial

fraction of the true non-participant subsample (S* = 0), the second inequality in Equation (9)

need not hold. Thus, if conditioning variables (X) were specified so that an analytical sample

excluded extremely disadvantaged respondents, the MTS assumption may be easier to justify.

        Returning to Table 6, the MTS lower bound is given by (see Panel E)

                                              P (=
                                                 Y 1,=S 3)
                                  −1 +                           ≤ ATE3,1
                                                                      MTS

                                         P( S =3) + P(Y =0, S =
                                                              1)

with the upper bound unchanged compared with the worst-case upper bound provided in Panel

A. Using the FoodAPS data, the worst-case bounds shrink from [−0.762, 0.835] to

[−0.576, 0.835]. The lower bound is improved further by combining MTS with the

nondifferential errors assumption as shown in Panel F:


                             P(Y =1, S =3) + P(Y =1, S =1) 
  −1 + max  P(Y = 1| S = 3),                                + P (Y = 0 | S = 1) [ P ( S = 3) + P ( S = 1) ]
                                  P (Y =3) + P (Y =
                                                   1)       

                                                 ≤ ATE3,1
                                                      MTS
                                                          .

In our application, the improvement is dramatic. In particular, the Panel E bounds narrow from

[−0.576, 0.835] to [−0.058, 0.676] in Panel F. The lower bound is improved 70 percentage points
                                                                                                     26


compared with the Frame B worst-case lower bound, and it is improved 54 percentage points

compared with Manski’s no-errors worst-case lower bound. Figures 3A and 3B reveal how the

MTS bounds and the MTS bounds with nondifferential errors, respectively, vary with the values

of P (=
      S * 3=
           | Y 0,=
                 S 1) and P( =
                             S * 3 |=
                                    Y 1,=
                                        S 1).
       To formally specify the MTR assumption, JKZ modify Manski’s (1995, 1997) original

approach. For a given realized program participation status, we suppose that potential

participation in SNAP alone or WIC alone would not harm a household’s food security on

average compared with no participation, nor would participation in both programs be detrimental

on average compared with participation in either program alone:


                       P[Y (3) =1| S * ] ≥ P[Y (1) =1| S * ] ≥ P[Y (0) =1| S * ]

                       P[Y (3) =1| S * ] ≥ P[Y (2) =1| S * ] ≥ P[Y (0) =1| S * ].                 (10)


In isolation, this assumption is uninformative, since it precludes strictly negative effects by

construction. It can have useful identifying power, however, when combined with the

instrumental variable assumptions described next. In particular, it assures that the effect is

nonnegative across all values of the instrument. It is difficult to imagine that participation in

more food assistance programs would itself cause more food insecurity, at least on average

(Currie, 2003).

       We can further narrow the bounds by employing MIVs. Monotone instruments are often

easier to motivate than standard IVs because they do not require any orthogonality/exclusion

restrictions. In our application, we merely require that the instrument leads to a weakly improved

latent food security outcome, on average, conditional on the treatment. As MIVs, we use

variables reflective of important aspects of local food environment, as recorded in FoodAPS-

GC. 21 In particular, we employ the ratio of actual household expenditures on food at home to

food expenditures consistent with the TFP recommendations and local food prices—the food

expenditure MIV; for details, see Section 2.1. 22 We also investigate the usefulness of a
                                                                                                              27


conventional income-to-poverty MIV based on household income and composition considered in

KPGJ. An assumption underlying these monotone instruments is that, broadly speaking, more

resources in the household and access to cheaper food cannot harm food security. Unlike a

standard IV, there is no exclusion restriction that the monotone instrument can affect food

security only through its effect on program participation. The MTS assumption described above

is a special case of the MIV assumption in which the treatment S * itself is the instrument.

       Let u represent a monotone instrument. The MIV assumption specifies that higher values

of u lead to weakly improved food security outcomes, on average, under each treatment:

       u1 ≤ u ≤ u2 ⇒ P[Y ( j ) = 1| v = u1 ] ≤ P[Y ( j ) = 1| v = u ] ≤ P[Y ( j ) = 1| v = u2 ] for each j.

It should be noted that the MIV assumption is not specified at the level of an individual or as a

comparison of individual respondents. Rather, it pertains to a comparison of incidences of food

security across respondent groups defined by the value of v. While the conditional probabilities

above are not identified, they can be bounded as described by Manski and Pepper (2000).

Bounds on the unconditional latent probability, P[Y ( j ) = 1], can, in turn, be obtained by applying

the law of total probability and calculating a weighted average of the bounds on

P[Y ( j ) = 1| v = u ] over different values of u. 23 When combined with MTS or MTR, those

restrictions are assumed to apply at each value of the instrument, v. In general, using some

covariates as MIVs may (but is not guaranteed to) tighten the ATE bounds. In a somewhat

similar manner, Firpo and Ridder (2008) note that averaging bounds obtained from conditional

(on covariates) outcome distributions may produce more informative bounds than those obtained

from unconditional outcome distributions. We note that the MIV assumption could fail in

principle if, compared to groups with low values of v, groups with higher values have attributes

that are detrimental to food security. For instance, households less prone to be food secure may

choose to reside in places with low food prices, or neighborhoods with low food prices may have

few food stores. The former is unlikely to be the case: a recent analysis by Ver Ploeg and Wilde

(2018) suggests no systematic sorting of households by food security outcomes across local food
                                                                                                      28


environments. The latter goes against basic economic intuition: low food prices are likely a

reflection of an intense competition in the local food retail industry and, thus, also likely to be

associated with more food stores.

       Table 7 demonstrates the identifying power of combinations of the MTS, MTR, MIV,

and nondifferential errors assumptions when SNAP participation status is known (through

administrative data) and WIC participation may be underreported. Point estimates of the bounds

are provided along with Imbens-Manski (2004) confidence intervals (CI) that cover the true

value of the ATE with 95% probability. Strictly positive estimated average treatment effects are

highlighted in bold. The key finding is that we can identify the ATE as strictly positive and

statistically significant when combining the MTS, MTR, expenditure MIV, and measurement

error assumptions. In particular, the lower bound on the effect of SNAP and WIC compared to

SNAP alone on the food security rate among households in our analytical sample is estimated to

be 24 percentage points (without accounting for sampling variability). Accounting for sampling

variability reflected in the confidence interval, food security would rise by at least 1.9 percentage

points (see the bottom right cell in Panel A of Table 7).

       The large difference between the point estimate of the lower bound and the confidence

interval lower bound reflects our relatively small sample size of 460 households. A larger sample

size would not necessarily shrink the width of the estimated bounds on the average treatment

effect since the point estimates of the bounds are consistently estimated. However, these bounds

would be more precisely estimated. In our setting, the availability of carefully constructed SNAP

validation data outweighs our concern about a relatively small sample size.


ESTIMATES ON ALTERNATIVE SAMPLES

         To assess the degree of sensitivity of our results to potentially mismeasured food

program participation eligibility, we constructed two alternative samples and reestimated the

ATE bounds on them. Alternative sample 1 (N = 342) drops from our main analytical sample

households that reside in broad based categorical eligibility (BBCE) states and have income-to-
                                                                                                   29


poverty ratio of 1 or higher. Alternative sample 2 (N = 429) drops from our main analytical

sample households residing in two states covered by FoodAPS that have been found by

Mathematica Policy Research to have high fractions of households that might become ineligible

for SNAP if the state stopped using the BBCE rules. Thus, compared to the main analytical

sample, these alternative samples impose more restrictions in terms of who is considered

potentially eligible for joint program participation.

       Tables B1 and B2 in Appendix B provide descriptive statistics for alternative samples 1

and 2, respectively. Expectedly, households in alternative sample 1 are somewhat poorer on

average than those in alternative sample 2 as well as those in the main analytical sample (see

Table 5). Otherwise, descriptive statistics do not seem to differ by much across the three

samples.

       Tables 8 and 9 present bounds estimated on alternative samples 1 and 2, respectively (the

layout of these tables follows that of Table 7). We find the estimates on the alternative samples

to be very similar to those obtained on the main analytical sample. While there are some

numerical differences throughout, they tend to be small. For example, when using the income-to-

poverty MIV, bounds estimated on alternative sample 1 are wider than those obtained on the

other two samples and no estimate is statistically significant, whereas bounds estimated on

alternative sample 2 are narrower compared to those on the main analytical sample and some

become statistically significant.

       When combining the food expenditure MIV assumption with the MTS, MTR, and

nondifferential errors assumptions, we find qualitatively the same results across all three

samples. In particular, the lower bound on the ATE of interest is estimated to be 28 percentage

points on alternative sample 1 and 21 percentage point on alternative sample 2 (for comparison,

it is 24 percentage points on the main analytical sample). As before, however, sampling

variability matters: the effect could be as little as 5 percentage points on alternative sample 1 and

is not statistically significant on alternative sample 2 (at the 95 percent significance level).

4. Conclusion

Low-income households in the United States often receive benefits from more than one food

assistance program administered by USDA, which raises the question of whether these programs

could have meaningful synergies or might be redundant. We investigate the issue by focusing on

two popular programs, SNAP and WIC, and apply a novel nonparametric bounding methodology

to simultaneously handle a multinomial partially ordered treatment, endogenous household

selection into assistance programs, and misreported program participation. The literature has

shown that even small amounts of misreporting in surveys can lead to substantial identification

decay of treatment effect parameters of interest (e.g., Kreider 2010; Millimet 2011). This paper

traces out how the availability of validation data, even for only one of the potential treatments,

has the potential to substantially sharpen what can be known about the causal effects of multiple

program participation. Gaining a better understanding of the conditions under which validation

data are particularly valuable may help guide decisions regarding which programs to validate in

the future.

        We draw on a unique aspect of FoodAPS in that it provides auxiliary administrative data

on SNAP participation, which allows us to partially validate the treatment variable. Under

endogenous household selection into the programs, Manski’s (1995) classical treatment effect

bounds are wide and contain zero, which makes it impossible to sign the causal effects. The

bounds become even wider in our environment of systematically underreported program

participation. However, similar to Kreider et al.’s (2012) approach, we are able to substantially

narrow the bounds by combining conventional, relatively mild monotonicity assumptions on the

selection process and restrictions on the patterns of WIC misclassification. The methods

employed in this paper extend their framework to allow for multiple treatments with validation

data for one of the treatments. Our objective is to strike a balance between making assumptions

that are weak enough to be credible but strong enough to be informative.
                                                                                                   31


        The methods showcase what can be learned about treatment effects regarding multiple

programs when validation data are available for one program but not the other. Exploiting the

administratively validated SNAP data in FoodAPS, our key finding is that we can identify the

average treatment effect as strictly positive under relatively weak assumptions on the selection

process combined with a food expenditure monotone instrumental variable. Monotone

instrumental variables are weaker than standard IVs in that they require no a priori exclusion

restrictions. Using our sample of potentially eligible households, we estimate a lower bound on

the effect of participating in both SNAP and WIC compared with participating in SNAP alone on

the food security rate at 24 percentage points (without accounting for sampling variability).

While this estimated lower bound is large and statistically significant, it is not precisely

estimated. With our relatively small sample size of 460 households, food security might rise by

as little as 1.9 percentage points after accounting for sampling variability reflected in the 95

percent confidence interval.

        Overall, our results provide evidence that SNAP and WIC are not redundant. These

findings have direct policy relevance in that they inform policymakers about the existence of

complementarities between SNAP and WIC, which can help contribute to designing a more

efficient food safety net in the United States. The degree of the complementarity remains an

open question owing in part to the relatively small sample size in our analysis. Moreover, the

SNAP administrative data could themselves contain errors (e.g., if the household matching

algorithm has imperfections), and we do not have direct evidence about the nature of WIC

classification errors. Validation of participation status for WIC and other assistance programs

beyond SNAP would allow for narrower and more reliable bounds on the average treatment

effects of interest.

Endnotes:

1
    The rate of food insecurity among all U.S. households was 12.3% (Coleman-Jensen et al.

2017a).
2
    The second largest program is the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).
3
    Brien and Swann (2000) find that synergies can reinforce welfare programs’ effects.
4
    To avoid further complexity, we abstract away from the issue of potentially mismeasured food

security status. To the extent that such misclassification exists, the identified bounds on

treatment effects reported in this paper would become wider.
5
    Mismeasurement of a binary variable induces a nonclassical measurement error even if such

errors occur randomly, and in our setting errors are systematic in one direction and likely related

to household characteristics. Stephens and Unayama (2015) show that the inconsistency of a

standard IV estimator also arises when a continuous (rather than binary) endogenous treatment

variable (e.g., the amount of received program benefits) is either underreported or imputed.
6
    The policies are not randomly assigned, and policies targeted towards participation (such as

eligibility rules or ease of recertification) may be correlated with other state policies that could

directly affect food security (e.g. policies that affect the financial well-being of poorer

households and therefore their ability to buy food).
7
    No administrative data to validate WIC participation are available in FoodAPS.
8
    The income eligibility cutoffs are 130% and 185% of the poverty threshold in the cases of

SNAP and WIC, respectively. Since we study households that are potentially eligible for the two

programs concurrently, we impose the income cutoff of min{130%, 185%} = 130% of the

poverty threshold when constructing the analytical sample. In the case of WIC, more than 86%
                                                                                                   40



of WIC households had incomes at or below 130% of poverty in 2014 (Thorn et al. 2015, Table

III.6, p. 44).
9
    Such households can be further categorized as having “low food security” (score of 3-5) or

“very low food security” (6-10).
10
     Many variables pertaining to these public policies come from the SNAP Policy Database (ERS

2017b). They refer to SNAP policies and design features at the state level, including the

magnitude of outreach expenditures, length of recertification periods, exemptions from the

household asset test, reporting requirements, and fingerprinting of applicants, among others. The

literature often uses these variables as IVs for SNAP participation (e.g., Gregory and Deb 2015;

Ratcliffe, McKernan, and Zhang 2011; Yen et al. 2008).
11
     Our analysis involves using confidential geographic identifiers and other restricted-access

FoodAPS data. We access them through a secure data enclave of the National Opinion Research

Center (NORC). For details on publicly available FoodAPS data, see ERS (2017a).
12
     In FoodAPS, questions about SNAP and WIC refer to current participation.
13
     A tradeoff is that we cannot point-identify the ATE.
14
     Note that we are not restricting a treatment effect to be the same across households. As

emphasized by Moffitt (2005), the classical linear response model assumption, for example, is

difficult to justify in the case of government assistance programs that are thought to have

heterogeneous effects.
15
     With a binary treatment, the Manski bounds would have a width equal to 1 (and always

include 0). In the present context with multiple treatments, the Manski bounds have a width

greater than 1.
                                                                                                  41


16
     Although we formally treat administrative data in FoodAPS as the gold standard for SNAP

participation, we recognize that these data may contain some errors themselves (e.g., if the

household matching algorithm has imperfections).
17
     For future research, there is information reported on food expenditures funded through WIC

vouchers at purchase events that might be used to partially validate participation. Of concern is

the potential for lags in the timing of using WIC benefits after no longer being certified as a

program participant.
18
     Naturally, the bounds presented below widen to the extent that this assumption does not hold

exactly or other variables are measured with error. Similarly, point estimates in other studies may

not be robust to departures from the implicit assumption of perfectly accurately measured

variables.
19
     The chance of being found to participate in SNAP when claiming otherwise is about 49%

among food secure households and 44% among food insecure households. The fractions are also

similar to each other for the rare cases of reporting SNAP benefits not actually received.
20
     JKZ show that either the lower or upper bound is given by this difference in conditional means

depending on whether κ is less than or greater than 1.
21
     Previous studies have shown that the local food environment is an important contributor to

food security and health through differences in access, availability, and cost of food (e.g., Rose

and Richards 2004; Ver Ploeg 2010; Bonanno and Goetz 2012; Lee 2012). In particular, the

relative cost of food in the area can substantially affect a low-income household’s ability to

provide an adequate diet to its members. Zhylyevskyy et al. (2013) find that lower relative fruit

and vegetable prices positively affect the selection of these foods in a study of African American

youths and parents.

22
     We report the results for the MIV based on food prices at food stores located within 20 miles

of the household’s place of residence.
23
     As noted by Manski and Pepper (2000), the MIV estimator is consistent but biased in finite

samples. We employ Kreider and Pepper’s (2007) modified MIV estimator that accounts for the

finite sample bias using a nonparametric bootstrap correction method.

Notes: This table shows descriptive statistics for selected characteristics of four subsamples that

were created by partitioning the analytical sample according to household program participation

pattern. SNAP participation measure incorporates administrative data. WIC participation is self-

reported. “No program” refers to participation in neither SNAP nor WIC. “Both programs” refers

to participation in both SNAP and WIC.

Observations are weighted using FoodAPS household weights.
