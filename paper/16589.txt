                                             ABSTRACT

This paper compares the recent global crisis and recession to earlier international financial crises and
recessions. Based on existing chronologies of banking, currency and debt crises we identify clusters
of crises. We use an identification of extreme events and a weighting scheme based on real GDP relative
to the U.S. to identify global financial crises since 1880. For banking crises we identify five global
ones since 1880: 1890-91, 1907-08, 1913-14, 1931-32, 2007-2008.

In terms of global incidence the recent crisis is fourth in ranking and comparable to 1907-08. We also
calculate output losses during the recessions associated with global financial crises and again the recent
crisis is similar in severity to 1907-08 and is fourth in ranking. On both dimensions the recent crisis
is a pale shadow of the Great depression. The relatively mild experience of the recent crisis may reflect
institutional and policy learning.

1. Introduction



A financial crisis in the US in 2007 spread to Europe and led to a recession across the

world in 2007-2009. Have we seen patterns like this before or is the recent experience

novel? This paper compares the recent crisis and recent recession to earlier international

financial crises and global recessions.


First we review the dimensions of the recent crisis. We then present some historical

narrative on earlier global crises in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The

description of earlier global crises leads to a sense of déjà vu.



We next demarcate several chronologies of the incidence of various kinds of crises:

banking, currency and debt crises and combinations of them across a large number of

countries for the period from 1880 to 2010. These chronologies come from earlier work

of Bordo with Barry Eichengreen, Daniela Klingebiel and Maria Soledad Martinez-Peria

and with Chris Meissner (Bordo et al (2001), Bordo and Meissner ( 2007)) , from

Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff’s recent book (2009) and studies by the IMF

( Laeven and Valencia 2009,2010).1 Based on these chronologies we look for clusters of

crisis events which occur in a number of countries and across continents. These we label

global financial crises.




1
 There is considerable overlap in the different chronologies as Reinhart and Rogoff incorporated many of
our dates and my coauthors and I used IMF and World Bank chronologies for the period since the early
1970s.


                                                                                                           2
International financial crises inevitably are associated with recessions. We then ascertain

the impact of the global financial crises identified by our cluster analysis on real output in

the countries affected. To do this we first demarcate business cycle turning points in the

countries affected by the global crises and then measure the accumulated output losses in

the recessions associated with the identified crises. Not surprisingly we find that the

economic impact of the Great Depression dwarfed that of the recent crisis but so did

several other historic global financial crises. We consider several factors that could

explain the patterns of global financial crises. These include globalization, the gold

standard and whether the US was in crisis. We conclude with some policy implications

of our evidence.



2. Dimensions of the Recent Global Financial Crisis



The collapse in the subprime mortgage market after the collapse of a major housing boom

in the U.S. (which had been propelled by expansionary monetary policy and long

standing government policies encouraging home ownership) and the plunge in values of

mortgage backed securities in the US in 1907, led to a crisis in the US Shadow banking

system (non bank financial intermediaries that had issued and held mortgage backed

securities) (Gorton 2010). These pressures led to liquidity shortages in the interbank

wholesale markets that funded the financial sector. The crisis spread to European banks

via the drying up of interbank liquidity which led inter alia to the run on Northern Rock

in the UK in September 2007 and the exposure of European banks to mortgage backed




                                                                                            3
securities held in off balance sheet SIVs which led to threats to the solvency of banks in

Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Switzerland and Iceland.



Although the Federal Reserve, ECB and Bank of England provided ample liquidity in the

fall of 2007 the crisis worsened with the collapse of Lehman Brothers (in which case the

US monetary authorities did an about face after having bailed out Bear Stearns in March

2008 )and the near collapse of AIG ( saved by a huge bailout) in September 2008.



A credit crunch and a pause in expansionary monetary policy in early 2008 reflecting a

misplaced fear of commodity price hikes leading to inflation (Hetzel 2009) led to a

recession in the US and Europe. The advanced country recession and a collapse in

international trade finance greatly reduced exports from China and other emerging Asian

countries as well as the rest of the world leading to a global downturn. In addition several

eastern European countries were hit by crisis because they were overexposed to foreign

currency denominated debt. They were rescued by the IMF.



The global crisis ended with government bailouts of insolvent banks, guarantees of the

liabilities of the banking system, the provision of credit facilities to unclog financial

markets and expansionary monetary and fiscal policy in many countries. The global

recovery began in the summer of 2009 making the recession which began in late 2007 in

the US and other countries the longest (and possibly the deepest one) in the postwar era.




                                                                                            4
3. Historical Patterns in International Financial Crises



We provide a brief narrative of events which could be characterized as global financial

crises. We also demarcate several episodes which were primarily regional rather than

global crises.



We first define our terms. The essence of a financial crisis is a banking crisis (Schwartz

1986). According to Bordo, Eichengreen et al ( 2001) “for an episode to qualify as a

banking crisis ,we must observe either bank runs, widespread bank failures and the

suspension of deposits into currency such that the latter circulates at a premium relative

to deposits ( a banking panic), or significant banking sector problems( including but not

limited to bank failures) resulting in the erosion of most or all of banking system

collateral that are resolved by a fiscally underwritten bank restructuring’



This definition allows us to distinguish between pre 1914 banking panics in which lender

of last resort intervention was either absent or unsuccessful, and subsequent crises in

which a lender of last resort or deposit insurance was in place and the main problem was

bank insolvency rather than illiquidity.2




2
  Reinhart and Rogoff ( 2009) have a different more liberal definition “ We mark a banking crisis by two
types of events: (1) bank runs that lead to the closure, merging or takeover by the public sector of one or
more financial institutions and (2) if there are no runs, the closure, merging, takeover or large scale
government assistance of an important financial institution ( or group of institutions) that mark the start of a
string of similar outcomes for other financial institutions” page 10.




                                                                                                              5
Financial crises are aggravated when they lead to or are accompanied by currency crises

(a speculative attack on a pegged exchange rate) and debt crises (sovereign debt defaults).

International financial crises are banking crises that are often accompanied by currency

crises (twin crises) or by debt crises (or by both currency and debt crises together) that

occur in multiple countries and across continents. They also involve both advanced and

emerging countries.



Such events are often triggered by asset price booms and busts in key countries. Stock

market and property booms often burst preceding financial crises (Bordo 2003).



The world has seen a number of global financial crises since the beginning of the

nineteenth century and even before (Kindleberger 1978). Before World War I they

occurred in an environment of globalization—the integration of goods, labor and capital

markets in which free capital mobility often was at the heart of asset booms and busts that

led to crises. They also occurred under the classical gold standard which linked countries

together by fixed exchange rates. In the interwar period major financial crises occurred

after the world returned to the gold exchange standard. After World War II under the

Bretton Woods system with pegged exchange rates, capital controls and extensive

financial regulation, financial crises were rare although there were frequent currency

crises. Since the early 1970s along with the switch to a floating exchange rate regime (for

the advanced countries), the removal of capital controls, and the liberalization of

domestic financial markets, international financial crises have reappeared.




                                                                                         6
3.1 The specie standard era



A number of international financial crises involving banking crises in London, the

continent of Europe, the United States and Latin America occurred during the nineteenth

century when most countries were on specie standards (silver, gold, bimetallism). Also in

that century after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, globalization in trade and capital

increased dramatically (Bordo, Taylor and Williamson 2003). We briefly demarcate

several events in the nineteenth century before our data starts in 1880 and then the crisis

events after 1880.



The first international financial crisis was the crisis of 1825 (Neal 1998, Bordo 1998.).

The opening up of Latin America after the overthrow of the Spanish empire led to the

opening up of international trade between England and the Latin American republics and

massive capital flows from London (and the continent) to finance infrastructure, mining

and government. The investment was fueled by easy monetary policy by the Bank of

England. Many of the ventures financed were fraudulent. This led to a boom on the

London stock exchange. Once the capital outflows impinged on the Bank of England’s

gold reserves, Bank rate was raised and the stock market crashed.



This led to a banking panic which was not quickly stemmed by lender of last resort action.

A sudden stop of capital flow from London led to debt defaults, banking panics, currency

crashes across Latin America. The panic in London spread to the continent and according

to some sources, to the US.




                                                                                         7
Banking panics and stock market crashes in London in 1837, 1839, 1847 and 1857 spilled

over to the continent. The first two crises impacted the US via the cotton trade. The 1847

crisis involved a railroad boom, stock market crash and harvest failure. The crisis was

triggered by tight Bank of England policy. The 1857 crisis started in the US with the

failure of the Ohio Life Insurance Company, leading to a stock market crash and banking

panic. This crisis augured the importance of the United States in future global financial

crises. Major banking panics also occurred in London and Germany.



The crisis of 1873 had a global reach. According to Kindleberger (1978) it started with

the collapse of a property boom in Germany and Austria, then spread through the

continent and affected the US as European investors dumped US railroad stocks. The US

had a major panic associated with a corporate governance scandal in the railroad sector

(Benmelech and Bordo 2008). The collapse of that sector contributed to a serious and

drawn out recession. The crisis spread to Latin America via a sudden stop as the Bank of

England raised its bank rate to offset gold outflows (Catao 2006). This led to a series of

debt defaults across the region and a banking crisis in Peru (Reinhart and Rogoff 2009)



3.2 The Classical gold standard era 1880-1913



The pre World War I classical gold standard era witnessed two major global financial

crises; 1890-1893, 1907-1908. In both periods banking, currency and debt crises occurred




                                                                                          8
in countries across the world. In some of the countries affected output losses were very

large (Bordo and Eichengreen 1999).



1890-1893



In the 3 year span there were two big crises centered on 1890 and 1893 with crisis

events also occurring in the intervening years.



The 1890 crisis is usually termed the Baring crisis. In the 1880s substantial capital flows

from the advanced countries of Western Europe to develop the infrastructure of the

periphery occurred during a period of sluggish domestic demand. Major recipients of

these funds were Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. The associated land boom financed by

generous bank lending ended in a bust consequent upon the Bank of England and other

European central banks raising their discount rates to stem losses in their gold reserves

(Bordo 2006). The sudden stop led to a banking crisis, debt default and currency crisis in

Argentina. Barings Brothers (a leading London merchant bank) which was heavily

exposed to Argentine debt became insolvent. It was rescued by a lifeboat operation (a

consortium of key London banks that agreed to backstop Barings assets with a British

government guarantee) orchestrated by the Bank of England which prevented a banking

panic. But panics did occur in numerous European countries, and in Latin America. In

addition to Argentina, a triple crisis occurred in Portugal while the US, Brazil, and Russia

had twin crises.




                                                                                          9
In an environment of continued financial stringency following the Baring crisis, a major

twin crisis broke out in the US in 1893 reflecting concerns over threats by the Free Silver

movement to its continued adherence to the gold standard (Friedman and Schwartz 1963).

Australia had a major banking panic at the end of a land boom financed by British capital;

triggered by a decline in the terms of trade. Other countries in crisis in 1893 included

New Zealand, Italy, Greece and several Latin American countries. In this period Bordo

and Murshid (2002 and 2007) find evidence of both contagion between the core and

periphery countries and a significant risk of a global financial crisis.



The second major global financial crisis was in 1907. A banking panic in the autumn in

the US was at the heart of it. It may have been triggered by the Bank of England

discriminating against merchant banks financing US trade following large payments by

British insurance companies to cover losses stemming from the San Francisco earthquake

(Odell and Wiedenmeir 2005).Other countries hit by banking crises included France,

Italy(which had a twin crisis), Denmark, Sweden, Japan, Chile and Mexico. This crisis

led to significant output losses in several countries (Bordo and Eichengreen 1999).



The last big crisis in this era was in 1914 at the outbreak of World War One reflecting a

global demand for liquidity. Massive lender of last resort operations ( eg the US invoked

the Aldrich Vreeland Act and issued emergency currency),the closing of stock exchanges

and the imposition of capital controls in many countries prevented panics in many

countries .

.




                                                                                        10
3.3 The Interwar period 1919-1939



The interwar period is notorious for financial crises. They occurred in two waves: 1920-

25 and 1929-33.



The crises of the 1920-25 period reflected the attempts globally by central banks to

unwind the inflation that had built up in the War. It also reflected global imbalances

reflecting shifts in the pattern of global production and agriculture. Disinflation impinged

upon the balance sheets of many European countries leading to banking crises in the

Scanadanavian countries, the Netherlands, Italy as well as in Japan, Mexico and

elsewhere. Some of these were twin crises. The brief global recession of 1920-22 was

quite severe.




1929-33: The Great Contraction.



This episode is infamous as the worst of all crisis periods. It was preceded by stock

market crashes in the US and UK. A series of banking panics in the US beginning in

October 1930 were not successfully allayed by the Federal Reserve (Friedman and

Schwartz 1963 and Bordo and Landon Lane 2010) and turned a serious recession into the

Great Depression. The depression was transmitted around the world by the fixed

exchange rate links of the gold exchange standard (Friedman and Schwartz 1963) and by

the implosion of international fiduciary currency reserves built upon a thin film of




                                                                                         11
international gold reserves (Bernanke 2002). Adherents to the gold exchange standard

who lacked credibility were prevented by “golden fetters” from offsetting banking panics

(expansionary monetary policy would have led to a speculative attack on the gold parity)

which proliferated across Europe, (Eichengreen 1992). Many countries across the world

also were hit by debt and currency crises. Countries only extricated themselves from

depression when they left the gold standard and followed expansionary monetary policy.

The banking panics and deep deflation greatly worsened the real economies of countries

which experienced them (Bernanke and James 1991).



3.4. Post World War II: Bretton Woods 1944-1973



In the Bretton Woods adjustable peg regime characterized by widespread capital controls

and extensive financial regulation designed to prevent a reoccurrence of the financial

chaos of the interwar, there were very few banking crises (or debt crises). However there

were frequent currency crises as many countries were unable to align their domestic

financial policies with their pegged currencies (Bordo 1993).



3.5 The Managed Float and a Return to Globalization 1973 -2010



After the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system the global financial economy reopened.

In addition, in the face of high inflation many controls on the banking and financial

system began to crumble. The financial crisis problem of earlier eras returned.




                                                                                      12
3.5.1 The 1970s.



Banking crises erupted in both advanced and emerging countries in the 1970s. In 1974 in

the US, Franklin National bank was bailed out while in Germany Herstatt bank was not.

Neither of these events were classic banking crises. Other European countries witnessed

significant bank failures as did other parts of the world. In the emerging countries there

were scores of currency crises. However in this decade it is difficult to discern a global

financial crisis.



3.5.2 The 1980s.



The 1970s was the height of the Great Inflation the causes of which include a misplaced

emphasis on the Phillips curve, the end of the gold discipline of the Bretton Woods

system and the oil price shocks of 1973 and 1978. At the end of the 70s the US and other

advanced countries shifted to a very tight monetary policy to break the back of

inflationary expectations. In addition to precipitating one of the worst postwar recessions

in many countries the tight policies also led many countries in Latin America and

elsewhere to default on debts built up in the preceding inflationary era.



The Latin American debt crisis beginning in 1982 in which amongst others Mexico,

Argentina, Chile, Ecuador and diverse countries like Egypt and Turkey defaulted on their

sovereign debt, triggering financial difficulties for banks across the world. Many had lent




                                                                                        13
money to the countries affected. In the US key money center banks like Chase and

Citibank were bailed out.



The IMF and World Bank report scores of banking crises in emerging countries in this

decade. The period 1982-84 may constitute a global financial crisis.



3.5.2 The 1990s



The 1990s was characterized by three regional financial crises: in Europe 1990-91, the

Tequila Crisis in 1994 and the Asian crisis of 1997-98.3



Europe



The liberalization of financial markets in many countries in the late 1980s led to a series

of financial crises. In the Nordic countries freeing the banks from extensive controls led

to a property boom in Sweden and Finland. A bust was triggered by the EMS crisis and

the breakdown of the Soviet empire. These forces produced the Nordic banking and

currency crisis (Jonung and Hagberg. 2005). Banks also failed in Norway. Other

countries like Italy and Australia also had banking crises in this period.




3
  Japan had a major banking crisis after the bursting of property and stock bubbles in 1989. Although this
likely contributed to the Asian Crisis of 1997 , it was not an international financial crisis.


                                                                                                       14
The Tequila crisis.



Tight Federal Reserve policy in reaction to an inflation scare may have been the trigger

for a massive devaluation by Mexico in 1994. This led to a banking crisis and a rescue

package arranged by the US. Other Latin countries also were hit by debt, banking and

currency crises referred to as the tequila effect. Impact on the advanced countries was

minimal.



The Asian Crisis 1997-1998.



The causes for the massive currency and banking crises in Thailand, Indonesia, Korea as

well as less dramatic disruption in Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan

include: overvalued currency pegs, original sin (liability dollarization,) the drying up of

Japanese lending after its banking crisis, corporate malfeasance and corruption. These

crises had contagion effects on other emerging countries possibly reflecting stringency in

advanced country lending. Two prominent countries were Russia which defaulted on its

debt in 1998 and Brazil which had a serious currency crisis in 1998. A threat by the

Russian Crisis to the advanced countries by the incipient collapse of LTCM, a large

hedge fund, which was greatly exposed to Russian debt which seriously exposed the

balance sheets of important counterparties( including New York money center banks) to

loss, , was offset by a Federal Reserve arranged rescue.




                                                                                        15
The Asian crisis had impact across many emerging countries but did not seriously impact

the advanced countries. However many have argued that if it weren’t for the generous

rescue packages provided by the IMF, other governments, and other agencies it would

have become one. On the other hand, others have argued that the rescues were largely

bailouts which would engender future moral hazard (Bordo and Schwartz , 2000).



4. Empirical Evidence



4.1 Identifying Global Crises



In order to quantify the effect that a global financial crisis has on a country’s real

economy (business cycle) we first need to identify periods of global financial distress. To

do this we assemble information on three types of financial crises: banking crises,

currency crises, and sovereign debt crises. We have 57 countries in our sample which

runs from 1880 to 2009. Multiple sources were used to accumulate information on these

three types of crises and the information obtained was aggregated into our database. The

raw data on banking crises can be found in Figure A.1 in the appendix and the raw data

on currency and debt crises can be found in Figures A.2 and A.3 of the appendix.



The sources used were Bordo et al (2001), Bordo and Meissner (2005), Reinhart and

Rogoff (2009), Laeven and Valencia (2010) and the IMF WEO. The dating of currency

crises using an intersection between an EMP index and narratives is similar across the

chronologies as is the dating of debt crises. However there were some differences




                                                                                        16
between Bordo and coauthors and Reinhart and Rogoff on the definition of banking

crises. Their definition is generally more liberal than ours. They include a number of

episodes as banking crises which we do not, such as minor banking crises in Canada in

1893, the UK in 1991, 1994 and 1995 and there are some they do not include like the

major banking panic in the US in 1893. Also recent work by Nelson and Salido (2010)

show different banking crises in the postwar US than either ours or Reinhart and Rogoff.

They demarcate 1973-75, 1982-84 and 1988-91 as crises whereas Reinhart and Rogoff

designate only 1984 as a banking crisis in that period. In addition Jalil (2010) demarcates

several minor banking crises for the US in the 1920s and also in the nineteenth century

that neither of us demarcates. In this paper we include all the crises reported by the

different authors. We do not distinguish between major and minor banking crises.



In order to identify periods of global crisis we first look for clusters of crises. To do so,

for each year, we count the number of crises for each category. These raw counts are

reported in Figures A4 – A6 in the appendix.4 Candidate global crises are then identified

using a centered moving sum of order 2 of these raw counts. That is for each period we

count the number of unique crises for the current period and the preceding and following

period as well. Peaks in the two-period moving sum series are candidates for periods of

global financial crises.



One important consideration, however, is that not all countries are the same in the sense

that a crisis in a large country (e.g. the U.S.) is different to a crisis in a small country (e.g.

 As noted above in many instances multiple authors identify the same crisis. In these cases the crisis is
only counted once so as not to bias the results towards finding a global crisis.


                                                                                                            17
New Zealand) in its effect on the global economy. To account for this effect we weight

each observation by the country’s real GDP relative to U.S. GDP.5 If a banking crisis

occurs in a country whose real GDP is half that of the United States then the observation

is given a weight of 0.5. This weighted count thus reflects the relative importance of the

country (in terms of its size) when deciding whether a cluster of banking crises

constitutes a global financial crisis.




In determining whether a cluster is a global crisis we use the following rule: 1) we find a

local peak of the two-period moving sum of the weighted count series, yt. A local peak is

defined to be a period (t) where


                                         yt  yt 1 and yt  yt 1 .                             (1)

In case of ties, ( yt  yt 1 ) then period t is chosen if yt 1  yt  2 and period t+1 is chosen if

yt  2  yt 1 . 2) The local peak, found in 1), is an extreme value (thus the cluster must be

large enough to be considered a rare event), and 3) the countries making up the cluster

must be from different geographical regions.



A peak is considered an extreme event if the weighted sum of total crises is more than

three standard deviations from the mean. In order to account for outliers the upper 10% of

the data is first trimmed before computing the mean and standard deviation of the data.

Once the cutoff is determined we look at the boundary value of the weighted series. The

                                                                                                  18
crisis is considered large and rare if it is in the upper tail of the distribution and has a total

combined weight that is greater than the combined output of the US.



The preceding rule is applied to the data on banking crises, currency crises, and debt

crises individually. It is also applied to a combined banking and currency crisis dataset to

look for global “twin”-crises and to a combined banking, currency and debt crisis dataset

to identify global “triple”-crises, to a combined banking and debt crisis and to a

combined debt and currency crisis data set. The results are given below:



4.1.1 Global Banking Crises



The two-period weighted moving sum banking crisis series is depicted in Figure 1. The

horizontal dashed line represents the three standard deviation threshold for (partly)

determining a global crisis and is equal to 1.75. Thus the five identified global crises have

a weighted sum greater than 1.75. Using the rule outlined above we found global banking

crises in the following periods: 1890-1891, 1907-1908, 1913-1914, 1931-1932, and 2007-

2008. The countries involved in each of these global banking crises are reported in Table

1.



In all of the identified periods countries from at least two (and usually more) distinct

geographical regions are present. The most recent global crisis only contains countries

from North America and Europe whereas the other crises contain countries from at least




                                                                                               19

three distinct geographical areas. It is also evident from Figure 1 that the most recent

global banking crisis ranks fourth in terms of the weighted sum of countries having

banking crises and appears quite similar to the banking crisis of 1907-1908.



4.1.2 Global Currency Crises



Figure 2 depicts the three period moving sum of the weighted count of currency crises

where again the weights are relative GDP in 1990 dollars. Using the same rule as

described above we identify the following periods as global currency crises: 1890-91,

1893-94, 1931-1932, 1933-34, 1970-71, 1970-1971, 1981-1982, 1986-87, and 1992-1993.

                  Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, USA.



The cutoff for crises to be more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean in this

case is 1.5, thus all identified currency crises have total weight equal to 1.5 times the size

of the U.S. economy. The countries involved in these global currency crises are reported

in Table 2.



There are some noticeable differences in the occurrences of the currency crises compared

with the global banking crises found above. The period from 2007-2008, where we did

identify a global banking crisis, does not have a global currency crisis. In fact there are

only two periods where there are both a global banking crisis and a global currency crisis.

These are the 1931-1932 period, and the 1981-1982 period.

4.1.3 Debt Crises



Figure 3 depicts the weighted moving sum of the number of sovereign debt crises for the

period 1880-2009. Using a threshold of 3 standard deviations above the mean there are a

number of peaks identified. However, in no case was the peak large enough to be

considered a global crisis; the largest peak was in 1932 and had a value of 0.58. Thus our

identification does not yield any debt crises important enough to be declared a global debt

crisis. Again we do not observe any global debt crisis for the most recent period (2007-

2008)




4.2 Global “Twin”-Crises



                                                                                          23
In the preceding sections we separately identified global crises for banking, currency, and

debt crisis. We found two periods where there were both global banking and global

currency crises. However, this approach did not check whether the countries included in

each type of crisis overlapped or were different. That is, we do not know whether in these

periods there were both a banking crisis and a currency crisis occurring in parallel (i.e. to

two different sets of countries) or in unison (i.e. to the same countries). In this section we

compute the weighted count of the countries having “twin” banking and currency crisis

concurrently. The moving sum of this weighted count of “twin” crises is depicted in

Figure 4.



Using a threshold of three standard deviations only one global “twin”-crisis is identified:

1931-1932. The two peaks in the 1890’s do not constitute a global crisis as only one

country is involved in each case; Brazil for 1889 and the USA for 1893. This suggests

that the other period where there is an overlap of banking crisis and currency crisis: 1981-

1983 (a banking crisis from 1982-83 and a currency crisis from 1981-1982) was a period

where there was both a banking crisis and a currency crisis but that these crises affected

different sets of countries.



Figures 5 and 6 show the weighted moving sum of the other twin crises (Currency and

Debt and Banking and Debt) and we identify no periods where there were significant

numbers of these types of twin crises.

4.3 Global “Triple” Crises



Previously we did not identify any periods where there were any global debt crises. In

this section we compute weighted counts of countries having all three crises at once and

the moving sum of these weighted counts is depicted in Figure 7. Again there are no

periods that we can identify where there were a significant number of countries having

“triple” crises.




4.4 Robustness

In order to check that our findings are robust to our method we tried a number of

alternative approaches. First we used a fixed threshold to identify a global crisis rather

than use the three standard deviation approach described above. Second we used a three



                                                                                              27
period moving average instead of the two-period moving average reported above. Third,

we used relative per capita real income rather than relative real income as the weight.

For all alternatives the main conclusions that we draw are unaltered. The main

differences between the alternative approaches are the identification of smaller crises

periods when using per capita real income as the weight. All the crises periods identified

above are identified using the other methods.




5. Comparing and Quantifying the Crises



In Section 5 we used informal “cluster” analysis to identify global crises. In that section

we combined data sets on crises from a number of sources and counted the number of

observed crises to look for clusters of crises across the world. In this section we turn our

attention to quantifying the “cost” of a recession and compare these costs across the

different types of crisis and non-crisis periods. In order to be consistent we use a

restricted dataset that consists of countries for which we have data that span the entire

sample period from 1880-2009. This restricted set of countries is nonetheless quite varied

and consists of countries from many regions, a variety of levels of development, and a

variety of levels of openness.



The countries that are included in this analysis are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium,

Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, The

Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The United




                                                                                         28
Kingdom, Uruguay, and The United States of America. In order to quantify the loss

caused by a recession we first date business cycles for each country by looking for peaks

and troughs of real output for each country using a common business cycle dating

algorithm. We then compute the cost of each recession for each country and compare this

cost across the many different types of crisis periods identified above.



The set of countries included in our analysis is kept constant over the whole sample even

though data for other countries becomes available over time as we wanted to keep a

consistent set of countries for the analysis and to not bias our results. If the countries to

be added were chosen randomly one would not expect the results to be affected by the

addition of extra countries in the later periods but it is fair to assume that the availability

of data is not a random event and most likely a function of a country’s development. Also

the aim of this exercise is to compare recessions across different crisis periods so it is

important to have a consistent set of countries across time.



5.1 Data



The data that we use is real output in constant 1990 dollars and comes from the dataset
                                          6
compiled by Angus Maddison.                   This methodology is described in more detail in

Maddison (2007), but nominal output for each country is first converted into 1990 local

currency units and then converted into 1990 dollars using a database of international

comparisons reported by the World Bank in 1990.

    The dataset can be found at http://www.ggdc.net/maddison .


                                                                                            29
5.2 Identifying Cycles and Measuring Loss.



In order to have a consistent set of dating rules across each country in our sample we use

the business cycle dating procedure of Bry and Boschan (1971) that was updated by

Harding and Pagan (2000, 2002). Here we date the classical cycle – that is the turning

points of the level of real output – using the following rules: 1) the minimum length of a

cycle is two years, 2) a recession or an expansion has to be at least one year in length, 3)

peaks and troughs must alternate. The actual peak years and trough years that we use can

be found in Table A.1 of Appendix A.



It should be noted that we could have alternatively looked at growth-cycles – turning

points in the growth rate of real output – but in order to be consistent across the whole

sample period of 1880—2009 we only compare classical cycles. This means that for

latter periods, where the growth of real output is high, some countries have very long

cycles.



There have been many different approaches to quantifying the loss of a recession. Some,

for example Bordo et al (2001) and Laeven and Valencia (2010) use a measure of how

long the economy took to get back to a measure of “potential” output as a measure of the

severity of the recession. Harding and Pagan (2002) discuss a number of different

approaches to measuring the severity of a recession including duration (time from peak to

trough), amplitude (percentage loss from peak output to trough output) and accumulated

loss (the sum of the percentage differences from peak output to all output levels for each




                                                                                         30
period of the recession). This last measure approximates the area above the actual level of

output and the projection of peak output out horizontally for the duration of the recession.

Harding and Pagan (2002) also use a measure of the steepness of the recession by

measuring the difference between the actual accumulated loss and the loss if actual

output followed a straight line from peak output to trough output – which they call an

excess loss measure.



In our approach we use the accumulated percentage loss as our measure of the severity of

a recession. This measure has the benefit of combining information about the recession’s

depth and duration into one number. The problem with using only amplitude or only

duration is that it would be hard to compare a short but sharp recession with a long but

shallow recession. Which of these recessions are worse? One would have a longer

duration and the other would have larger amplitude. The accumulated percentage loss

measures the total loss due to a recession as a percentage of the peak level of output and

is able to compare all types of recessions. We do not use the other Harding and Pagan

(2002) measure (the excess measure) as our dating rules allow for one year recessions

which would necessarily yield zero excess.



The other measures mentioned above that measure how long it takes the economy to get

back to a measure of potential output are not used either. The main reason is that we want

to compare the severity of the most recent banking crisis in terms of the effect on the

severity of recession during this period. As most economies in our sample had peaks in

either 2007 or 2008 there is not enough data to compute this measure. Since we are not




                                                                                         31
able to use this duration measure to compare the severity of recessions across the

different periods with the most recent recessions we do not report the severity measures

of Bordo et al (2001).



5.3 Results from our Comparisons



As noted above we use a consistent classical business cycle dating algorithm to date

classical business cycles for each of the 23 countries in our sample from 1880 until

2009.7 For each recession that is identified we compute the accumulated percentage loss

of the recession compared to the counterfactual that the country stayed at peak output for

the entire duration of the recession. If the last identified turning point was a peak then we

measured the accumulated loss from this peak until the end of the sample in 2009. For

most countries the last identified peak was in 2007 and 2008 and there is considerable

evidence that these countries have troughed by 2009 (although the algorithm cannot

determine this without knowing the level of output for 2010). Given that we don’t know

the actual trough dates for the last recession we obviously run the risk of having truncated

measures but we do not think this is a major issue given that most of the countries in our

sample appear to have troughed by the end of 2009.



In order to account for country size we weight each loss measure by the country’s relative

GDP relative to that of the United States. Once we compute the measure of severity for

each recession we then compare the severity of recessions over all of the sample and in

particular during periods of crisis. Some summary statistical results on the severity of the

recessions can be found in Table 5. The statistics that are reported are the mean of the

distribution, the median of the distribution, and the 25th and 75th percentiles (the inter-

quartile range).



The first number that is reported in Table 5 is for all recessions in our sample. The mean

weighted (weighted by relative GDP) accumulated percentage loss for all recessions in

our sample is -1.12% but it is clear that the distribution of accumulated losses is highly

skewed to the left as the median and 25th and 75th percentiles are much smaller at -0.15%,

-0.68%, and -0.05% respectively. Thus the distribution of accumulated loss of a recession

is skewed to the left with a large number of large negative losses. That is, the distribution

has a “fat” lower tail.



Next we report the mean, median, and inter-quartile range for those recessions that do not

overlap any of the crisis (banking, currency, or debt) periods and for those that do overlap



                                                                                             33
with any of the crisis periods. 8 The mean accumulated loss during a crisis period is

approximately twice that for recessions that occur outside of any of the crisis windows.

The median and 25th percentiles are also shifted left suggesting that recessions during

crises are worse, in terms of accumulated percentage loss, than recessions during non-

crisis periods.



We next split the crisis periods into their respective types and report results for the three

types of crises that we identify: banking crises and currency crises. Looking first at

banking crises (periods where there is a global banking crisis) we observe that the loss

distribution is heavily skewed to the left with a mean loss of around -3.03% and a median

loss of around -0.62%. We also split the sample into those countries that actually have a

banking crisis and those who do not (but nonetheless have a recession during a global

banking crisis) and find that countries that have a banking crisis have slightly larger

losses than those countries that do not.




The pattern for the currency crises is different. Again a currency crisis is a period where

there is a currency crisis. First it is clear that recessions during currency crises are not as

severe as during banking crises. There appears to be a discernable difference between

those countries having a currency crisis (their recessions are worse) than those not having

a currency crisis but having a recession during a currency crisis.

  A recession is deemed to overlap if any of the periods of the recession overlap with any of the periods of
the crisis window.


                                                                                                          34
5.3.1 Comparing Individual Banking Crises



The results of the previous section suggest that banking crises are the more important

crises to consider given that recessions associated with them are large and there appears

to be more spillover from crisis countries to other countries for banking crises than other

types of crises. Because of this and the fact that the most recent crisis is a “pure” banking

crisis we next focus our attention on the individual banking crises that we have identified.



The results reported in Table 5 are for all the banking crises across all periods and it is

useful to be able to compare each crisis window to each other. This comparison is

reported in Table 6. Here the summary statistics are reported for each crisis window

identified in Section 5. The results show that clearly the banking crisis of the 1930’s was

associated with much more severe recessions than any other crisis window. The most

recent crisis has relatively small losses compared to the other major banking crises.



Another interesting point to note about the most recent crisis is that the tail of the

accumulated loss distribution is not as “fat” as for the other preceding crises. Figures 8

and 8a contain boxplot graphs depicting the weighted accumulated percentage loss

distributions for each of the identified banking crises windows. The boxplots graphically

report the same information as Table 6. More importantly they also report the tail of the

distribution. Each boxplot reports a box which runs from the 25th percentile to the 75th

percentile. The red line reports the median. The closer the red line is to the 75th percentile




                                                                                           35

(the top line of the box in this case) the more skewed the distribution. Any observations

that lie outside the inter-quartile range are depicted with red ‘+’ symbols.



Looking at Figures 8 and 8a we see that the most recent crisis is the only crisis without a

very long lower (left) tail. Alternatively, if the distribution is skewed like the other crises

the tail is much shorter. Unlike the other crises, there are no really large losses associated

with the most recent crisis, with the largest accumulated loss being less than 5%.




                                                                                                36

 For Figures 8 and 8a the left tail of the distribution for the 1931-32 crisis is cutoff at -30%. Some
observations with weighted losses less than -30 are not reported.


                                                                                                         37
The conclusions one can draw from these observations is that the recessions associated

with the most recent financial crisis were indeed quite unprecedented given 1) the fact

that the output losses were at the low end of what we would have expected after looking

at the previous major banking crises and 2) we did not observe any really large negative

losses (no fat left tail). This is unprecedented given the previous experience of global

banking crises.



6. Discussion



Our empirical evidence in the preceding section indicates that since 1880 the world has

witnessed 5 global financial (banking) crises.10 This result is based on our aggregation of

several chronologies of banking crises where we calculate a moving sum of the weighted

counts by country size and condition on crisis incidence across continents. When we add

in currency crises and search for global twin crises we only find one in the 1930s. When

we add debt crises to the total we find that no triple global crises occurred. In terms of

incidence weighted by country size the 1930s was the worst global crisis by far, followed

by the recent crisis. Although the number of countries affected by crises was lower than

some of the historic crises, the presence of the US and other major countries makes the

recent crisis important in terms of the number and size of countries involved.



We also measured the output losses in global crises. We used a business cycle dating

algorithm to date classical business cycles and for each recession we computed the

accumulated percentage loss as our measure of the severity of a recession. We found that
10
     This number is increased to 9 crises when we use a larger window in our moving sum.


                                                                                           38
the distribution of recessions associated with crises was highly skewed with a fat left tail

and that the mean accumulated percentage loss was higher for recessions associated with

crises than those that were not associated with crises. We also found that recessions

associated with banking crises were worse than those associated with currency crises and

we found that banking crises appeared to affect all countries more than currency crises.

The losses during recessions associated with currency crises were larger for those

countries having a currency crisis than those that did not.



We then compared the 5 global banking crises that we identified and found that the

recessions associated with the most recent crisis was quite similar in average loss to the

crises of 1907-08 crisis but not as large as in the 1890-91 and the 1913-14 crises. The

other important finding is that the most recent crisis is not associated with a highly

skewed loss distribution. Unlike all other banking crises there are no really large negative

losses. This result is unprecedented.



Thus, global financial crises have occurred before this one. The most recent crisis appears

quite similar in its economic impact to the crisis of 1907-08 in that the recessions

associated with it are small relative to other crises in history. It is certainly not the worst

crisis in recent history and is most likely not the worst crisis since the Great Depression,

at least with respect to output losses of recessions associated with the crisis.




                                                                                            39
Moreover from our evidence we see that there is a clear link between international

financial crises and the severity of recessions. Indeed global crises may help synchronize

the business cycle (Bordo and Helbling 2010).



We summarize some possible factors that can explain the incidence of global financial

crises. First, international financial crises since at least 1857 seem to occur when the US

(the largest economy since the end of the nineteenth century) is involved. One strong

possible reason for the U.S. involvement in global financial crises is that the US banking

system has long been crisis prone. In the pre 1914 era this reflected two basic problems;

unit banking and the absence of an effective lender of last resort. This contrasted with

many of the other advanced countries which had nationwide branch banking systems

which could more easily diversity portfolios across regions and also which had central

banks which had learned by the 1870s to act as lenders of last resort to the financial

system. .London was also important as a focal point for the global transmission of crises

before 1914 but the Bank of England had learned to become an effective lender of last

resort. England had its last banking crisis in 1866.



Since 1914 the US has had a central bank, the Federal Reserve, which was established in

large part to prevent the type of banking panics which characterized the National banking

era (1965 to 1914). However the Fed failed in its role as lender of last resort to allay a

series of banking panics in the 1930s which it is argued precipitated the Great Depression.

In addition the US kept unit banking (in most states) after the establishment of the Fed

until very recently.




                                                                                        40
The US has also since 1865 had a Dual banking system in which state banks ( with lower

capital and reserve requirements) have been regulated by state banking authorities while

national     banks   have   been   regulated   by   the   federal     Comptroller   of   the

Currency .According to White (1982) this fostered regulatory competition, inefficiency

and instability). Moreover for seven decades after 1914 member banks of the Federal

Reserve (all national banks and some state banks) were supervised by the Federal

Reserve). Since the 1930s a new patch work of regulatory agencies has proliferated to

supervise and regulate the diverse parts of the non bank financial system. Heavy

regulation may explain the absence of banking crises in the U.S (as well as the rest of the

world) from the 1930s to the 1970s. The lack of regulatory coordination and failures in

supervision in the U.S. may have been a cause of the recent crisis.



Second, financial globalization seems to be an important part of the story of global

financial crises. The free movement of global capital and frequent sudden stops was a key

element in the global crisis environment of the 19th century (Bordo, Cavallo and

Meissner 2010). These patterns have reemerged in the second era of globalization since

the 1970s.



Third, the international monetary regime was also important in the proliferation of crises.

When the world was on the gold standard both before and after World War I, crises were

transmitted by fixed exchange rates and in the interwar when credibility was low “golden

fetters” prevented many countries from offsetting them. Moreover the alternating waves

of inflation and deflation that reflected the automatic operation of the gold standard pre




                                                                                         41
1914 may have itself triggered financial instability leading to crises (Bordo 1990).

However today most countries (with the principal exception of the European Monetary

Union) are in a managed float regime and global financial crises are present. This

suggests that increasingly tighter linkages between global financial markets and

burgeoning capital flows today operate independently of the exchange rate regime.



Fourth, asset booms fueled by capital inflows and busts triggered by sudden stops were

key elements in many of the international financial crises pre WWI. In the interwar the

1920s stock market boom was similar in many respects to the railroad booms of the

nineteenth century and was fueled by international capital flows (Eichengreen 1992,

Bordo 2003). Finance for both the tech boom of the late 90s and the recent property

booms in the US and elsewhere had an important international element manifest in the

international scope of securitization and the global proliferation of derivatives.



Policy Lessons



What are some of the policy lessons to be learned from the historical record of global

financial crises?



First, the historical record suggests that international financial crises before 1914 largely

burned themselves out. Countries which had effective LLRs in place like Britain

insulated themselves from them. Others did not and like the US had to suspend

convertibility of bank liabilities into currency. Also the absence of a lender of last resort




                                                                                          42
in the U.S. and key flaws in its banking system made it an important catalyst for

international crises because of its economic importance. Moreover in this era although

there was minimal policy coordination eg between the Bank of England and the Banque

de France in the 1907 crisis, it was minimal and episodic ( Flandreau 1997, Bordo and

Schwartz 1998).In the interwar period the League of Nations was largely ineffective in

coordinating rescues as were other intergovernmental arrangements (Bordo and Schwartz

1999).



In the postwar the IMF and other agencies has dealt with currency crises and debt crises

to some effect. The resolution of banking crises has been largely done by national

monetary authorities. The growing problem of liability dollarization prevented LLR

operations in dollars in the Asian countries hit by crisis in 1997-98. Their problems were

solved by massive international rescues. A similar problem arose in the aftermath of the

recent crisis.



In the recent crisis the question is moot whether international policy coordination was

effective. Many countries did lender of last resort actions to stem the financial crisis in

their own countries. They also pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policy. These

actions likely prevented the recession from being worse. It is not clear that national

authorities pursued these actions because of international arrangements. More likely they

did it because they had learned some lessons from the Great Depression.




                                                                                        43
The lesson from history that countries with sound financial systems, effective lenders of

last resort and efficient financial supervision and regulation fared better in global

financial crises than others has held up in the recent crisis ( Bordo and Meissner 2005).

Countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand whose banks were less exposed to

mortgage backed securities, whose banks did not have SIVs and which did not have

under regulated shadow banking systems largely avoided the recent crisis.



Second, what seems to be novel about the recent crisis is the extent to which financial

innovation partly in response to the supervision and regulation of the banking systems

and financial markets in place in the US and other advanced countries led to the

development of securitization, derivatives and off balance sheet entities designed to

evade capital requirements. These innovations were globally linked through financial

globalization. This increased global systemic risk. In earlier eras, stock (and bond)

markets across countries were linked together during crises but the linkages are much

tighter today and occur across virtually all international financial markets. This

development may make the case for enhanced global financial supervision and regulation

to ameliorate the systemic risks. Although how to achieve this in the face of the sanctity

of sovereignty is problematic to say the least. It also may make the case for capital

controls. However it is not clear that the inefficiencies of widespread capital controls and

the inevitability of their evasion are worth the effort.



Finally, the fact that this crisis was one of the least costly of the global financial crises

suggests that perhaps policy makers in the countries affected learned some of the lessons




                                                                                          44
from the past global financial crises. They followed aggressive expansionary monetary

and fiscal policies. This was certainly not the case before World War II.




                                                                                  45
