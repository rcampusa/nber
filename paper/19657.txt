                                             ABSTRACT

This study tests the importance of Ricardian technology differences for international trade. The empirical
analysis has three comparative advantages: including emerging and advanced economies, isolating
panel variation regarding the link between productivity and exports, and exploiting heterogeneous
technology diffusion from immigrant communities in the United States for identification. The latter
instruments are developed by combining panel variation on the development of new technologies across
U.S. cities with historical settlement patterns for migrants from countries. The instrumented elasticity
of export growth on the intensive margin with respect to the exporter's productivity growth is between
1.6 and 2.4 depending upon weighting.

1     Introduction

Trade among countries due to technology di¤erences is a core principle in international eco-
nomics. Countries with heterogeneous technologies focus on producing goods in which they
have comparative advantages; subsequent exchanges a¤ord higher standards of living than are
possible in isolation. This Ricardian …nding is the …rst lesson in most undergraduate courses
on trade, and it undergirds many modelling frameworks on which recent theoretical advances
build (e.g., Dornbusch et al. 1977, Eaton and Kortum 2002, Costinot et al. 2012). In response
to Stanislaw Ulam’s challenge to name a true and nontrivial theory in social sciences, Paul
Samuelson chose this principle of comparative advantage due to technology di¤erences.

    While empirical tests date back to David Ricardo (1817), quantifying technology di¤er-
ences across countries and industries is extremely di¢ cult. Even when observable proxies for
latent technology di¤erences are developed (e.g., labor productivity, industrial specialization),
cross-sectional analyses risk confounding heterogeneous technologies with other country-industry
determinants of trade. Panel data models can further remove time-invariant characteristics
(e.g., distances, colonial histories) and a¤ord explicit controls of time-varying determinants (e.g.,
factor accumulation, economic development, trading blocs). Quantifying the dynamics of un-
even technology advancement across countries is an even more challenging task, however, and
whether identi…ed relationships represent causal linkages remains a concern. These limitations
are particularly acute for developing and emerging economies. This is unfortunate as non-OECD
economies have experienced some of the more dramatic changes in technology sets and manufac-
turing trade over the last thirty years, providing a useful laboratory for quantifying Ricardian
e¤ects.

   This study contributes to the empirical trade literature on Ricardian advantages in three
ways. First, it utilizes a panel dataset that includes many countries at various development
stages (e.g., Bolivia, France, South Africa), a large group of focused manufacturing industries,
and an extended time frame. The 1975-2000 World Trade Flows (WTF) database provides
export data for each bilateral route (exporter-importer-industry-year), and data from the United
Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) provide labor productivity estimates.
The developed data platform includes substantially more variation in trade and productivity
di¤erences across countries than previously feasible.

    The second contribution is to provide panel estimates of the elasticity of export growth with
respect to productivity development. Following the theoretical work of Costinot et al. (2012)
that is discussed below, estimations include …xed e¤ects for importer-industry-year and exporter-
importer-year. The importer-industry-year …xed e¤ects control, for example, for trade barriers
in each importing country by industry segment, while the exporter-importer-year …xed e¤ects

                                                 1
control for the overall levels of trade between countries (e.g., the gravity model), labor cost struc-
tures in the exporter, and similar. While these controls account for overall trade and technology
levels by country, permanent di¤erences in the levels of these variables across industries within a
country are used for identi…cation. This paper is the …rst to quantify Ricardian elasticities when
further modelling cross-sectional …xed e¤ects for exporter-importer-industry observations. This
panel approach only exploits variation within industry-level bilateral trading routes, providing
a substantially stronger empirical test of the theory.

   The third and most important contribution is to provide instruments for the labor pro-
ductivity development in exporting countries. Instruments are essential in this setting due to
typical concerns: omitted variable biases for the labor productivity measure, reverse causality,
and the potential for signi…cant measurement error regarding the productivity di¤erences across
countries. The instruments exploit heterogeneous technology di¤usion from past migrant com-
munities in the United States for identi…cation. These instruments are developed by combining
panel variation on the development of new technologies across US cities during the 1975-2000
period with historical settlement patterns for migrants and their ancestors from countries that
are recorded in the 1980 Census of Populations.

    The foundation for these instruments is the modelling of Ricardian advantages through di¤er-
ences across countries in their access to the US technology frontier. Recent research emphasizes
the importance of immigrants in frontier economies for the di¤usion of technologies to their home
countries (e.g., Saxenian 2002, 2006, Kerr 2008, Papageorgiou and Spilimbergo 2008). These
global connections and networks facilitate the transfer of both codi…ed and tacit details of new
innovations, and Kerr (2008) …nds foreign countries realize manufacturing gains from stronger
scienti…c integration, especially with respect to computer-oriented technologies. Multiple studies
document speci…c channels sitting behind this heterogeneous di¤usion.1

    As invention is disproportionately concentrated in the United States, these ethnic networks
signi…cantly in‡uence technology opportunity sets in the short-run for following economies. This
study uses heterogeneous technology di¤usion from the United States to better quantify the im-
portance of technology di¤erences across countries in explaining trade patterns. Trade between
the United States and foreign countries is excluded throughout this study due to network ef-
fects operating alongside technology transfers. Attention is instead placed on how di¤erential
   1
    Channels for this technology transfer include communications among scientists and engineers (e.g., Saxenian
2002, Kerr 2008, Agrawal et al. 2011), trade ‡ows (e.g., Rauch 2001, Rauch and Trindade 2002), and foreign
direct investment (e.g., Kugler and Rapoport 2007, 2012, Foley and Kerr 2013). Recent research further quanti…es
the role of international labor mobility in these exchanges (e.g., Saxenian 2006, Kapur and McHale 2005, Nanda
and Khanna 2010, and Obukhova 2008, 2009).
  Other sources of heterogeneous technology frontiers are geographic distances to major R&D nations (e.g.,
Keller 2002b), the innovative e¤orts of trading partners (e.g., Grossman and Helpman 1991, Coe and Helpman
1995, Coe et al. 1997), or international patenting decisions (e.g., Eaton and Kortum 1999). Keller (2004) reviews
the technology transfer literature.


                                                       2
technology transfer from the United States— especially its industry-level variation by country—
in‡uences exports from the foreign country to other nations. Said di¤erently, the study quanti-
…es the extent to which India’s exports, for example, grow faster in industries where technology
transfer from the United States to India is particularly strong.

    The instrumented elasticity of export growth on the intensive margin with respect to the
exporter’s productivity growth is 2.4 in unweighted estimations. The elasticity is 1.6 when
using sample weights that interact worldwide trade volumes for exporters and importers in
the focal industry. Thus, the study estimates that a 10% increase in the labor productivity
of an exporter for an industry leads to about a 20% expansion in export volumes within that
industry compared to other industries for the exporter. This instrumented elasticity is weaker
than Costinot et al.’s (2012) preferred estimate of 6.5 derived through producer price data for
OECD countries in 1997, but it is quite similar to their 2.7 elasticity with labor productivity
data that are most comparable to this study. The two analyses are also qualitatively similar in
terms of their relationships to uninstrumented elasticities. This study does not …nd evidence of
substantial adjustments in the extensive margin of the group of countries to which the exporter
trades. These results are robust to sample composition adjustments and variations on estimation
techniques. Extensions quantify the extent to which heterogeneous technology transfer can be
distinguished from a Rybczynski e¤ect operating within manufacturing, evaluate di¤erences in
education levels or time in the United States for past migrants in instrument design, and test
the robustness to controlling for direct ethnic patenting growth by industry in the United States.

    This study concludes that comparative advantages are an important determinant of trade;
moreover, Ricardian di¤erences are relevant for explaining changes in trade patterns over time.
These panel exercises are closest in spirit to the industrial specialization work of Harrigan (1997b)
and the structural Ricardian model of Costinot et al. (2012). Other tests of the Ricardian
model are MacDougall (1951, 1952), Stern (1962), Golub and Hsieh (2000), Morrow (2010), Chor
(2010), Shikher (2010), Fieler (2011), Costinot and Donaldson (2012), Caliendo and Parro (2012),
Bombardini et al. (2012), and Levchenko and Zhang (2012). The comparative advantages of
this work are in its substantial attention to non-OECD economies, the stricter panel assessment
using heterogeneous technology di¤usion, and the instruments built o¤ of di¤erential access
to the US frontier. Work on migration-trade linkages dates back to Gould (1994), Head and
Reis (1998), and Rauch and Trindade (2002), with Bo and Jacks (2012), Bahar and Rapoport
(2013), and Cohen et al. (2013) being recent contributions that provide references to the lengthy
subsequent literature. This paper di¤ers from these studies in its focus on technology transfer’s
role for export promotion as an independent mechanism from migrant networks. In addition to
contributing to the trade literature, the study documents for emerging economies an economic
consequence of emigration to frontier economies like the United States.2

2     Theory and Estimating Framework

This section develops the basic estimating equation from the multi-country and multi-industry
model of Costinot et al. (2012). This framework builds o¤ the model of Eaton and Kortum
(2002) to articulate appropriate estimation of Ricardian advantages. A simple application builds
ethnic networks and heterogeneous technology di¤usion into this theory. The boundaries of the
framework and the statistical properties of the estimating equation are discussed.3


2.1     Costinot et al. (2012) Theoretical Framework

A world economy is comprised of I countries and K industries or goods. Labor is the sole factor
of production and there are constant returns to scale in the production of each good. Labor is
perfectly mobile across industries and immobile across countries. Li and wi are the number of
workers and the wage rate in country i, respectively. Consumers consume their full wages in each
period. Accordingly, time subscripts are omitted until the estimating equation is introduced.
Countries are free to produce or trade all goods. Each good k 2 K has an in…nite number of
varieties indexed by ! 2        [1; : : : ; +1]. zik (!) represents the number of units of the !th
variety of good k that can be produced with one unit of labor in country i.

   Following Eaton and Kortum (2002), zik (!) is a random variable drawn independently for
each triplet (i; k; !) from a Fréchet distribution,

                                 Fik (z) = exp[ (z=zik ) ], for all z     0,                              (1)

where zik > 0 and > 1. Thus, technological di¤erences across countries and industries depend
on two parameters, zik and . The …rst parameter zik captures the fundamental productivity
of country i in industry k, which a¤ects the productivity of all producers (e.g., institutions,
climate). For each industry, the cross-country variation of this zik parameter governs the cross-
country variation in relative labor productivity that sits at the core of the standard Ricardian
model. A larger zik raises the absolute advantage for trade for exporter i in industry k. The second
parameter models the intra-industry heterogeneity that exists due to the scope for idiosyncratic
di¤erences in technological know-how across varieties. This variation is the same in all countries
and industries, and parameterizes the impact of changes in fundamental productivity levels
zik on aggregate trade ‡ows. A larger implies a tighter distribution that limits the scope for
comparative advantage across nations.
trade. Their concern, however, is with the calculation of welfare consequences for US natives as a consequence
of immigration due to shifts in trade patterns.
    3
      Dornbusch et al. (1977), Wilson (1980), Baxter (1992), Alvarez and Lucas (2007), and Costinot (2009)
provide further theoretical underpinnings for comparative advantage.

    Trade frictions have iceberg costs such that for each unit of good k shipped from exporter i
to importer j, only 1=dkij 1 units arrive, with dkii = 1 and dkil dkij dkjl for any third country l
to rule out cross-country arbitrage opportunities. Perfect competition in markets and constant
returns to scale in production imply that the price pkj (!) paid by buyers of variety ! of good k
in any country j is
                                       pkj (!) = min[ckij (!)],                                 (2)
                                                                i2I

                                is the cost of producing and delivering one unit of this variety
from country i to country j. For each variety ! of good k, buyers in country j select the best
price available from around the world. An increase in country i’s e¢ ciency for good j lowers the
price it must charge.

    Representative consumers in each country have a two-tier utility function. The upper tier is
Cobb-Doublas, and the preference parameter kj measures the share of expenditure on varieties
from industry k in country j. The lower tier is constant elasticity of substitution (CES), and
  k
  j is the elasticity of substitution between varieties. Accordingly, expenditures are such that in
any importer j, total expenditure on variety ! of good k is

which has an intuitive interpretation that closely connects to a similar expression in Eaton and
Kortum (2002). The righthand terms express the overall economic size of the importer j and its
preferences over goods. The lefthand fraction describes the extent to which the exporter is the
lowest cost producer of the good, taking into account geographic distances, production costs,
technology levels, and the underlying heterogeneity in varieties for countries. Under assumptions
of balanced trade, the relatives wages around the world can further be determined.

   Costinot et al. (2012) show that equation (4) provides the foundation for estimating an
econometric equation of the form
                                                                k
                                         ln x~kij =    ij   +   j        zik ) + "kij ;
                                                                    + ln(~                                                    (5)

                                                                5
where x~kij represents "corrected" trade ‡ows that adjust for country openness. Similarly, z~ik
represents observed productivity, given that not every country produces every good as it can
import goods from other countries. ij and kj are vectors of exporter-importer and importer-
industry …xed e¤ects. Comparing equations (5) and (4) shows the basic function of these …xed
e¤ects. The importer-industry …xed e¤ects control for the righthand terms about the importer
and its preferences over goods. Importer-industry …xed e¤ects also account for the denominator
of the lefthand fraction, given that it is a worldwide aggregate for an industry. The exporter-
importer …xed e¤ects capture the numerator’s terms, which emphasize cost levels in the exporter
and distances between the two countries. Under the assumption that the delivery cost term dkij
in the numerator can be expressed in proportionate terms over these two vectors of …xed e¤ects
(e.g., dkij = dij dkj ), speci…cation (5) provides an unbiased estimate of the parameter. An
alternative assumption is that the residual di¤erences in delivery costs after controlling for these
vectors of …xed e¤ects are uncorrelated with the focal productivity level z~ik .


2.2    Estimating Equation

This study quanti…es this Ricardian theory through worldwide trade in manufacturing goods.
Rather than attempting to jointly model Ricardian advantages with other determinants of trade
(e.g., Davis and Weinstein 2001, Morrow 2010), estimations isolate the role of technology di¤er-
ences through the structure outlined by Costinot et al. (2012) along with …rst di¤erencing and
instrumental variables. The …rst step is to extend equation (5) to include time t,
                                                       k
                              ln x~kijt =    ijt   +   jt        zitk ) + "kijt :
                                                            + ln(~                              (6)

It is important to note that this extension is being applied to the …xed e¤ect terms. Thus, the
exporter-importer …xed e¤ects in the cross-sectional format become exporter-importer-year …xed
e¤ects in a panel format. The empirical work below estimates equation (6) for reference, but
most of the speci…cations instead examine a …rst-di¤erenced form,
                                                       k
                               ln x~kijt =   ijt   +   jt   +         zitk ) + "kijt ;
                                                                   ln(~                         (7)

where the …xed e¤ects and error term are appropriately adjusted.

   The motivation for …rst di¤erencing is stronger empirical isolation of the parameter. By
themselves, exporter-importer-year and importer-industry-year …xed e¤ects in equation (6) allow
identi…cation of the parameter in two ways: 1) longitudinal changes in z~itk over time and 2)
long-term di¤erences in z~itk across industries for the exporter. In a cross-sectional estimation of
equation (5), it is not feasible to distinguish between these forms. This second e¤ect persists
when extending the equation (6) to a panel setting because the exporter-importer-year …xed
e¤ects ijt only account for the aggregate technology changes for exporters.

                                                       6
    Whether estimating the parameter through both forms of variation is appropriate depends
upon model assumptions, beliefs about unmeasured factors, and measurement error. It is helpful
to illustrate by considering the exports of Germany in automobiles. The study examines trade
over the 1980-1999 period. Throughout this period, Germany held strong technological advan-
tages and labor productivity for manufacturing automobiles relative to the rest of the world.
Over the course of the period, this productivity also changed in relative terms. If one can fea-
sibly isolate these productivity variables, then having both forms of variation is an advantage.
A second and related issue is that …rst di¤erencing the data exacerbates the downward bias
that measurement error causes for estimates of the parameter. There are plenty of reasons to
suspect non-trivial measurement error in industry-level labor productivity estimates developed
from the UNIDO database.

     On the other hand, the earlier discussion about the delivery cost term dkij highlights why
removing long-term di¤erences might be an advantage. The basic identi…cation constraint for
the econometric analysis is that technology levels of exporters cannot be distinguished from
other unobservable factors that also vary by exporter-industry or exporter-industry-year for the
long-term technology levels and their longitudinal changes, respectively. The …rst is particularly
worrisome given its general nature. First di¤erencing is not foolproof against omitted factors,
but it does require that the changes in these factors correlate with the changes in the focal
productivity level in the exporters of z~itk . For the delivery cost example that was outlined above,
…rst di¤erencing permits the allowable proportionate structure dkij = dij dkj to be extended to
dkijt = dijt dkjt dkij , where the third term represents the long-term delivery costs for the exporter
to the importer by industry. This latter approach of panel estimation, while very common in
micro-economic analyses, has yet to be extended to the Ricardian literature.

    Beyond this discussion, a few other notes about the estimation of (7) are warranted. The
dependent variable is bilateral manufacturing exports by exporter-importer-industry-year. The
lack of trade for a large number of bilateral routes at the industry level creates econometric
challenges with a log speci…cation. These zero-valued exports are predicted by the model as
an exporter is rarely the lowest cost producer for all countries in an industry. This study
approaches this problem by separately testing the intensive and extensive margins of trade.
Most of the focus is on the intensive margin of trade expansion, where the dependent variable
is the log growth in the value of bilateral exports ln x~kijt . The intensive margin of exports
captures both quantities e¤ects and price e¤ects (e.g., Acemoglu and Ventura 2002, Hummels
and Klenow 2005). In tests of extensive margin of trade expansion— that is, commencing exports
to new import destinations— the dependent variable becomes a dichotomous indicator variable
for whether measurable exports exist. Di¤erences in the sample construction for these two tests
are discussed when describing the trade dataset.

   Beyond the model’s background, the exporter-importer-year …xed e¤ects perform several

                                                  7
functions. They intuitively require that Germany’s technology expansion for auto manufacturing
exceed its technology expansion for chemicals manufacturing if export growth is stronger in autos
than chemicals. Thus, these …xed e¤ects remove aggregate trade growth by exporter-importer
pairs common across industries. These uniform expansions could descend from factors speci…c to
one country of the pair (e.g., economic growth and business cycles, factor accumulations, terms
of trade and price levels) or be speci…c to the bilateral trading pair (e.g., trade agreements,
preferences4 ). This framework is thus a powerful check against omitted variables biases, helping
to isolate the Ricardian impetus for trade from relative factor scarcities and other determinants of
trade. The …xed e¤ects also control for the gravity covariates commonly used in empirical trade
studies. National changes in factor endowments may still in‡uence industries di¤erentially due
to the Rybczynski e¤ect, which is explicitly tested for below. The importer-industry-year …xed
e¤ects control for tari¤s imposed upon an industry in the importing country. More broadly, they
also control for the aggregate growth in worldwide trade in each industry, relative price changes,
and the potential for trade due to increasing returns to scale (e.g., Helpman and Krugman 1985,
Antweiler and Tre‡er 2002).

    More subtly, a key di¤erence between multi-country Ricardian frameworks and the classic
two-country model of Dornbusch et al. (1977) is worth emphasizing. This di¤erence in‡uences
how the comparative static of increasing a single country-industry technology parameter z~itk ,
ceteris paribus, is viewed. The multi-country theoretical framework allows for increases in z~itk
to reduce exports on some bilateral routes for the exporter-industry. This e¤ect is due to
general equilibrium pressures on input costs and extreme value distributions. The treatment
e¤ect is measured across all export destinations and thus captures the general Ricardian pattern
embedded in the model. This e¤ect, however, is a net e¤ect that may include reduction of
exports on some routes.5


2.3     Heterogeneous Technology Di¤usion and Ricardian Trade

While the Ricardian framework assigns a causal relationship of export growth to technology de-
velopment, in practice the empirical estimation of speci…cation (7) can be confounded by reverse
causality or omitted variables operating by exporter-industry-year even after …rst di¤erencing.
Reverse causality may arise if engagement in exporting leads to greater technology adoption,
perhaps through learning-by-doing or for compliance with an importer’s standards and regula-
tions. An example of an exporter-industry-year omitted factor is a change in government policies
to promote a speci…c industry, perhaps leading to large technology investments and the adoption
   4
    Hunter and Markusen (1988) and Hunter (1991) …nd these stimulants account for up to 20% of world trade.
   5
    Costinot et al. (2012) provides a more detailed discussion, including the extent to which the industry ordering
of the two-country model is found in the relative ordering of exports for countries.



                                                        8
of policies that favor the chosen industry’s exports relative to other manufacturing industries.
This would lead to an upward bias in the estimated parameter.6

   Heterogeneous technology transfer from the United States provides an empirical foothold
against these complications. Consider a leader-follower model where the technology state in
exporter i and industry k is
                                 z~itk = z~tk;U S k
                                                  i
                                                         k
                                                    it Mit :                            (8)
z~tk;U S is the exogenously determined US technology frontier for each industry and year. Two
general shifters govern the extent to which foreign nations access this frontier. First, ki models
time-invariant di¤erences in the access to or importance of US technologies to exporter i and
industry k; potentially arising due to geographic separation (e.g., Keller 2002b), heterogeneous
production techniques (e.g., Davis and Weinstein 2001, Acemoglu and Zilibotti 2001), or similar
factors. The shifter it models longitudinal changes in the utilization of US technologies common
to all industries within exporter i, for example, changes due to declines in communication and
transportation costs, greater general scienti…c or business integration, and so on. In what follows,
both of these shifters could further be made speci…c to an exporter-importer pair.

    By themselves, these …rst three terms of model (8) describe the realities of technology dif-
fusion but are not useful for identi…cation when estimating speci…cation (7). The technology
frontier z~tk;U S is captured by the importer-industry-year …xed e¤ects, the bilateral ki shifter is
removed in the …rst di¤erencing, and the longitudinal it shifter is captured in the exporter-
industry-year …xed e¤ects. The …nal term Mitk , however, describes di¤erential access that the
migrants to the United States from exporter i provide to the technologies used in industry k.
This term models the recent empirical literature that …nds that overseas diaspora and ethnic
communities aid technology transfer from frontier countries to their home countries. If there is
su¢ cient industry variation in this technology transfer, once removing the many …xed e¤ects
embedded into speci…cation (7), then this transfer may provide an exogenous instrument to the
exporter productivity parameter z~itk in a way that allows very powerful identi…cation for the role
of Ricardian advantages in trade.

   The design of this instrument combines spatial variation in historical settlement patterns
in the United States of migrant groups from countries with spatial variation in where new
technologies emerged over the period of the study. The instrument takes the form
                                                    "             #
                                    X                 T echk;A S
                                                           c;t
                             Mitk =     M %i;c;1980        k;A S
                                                                    ;                     (9)
                                    c2C
                                                      T echc;1980

   6
    More speci…cally, the innovation in industrial policy support must be non-proportional across manufacturing
industries. Long-term policies to support certain industries more than others are accounted for by the …rst
di¤erencing. Uniform changes in support across industries are also jointly accounted for by panel …xed e¤ects.



                                                      9
where c indexes US cities. M %i;c;1980 is the share of individuals tracing their ancestry to country
i— de…ned in more detail below and including …rst-generation immigrants— that are located in
city c in 1980. These shares sum to 100% across US cities. The bracketed fraction is a technology
ratio de…ned for an industry k. The ratio measures for each city how much patenting grew in
industry k relative to its initial level in 1980. The fraction exceeds one when when a city’s
level of invention for industry k grows from the base period, and it falls below one if the city’s
invention for an industry weakens.

    The instrument thus interacts the spatial distribution across US cities of migrants from
exporter i with the city-by-city degree to which technological development for industry k grew
in locations. By summing across cities, equation (9) develops a total metric for exporter i and
industry k that can be …rst di¤erenced to instrument for ln(~      zitk ) in equation (7). A subtle but
important point is that the instrument can only work in a …rst-di¤erenced format (or equivalent
panel data model with bilateral route …xed e¤ects). This restriction is because the expression
(9) does not have a meaningful cross-sectional level to it— for all countries and industries, the
value of Mitk is equal to one in 1980 by de…nition. As such, Mitk cannot predict the cross-section of
trade in 1980. However, Mitk does provide insight about changes in technology opportunity sets
over time that can be used for identi…cation in estimations that consider changes in technology
and trade over time.

    Two other points about the instrument’s design are important to bring out as they specif-
ically relate to potential concerns about the instrument. One concern would be that migrants
from exporter i select cities speci…cally to acquire technologies useful for their home country’s
exports. This seems less worrisome perhaps for individual migrants, but it is quite plausible
when contemplating a German automobile manufacturer opening a new facility in the United
States (e.g., Alcacer and Chung 2007). The instrument seeks to rule out this concern by …xing
the city distribution of migrants from exporter i at their city locations in 1980. This approach
eliminates endogenous resorting, and the results below are also shown to be robust to focusing
on second-generation and earlier migrants.

    A second concern is one of reverse causality. The United States relies extensively on immi-
grants for its science and engineering labor force, with …rst-generation immigrations accounting
for about a quarter of the bachelor’s educated workforce and half of those with PhDs. Moreover,
immigrants account for the majority of the recent growth in the US science and engineering
workforce. The spatial patterns of new high-skilled immigrants frequently build upon ethnic
enclaves and impact the innovation levels in those locations (e.g., Kerr and Lincoln 2010, Hunt
and Gauthier-Loiselle 2010, Peri et al. 2013). Thus, a worry could be that the technology
growth for cities in model (9) is endogenous. The concern would be that Germany is rapidly
developing innovations and new technologies for the automobile industry, and this expansion is


                                                  10
simultaneously leading to greater exports from Germany and the migration of German scientists
that are patenting automobile technologies to the United States.

    This concern is addressed in several ways throughout this study, including sample decompo-
sition exercises, lag structure tests, and similar exercises. The most straightforward safeguard,
however, is already built into model (9). The patenting data, as described below, allow us to
separate the probable ethnicities of inventors in the United States. By focusing on inventors
of Anglo-Saxon ethnic heritage, one can remove much of this reverse causality concern. The
Anglo-Saxon group accounts for about 70% of US inventors during the time period studied, and
so this group re‡ects the bulk and direction of US technological development.7

    Addressing these concerns also provides the approach (9) with a conceptual advantage with
respect to the …xed e¤ect estimation strategy. The …rst di¤erencing in speci…cation (7) controls
for the initial distributions M %i;c;1980 , and the importer-industry-year …xed e¤ects kjt control for
the technology growth ratio for industry k. This separation is not perfect due to the summation
over cities, but it is closely mimicked. Thus, the identi…cation in these estimations comes o¤
these particular interactions. This provides a strong lever against concerns of omitted factors
or reverse causality, and the well-measured US data can provide instruments that overcome the
downward bias in coe¢ cients due to measurement error.


3     Data Preparation

This section describes the key data employed in this study and their preparation.


3.1     Labor Productivity Data

Productivity measures z~itk are taken from the Industrial Statistics Database of the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). The UNIDO collects industry-level manufactur-
ing statistics for The International Yearbook of Industrial Statistics and specialized publications
on topics like development and competition. Researchers at the UNIDO supplement the data
resources of the OECD with national records for non-OECD members, creating a unique global
resource. The UNIDO’s stated objective is the compilation of internationally comparable and
internally consistent series (e.g., variable de…nitions, accounting units, collection procedures).
   7
     Very strong crowding-in or crowding-out of natives by immigrant scientists and engineers would create a bias
in the Anglo-Saxon trend itself. Kerr and Lincoln (2010) …nd very limited evidence of either e¤ect at the city
level for the United States during this time period and for the time horizons considered here (i.e., …rst di¤erencing
over …ve-year periods).




                                                         11
   The UNIDO data provide an unbalanced panel over countries, industries, and time periods,
and the availability of these data are the key determinant of this study’s sample design. Esti-
mations consider manufacturing industries at the three-digit level of the International Standard
Industrial Classi…cation system (ISIC3). Data construction starts by calculating the annual
labor productivity in available industries and countries during the 1980-1999 period. These
annual measures are then collapsed into the mean labor productivity level for each …ve-year
period from 1980-1984 to 1995-1999. This aggregation into …ve-year time periods a¤ords a
more balanced panel by abstracting away from the occasional years when an otherwise reported
country-industry is not observed. The higher aggregation is also computationally necessary
below due to the tremendous number of …xed e¤ects considered.

    These labor productivity measures are …rst di¤erenced in log format for inclusion in equation
(7). Thus, an exporter i and industry k is included if it is observed in the UNIDO database in
two adjacent periods. Sample inclusion also requires that the country-industry be reported in
two observations at least …ve years apart (e.g., to prevent an included observation only being
present in 1989 and 1991). The main estimations consider the three change periods of 1980-
1984!1985-1989, 1985-1989!1990-1994, and 1990-1994!1995-1999.

    Table 1a describes the 88 exporting countries included. Column 2 provides a count of the
number of periods the country is included in after the …rst di¤erence is taken, with a maximum
of three changes. Column 3 documents the count of bilateral route observations included at
the exporter-importer-industry level for the intensive-margin estimations. The total observation
count is 103,839 intensive-margin changes for an exporter-importer-industry. Countries di¤er
in their observation counts, even if observed for the same number of periods, due to variations
in their industry-level reporting in the UNIDO database and minimum requirements for export
volumes discussed below.

    Column 4 documents the average manufacturing productivity levels for countries, expressed
in US dollars. While direct comparisons across countries are limited with an unbalanced panel,
productivity di¤erences between industrialized countries and developing nations are clearly evi-
dent. Oil-producing countries (e.g., Kuwait, Norway) have the highest average labor productiv-
ity levels, with Ireland, Japan and Singapore among the highest when excluding oil producers.
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar are among the lowest levels recorded. A small num-
ber of country-industry observations with under ten employees or very problematic data are
excluded. Column 5 documents the mean growth rate in labor productivity for each country
over its observations. These growth rates are …ve-year di¤erences, with outliers winsorized at
their 2% and 98% levels for reporting. Hong Kong, Myanmar, Peru, and Syria have the highest
growth rates, while the Dominican Republic, Tanzania, and Romania show the sharpest declines.

   Table 1b provides similar statistics for the 26 industries, aggregating over countries. Industry

                                               12
353 (Petroleum re…neries) has the highest average labor productivity, while industry 322 (Wear-
ing apparel, except footwear) has the lowest. Productivity growth is strongest in industries 382
and 383 (Machinery, except electrical, and Machinery, electric). Productivity growth rates are
lowest in industry 323 (Leather products) and industry 361 (Pottery, china, earthenware).8


3.2     Export Volumes

Bilateral exports x~kijt are taken from the 1975-2000 World Trade Flows Database (WTF) devel-
oped by Feenstra et al. (2005). This rich data source documents product-level values of bilateral
trade for most countries from 1980-1999. Similar to the development of the labor productivity
variables, these product ‡ows are aggregated into …ve-year periods from 1980-1984 to 1995-1999
and then …rst di¤erenced in log format. Each productivity growth observation available with
the UNIDO dataset is paired with industry-level bilateral export observations from that country.
All exporting countries other than the United States are included.

    The majority of export volumes for bilateral routes are zero-valued, which creates challenges
for the estimation of equation (7). It is also the case that the minimum threshold of trade
that can be consistently measured across countries and industries is US $100k in the WTF
database. While Feenstra et al. (2005) are able to incorporate smaller trading levels for some
countries, these values are ignored to maintain a consistent threshold across observations. To
accommodate these conditions, the empirical approach separately studies the extensive and
intensive margins of export expansion. Mean export volumes are taken across exporter-importer-
industry observations for …ve-year time periods. For the extensive margin, entry into exports
along an exporter-importer-industry route is de…ned as exports greater than US $100k.9

    Columns 6-8 of Tables 1a and 1b describe the WTF data. These descriptives focus on the
intensive-margin estimations that require exporter-importer-industry observations maintain the
minimum threshold of trade volume. Columns 6 and 7 provide comparable statistics about the
mean export levels and growth rates for included routes. Germany and Japan have the highest
average volumes, and Nicaragua and El Salvador have the lowest average volumes. Export growth
rates are strongest in Nicaragua, Congo, and Costa Rica, and they are lowest in Guatemala and
Zimbabwe. From an industry perspective, trade volumes have the highest average values in
industries 382-384 (Machinery and Transportation equipment), and the lowest average volumes
    8
      Most Ricardian models suggest using labor productivity to measure comparative advantage. This is fortunate
in that manufacturing output and employment data are among the most available metrics for the broad grouping
of countries under study. Labor is typically the only factor of production in Ricardian models, so a natural
extension might be total factor productivity that also allows for capital accumulation as well. Unfortunately,
capital data at the country-industry level for this sample is too sparse to be of bene…t in a panel study. An
earlier version of this paper presents results using output to measure industrial specialization.
    9
      A break exists in data collection procedures at 1984. This break does not have a signi…cant impact on
ISIC3-level export volumes, and the results are robust to dropping the initial period.


                                                      13
are observed in industry 361 (Pottery, china, earthenware). Industry 383 (Machinery, electric)
has the highest growth rate, while industries 353 (Petroleum re…neries) and 371 (Iron and steel)
have the lowest.

    Column 8 of Table 1a documents the share of total WTF exports for countries that are
included in this sample. The main reasons why exports are not included are lack of corresponding
UNIDO labor productivity estimates or that the exports are going to the United States. This
sample accounts for 78% of exports to destinations other than United States from these countries
(about 63% if exports to the United States are included in the denominator). Column 8 of Table
1b provides comparable data for industries. The sample accounts for 69% of exports in these
industries to destinations other than United States. This share is lower than 78% due to the
inclusion of exporters not captured in Table 1a. Much of the decline on the industry side comes
through limited representation of major petroleum producers.10


3.3     US Historical Settlement Patterns

The …rst building block for the instrument is the historical settlement patterns of migrants from
each country M %i;c;1980 . These data are taken from the 1980 Census of Populations, which is
the earliest US census to collect the detailed ancestry of respondents (as distinguished from
immigration status or place of birth). The detailed ancestry codes include 392 categories with
positive responses, and this study maps these categories to the UNIDO records. Respondents
are asked primary and secondary ancestries, but the classi…cations only focus on the primary
…eld given the many missing values in the secondary …eld. There are multiple ancestry groups
that map to the same country, but the mapping procedure limits each ancestry group to map
to just one UNIDO country. Categories not linked to a speci…c UNIDO country are dropped
(e.g., Western Europe not elsewhere classi…ed, Cosswack, Ossetian). In total, 89% of the US
population in 1980 is mapped.

   Metropolitan statistical areas, which will be referred to as cities for expositional ease, are
identi…ed using the 1% Metro Sample. This dataset is a 1-in-100 random sample of the US
population in 1980 and is designed to provide accurate portraits of cities. The set C over which
M %i;c;1980 is calculated includes 210 cities from the 1980 census …les are linked to the US patent
data described next. The primary measures of M %i;c;1980 include all individuals regardless of
age or education level to form M %i;c;1980 , only dropping those in group quarters (e.g., military
barracks) or not living in an urban area. Extensions test variations on these themes.
  10
     Price de‡ators are not available for this sample (exports or labor productivity data). To the extent that
exporter-industry-year de‡ators are comprised of exporter-year, industry-year, and exporter-industry compo-
nents, the …xed e¤ects and …rst di¤erencing strategy will control for them automatically. Residual exporter-
industry-year trends could bias OLS estimations. The IV estimations will overcome any such OLS biases due to
de‡ators.


                                                     14
   Columns 9 and 10 of Table 1a provide the largest cities for each country’s ancestry population.
Due to their large overall size and high immigration shares, cities like New York, Los Angeles,
and Miami appear frequently. Nonetheless, there is substantial heterogeneity. East and West
Coast cities are more likely to link respectively to European and Asian ancestries, for example,
while southern parts of the United States link more to Latin American ancestries. The migration
from Nordic countries to the mid-west is evident (e.g., Finland’s presence in Minnesota).


3.4    US Patenting Data

The second building block for the instrument is the trend in patenting for each city T echk;A
                                                                                            c;t
                                                                                                S
                                                                                                  .
These series are quanti…ed through individual records of all patents granted by the United States
Patent and Trademark O¢ ce (USPTO) from January 1975 to May 2009. Each patent record
provides information about the invention (e.g., technology classi…cation, citations of patents on
which the current invention builds) and inventors submitting the application (e.g., name, city).
Hall et al. (2001) provide extensive details on this dataset. USPTO patents must list at least one
inventor, and multiple inventors are allowed. Approximately 7.8 million inventors are associated
with 4.5 million granted patents during this period.

    The base patent data are augmented in three ways. First, the addresses listed on inventor
records are used to group patents to the cities identi…ed in the 1980 census. This procedure uses
city lists collected from the O¢ ce of Social and Economic Data Analysis at the University of
Missouri, with a matching rate of 99%. Manual recoding further ensures that all patents with
more than 100 citations and all city names with more than 100 patents are identi…ed. Some
smaller metropolitan areas identi…ed in the patent data are excluded since they do not link to
places identi…ed in the 1980 census. Only patents with all inventors living in the United States
at the time of their patent application are included, and multiple inventors are discounted so
that each patent receives the same weight when measuring inventor populations.

    Second, the USPTO issues patents by technology categories rather than by industries. The
work of Johnson (1999), Silverman (1999), and Kerr (2008) develops concordances that link the
USPTO classi…cations to ISIC3 industries in which new inventions are manufactured or used.
The main estimations focus on industry-of-use, a¤ording a composite view of the technological
opportunity developed for an industry. Studies of advanced economies …nd accounting for these
inter-industry R&D ‡ows important (e.g., Scherer 1984, Keller 2002a). Estimations using the
alternative categorization of technologies to industry of manufacturer are also presented below.
Cohen (2011) discusses the larger literature on industry-level mappings and evidence regarding
patents, R&D, and productivity.

   Finally, the probable ethnicities of inventors are estimated through the names listed on
patents. This procedure exploits the fact the individuals with surnames Gupta or Desai are

                                                15
likely to be Indian, Wang or Ming are likely to be Chinese, and Martinez or Rodriguez are
likely to be Hispanic. The name matching work exploits two commercial databases of ethnic
…rst names and surnames, and the procedures have been extensively customized for the USPTO
data. The match rate is 98% for US domestic inventors, and the process a¤ords the distinction of
nine ethnicities: Anglo-Saxon, Chinese, European, Hispanic, Indian, Japanese, Korean, Russian,
and Vietnamese.11

    Most of the estimations in this paper only use whether inventors are of Anglo-Saxon origin,
as a means for reducing the potential of reverse causality as discussed above. The Anglo-Saxon
share of US domestic patenting declines from 73% in 1980-1984 to 66% in 1995-1999. This group
accounts for a majority of patents in each of the six major technology categories developed
by Hall et al. (2001). Appendix Table 1 provides descriptive statistics. This approach, in
combination with the interactions embedded in model (9), has the subtler advantage of allowing
the construction of instruments for many more countries and their ancestry groups than what
one can directly identify through inventor names, either due to lack of names for some countries
(e.g., Ethiopia, Oman) or due to extensive name overlap among countries within an ethnic group
(e.g., most of Latin America sharing Hispanic names). Extensions to this main approach are
considered after the core instrumental variable results are presented.

    As with the productivity and trade data, the patenting series are aggregated into …ve-year
blocks by city and industry. These intervals start in 1975-1979 and extend through 1995-1999,
and the series are normalized by the patenting level of each city-industry in 1980-1984. These
series are then united with the spatial distribution of each country’s ancestry group using model
(9) to form an aggregate for each country-industry, and the log growth rate is then calculated
across these …ve-year intervals. The lag of this growth rate is used as the instrument for the pro-
ductivity growth rate in an exporter-industry. That is, the estimated growth in technology ‡ows
from Brazil’s chemical industry during 1975-1979!1980-1984 is used as the instrument for the
growth in Brazil’s labor productivity in chemicals for the 1980-1984!1985-1989 period. This lag
structure follows the emphasis in Kerr (2008) on the strength of ethnic networks for technology
di¤usion during the …rst 3-6 years after a US invention is developed, and the comparison to
contemporaneous ‡ows is shown in robustness checks.

    The Costinot et al. (2012) model dictates the inclusion of importer-industry-year …xed e¤ects
 k
 jt in speci…cation (7) for structural reasons such as country preferences. Two other rationales
exist for having at least industry-year …xed e¤ects due to the data development depicted. First,
the US technology frontier is taken as exogenous in model (8), and the identi…cation of the
  11
     Kerr (2007) documents speci…c algorithms, lists frequent ethnic names, and provides extensive descriptive
statistics. This paper also discusses quality assurance exercises performed. For example, the ethnic-name database
can be applied to foreign patents registered with the USPTO. The ethnic-name database assigns ethnicities to 98%
of foreign records. Moreover, estimated inventor compositions are quite reasonable— for example, approximately
90% of inventors …ling from Chinese countries and regions are classi…ed as ethnically Chinese.


                                                       16
parameter should thus be independent of the pace of US technology expansion in di¤erent indus-
tries. A second methodological rationale stems from the US patent process. US patent grants
have increased dramatically since the early 1980s. While several factors lie behind this increase,
it is clear that USPTO grant rates grew faster than the underlying growth of US scienti…c per-
sonnel and innovation can explain. Moreover, di¤erences in grant rates exist across industries.
The …xed e¤ects account for these secular changes in the underlying patenting productivity.12


4      Empirical Results

This combined dataset is a unique laboratory for evaluating Ricardian technology di¤erences
in international trade. This section commences with ordinary least squares (OLS) estimations
using the UNIDO and WTF data. The instrumental variable (IV) results are then presented.


4.1     Base OLS Speci…cations

Table 2 provides the basic OLS estimations. Column 1 presents the "between" estimates from
speci…cation (6) before …rst di¤erencing the data; the dependent variable is the log mean nominal
value of bilateral exports for the …ve-year period. These estimates identify the parameter
through variation within bilateral trading routes and variation across industries of an exporter.
This framework parallels most Ricardian empirical studies. Column 2 presents the "within"
estimate from speci…cation (7) that utilizes …rst di¤erencing to isolate productivity and trade
growth within exporter-importer-industry cells.

    Estimations in Panel A weight bilateral routes by an interaction of total exporter and im-
porter trade in the industry. For example, the weight given to Germany’s exports of automobiles
to Nepal is the total export volume of Germany in the auto industry interacted with the total
imports of Nepal in the auto industry, using averages for each component across the sample
period. These weights focus attention on routes that are likely to be more important and give a
sense of the overall treatment e¤ect from Ricardian advantages. The weights, however, explicitly
do not build upon the actual trade volume for a route to avoid an endogenous emphasis on where
trade is occurring. Estimates in Panel B are unweighted. This study reports results with both
strategies to provide a range of estimates.

    Estimations cluster standard errors by exporter-industry. This re‡ects the repeated applica-
tion of exporter-industry technology levels to each route and the serial correlations concerns of
  12
    For example, Griliches (1990), Kortum and Lerner (2000), Kim and Marschke (2004), Hall (2005), Branstetter
and Ogura (2005), Ja¤e and Lerner (2005), and Lemley and Sampat (2007).


                                                     17
panel models. Other variants are reported below, too. Finally, the combination of 88 countries,
26 industries, and 3 time intervals creates an enormous number of exporter-importer-year and
importer-industry-year …xed e¤ects. The number of import destinations is in fact larger than the
88 exporters, as a UNIDO data match is not required for import destinations. With such a large
dataset, it is computationally di¢ cult to include exporter-importer-year and importer-industry-
year …xed e¤ects, especially when considering IV estimations. By necessity, manual demeaning is
employed to remove the exporter-importer-year …xed e¤ects, and this procedure is applied over
the importer-industry-year …xed e¤ects. The baseline estimates also use an aggregated version
of the importer-industry-year …xed e¤ects where the industry level used for the groups is at the
two-digit level of the ISIC system rather than the three-digit level (reducing this dimension from
26 industries to 8 higher-level industry groups). Robustness checks on these simpli…cations are
reported below.

    Interestingly, the "between" and "within" elasticities estimated in Panel A are both around
0.6 on the intensive margin. These coe¢ cients suggest that a 10% growth in labor productivity
for an exporter-industry is associated with a 6% growth in exports. The estimates in Panel B
are lower at 0.2-0.4, but they remain economically and statistically important. These elasticities
are somewhat lower than the unit elasticity often found in this literature with OLS estimation
techniques and cross-sectional data. There are many empirical reasons why this might be true,
with greater measurement error for productivity estimates outside of OECD sources certainly
being among them. An elasticity greater than or equal to one is also the baseline for the
Ricardian theory in Section 2. The IV estimates reported below are greater than one and have
a comparable level on some dimensions to those estimated with OECD countries. The next
subsection continues with extensions for these OLS estimates to provide a foundation for the IV
results.


4.2    Extended OLS Results

Table 3 provides robustness checks on the …rst-di¤erenced estimates, which are the focus of the
remainder of this study. The …rst column repeats the core results from Column 2 of Table 2.
The next two columns show robustness to dropping Brazil and China. Brazil, of all included
countries, displays the most outlier behavior with respect to its productivity growth rates, likely
due to de…nitional changes, but Brazil’s exclusion does not a¤ect the results. The results are
also similar when excluding China, which experienced substantial growth during the sample
period. It is generally worth noting that the 1980-1999 period pre-dates the very rapid take-o¤
of Chinese manufacturing exports after 2000. Unreported tests considered other candidates like
Mexico, Germany, and Japan, and these tests, too, found the results very stable to the sample
composition, re‡ective in large part of the underlying exporter-importer-year …xed e¤ects.

                                                18
    Column 4 shows the results when excluding industry 383 (Machinery, electrical). The coe¢ -
cient estimates are reduced in size by about 30% from Column 1, but they remain quite strong
and well-measured overall. The exclusion of industry 383 has the largest impact on the results
of the 26 industries in the sample, which is why it is reported. This importance is not very
surprising given the very rapid development of technology in this sector, its substantial di¤usion
around the world, and its associated trade. On this dimension, the industry-year portion of the
importer-industry-year …xed e¤ects play a very stabilizing role. Column 5 shows that winsoriz-
ing the sample at the 2%/98% delivers similar results, indicative that outliers are not overly
in‡uencing the measured elasticities.

    It was earlier noted that computational demands require that the main estimations employ
the ISIC2-level industry groups when preparing importer-industry-year …xed e¤ects. Columns
6-8 test this choice in several ways. First, Column 6 shows that the results hold when estimating
the full model with ISIC2-based cells, so that the importer-industry-year …xed e¤ects exactly
match the cell construction. The weaker variation reduces the coe¢ cient estimates by half,
but the results remain statistically and economically important. Columns 7 and 8 alternatively
estimate the model using the sample from Kerr (2008) that focuses on a subset of the UNIDO
data in the 1985-1997 period. The Kerr (2008) sample is substantially smaller in size than
the present one, and so there is greater ‡exibility with respect to these …xed e¤ect choices.
The choice of industry aggregation for the importer-industry-year …xed e¤ects does not make a
material di¤erence in this sample.13

    Finally, Column 9 shows the results with exporter-level clustering. The labor productivity
and export development of industries within countries may be correlated with each other due to
the presence of general-purpose technologies, learning-by-doing (e.g., Irwin and Klenow 1994),
and similar factors, and Feenstra and Rose (2000) show how the export ranges of countries
can change over time in systematic ways across industries. Clustering at the exporter level
allows for greater covariance across industries in this regard, and returns lower standard errors.
Most papers in this literature use robust standard errors on cross-sectional data, which would
translate most closely to bilateral-route clustering in a panel model. Unreported estimates
consider bilateral-route clustering and alternatively bootstrapped standard errors, and these
standard errors are smaller than those reported in Column 9.

   Table 4 considers several extensions of this work to characterize heterogeneity in the sample.
Column 2 interacts the regressor with the GDP/capita level of the exporter, broken down into
quintiles. Interestingly, the link between base productivity and exports that is being captured
in this study is mainly coming o¤ of the lower-income countries, suggestive of higher trade
  13
    This extra check also has the advantage of linking the two studies closer together since the Kerr (2008) paper
focuses extensively on productivity growth due to technology transfer. Stability to the somewhat di¤erent data
preparation steps in Kerr (2008) is comforting.


                                                       19
due to varieties among developed economies. This may be due to the greater potential for
within-country productivity dispersion in the sample of developing and emerging economies,
their more rapid productivity development over the 1980-1999 period, and similar factors. It
is similar to the conclusion of Fieler (2011) that trade among advanced economies links to
product di¤erentiation and variety (low ), while trade among emerging economies links more
closely to fundamental productivity levels (higher ).14 By contrast, Column 3 …nds very little
di¤erence across countries of di¤erent sizes. Columns 4 and 5 also show very little connection
of export growth to geographic distances, excepting the fact that the growth in exports is not
simply happening to bordering countries. These extensions suggest that spatial distance is a
second-order factor in shaping where export growth occurs following technology expansion.

    In contrast to the Ricardian framework, Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) models describe trade
as resulting from factor di¤erences across countries (e.g., labor, capital, natural resources). In
the above model, technology is the only channel promoting export growth due to identical
factor endowments and no intertemporal factor accumulation. During the period studied, some
countries experienced signi…cant growth in their skilled labor forces and physical capital stocks,
as well as their technology sets, and the former could lead to growth in manufacturing exports
due to the Rybczynski e¤ect. Capital accumulation is particularly noted in rapid advances
made by several East Asian economies (e.g., Young 1992, 1995; Ventura 1997). The inclusion
of exporter-importer-year …xed e¤ects suggests that a Rybczynski e¤ect for the manufacturing
sector as a whole is not responsible for the observed trade patterns. Columns 6-8 provide
additional evidence that the observed role for technology within manufacturing is not due to
specialized factor accumulations.15

    The intuition behind the proposed test is straightforward. Under the Rybczynski e¤ect, the
accumulation of skilled workers in country i shifts country i’s specialization towards manufac-
turing industries that employ skilled labor more intensively than other factors. By grouping
manufacturing industries by their skilled-labor intensities, tests examine if technology’s impor-
tance is preserved after time trends are removed for these industry groups within each country.
These time trends are included in addition to the …xed e¤ects listed at the bottom of the table.
To illustrate, the computer and pharmaceutical industries are both highly skill intensive. A
general Rybczynski e¤ect due to skilled worker accumulation in China would favor specializa-
tion and export growth in these industries equally. Additional con…dence for technology’s role is
warranted if China’s exports grow faster in the skill-intensive industry that receives the strongest
technology transfer from the United States relative to its peer industries.
  14
     These interactions are an empirical extension that are beyond the closed-form model depicted in Section 2.
Fieler (2011) provides a theoretical foundation for this work.
  15
     See Heckscher (1919), Ohlin (1933), and Vanek (1968). Dornbusch et al. (1980) provide a classic HOV
model, while Schott (2003) and Romalis (2004) o¤er powerful extensions and empirical tests. Tre‡er (1994,
1996), Harrigan (1997b), Davis and Weinstein (2001), Chor (2010), Morrow (2010), and Burstein and Vogel
(2012) jointly explore technology and factor di¤erences as determinants of trade.


                                                      20
    To implement this matching exercise, industries are grouped into quintiles based upon their
factor intensities in the United States. Three intensities are studied— the industry’s capital-labor
ratio, the industry’s mean wage rate, and the share of non-production workers in the industry’s
labor force. Table 1b documents for each industry the quintile groupings assigned. Textiles
and apparel consistently rank in the lowest quintile in all three classi…cations schemes, while
chemicals and industrial machinery consistently fall into top quintiles. Some di¤erences do exist
though. The correlations among quintile groupings are 0.77 for capital-labor and mean wage,
0.60 for mean wage and non-production share, and 0.44 for capital-labor and non-production
share. The role for technology holds up well in all three variants. These …ndings suggest an
omitted factor accumulation is not confounding the identi…ed role for technology.16


4.3     Base IV Results

Table 5 presents the core IV results. The …rst column reports the …rst-stage estimates of how
   ln(Mitk ) predicts ln(~
                         zitk ). The …rst-stage elasticity in Panel A is 0.6, suggesting a 10% increase
in the technology ‡ow metric from the United States predicts a 6% increase in labor productivity
abroad at the exporter-industry level. The unweighted estimates in Panel B suggest a smaller
3% increase. While the second elasticity is lower, the instrument generally performs better in the
unweighted speci…cations due to its more precise measurement. The F statistics in Panels A and
B are 4.7 and 11.6, respectively. The sample weights in Panel A place greater emphasis on larger
and more advanced countries that have large export volumes (e.g., Germany, Japan). While this
framework …nds a substantial response, the weighted dependency of this group on heterogeneous
technology transfer from the United States is noisier than in the unweighted estimations that
emphasize more developing and emerging countries.

   The second column presents the reduced-form estimates where ln(Mitk ) predicts ln(~       xkijt )
using a format similar to equation (7). In both panels, there is substantial reduced-form link of
technology ‡ows to export volumes.

   The third column provides the second-stage estimates from equation (7) having used ln(Mitk )
to predict ln(~ zitk ). In Panel A’s estimation, the weighted elasticity is 1.6, suggesting a 16%
  16
    The ideal test would simply remove factor-based trade from export volumes studied. This is test is unattain-
able for several theoretical and practical reasons. First, while 2x2x2 HOV models (two countries, factors, and
goods) cleanly predict a country exports goods that intensely use the factors in which the country is well en-
dowed, this prediction does not hold universally in settings with multiple goods and factors (e.g., the critique of
Leamer (1980) on Leontief’s (1953) paradox). Likewise, bilateral trade patterns due to factor-based di¤erences
are only determined for special cases in a multi-country world (e.g., Romalis 2004). Thus, strong assumptions
would be required for distinguishing factor-based trade in this empirical setting. Practically speaking, the data
constraint is also prohibitive as factor data and industry input-output matrices are very poorly measured for
most of the countries and years covered by this study. Davis and Weinstein (2001) study this issue using OECD
data. Morrow (2010) comparatively assesses the Ricardian and HOV models in a uni…ed framework. Morrow
…nds that the two models each o¤er valid partial descriptions and ignoring one force for comparative advantage
does not bias empirical tests of the other.


                                                        21
increase in export volumes for every 10% increase in labor productivity. In Panel B’s unweighted
estimation, the 10% increase in labor productivity is linked to a 24% increase in export volumes.
The second-stage elasticity in Panel B is larger than in Panel A, as the IV estimates provide the
reduced-form scaled up by the …rst-stage e¤ects. Thus, even though the unweighted reduced-
form estimate in Column 2 is smaller than the weighted reduced-form estimate, this ordering
reverses once scaled-up by the …rst stages.

    This study does not overly favor one set of estimates. The unweighted and unweighted ap-
proaches both have merits and liabilities. Instead, the conclusion from this work is that the
instrumented elasticity is in the neighborhood of 2. This instrumented elasticity is weaker than
the preferred instrumented elasticity of 6.5 that Costinot et al. (2012) estimate for OECD coun-
tries cross-sectionally in 1997 using producer price data, but it is quite similar to the 2.7 elasticity
that they estimate with labor productivity metrics. While it is impossible to di¤erentiate among
the various reasons as to why the IV estimates are larger than the OLS estimates, a very likely
candidate is that OLS su¤ers from a substantial downward bias due to measurement error in the
labor productivity estimates, especially with the substantial di¤erencing embedded in equation
(7). While it is likely that omitted factors or reverse causality in‡uenced the OLS estimations
as well, these appear to have been second-order to the measurement issues.17

    It is important to identify the dual meaning of the higher IV results compared to OLS with
respect to the parameter. In Section 2’s model, a higher parameter corresponds to a reduced
scope for intra-industry trade due to comparative advantages across varieties. IV estimations
thus suggest that OLS speci…cations overestimate the scope for intra-industry trade because
they understate the link between country-industry productivity improvements and their asso-
ciated export volumes. Both impetuses can be connected to Ricardian theories of comparative
advantage for trade, but role of the structural parameter needs to be carefully delineated.

    These estimates are signi…cant in terms of their potential economic importance and explana-
tory power. Using an elasticity of 2, the interquartile range of country-level labor productivities
in Table 1a can explain 75% of the interquartile range in export levels. Similarly, the interquar-
tile range of country-level labor productivity growth can explain 142% of the interquartile range
in export growth levels.

    To this point, the reported estimations have only focused on the intensive margin of export
growth. Appendix Table 2 reports OLS and reduced-form results related to the extensive margin
of trade commencement. These estimations follow Tables 2 and 5 in their approach, with linear
  17
     Costinot et al. (2012) adjust export volumes for trade openness using the import penetration ratio for a
country-industry. The estimates are very similar when undertaking this approach, being 1.163 (0.457) and 2.513
(1.138) for weighted and unweighted speci…cations, respectively. This approach is not adopted for the main
estimations due to worries about mismeasurement in the import penetration ratio when combining UNIDO and
WTF data.

probability models considering an indicator variable for exports above US $100k on a bilateral
route as the outcome variable. The OLS and reduced-form results do not display signi…cant
elasticities. Computational limits prevent the full estimation of IV elasticities, but the zero-
valued reduced-form elasticities are su¢ cient to conclude that the IV results would also be
weak. On the whole, this study concludes that the exporting growth due to enhanced labor
productivity and technology transfer comes through export growth on existing routes rather
than through entry into new bilateral routes.18


4.4     Extended IV Results

Table 6 provides robustness checks in the same format as Table 3. The instrumented elasticity is
again very stable to the exclusion of high-pro…le countries. The weighted elasticity is very stable
in Column 4 to excluding industry 383 (Machinery, electrical), while the unweighted elasticity
strengthens. This choice of reporting is again due to electrical machinery having the largest
impact on the results, with, for example, very similar elasticities to Column 1 being observed if
excluding industry 382 (Machinery, except electrical). Results are also again very similar with a
winsorized sample. The instrumented elasticities are reasonably stable to variations on industry
dimensions and samples in Columns 6-8 in terms of economic magnitudes, but the standard
errors on the unweighted sample in Panel B become too large for de…nitive conclusions. The
last column again shows the results are robust to exporter-level clustering. Employing bilateral-
route clustering or bootstrapped standard errors would substantially increase the precision of
the results.

    Table 7 reports additional robustness checks related to the instrument design. Results in
Column 2 are similar when using the total technology trends for cities in model (9) rather
than just the Anglo-Saxon ethnic trend. More deviation, however, is observed when using the
technology-to-industry concordances that emphasize where manufacturing occurs, rather than
where technologies are used. The main estimations focus on industry-of-use, a¤ording a com-
posite view of the technological opportunity developed for an industry. Keller (2002b) reports
inter-industry R&D ‡ows aid productivity growth signi…cantly within OECD countries, equal to
half or more of the own-industry development. Estimations with manufacturing industries sup-
port the using-industry speci…cations in a weighted format, albeit with larger standard errors.
Unweighted estimates have a zero-valued …rst stage that prevents further analysis. This di¤er-
ence emphasizes the importance of technology adoption behind the labor productivity results.

   Columns 3-7 test variations on the construction of M %i;c;1980 . Columns 4 and 5 show that
very similar results are obtained when using …rst- or later-generation migrants for de…ning the
  18
    This test links exporting in a speci…c industry with technology for that industry. This approach di¤ers from
examinations of the extensive margins of trade that count the number of independent varieties exported (e.g.,
Feenstra 1994, Feenstra and Rose 2000, Hummels and Klenow 2005).


                                                      23
spatial patterns of migrants. This comparability is not surprising given the persistence of ethnic
enclaves in the United States and their attraction of new immigrants from the home country. This
stability suggests that the results are not being in‡uenced by endogenous migrant decisions about
which cities will show particular strength in patenting growth for certain industries. Columns
6 and 7 show similar results when using bachelor’s educated workers from a country’s ancestry
versus those without bachelor’s degrees, with the weighted estimations somewhat favoring the
distribution of bachelor’s educated workers. Overall, these variations suggest a strong stability
to this part of the IV’s construction.

    Column 8 of Table 7 tests a more stringent speci…cation that augments equation (7) to
include additional …xed e¤ects for distance-industry-year, where distance is an indicator variable
for being more than the median distance from the United States. This augmented speci…cation
controls even more tightly for geographical distance as a determinant of technology di¤usion,
…nding continued and strong evidence that di¤erential technology transfer from the United States
matters. Similar results are also found when including an equivalent set of …xed e¤ects that
partition on GDP/capita of countries. Column 9 demonstrates robustness to dropping countries
with a limited migrant connection to the United States, speci…cally those nations with fewer
than 100k people in the United States in 1980 reporting ancestral connections to the country.

    Unreported estimations also test including the three Rybczynski e¤ect controls discussed
with Table 4. In the unweighted estimations, the inclusion of these controls does not materially
in‡uence the instrumented elasticities. All three elasticities are in the range of 1.5-2.1 and are
statistically signi…cant at a 5% level or higher. In the weighted estimations, these controls
have a larger impact. For the non-production share control, the weighted elasticity is 2.5 (1.7),
while estimations with the other two controls have invalid …rst stages. Thus, the conclusions
regarding heterogeneous technology transfer, productivity growth, and exports for the weighted
estimations need to be cautious to acknowledge that these e¤ects are not well-distinguished from
a generalized Rybczynski e¤ect operating inside of the manufacturing sector itself. In unweighted
estimations, these e¤ects are better distinguished.

    The primary IV estimations build a …ve-year lag structure into when the technology growth
occurs in the United States to when the productivity growth happens abroad. Thus, growth
in technology ‡ows over the 1975-1979!1980-1984 period towards an exporter-industry are
used to predict labor productivity growth and export growth during the 1980-1984!1985-1989
period. This …ve-year lag matches discussions of rates of di¤erential technology ‡ows across
countries. Appendix Table 3 compares this lag structure with contemporaneous technology ‡ows
in estimations similar to the …rst-stage and reduced-form speci…cations. The lagged estimator is
stronger than the contemporaneous estimator when both are modelled independently or when
modelled jointly. This pattern provides comfort in the estimation design and the proposed causal
direction of the results.

                                               24
    Another test utilizes the ethnic patenting growth in the United States to formulate an addi-
tional control against reverse causality. This control is calculated as the patenting growth within
each industry in the United States by members of the focal ethnic community. Thus, estima-
tions consider the technology transfer instrument (9) and its impact for productivity growth
and trade after controlling for the direct growth of patenting by industry of ethnic communities.
The control is calculated across the ethnic groups discussed in Section 3, with the same control
applied to countries within an ethnicity (e.g., the growth in US patenting by ethnic Hispanic
inventors for computers is used as a control with both Mexico’s and Chile’s computer productiv-
ity and exports). As some countries do not map to an identi…able ethnic group with the name
matching approach, the sample is reduced to 73,545 observations. For this sample, the weighted
and unweighted instrumented elasticities before the ethnic patenting control is introduced are
1.32 (0.54) and 2.21 (0.92), respectively. With the control, these instrumented elasticities are
very similar at 1.40 (0.64) and 2.32 (1.37), respectively.19


5     Conclusions

While the principle of Ricardian technology di¤erences as a source of trade is well established
in the theory of international economics, empirical evaluations of its importance are relatively
rare due to the di¢ culty of quantifying and isolating technology di¤erences. This study exploits
heterogeneous technology di¤usion from the United States through ethnic migrant networks to
make additional headway. Estimations …nd bilateral manufacturing exports respond positively
to growth in observable measures of comparative advantages. Ricardian technology di¤erences
are an important determinant of trade in longitudinal changes, in addition to their cross-sectional
role discussed earlier.

    Leamer and Levinsohn (1994) argue that trade models should be taken with a grain of salt
and applied in contexts for which they are appropriate. This is certainly true when interpret-
ing these results. The estimating frameworks have speci…cally sought to remove trade resulting
from factor endowments, increasing returns, consumer preferences, etc. rather than test against
them. Moreover, manufacturing exports are likely more sensitive to patentable technology im-
provements than the average sector, and the empirical reach of the constructed dataset to include
emerging economies like China and India heightens this sensitivity. Further research is needed
to generalize technology’s role to a broader set of industrial sectors and environments.

    Beyond quantifying the link between technology and trade for manufacturing, this paper also
serves as input into research regarding the bene…ts and costs of emigration to the United States
  19
     Earlier versions of this paper consider direct ethnic patenting and exports more extensively. The early work
also evaluates the role of sector reallocation from agriculture, the empirical contrast of the technology states in
the exporter and the importer, and the potential for vertical integration through parts trade (e.g., Ng and Yeats
1999, Schott 2004). These results are available upon request.

for the migrants’home countries (i.e., the "brain drain" or "brain gain" debate). While focusing
on the Ricardian model and its parameters, the paper establishes that the technology transfer
from overseas migrants are strong enough to meaningfully promote exports. Care should be
taken to not overly interpret these …ndings as strong evidence of a big gain from migration.
The paper does not seek to establish a clear counterfactual in the context of immigration from
the source countries’ point of view (e.g., Agrawal et al. 2011). As such, the positive export
elasticities due to US heterogeneous technology di¤usion do not constitute welfare statements
relative to other scenarios. Future research needs to examine these welfare implications further.

Notes: Table provides descriptive statistics on intensive-margin sample. An included observation is the first-difference of values for an exporter-importer-
industry-period from the prior period. For the differencing, the exporter's labor productivity at the industry level must be reported in the UNIDO database in
both periods and the export volumes in the World Trade Flows database must exceed $100k for both periods. All trade with the United States is excluded.
Column 2 reports the number of periods after first differencing that a country is included, and the third column provides route-level observation counts after
first differencing. Columns 4 and 5 provide labor productivity estimates from the UNIDO database. Columns 6-8 report statistics from the World Trade
Flows database, with volumes expressed in US dollars. The last two columns document the two largest ethnic heritage cities used in the instrument design.
Cities are defined at the consolidated metropolitan area level, with abbreviated names provided.

Notes: Panel estimations consider manufacturing exports taken from the WTF database. Data are organized by exporter-
importer-industry-year. Industries are defined at the three-digit level of the ISIC Revision 2 system. Annual data are
collapsed into five-year groupings beginning with 1980-1984 and extending to 1995-1999. The dependent variable in
Column 1 is the log mean nominal value (US$) of bilateral exports for the five years; the dependent variable in Column 2
is the change in log exports from the prior period. The intensive margin sample is restricted to exporter-importer-industry
groupings with exports exceeding $100k in every year. The $100k threshold is chosen due to WTF data collection
procedures discussed in the text. Labor productivity from the UNIDO database measures comparative advantages.
Column 1 estimates Ricardian elasticities using both within-panel variation and variation between industries of a country.
Column 2 estimates Ricardian elasticities using only variation within panels. Estimations in Panel A weight bilateral
routes by the interaction of total exporter and importer trade in industry; estimations in Panel B are unweighted.
Estimations cluster standard errors by exporter-industry. Importer-Industry-Yr FE are defined at the two-digit level of the
ISIC system. *, **, *** denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Notes: See Table 2. Interactions in Column 4 use Great Circle distances between capital cities. To give a feel for these demarcations, the distances from Beijing,
China, to the capitals of Bangladesh, United Arab Emirates, and Spain are 3029 km., 5967 km., and 9229 km., respectively. Columns 6-8 test for the Rybczynski
effect within manufacturing. Industries are grouped into quintiles by their US capital-labor ratios, mean wage rates, and non-production worker wage bill shares.
Table 1b lists industry groupings. Linear time trends for each country by industry quintile are included in the estimation.

Notes: Panel A presents descriptive statistics for inventors residing in the US at the time of patent application. Inventor ethnicities are estimated through inventors' names
using techniques described in the text. Patents are grouped by application years and major technology fields. Cities, defined through Metropolitan Statistical Areas,
include AUS (Austin), BAL (Baltimore), BOS (Boston), DC (Washington), HRT (Hartford), LA (Los Angeles), MIA (Miami), MIL (Milwaukee), NAS (Nashville), NOR
(New Orleans), NYC (New York City), PRT (Portland), SA (San Antonio), SD (San Diego), SF (San Francisco), SLC (Salt Lake City), STL (St. Louis), WPB (West Palm
Beach), and WS (Winston-Salem). Cities are identified from inventors' city names using city lists collected from the Office of Social and Economic Data Analysis at the
University of Missouri, with a matching rate of 99%. Manual recoding further ensures all patents with more than 100 citations and all city names with more than 100
patents are identified. Panel B presents comparable statistics calculated from the 1990 Census using country of birth for scientists and engineers. Anglo-Saxon provides a
residual in the Census statistics. Many US inventors with European names are native citizens.

Notes: See Tables 2 and 5. Estimations test the extensive margin of trade through linear probability
models. The dependent variable is a dichotomous indicator variable taking unit value if bilateral
exports exceed $100k. The $100k threshold is chosen due to WTF data collection procedures
discussed in the text.
