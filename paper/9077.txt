                                              ABSTRACT

        This study demonstrates how constrained efficient allocations can arise endogenously as
equilibria in an economy with a limited ability to enforce contracts and with private agents behaving
competitively, taking a set of taxes as given. The taxes in this economy limit risk-sharing and arise in an
equilibrium of a dynamic game between governments of sovereign nations. The equilibrium allocations
depend on governments choosing to tax both the repayment of international debt and the income from
capital investment in their countries.

     Applied general equilibrium models have proven useful for analyzing a variety of issues,

ranging from international business cycles to asset pricing. However, many of these models as-

sume the existence of complete asset markets, which in turn implies complete risk-sharing among

agents in the economy. Complete risk-sharing has implications that are often far from the data

(Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland [4]). Researchers have thus developed models in which risk-sharing

is limited for some reason. One approach is to exogenously restrict the set of tradable assets

(Baxter and Crucini [5]); another is to introduce a friction in the environment that endogenously

limits the amount of achievable risk-sharing (Kehoe and Perri [13]).

     Recently, we have examined a model in which limited risk-sharing arises endogenously from

the limited ability to enforce credit arrangements between sovereign nations (Kehoe and Perri

[13]). This type of friction goes a long way toward reconciling theory and data. The limited

ability to enforce international credit arrangements manifests itself in enforcement constraints

which require that in each period and state, allocations can be enforced only if their value

is greater than it would be if the country were excluded from all further intertemporal and

interstate trade. This friction captures in a simple way the diﬃculties of enforcing contracts

between sovereign nations that involve large transfers of resources backed only by promises to

repay.

     Our recent work focuses on planning problems with enforcement constraints, or constrained

eﬃcient allocations, but does not analyze in detail how these allocations can be decentralized.

Here we do that detailed analysis. We show that constrained eﬃcient allocations arise as equi-

libria of a dynamic game between governments, with private agents acting competitively. In this

game, private agents solve standard competitive equilibrium problems, while the government of

each country can choose to prevent its agents from repaying their outstanding international debts


                                               1
by taxing such repayments, and if there is capital, the government can also tax capital income.

We show that the allocations that solve the constrained planning problem can be supported as

equilibria of this game if and only if they satisfy the enforcement constraints.

     The main contribution of this work is to show how limited international risk-sharing can

endogenously arise in the equilibrium of an appropriately defined game with competitive private

agents. As such, this work builds on both the literature on international debt–such as the studies

of Eaton and Gersovitz [9], Kletzer and Wright [14], and Manuelli [17] and those surveyed by

Eaton and Fernandez [8]–and the literature on debt-constrained asset markets, particularly the

studies of Alvarez and Jermann [2], Attanasio and Ríos-Rull [3], Kehoe and Levine [11, 12],

Kocherlakota [15], and Ligon, Thomas, and Worrall [16].

     In those studies, the equilibrium is modeled in one of two ways. In the international

debt literature, private competitive agents are not explicitly modeled; instead, a game is set up

between two large agents, often thought of as the governments of the countries. In the debt-

constrained asset market literature, private agents are explicitly modeled as competitive, but

the constraints that private consumers face are not explicitly chosen by any agent as part of the

equilibrium. For example, in the work of Kehoe and Levine [11], the enforcement constraints are

built directly into the commodity space. Alvarez and Jermann [2] go the farthest and show how

appropriately set constraints on debt can decentralize the constrained eﬃcient allocations as a

competitive equilibrium. Even in that work, however, the debt constraints are not chosen by

any agent. Alvarez and Jermann [2] show, rather, that if the debt constraints are appropriately

set, then the allocations of interest can be decentralized. Jeske [10] and Wright [19] also analyze

competitive equilibria with limited enforcement, but they focus on the case in which the decision

to repudiate the debt is made by private agents and not by governments, so the strategic element


                                                2
of default decision is not explicitly modeled.

     Our work goes beyond the literatures on international debt and debt-constrained asset

markets. Here the debt taxes, which are the mechanism through which international risk-sharing

is limited, are derived endogenously as equilibria of a dynamic game between governments.

     We begin with a pure exchange economy with two countries and a large number of identical

consumers in each. We set up a planning problem with enforcement constraints and show how

the resulting constrained eﬃcient allocations can be characterized by a transition law for the

ratio of marginal utilities of consumers across countries together with a resource constraint.

We show that the constrained eﬃcient allocations can be decentralized as either a competitive

equilibrium with appropriately set debt constraints, as in the work of Alvarez and Jermann [2],

or as a competitive equilibrium with debt taxes. In both notions of competitive equilibrium, the

frictions faced by private agents, the debt constraints or the debt taxes, while appropriately set,

are exogenous.

     We then define a dynamic game in which the governments of the countries optimally choose

the debt taxes as part of the equilibria, while private agents act competitively, taking the debt

taxes as exogenous. We show that any constrained eﬃcient allocation can be supported as

an equilibrium of this dynamic game. In this sense, our economy is a standard competitive

environment in which limited international risk-sharing arises endogenously from the limited

enforcement of international contracts and the strategic interactions between governments.

     We then add capital to the model, so that the economy is a standard two-country growth

model with enforcement constraints. We show that the constrained eﬃcient allocations cannot

be decentralized with only the type of debt constraints used by Alvarez and Jermann [2]. This

is because in the planning problem with enforcement constraints, the Euler equation for capital


                                                 3
accumulation is necessarily distorted away from the first-best, but with debt constraints alone,

there is no such distortion. If we add a constraint limiting the amount of capital that can be

saved, as suggested by Seppälä [18], the constrained eﬃcient allocations can be decentralized as

competitive equilibria. However, we find this decentralization in which consumers are limited in

the amount they can borrow as debt and the amount they can save in the form of capital not

intuitively appealing.

     Finally, we show that if the economy includes capital income taxes as well as debt taxes,

then the constrained eﬃcient allocations can be decentralized as competitive equilibria. It is

then easy to show that any constrained eﬃcient allocation can be supported as the equilibrium

of a dynamic game in which governments choose both types of taxes.


             1. CONSTRAINED EFFICIENT ALLOCATIONS

Consider the following deterministic pure exchange economy, which is a special case of the

stochastic pure exchange economy studied by Alvarez and Jermann [2] and the stochastic pro-

duction economy studied by Kehoe and Perri [13]. We will show here that constrained eﬃcient

allocations in this economy can be decentralized either by limits on borrowing or by taxes on

debt payments to agents outside a country.


                                 1.1. The World Economy

Our theoretical world economy consists of two countries, i = 1, 2, each represented by a large

number of identical, infinitely lived consumers and a time-varying deterministic endowment of a

single homogeneous consumption good. The endowment of country i in time period t is yit while
                                                                   P∞
consumers in country i have utility, or preferences, of the form    t=0   β t U(cit ),where cit denotes

consumption of the endowment good by consumers in country i in t and β denotes the discount


                                               4
factor. The resource constraints are given by


       c1t + c2t = y1t + y2t .                                                                   (1)


We assume that for country i = 1, 2, all endowments yit ∈ [y, ȳ] for some finite, strictly positive

constants ȳ and ȳ.

      This economy has, besides the resource constraints, enforcement constraints which require

that at every point in time, each country prefers the allocation it receives over the allocation it

could get if it were in autarky, or self-suﬃcient, from then on. These enforcement constraints are

of the form
       ∞
       X                               ∞
                                       X
              β s−t U (cis ) ≥ Vit =          β s−t U (yis ),                                    (2)
        s=t                            s=t


where Vit denotes the value of autarky for country i from period t on, which is given by the value

of utility in which consumers simply consume their endowment for t on.

      The constrained eﬃcient allocations of this economy solve the planning problem of maxi-

mizing a weighted sum of the discounted utilities:
               "                                                #
                   ∞
                   X                          ∞
                                              X
       max λ1             β t U (c1t ) + λ2         β t U (c2t )                                 (3)
                    t=0                       t=0


subject to the resource constraints (1) and the enforcement constraints (2) for country i = 1, 2

and all periods t, where λ1 and λ2 are nonnegative initial weights on the two countries’ utilities.

      An allocation {c1t , c2t }∞
                                t=0 is constrained eﬃcient if it solves the planning problem for some


nonnegative planning weights λ1 and λ2 . We characterize these allocations as follows. Let β t µit

denote the multipliers on the enforcement constraints. Let Mit = Mit−1 + µit and Mi,−1 = λi .

Notice that Mit is the initial planning weight on country i, λi , plus the sum of the multipliers on



                                                                    5
country i’s enforcement constraint from period 0 through period t. By grouping terms, we can

write the planning problem as
              ∞ X
              X
       max                β t [Mit−1 U (cit ) + µit (U (cit ) − Vit )]
              t=0     i


subject to the resource constraints (1). The first-order conditions are summarized by

       U 0 (c1t )   M2t
         0
                  =     .
       U (c2t )     M1t

For notational simplicity, we use the normalized weight zt = M2t /M1t and the normalized mul-

tiplier vit = µit /Mit . Then the transition law for the z along with the first-order conditions can

be written as
              µ              ¶
                  1 − v1t
       zt =                      zt−1                                                              (4)
                  1 − v2t

              U 0 (c1t )
       zt =              ,                                                                         (5)
              U 0 (c2t )

where z−1 = λ2 /λ1 . Thus, constrained eﬃcient allocations are characterized by (4) and (5) along

with the resource constraints and enforcement constraints for some sequence of relative weights

z and multipliers vi . Notice that, if in equilibrium some enforcement constraint is binding, then

the first-order condition for relative consumption (5) is distorted away from those conditions for

the unconstrained eﬃcient allocations in which U 0 (c1t )/U 0 (c2t ) = λ2 /λ1 , and the allocation will

display less than perfect risk-sharing.

      We can get some intuition for how the binding pattern of the enforcement constraints is

related to the allocations as follows. Combine (4) and (5) to give
                      µ             ¶
       U 0 (c1t )         1 − v1t       U 0 (c1t−1 )
                  =                                  ,                                             (6)
       U 0 (c2t )         1 − v2t       U 0 (c2t−1 )



                                                              6
and realize that there are three possible binding patterns for the enforcement constraints: either

country 1’s constraint binds and country 2’s constraint is slack (v1t > 0, v2t = 0), country

2’s constraint binds and country 1’s constraint is slack (v2t > 0, v1t = 0), or both countries’

constraints are slack (v1t = v2t = 0). If country 2’s constraint binds in period t, then

        U 0 (c1t )   U 0 (c1t−1 )
                   >              ,                                                             (7)
        U 0 (c2t )   U 0 (c2t−1 )

so that the ratio of country 1’s marginal utility to country 2’s marginal utility increases relative

to this ratio in period t − 1, with the reverse when country 1’s constraint binds. If neither

constraint binds, then the ratio of marginal utilities stays the same. Of course, (7) also implies

that if country 2’s constraint binds, then the consumers in country 1 have the higher intertemporal

marginal rate of substitution from period t − 1 to t in that

         U 0 (c1t )     U 0 (c2t )
                     >              ,                                                           (8)
        U 0 (c1t−1 )   U 0 (c2t−1 )

with the reverse when country 1’s constraint binds.

       This simple manipulation of (7) into (8) gives the intuition for the following lemma estab-

lished by Alvarez and Jermann [2]:


       Lemma 1. If {c1t , c2t } is a constrained eﬃcient allocation with
        ∞
        X                            ∞
                                     X
                  s−t
              β         U (cjs ) >         β s−t U (yjs ),                                      (9)
        s=t                          s=t


then

        U 0 (cjt+1 )       U 0 (cit+1 )
                     = max              .                                                      (10)
         U 0 (cjt )     i   U 0 (cit )

In words, unconstrained consumers have the highest marginal rate of substitution. Alvarez and

Jermann [2] prove this using a simple variational argument, but for our purposes, the algebra of


                                                             7
(7) and (8) makes the lemma obvious. We use this lemma when we construct asset prices for the

decentralization with debt constraints. In that decentralization, the asset prices are determined

by the marginal rate of substitution for the unconstrained consumers, which, as this lemma

shows, is whatever marginal rate of substitution is the highest among the consumers.

      We will be most interested in allocations for which the present value of the allocation, at

the appropriately defined prices, is finite for each consumer. Letting q0,t = q0,1 q1,2 . . . qt−1,t with

                         βU 0 (cit+1 )
       qt,t+1 = max                    ,
                     i    U 0 (cit )

we say that an allocation {c1t , c2t }∞
                                      t=0 has high implied interest rates if for i = 1, 2,

       ∞
       X
              q0,t (y1t + y2t ) < ∞.                                                                 (11)
        t=0

      Here qt,t+1 is the marginal rate of substitution for whichever country’s representative con-

sumer is unconstrained between periods t and t + 1. Typically, in some periods one country’s

consumer will be unconstrained while in other periods the other country’s consumer will be

unconstrained. Thus, the product of these marginal rates q0,t does not represent any single con-

sumer’s marginal rate of substitution between periods 0 and t, but rather is a mixture of both

representative consumers’ marginal rates.


                            1.2. Decentralization With Debt Constraints

Here we consider how to decentralize the constrained eﬃcient allocations with debt constraints

along the lines of Alvarez and Jermann [2]. We show that any constrained eﬃcient allocation

that has high implied interest rates can be decentralized as a competitive equilibrium with

appropriately chosen debt constraints and initial assets.

      In this economy, the price of a claim to one unit of the consumption good in period t + 1 in

period t units is denoted by qt,t+1 and the amount of such asset claims purchased by consumer


                                                    8
i in period t is denoted by ait+1 . In this decentralization, the consumers in country i choose

{cit , ait+1 } to solve
               ∞
               X
         max         β t U (cit )                                                                       (12)
               t=0

subject to

         cit + qt,t+1 ait+1 = yit + ait ,                                                               (13)


         ait+1 ≥ Bit+1 ,


with ai0 given, where Bit+1 ≤ 0 specifies the lowest amount of assets that a consumer in country

i in period t is permitted to have. Thus, {Bit+1 } is a sequence of exogenous, time-varying,

country-specific debt constraints.

      A competitive equilibrium with debt constraints {B1t+1 , B2t+1 } together with initial assets

a10 and a20 is a set of allocations {c1t , c2t }, asset holdings {a1t+1 , a2t+1 }, and asset prices {qt,t+1 }

for which {cit , ait+1 } solves (12) for each i, and markets clear, so that a1t+1 + a2t+1 = 0 and (1)

holds.

      Let β t θt denote the multiplier on the debt constraints. Then the first-order conditions are

summarized by

                     βU 0 (cit+1 )    θ it
         qt,t+1 =        0
                                   + 0                                                                  (14)
                      U (cit )      U (cit )

and the transversality conditions

         lim β t U 0 (cit )(ait − Bit ) = 0.                                                            (15)
         t→∞


Hence, the allocations and prices that constitute a competitive equilibrium are summarized by

the resource constraints (1), the budget constraints (13), the first-order conditions (14) with

θit ≥ 0, and the transversality conditions (15).

construct the asset prices, asset holdings, and debt constraints that decentralize this allocation

as follows. Let

                            U 0 (cit+1 )
        qt,t+1 = max β                                                                                         (16)
                      i      U 0 (cit )

be the asset price, and given this price and the allocations, use (14) to define the multipliers θit .

It is immediate that these multipliers have the right properties. If consumer i has the higher

marginal rate of substitution, so that qt,t+1 = βU 0 (cit+1 )/U 0 (cit ), then θit = 0. If consumer i has

the lower marginal rate of substitution, U 0 (cit+1 )/U 0 (cit ) < U 0 (cjt+1 )/U 0 (cjt ), then (14) and (16)

imply that θit > 0.

      Using the transversality condition, we can iterate on the consumer budget constraints to

get an expression for the assets as
                ∞
                X
        ait =         qt,s (cis − yis ),                                                                       (17)
                s=t
                                                                          P∞
where qt,s = qt,t+1 qt+1,t+2 . . . qs−1,s . We set initial assets ai0 =    t=0 q0,t (cit   − yit ).

      We set the debt constraints as follows. If a debt constraint binds for consumer i in t, so

that vit+1 > 0, then we set the debt constraint Bit+1 = ait+1 , so that the constrained consumer

can borrow no more than the consumer’s actual borrowing.

      If a debt constraint is slack for consumer i in t, so that vit = 0, then there are many ways

to set the borrowing limit, all of which will be slack. The loosest is to set the limit equal to the
                                                                               P∞
present discounted value of future endowments, so that Bit+1 = −                   s=t+1 qt+1,s yis .   Alvarez and

Jermann [2] choose to set it according to the following counterfactual thought experiment. If

at the constructed prices an unconstrained consumer happens to borrow exactly up to the limit

in period t and then acts optimally from then on, this consumer will be indiﬀerent between the


                                                      10
proposed allocations and autarky. More formally, let Jit (ait ) denote the maximized value in the

consumer’s problem (12) for some arbitrary level of initial assets, where we have suppressed the

dependence of this value on the current and future prices and debt constraints {qs,s+1 , Bis+1 }∞
                                                                                                s=t .


Then define debt constraints to be not too tight if the sequence {Bit+1 } satisfies

       Jit (Bit ) = Vit .                                                                                           (18)

Notice that (18) not only defines the debt constraints for the unconstrained consumer as we

have discussed, but applied to the constrained consumer, it also automatically implies that

Bit+1 = ait+1 .

      To make our argument complete, we need to show that any constrained eﬃcient allocation

that satisfies the high implied interest rate condition (11) also satisfies the transversality condition
                                                                                              P∞
(15). To see this, note that with debt constraints that satisfy Bit+1 = −                      s=t+1 qt+1,s yis   for the

unconstrained consumer and Bit+1 = ait+1 for the constrained consumer, from (17) it follows
                                    P∞
that ait − Bit is equal to             s=t qt,s cis   for the unconstrained consumer and equal to 0 for the

constrained consumer. In either case, since cis is nonnegative and satisfies the resource constraint,
              P∞
ait − Bit ≤       s=t qt,s (y1s   + y2s ), and hence,

where the second inequality in (19) follows since, by construction, q0,t ≥ β t U 0 (cit )/U 0 (ci0 ), and

the second equality in (19) follows from the high implied interest rate condition (11).

      From the construction, it is immediate that the constrained eﬃcient allocations {c1t , c2t }

together with the constructed asset positions {a1t , a2t }, debt prices {qt,t+1 }, and debt constraints


                                                               11
{B1t+1 , B2t+1 } form a competitive equilibrium with debt constraints. We have thus established

the following:


     Proposition 1. Any constrained eﬃcient allocation that has high implied interest rates can

be decentralized as a competitive equilibrium with debt constraints.


                           1.3. Decentralization With Debt Taxes

Now we discuss how to decentralize the constrained eﬃcient allocations as a competitive equi-

librium with debt taxes. We show that if these debt taxes are appropriately chosen, then the

constrained eﬃcient allocations can be decentralized. (In the next section, we will allow the

governments to purposefully choose these taxes.)

     In this economy, the government of each country can tax payments made to consumers in

the other country and then rebate the proceeds in a lump-sum fashion to its own consumers.

Except for these government policies, private markets function perfectly.

     We begin by setting up a competitive equilibrium with debt taxes. Consider the consumer

problem and the government budget constraint for some arbitrarily given sequence of govern-

ment policies and prices. Throughout we will focus on country 1; the notation for country 2

is analogous. It is convenient to define separate variables for saving and for borrowing. We let

s1t+1 ≥ 0 denote the savings, or assets, of a consumer in country 1, b1t+1 ≥ 0 denote that con-

sumer’s borrowings, or liabilities, and τ 1t ∈ [0, 1] denote the tax rate levied by the government

of country 1 on payments from country 1 consumers to country 2 consumers.

     The problem for a consumer in country 1 is to maximize utility

subject to the budget constraint


         c1t + pt,t+1 (s1t+1 − b1t+1 ) = y1t + (1 − τ 2t )s1t − b1t + T1t ;                                 (20)


the nonnegativity constraints sit+1 , bit+1 ≥ 0; and bounds on debt b1t+1 ≤ b̄, where b̄ is a large

positive constant. Here pt,t+1 is the price of a consumption good in t + 1 in period t units, τ 2t is

country 2’s tax rate on payments s1t that country 2 consumers make to country 1 consumers, and

T1t is lump-sum transfers from the government of country 1 to its own consumers. The initial

assets si0 and liabilities bi0 are given.

      The government of country 1 chooses a tax rate on payments to country 2 consumers τ 1t

and rebates the revenues to its own consumers in a lump-sum fashion, so that the government

budget constraint in country 1 is T1t = τ 1t b1t .

liabilities {si0 , bi0 }i=1,2 consists of an allocation {c1t , c2t }∞                           ∞

               t=0 , and prices {pt,t+1 }t=0 such that {cit , sit+1 , bit+1 } solves the consumer problem for


each i, and markets clear, so that s1t+1 = b2t+1 and b1t+1 = s2t+1 and the resource constraint (1)

holds.

      To understand the budget constraints of the consumer and the government, suppose that in

period t − 1 a consumer in country 1 lends pt−1,t s1t in exchange for a promise to receive, in period

t, s1t minus the taxes τ 2t s1t levied by country 2 on repayments to country 1. Consumers in country

2 repay a total of s1t = b2t , with (1 − τ 2t )s1t going to country 1 consumers and τ 2t s1t = τ 2t b2t

going to the government of country 2. The government of country 2 then redistributes its tax

revenue in a lump-sum fashion to its own consumers.

      For brevity, from now on we let Uit0 denote Uct (cit ). With this notation, the first-order

with equality if b1t+1 > 0, so that country 2 is lending to country 1. Here and throughout we

assume that the debt constraint b1t+1 ≤ b̄ does not bind. The transversality condition is


       lim β t pt,t+1 U1t
                       0
                          (sit+1 − bit+1 + b̄) = 0.                                         (23)

      We now show the following analog of Proposition 1.


      Proposition 2. Any constrained eﬃcient allocation that has high implied interest rates can

be decentralized as a competitive equilibrium with debt taxes.


      Proof. We decentralize a constrained eﬃcient allocation with high implied interest rates as

follows. We set the prices

We set the taxes as follows. If at the given allocations U1t+1 /U1t ≥ U2t+1 /U2t , then we set

τ 1t+1 = 0 and

with qt,s = qt,t+1 qt+1,t+2 . . . qs−1,s and qt,t+1 = β maxi Uit+1 /Uit0 . If the right side of (28) is nonneg-

ative, we set bit+1 = 0; if the right side of (28) is negative, we set sit+1 = 0.

      We can see that the constructed prices, taxes, and assets and liabilities are a competitive

equilibrium with taxes as follows. To check the constructed prices, notice that in equilibrium in

any period t, either country 1 is lending to country 2, so that s1t+1 = b2t+1 > 0, s2t+1 = b1t+1 = 0,

and

           i  Uit             i  Uit

When either (29) or (30) hold, it is clear that the price pt,t+1 satisfies (24), while if (31) holds,

the price pt,t+1 can take on a range of values, one of which is given by (24). By inspection, we

know that the constructed taxes satisfy (29)—(31).

      To check the constructed assets and liabilities, substitute the budget constraint of the

government T1t = τ 2t b1t into that of the consumer to obtain

        c1t + pt,t+1 (s1t+1 − b1t+1 ) = (1 − τ 1t )s1t − (1 − τ 2t )b1t + y1t ,                           (32)


                                                        15
where if s1t > 0 and b1t = 0, then (1 − τ 1t )(1 − τ 2t ) = (1 − τ 1t ); and if s1t = 0 and b1t ≥ 0, then

(1 − τ 1t )(1 − τ 2t ) = (1 − τ 2t ). Hence, in general, we can write (32) as


        c1t + pt,t+1 (s1t+1 − b1t+1 ) = (1 − τ 1t )(1 − τ 2t )(s1t − b1t ) + y1t .                            (33)


Using the transversality condition, we can iterate on (33) to obtain

where ρt,s = ρt,t ρt,t+1 . . . ρs−1,s and ρt,t = 1 and

                           pt,t+1
        ρt,t+1 =                           .
                    (1 − τ 1t )(1 − τ 2t )

Using (24) and (27), we can see that ρt,t+1 = qt,t+1 and, hence, that ρt,s = qt,s . This relation used

along with (27) in (34) lets us reduce (34) to (28).

      The final step is to show that at the constructed allocations, if the high implied interest

rate condition (11) holds, then the transversality condition (23) holds. Notice first that


        b̄ lim β t pt,t+1 U1t
                           0
                              = 0.                                                                            (35)

To see this, note that since pt,t+1 satisfies (24), pt,t+1 U1t ≤ U1t+1 , while the high implied interest

rate condition implies that

we need only show that limt→∞ β t pt,t+1 U1t

(11). ¥


                                               1.4. Diﬀerences

Although we have shown that either debt constraints or debt taxes can be used to decentralize

an allocation, there is an important diﬀerence in how interest rates and prices are defined in

the two decentralizations. In the debt constraints economy, the interest rate (1/qt,t+1 ) is given

by the marginal rate of substitution of the agent whose enforcement constraint is not binding,

while in the economy with debt taxes, the interest rate (1/pt,t+1 ) is given by the marginal rate

of substitution of the agent whose enforcement constraint is binding. So, in general, the decen-

tralization with debt taxes will produce higher interest rates than the decentralization with debt

constraints. At an intuitive level, we know that in the decentralization with debt constraints,

interest rates are low, and the debt constraint is needed to prevent the agent with the binding

enforcement constraint from borrowing “too much.” Conversely, in the decentralization with

debt taxes, interest rate are high, and taxes are needed to prevent the agent whose enforcement

constraint is not binding from saving “too much.”



                                                          17
      One implication of these diﬀerent decentralizations is how interest rates respond to enforce-

ment frictions. If we start from a frictionless economy and add enforcement problems, then we

see that the interest rate moves diﬀerently in the two decentralizations. Relative to the friction-

less rate, the interest rate falls in the debt constraint decentralization and rises in the debt tax

decentralization. We find this feature of the debt tax decentralization somewhat appealing.


                    2. ENDOGENIZING THE DEBT TAXES

In our decentralizations, we have used the constrained eﬃcient allocations to construct the ap-

propriate debt constraints or debt taxes that decentralize the given allocations, but we have not

oﬀered a story about where these constraints or taxes come from. Here we provide a story for

how the constructed debt taxes may come out of an equilibrium of a dynamic game with both

government behavior and consumer behavior endogenous.


                                     2.1. The Dynamic Game

We set up this dynamic game as follows. In each period, the governments and the consumers

can vary their decisions, depending on the history of government policies up to the time the

decision is made. We let π t = (τ 1t , τ 2t ) denote the two governments’ policies in period t. At the

beginning of period t, the government of each country chooses a current policy as a function of

the history of past government policies ht−1 = (π 0 , ..., π t−1 ) together with a contingency plan for

setting future policies for all possible future histories. Let σ it (ht−1 ) denote the period t tax on

debt repayments chosen by the government of country i when faced with history ht−1 . After the

government sets the current policies, consumers make their decisions. Faced with the history

ht = (ht−1 , π t ), consumers in country i choose their period t consumption, assets, and liabilities,

denoted fit (ht ) = (cit (ht ), sit (hit ), bit (ht )). The prices are a function of the government policy


                                                   18
history and are denoted pt,t+1 (ht ). Let σ = (σ 1 , σ 2 ), and let σ i denote the infinite sequence of

functions (σ it ). Use similar notation for the other variables.

        For some given initial assets and liabilities, a sustainable equilibrium is a triple (σ, f, p)

such that three conditions are satisfied:

        (i) For i = 1, 2, for every history of government policies ht , the consumer allocations fis (hs )

for s = t, ..., solve

               ∞
               X
         max         β s−t U (cis )
               s=t


subject to


         c1s + ps,s+1 (hs )(s1s+1 − b1s+1 )


         = y1s + [1 − τ 2s (hs−1 )s1s (hs−1 )] − b1s (hs−1 ) + T1s (hs−1 ),


where the future histories’ policies and prices are induced from ht , σ, and p in the obvious way.

That is, ht+1 = (ht , σ t+1 (ht )), ht+2 = (ht ,σ t+1 (ht ),σ t+2 (ht , σ t+1 (ht ))), and given these induced

future histories, the policies and prices are given by σ s (hs−1 ) and ps (hs ).

        (ii) For every history ht , markets clear and the government budget constraint holds for

s = t, ..., so that c1s (hs ) + c2s (hs ) = y1s + y2s , as well as s1s (hs ) = b2s (hs ), s2s (hs ) = b1s (hs ), and

T1s (hs−1 ) ≡ τ 1s (hs−1 )b1s (hs−1 ), where the future histories hs are induced from σ in the obvious

way.

        (iii) For every history ht−1 , country 1’s government policies from t on, σ 1s for all s ≥ t,

solve

               X
               ∞
         max         β s−t U (c1s (h0s−1 )),
               s=t




                                                        19
         0              0          0                 0              0          0
where ht = (ht−1 , (σ 1t (ht−1 ), σ 2t (ht−1 ))) and ht+1 = (ht , (σ 1t+1 (ht ), σ 2t+1 (ht ))) and so on. A

similar condition holds for the government of country 2.

      Notice that in this definition of a sustainable equilibrium we require that both the gov-

ernments and the consumers act optimally for every history of policies–even for histories not

induced by the governments’ policy plans. This requirement is analogous to the requirement

of perfection in a game. In this definition, the consumers act competitively in that they take

current policies and prices and the evolution of future histories as unaﬀected by their actions.

The governments are not competitive. The government of country 1, for example, takes the allo-

cation rules f1 and f2 , the price function p, and the policy plan of the government of country 2,

σ 2 , as given. But the government of country 1 realizes that it can aﬀect outcomes both directly,

by having its consumers face a diﬀerent tax on payments to the other country’s consumers, and

indirectly, by aﬀecting the evolution of the future history and thus aﬀecting the policies chosen

by the other government, the allocations chosen by the consumers, and the prices.


                            2.2. Outcomes of a Sustainable Equilibrium

Recall that a sustainable equilibrium (σ, f, p) is a sequence of functions that specify policies,

allocations, and prices for all possible government policy histories. Thus, when we start from

the null history in period 0, a sustainable equilibrium induces a particular sequence of policies,

allocations, and prices that we denote by (π, x, p). We call this the outcome induced by the

sustainable equilibrium. In what follows, we adapt the work of Chari and Kehoe [6, 7], which

builds on the work of Abreu [1], to characterize this outcome.

      We first construct a sustainable equilibrium that we call the autarky equilibrium. We then

characterize the allocations that can be induced by reverting to this autarky equilibrium after



                                                    20
deviations. We define the autarky policy plans σ a , allocation rules f a , and price rules pa starting

from some given initial assets and liabilities as follows. The policy plan σ ait (ht−1 ) = 1, for all

i and t. Given any history ht , the autarky allocations (cait (ht ), sait+1 (ht ), bait+1 (ht )) are given by

cait (ht ) = yit , while the autarky prices of debt and the quantities of assets and liabilities are

identically zero, so pat,t+1 (ht ) = sait+1 (ht ) = bait+1 (ht ) = 0. The utility of autarky for consumer i in

period t is Vit .

      We now characterize the outcomes that can be sustained by a set of plans called the revert-

to-autarky plans, which are defined as follows. For an arbitrary sequence of policies, allocations,

and prices (π, x, p), these plans specify continuation with the candidate sequences (π, x, p) as

long as the specified policies have been chosen in the past; otherwise, the plans specify the

revert-to-autarky plans (σ a , f a , pa ). We then have


      Proposition 3. An arbitrary triple of sequences (π, x, p) can be sustained by the revert-to-

autarky plans if and only if the sequence is a competitive equilibrium with debt taxes and if, for

i = 1, 2 for every t, the following inequality holds:
        ∞
        X
              β s−t U (cis ) ≥ Vit .                                                                     (40)
        s=t



      Proof. Suppose, first, that the sequences of policies, allocations, and prices (π, x, p) can be

sustained by the revert-to-autarky plans; that is, suppose the associated revert-to-autarky plans

(σ, f, p) constitute a sustainable equilibrium. From the definition of a sustainable equilibrium,

consumer optimality requires that x maximize consumer welfare in period 0. This requirement

together with market-clearing ensures that this sequence is a competitive equilibrium in period

0.



                                                     21
     Next, we claim that inequality (40) holds for all i and t. Note that a feasible policy for

the government of i in t is to choose the autarky policies for all s ≥ t by taxing repayments to

consumers in the other country at rate 1. This policy will lead to a continuation utility of Vita ,

and hence, optimality of government policy ensures that (40) holds.

     Now suppose that some arbitrary triple of sequences (π, x, p) satisfies the proposition’s

conditions. We show that the associated revert-to-autarky plans constitute a sustainable equi-

librium. Consider, first, histories for which there have been no deviations from π before t. Since

(π, x, p) is a competitive equilibrium in period 0, x is optimal for consumers in period 0 given

π and p, and thus, the continuation of x is optimal for consumers when they are faced with

the continuation of π and p. In terms of government optimality, consider the situation of the

government of country 1. If it deviates in period t, then the consumers in both countries and the

government of country 2 will revert to the autarky policy plans and the autarky allocation rules

from period t on. Under these allocation rules, country 2 consumers will never lend to country 1

consumers, regardless of the policies chosen by the government of country 1. Thus, the best the

government of country 1 can obtain is the value of autarky from then on given by the right side

of (40). Given the assumed inequality, then, sticking to the specified plan is optimal.

     Consider, next, histories with a deviation from π before t. Clearly, the autarky plans from

then on are sustainable. From a consumer’s point of view, since no debt will be repaid, lending

is not optimal. The price of debt is zero since the value to a potential lender in the other country

of a promise to pay one unit tomorrow, net of taxes equal to one unit, is worthless. Thus, the

consumer is indiﬀerent among all amounts to borrow or lend because all have value 0 and all

pay 0. From a government’s point of view, given that the other government never allows its

consumers to repay their debts outside the country, regardless of the first government’s actions,


                                                22
it is optimal to prevent its own consumers from repaying their debts outside the country. ¥


        Combining Propositions 2 and 3, we immediately obtain the following proposition:


        Proposition 4. Any constrained eﬃcient allocation is the outcome of a sustainable equilib-

rium.


                                     3. ADDING CAPITAL
We now explore how our results change when we move from a pure exchange economy to a growth

model with capital. We first show in a constrained eﬃcient allocation that if the enforcement

constraints bind, then the Euler equation for capital is distorted. This result implies that a

competitive equilibrium with debt constraints alone cannot decentralize such an allocation. But

if in addition to the debt constraints, we allow for constraints that limit the amount of capital

that can be accumulated, capital constraints, then the constrained eﬃcient allocations can be

decentralized. However, we argue that such capital constraints are not intuitively appealing and

turn to our preferred decentralization: a combination of debt taxes and capital income taxes.

This combination can decentralize the constrained eﬃcient allocations. Finally, we sketch out

how these taxes may endogenously arise in a dynamic game similar to that just described.


                                         3.1. A Growth Model

We modify our pure exchange economy in several ways. The preferences are the same as before.

The resource constraints are now


         c1t + c2t + k1t+1 + k2t+1 = A1t f (k1t ) + A2t f(k2t ) + (1 − δ)(k1t + k2t )        (41)


with ki0 given, where kit+1 is the capital stock chosen in period t for use in production in

period t + 1; f(k) is a standard production function that is increasing, concave, and continuously


                                                      23
diﬀerentiable and satisfies the standard Inada conditions; Ait is country-specific deterministic

exogenous shocks; and δ is the depreciation rate of capital. The enforcement constraints are now

        X
              β s−t U (cis ) ≥ Vit (kit ),                                                          (42)
        s=t


where
                                ∞

        Vit (kit ) = max              β t U (cit )                                                  (43)

        cit + kit+1 = Ait f (kit ) + (1 − δ)kit .                                                   (44)


Notice that the problem with (financial) autarky reduces to that of a planning problem of a

closed-economy growth model. Notice also that the value of utility under autarky in period t

depends on the amount of capital located in country i in that period, kit . The derivatives of this

value, V 0 (kit ), will be the root problem behind why the equilibrium with debt constraints alone

cannot decentralize the constrained eﬃcient allocations.

     The constrained eﬃcient allocations of this economy solve the planning problem of maxi-

mizing a weighted sum of the discounted utilities:
               "                                                     #

where z−1 = λ2 /λ1 . Equation (46) is the Euler equation for capital accumulation in the economy

with enforcement constraints. This equation is distorted away from the familiar Euler equation

of the standard growth model that would arise in the absence of such constraints,


       U (cit ) = βU 0 (cit+1 )[f 0 (kit+1 ) + 1 − δ].                                      (47)


Notice that if vit+1 were equal to zero, then (46) would reduce to (47).


                             3.2. Decentralization With Debt Constraints

We now show that a competitive equilibrium with debt constraints alone cannot decentralize the

constrained eﬃcient allocations, except for the trivial case in which the enforcement constraints

never bind. In general, to decentralize such allocations, we need constraints limiting the amount

of capital that can be saved on capital as well as constraints limiting the amount of borrowing

with debt.


                                                           25
     Consider an economy with two countries i = 1, 2, each of which has a representative con-

sumer. Each consumer owns a production unit. Only that consumer can work with that unit,

but the consumer can borrow and lend from anyone else, subject to some time-varying debt

constraints. The representative consumer in country i solves the problem

       ait+1 ≥ Bit+1 ,                                                                        (50)


where Bit+1 is an exogenous, time-varying, agent-specific debt constraint. (We can imagine that

kit ≥ 0, but when f satisfies the Inada conditions, this will never bind, so we ignore it.) Letting

β t θit denote the multiplier on the debt constraint, we can summarize the first-order conditions

by

                     βU 0 (cit+1 )    θ it
       qt,t+1 =          0
                                   + 0
                      U (cit )      U (cit )

       U 0 (cit ) = βU 0 (cit+1 )[f 0 (kit+1 ) + (1 − δ)]                                     (51)


with θt ≥ 0.


     Proposition 5. If the enforcement constraint ever binds in the constrained eﬃcient alloca-

tion, then that allocation cannot be decentralized as an equilibrium with debt constraints.




                                                            26
      Proof. By construction, the normalized multiplier vit+1 ∈ [0, 1]. Suppose, by way of contra-

diction, that the enforcement constraint binds in some period t, so that vit+1 is strictly positive.

Since U 0 and f 0 are positive and V 0 is negative, the right side of (46),
           ½                                                          ¾
               U 0 (cit+1 ) 0                       vit+1    0
       β                   [f (kit+1 ) + 1 − δ] −           V (kit+1 ) ,
               1 − vit+1                          1 − vit+1

is strictly larger than the right side of (51). Thus if (46) holds at the constrained eﬃcient

allocation, then the Euler equation in the decentralized equilibrium (51) cannot also hold. ¥

      Now imagine that besides the debt constraint, we also add a capital constraint, a time-

varying constraint on the amount of capital that can be saved of the form


       kit+1 ≤ Dit+1 ,                                                                         (52)


where {Dit+1 } is a sequence of constants. It should be fairly obvious that if we choose these

constants appropriately, then we can decentralize the constrained eﬃcient allocations.

      To see this, imagine adding (52) to the consumer’s problem (48). If we let β t λit denote the

multiplier on (52), then the first-order condition for capital (51) is changed to


       U 0 (cit ) = βU 0 (cit+1 )[f 0 (kit+1 ) + (1 − δ)] − λit .                              (53)


With the appropriate choice of the capital constraint, the multiplier λit can be set so that

(53) coincides with (46). (For an alternative approach that arrives at the same conclusion, see

Seppälä [19].)


                                   3.3. Decentralization With Taxes

Consider now decentralizing the constrained eﬃcient outcome as a competitive equilibrium with

taxes on capital income as well as on debt. With these two taxes, we can mimic the distorted

first-order conditions that define the constrained eﬃcient outcome.


                                                          27

and the nonnegativity constraints sit+1 , bit+1 ≥ 0, and si0 , bi0 and ki0 given. Here Rit = 1 +

(1 − η it )(rit − δ) is the gross return on capital after taxes and depreciation, rit is the before-

tax return on capital, and η it is the tax on capital income net of depreciation (rit − δ). In this

decentralization, there are firms whose behavior we can summarize by conditions for rental rates

and wage rates:


        rit = f 0 (kit ) and wit = f (kit ) − kit f 0 (kit ).                                                    (55)


      In this economy, a competitive equilibrium with debt and capital income taxes

{τ 1t , τ 2t , η 1t , η 2t }∞
                            t=0 together with initial assets, liabilities, and capital stocks {si0 , bi0 , ki0 }i=1,2

                                                                   t=0 ,   assets   {s1t+1, s2t+1 }∞
                                                                                                   t=0 ,   liabilities

{b1t+1, b2t+1 }∞                                     ∞
               t=0 , and prices {pt,t+1 , rit , wit }t=0 such that {cit , sit+1 , bit+1 , kit+1 } solves the consumer


problem for each i and markets clear, so that s1t+1 = b2t+1 and b1t+1 = s2t+1 and the resource

constraint (41) holds.

      The construction of the debt taxes, assets, liabilities, and prices is nearly identical to that

for the pure exchange economy. The rental rates r and wage rates w are given by (55) while the

tax on capital income η is backed out from the Euler equation


        U 0 (cit ) = βU 0 (cit+1 )[1 + (1 − η it+1 )(fkit − δ)].


                                                             28
The following proposition is then immediate:


     Proposition 6. Any allocation that satisfies the resource constraint and has high implied

interest rates can be decentralized as a competitive equilibrium with debt and capital income

taxes.


     It is straightforward to show that any constrained eﬃcient outcome is the outcome of a

suitably defined sustainable equilibrium.


                                    4. CONCLUSION

We have proposed a new decentralization of constrained eﬃcient allocations in which the forces

that give rise to the limited risk-sharing are more explicitly modeled than in the existing liter-

ature. The decentralization is intuitively appealing when applied to international risk-sharing

problems for economies with capital and a limited ability to enforce contracts. It may be possi-

ble to similarly model the forces that limit risk-sharing in other decentralizations, for example,

an equilibrium in which the debt constraints studied by Alvarez and Jermann [2] are explicitly

chosen by financial intermediaries in an appropriately defined dynamic game.

     Here we have focused on a deterministic economy in order to economize on notation, but

all our results immediately generalize to a stochastic economy, provided that debt constraints,

capital constraints, and taxes can be state-contingent.
