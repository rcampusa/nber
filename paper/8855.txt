                                              ABSTRACT

        Discussions of school accountability focus on two issues: poor test administration and the
expense of accountability. Up to this point, researchers have focused on test quality and simply assumed
that the programs are expensive enough to crowd out other policies, such as class size reduction or higher
teacher salaries. Researchers have also assumed that it is so expensive to have a good accountability
program (which includes good comprehensive tests, well-defined standards, an effective report card
system, and safeguards that prevent cheating and teaching the test) that only poor accountability systems
will be affordable. In this paper, I present the facts about how much accountability costs. The facts are,
fortunately, highly knowable because costs show up both as expenditures on government budgets and as
revenues on companies' (mainly test makers') accounts. Moreover, it turns out that worrying about
measurement error in the cost data is pointless. The costs of accountability programs are so tiny that even
the most generous accounting could not make them appear large, relative to the cost of other education
programs. The "most expensive" programs in the United States generally cost less than one quarter of
1 percent of per pupil spending, and most of these are only as costly as they are because a state is in the
"expensive" and temporary phase of developing its own comprehensive tests.

                                     I. Is Accountability Expensive?

        A good accountability program includes a combination of testing, standards against which the

test results can be compared, and report cards that relay this information (as well as information on

schools’ level and use of resources) to parents and policy-makers. Proponents of school accountability

tout the benefits of a well-run accountability system: information for teachers and principals who need to

diagnose their students’ progress, information that gives schools incentives to perform, information for

parents who need to make choices among schools, and information on the degree to which schools are

teaching the material that their constituents (parents, voters, school boards, legislatures) want them to

teach. In fact, school accountability programs are generally seen as complementary to other types of

school reform. School choice, for instance, should work better if parents have more information, rather

than less.

        Opponents of school accountability mount arguments on two fronts: poor quality of tests and the

expense of accountability. It is natural to care about the quality of tests because students will naturally

spend time learning the material that is tested and schools will naturally tend to align their curricula with

the material that is tested. Indeed, it is the intention of a good school accountability system that students

study the material tested. The quality of tests and standards, though important, is the topic of a great deal

of other research. This paper focuses instead on the second issue regarding accountability–its expense.

Some opponents of school accountability argue that it is so expensive that it will crowd out other

policies, such as class size reduction or higher teacher salaries. Other opponents argue that is so

expensive to have a good accountability program (which includes well-designed, comprehensive tests,

well-defined standards, an effective report card system, and safeguards that prevent cheating and

teaching the test) that only poor accountability systems will be affordable.

        Understanding the cost of accountability turns out to be much simpler than understanding what
                                                                                                              2

makes a good test or set of standards. Facts are the best answer to questions about costs, so this chapter

presents the facts. The facts about how much accountability costs, fortunately, knowable. This is

because the costs must show up in two places: as expenditures on some government’s (usually the

state’s) budget and as revenues on some company’s (mainly the test maker’s) accounts. A skeptic might

ask, however: “Even if the accounting facts are knowable, won’t they be imperfect? In one state, the

salaries of state personnel who oversee the program might end up being counted as a cost of

accountability; but another state might count such personnel as mere general staff of the state’s

department education.” This is a reasonable concern, but it turns out that such accounting details are not

worthy of much worry. The costs of accountability programs are so small that even the most generous

accounting could not make them appear large, relative to the cost of other education programs.



             II. What Test-Makers’ Revenues Tell Us about the Cost of Accountability

        Nearly every achievement and ability test administered to American elementary and secondary

school students is purchased from a commercial test making firm, which also grades the test and prepares

reports at the state, district, school, grade, class, and student levels. The same firms support with their

tests with curriculum guides, suggested standards for criterion-based tests, and materials designed to help

schools understand the tests and standards and use them wisely. Indeed, test-makers tend also to be

textbook publishers, so the knowledge on which they base tests and standards is generally the same

knowledge that they must be able to defend for inclusion in textbooks.1 The American elementary and

secondary testing and standards industry is dominated by a several firms that well known: Harcourt-

Brace Educational Measurement, Reed-Elsevier, Houghton-Mifflin, Prentice-Hall, CTB/McGraw-Hill,

and so on. In practice, these firms rely on similar psychometric research and routinely hire experts from


        1
          The only important non-commercial elementary or secondary test is the National Assessment
of Educational Progress, which is administered to a random sample of American students at the behest of
the United States Department of Education.
                                                                                                              3

one another. The firms publish tests with names that are nationally familiar (such as the Stanford 9,

California Test of Basic Skills/Terra Nova, and Iowa Test of Basic Skills), but they also write the states’

specialized tests, such as the Connecticut Mastery Tests, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills,

Florida Writes, and all of the others.

        Because of the small number and consistency of the firms involved, analysts have a very clear

sense of the industry’s revenues from accountability systems. According to the Association of American

Publishers, the total revenues associated with accountability systems (revenues from sales of tests,

revenues from standards-related materials like curriculum guides and criteria, and revenues services

associated with accountability such as consulting for state government) amounted to $234.1 million in

2000. Because this figure includes a variety of intelligence quotient tests, diagnostic tests for disabled

children, career guidance tests, and the like; this figure overstates firms’ revenue associated with

accountability. Nevertheless, the revenues amount to only $4.96 per American student! Table 1 shows

that, even when we add in the cost of the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the only

important elementary or secondary test not associated with a commercial test-maker, the cost of

accountability is $5.81 per student. Such costs represents a very small share of the cost of educating

American children: average per-pupil spending in the United States was $8,157 in the 2000-01 school

year. Put another way, payments to all test-makers (including the United States government) represented

just 0.07 percent (seven-hundredths of 1 percent) of the cost of elementary and secondary education.

Even if payments were 10 times as large, they would still not be equal to 1 percent of what American

jurisdictions spend on education.

        In short, it seems likely that people who oppose accountability because of its costs have not

investigated the revenues of test-makers, which suggest that the costs are extremely modest.



               III. What States’ Expenditures Tell Us about the Cost of Accountability
                                                                                                               4

        Not all costs of state accountability systems end up as revenues that accrue to test-makers,

however. States certainly can and do run accountability systems by just paying for tests, the cost of

publishing results, and the cost of writing and publishing the standards on which the tests are graded.

Indeed, such states spend less than $4.96 per student for their systems. Other states put more elaborate

systems in place and have additional costs. For instance, some states have asked test-makers to design

tests and curriculum guides that are specific to the state. Developing such materials costs more than

using an “off-the-shelf” test, but the additional costs vary with the degree to which the state desires an

idiosyncratic test. A assessment system that requires only modest adaptation and augmentation of a test-

maker’s existing materials will obviously cost less than a assessment system that has to be written nearly

from scratch, albeit using much of the same knowledge and expertise that goes into off-the-shelf tests.

Moreover, states can choose to create a larger or smaller bureaucracy associated with an accountability

system. While some states administer their systems with existing department of education staff or just a

few additional staff, other states add numerous personnel who promulgate standards, run seminars for

principals and teachers, and answer parents’ questions. As a rule, states add more personnel when their

accountability systems are more idiosyncratic (to the state) or more controversial with the public (so that

more public relations are required). Also, a state that adds numerous personnel at the start-up of a

system will often need fewer personnel to continue the system once the first few years are over and

schools are accustomed to the process. Apart from payments to test-makers and their experts, a state’s

accountability budget may show some or all of the following expenses: the cost of running an office of

accountability, the salaries of accountability bureaucrats at the state department of education, the cost of

publishing school report cards (in addition to publishing test results and standards), the cost of ongoing

re-development and evaluation of the system itself, the cost of consultants, and reimbursement to school

districts for any costs that are imposed on them (such as training counselors on how to explain the system

to parents). Because accountability systems tend to be popular with the public (according to Public
                                                                                                             5

Agenda, 94 percent of the public favor testing and standards), states have an incentive to exaggerate, not

understate, the share of their department of education’s overhead that is associated with accountability.

Thus, once we add up a states’ reported expenses for its accountability system (including payments to

test-makers), we have (if anything) a slightly overstated sense of how it costs a state to run a system.

        Table 2 reviews the costs of 25 states’ accountability systems. The 25 systems shown include

the nation’s most expensive systems because they naturally have the most specialized offices, which are

the best at providing timely, detailed cost information. Table 2 shows which subjects are tested, which

grades are tested, and both total and per-pupil costs. All of the states test reading (R) and mathematics

(m), but some also test writing (W), science (S), social studies and history (SS), a foreign language (FL),

the arts (A), vocational studies (V), computers and technology (C), or health and physical education (H).

The most commonly tested grades are elementary and middle school grades, where off-the-shelf tests or

modest adaptations of them are most appropriate. (There is widespread agreement that third graders

ought to be numerate and able to read very simple material. There is more controversy about high school

students should know.) Nevertheless, all but one of the 25 states tests high school students–with a few

testing students in every year of high school and several requiring a high school graduation test or high

school competency exam.

        The per pupil cost of accountability varies in Table 2, not only because statesengage in different

amounts of testing and have different “bells and whistles,” but also because less-populated states share

the fixed costs of a system (especially an idiosyncratic system) over fewer pupils than large states do. At

the low cost end, there are states like South Carolina ($1.79 per pupil) and Georgia ($4.74 per pupil). At

the upper cost end, there are states like Delaware ($34.02 per pupil) and Maryland ($24.26 per pupil).

Even acknowledging that it is likely that states like South Carolina understate the costs and that states

overstate them, we have a good sense of the range. Just to keep things in perspective, note that even if

every state had the per-pupil accountability costs that Delaware reports, their systems would still account
                                                                                                              6

for only 0.4 percent (less than one half of 1 percent) of per pupil expenditure on American public

schools.



            IV. Some Case Studies Showing the Costs of States’ Accountability Systems

        While Table 2 gives us a good overall sense of the cost of accountability, curious readers may

want to know more detail. I picked out several states with rather elaborate and well-documented

accountability systems, and investigated the details of their costs. Tables 3 through 7 show the results.

        First, consider Arizona’s system, the costs of which are presented in Table 3. Arizona is a fairly

typical state in that it uses both an off-the-shelf test (the Stanford Achievement Test in grades 1 through

9) and a test designed specifically for the state (Arizona’s Instrument to Measure Standards test,

popularly known as “AIMS,” in grades 3, 5, 8, and 12). Arizona tests students in reading, writing, and

mathematics, a pattern that is also fairly typical. Arizona reports that the testing itself cost $5.93 per

student, which is reasonable given the mix of inexpensive off-the-shelf tests and more expensive state-

specific tests. Arizona has a student accountability information system that follows each student’s

progress over time, computes value-added for each student, and tracks each student’s grade progression

and movement among schools. The information system is run through an office of the state department

of education and costs $2.24 per pupil. Finally, Arizona publishes the test results, its standards, and a

myriad of other information about schools (staffing, enrollment, mission, special programs, spending) in

a school report card. These report cards are not only distributed to parents and policy-makers; they are

also made available at all public libraries and can be viewed on (and downloaded from ) a dedicated

website. The report card system costs $0.55 per pupil, so that Arizona’s system costs a total of $8.72 per

pupil. Arizona’s system is widely perceived as a system that is comprehensive without being

overbearing (Arizona does not use it to enforce a particular curriculum), and part of the fame of the state

superintendent who implemented it, Lisa Graham Keegan, is due to the system’s being a model for other
                                                                                                             7

states. Thus, it is reasonable to take Arizona’s $8.72 per pupil as a benchmark for a comprehensive but

not over-elaborate system.

        California has a system that is considerably more elaborate, especially at present. This is

because California is in the midst of modifying one system (STAR) and designing another (the Golden

State exams), so that it is simultaneously paying for the development of multiple tests. California has a

specially adapted and augmented version of the Stanford Achievement Test (STAR), which it uses in

grades 2 through 11 to test reading, language, spelling, mathematics, science (grades 9 through 11 only),

and social studies (grades 9 through 11 only). California is also paying for a high school exit exam and

the state-specific Golden State Exams, which are tests for grades 9 through 12 in reading, language,

written composition, mathematics, science, Spanish, and history and social science. California also has

an array of activities that complement its exams: seminars for school staff, experts to explain the system,

experts to evaluate how the system is aligned with California’s standards, an ongoing evaluation and

review of the system, and a few additional tests (English language development and career assessment).

In short, California’s system is not only elaborate because it is very comprehensive; it is also elaborate

because California is fully in the midst of its development. One might think that such a system would be

expensive, but the total cost per pupil is $19.93, about twice that of Arizona’s system, but still a very

small 0.2 percent (two-tenths of 1 percent) of American per-pupil spending.

        Personnel to administer California’s system include new department of education staff for the

Public School Accountability Act ($0.31 per pupil) and STAR tests ($0.07 per pupil), consultants for the

Public School Accountability Act ($0.04 per pupil) and high school exit exam ($0.02 per pupil), and test

experts for STAR and the high school exit exam ($0.06 per pupil). These personnel may seem like a lot,

but when spread over all the students in a state, their salaries and fees just do not amount to much ($0.50

per pupil). Similarly, the total cost of complementary activities is a modest $3.60 per pupil. The

complementary activities include a website ($0.17 per pupil), test integrity ($0.03 per pupil), alignment
                                                                                                              8

with state standards ($0.50 per pupil), reliability testing ($0.05 per pupil), test development including

that of the Golden State Exams ($1.98 + $0.25 per pupil), and assessment review ($0.62 per pupil). In

short, in California, it is still the tests themselves that generate the bulk of the costs, and we have already

seen that these costs are not great.

        Kentucky has a well-known assessment system, partly because its system has some unusual

elements like longitudinal assessment (an complex value-added system in which expert statisticians

control for student characteristics) and portfolio assessment, in which students’ actual classroom work is

assembled in a structured portfolio and analyzed by an outside expert, such as an educator. In other

words, Kentucky’s system contains a high degree of individuation for each student and has features that

are intensive in the time of experts. Kentucky is, thus, a useful benchmark for anyone interested in

individuated systems. The state’s Commonwealth Accountability Tests are administered in grades 4, 5,

7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, although not every subject is administered in every grade. The subjects are

diverse: reading, mathematics, science, social studies, arts and humanities, writing, and vocational

students. Kentucky also administers an off-the-shelf norm-referenced test in grades 3, 6, and 9, partly to

ensure that the state-specific tests remain comparable to other American tests.

        Although Kentucky’s accounting system does not contain as much detail as we would like, it

does inform us that implementing its system (including setting the standards, administering the test,

assessing the portfolios, performing longitudinal assessment, and distributing school report cards) costs a

total of $16.57 per student. This is almost twice as much as Arizona’s system, but the longitudinal and

portfolio assessment are more expensive evaluation methods. The Kentucky Commonwealth

Accountability Testing System also requires $0.53 for administration and $0.90 for ongoing validation

and research related to the system.

        The Texas system of assessment and accountability is one of the most comprehensive in the

United States. The state administers the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills test in reading and math
                                                                                                            9

in grades 3 through 8 and at the high school exit level. Texas also tests social studies and science in

grade 8; and it tests writing in grades 4, 8, and at the high school exit level. There are end-of-course

examinations in Algebra, Biology, U.S. History, and English II. Tests are administered in both English

and Spanish, and they are fully integrated with Texas' standards for every grade (the Texas Essential

Knowledge and Skills). Students with limited English proficiency take the Reading Proficiency Test in

English in grades 3 through 12, and special education students take the State-Developed Alternative

Assessment. The state is currently spending money on the development of tests for gifted and talented

students. The Texas Education Agency has what is almost certainly the most developed database system

in the United States for tracking student achievement. Indeed, every student is followed as an individual

(longitudinally), regardless of where he moves in the state. Students are even being followed into the

college system. Texas makes much of its data and reports available online, both in user friendly forms

for parents and in data base form for researchers. Schools are evaluated and school report cards are

distributed and publicized. Schools receive modest rewards for good performance.

        Texas' comprehensive system costs $20.30 per student. This includes the rewards for schools,

continuing development and evaluation of the program, and maintaining the data systems that track

students. Of this total, $6.41 is spent on the two reading assessment programs for young students, and

$10.48 is spent on all the other tests. The reward program spends $0.49 per student rewarding schools

for doing well on the assessment instruments and spends another $0.12 per student rewarding schools

that get a high percentage of parents to attend parent-teacher conferences. assessment costs $0.61 per

students. Administration, computers, and consultants account for the remaining $2.30 per student.

        Finally, let us consider the states of Washington and Virginia, which differ from Arizona’s

typical system mainly because the two states have just begun to implement state-specific tests. In other

words, Washington and Virginia are at the most expensive stage that a state can expect to experience

when setting up a state-specific system. In the first few years, implementing a assessment system is not
                                                                                                          10

routine, so it costs more. Also, in its first few years, a system continues to be developed and needs to be

explained to educators and the public.

        Washington state administers state-specific tests in reading, mathematics, writing, listening, and

science. These tests focus on grades 4, 7, and 10. The state also administers the Iowa Test of Basic

Skills in grades 3 and 6 and administers the Iowa Test of Educational Development in grade 9.

Implementing this new system cost $11.16 per student. Continuing development of the system cost an

additional $2.99 per student, and outreach efforts to explain the system to educators and parents cost

$0.70 per student. The total is $14.84 per student.

        Virginia has developed an ambitious set of state-specific tests called “Virginia Standards of

Learning.” The tests are given mainly in grades 3, 5, 8, and high school. Several subjects are tested:

writing, mathematics, English and reading, science, history and social studies, computers and technology,

world history, United States history, and world geography. The implementation and continuing

development of these tests costs $15.99 per student. In addition, Virginia administers a literacy test

($0.82 per student) and is working on an online version of its test and related curricular materials ($0.32

per student). The total is $17.13 per student.



                              V. Putting Assessment Costs in Perspective

        People who argue against accountability systems based on their costs often claim that the

systems will crowd out other school programs. Recalling this argument, it is useful to put the costs of

accountability in perspective by considering (1) per-pupil spending in the United States and (2) the costs

of two popular policies, class size reduction and higher teacher salaries. Table 8 shows the statistics for

all 50 states and for the United States as a whole.

        Examine the top row of Table 8, which shows the United States as a whole. In 2000-01, per-

pupil spending was $8,157 on average. A reduction in class size requires a proportional increase in the
                                                                                                            11

number of teachers and a proportional increase in school building size that is 1-for-1 with the

proportional reduction in class size. For instance, 10 percent more teachers and 10 percent more

classrooms are needed if class size is to be reduced by 10 percent. A 10 percent reduction in class size

translates in two fewer student per class in most of America, so a 10 percent reduction is not negligible,

yet it is unlikely to change the nature of teaching. (Reducing class size to, say, 10 students per class

would be more likely to change the nature of teaching, but it would also represent a 100 percent

reduction in class size–10 times more costly than the policy shown in Table 8!) Given that teacher

compensation represents 54 percent of the average American school’s costs and that items proportional

to the size of school buildings (building, heating, etc.) represent another 22 percent of the average

American school’s cost, a 10 percent reduction in class size costs about $615 per student in the United

States. Put another way, a modest reduction in class size costs 7,053 percent more than an accountability

system like Arizona’s and costs 12,399 percent more than the current average cost of assessment (see

Table 1). Given that a modest class size reduction is about 3 orders of magnitude more expensive an

accountability system, the claim that significant crowd-out occurs is simply unfactual. If a state were in

the midst of reducing class size, implementing an accountability system like Arizona’s (without

increasing the budget) would turn a 10 percent class size reduction to a 9.9 class size reduction. No one

would notice the difference in these two class size reduction policies! The lower rows of Table 8 show

the cost of reducing class size by 10 percent for all fifty states. The amount varies around the national

average of $615, from $422 per student in Mississippi to $896 per student in New Jersey.

        Now consider a 10 percent increase in teacher compensation. While teachers would undoubtedly

be grateful for such a raise and view it as useful, such a raise would not dramatically change the skill

level of people enter and remain in teaching. Thus, a 10 percent increase in compensation could be

described as significant but not transforming. Table 8 shows that it would cost the average American

school $437 per student to raise teachers’ compensation by 10 percent. (The low is $295 per student in
                                                                                                             12

Mississippi and the high is $669 in New Jersey.) In other words, raising teacher salaries by 10 percent

costs 5,011 percent more than an accountability system like Arizona’s and costs 8,810 percent more than

the current average cost of assessment (see Table 1). Again, a claim of crowd-out bears little relationship

to the facts. If a state were in the midst of raising teacher compensation, implementing an accountability

system like Arizona’s (without increasing the budget) would turn a 10 percent raise for teachers into a

9.8 raise. If a 9.8 percent raise were not going to change teachers, a 10 percent raise would not do so

either!

          Table 9, the final table in this chapter, puts accountability costs into perspective using per-pupil

spending. The table shows the actual share of per-pupil spending that is devoted to various states’

accountability systems. It also shows the actual share for the United States as a whole. The nation

spends 0.06 percent (six-hundredths of 1 percent) of funds for elementary and secondary public schools

on assessment. Although the states on the table include those with elaborate accountability programs, no

state spends even 1 percent of its elementary and secondary school budget on accountability. The top

spenders’ actual spending is about one-third of 1 percent of their public school budgets. In short,

assessment accounts for a tiny, almost negligible portion of American school costs at present. People

who oppose accountability based on its great cost ought to examine publicly available school accounts.



            VI. Ought Accountability Systems be a More Expensive? Preventing Cheating

          One of the most frequent complaints about accountability systems is that schools “teach to the

test.” This criticism generally confuses two complaints, one of which is legitimate and the other of

which is wrong-headed. The wrong-headed complaint is that schools “teach towards the test.” A school

that teaches toward a test modifies its curriculum in order to present material that will help students

answer the types of questions that appear on the assessment tests. This complaint is misguided because

the intention of assessment is to induce schools to alter their practices (if necessary) so that their students
                                                                                                                13

acquire the knowledge the state thinks they ought to know. While we may worry that states make

imperfect decisions about what students ought to know, such worries are best addressed by improving the

assessment instruments, not by relieving schools of the responsibility to demonstrate that they generate

knowledge.

        The legitimate complaint is that schools may “teach the test”–that is, give students specific

answers to specific questions that appear on the test. Schools may do this through outright cheating

(writing answers on the board, filling in students’ answer sheets for them, looking at the actual test ahead

of time and making students memorize sequences of answers). Schools may also do this by giving

teachers lots of access to the tests before and after the actual administration of the test, so that teachers

incorporate actual questions and answers from the test into their course materials. Using such methods, a

school could improve scores without its students acquiring the base of knowledge for which the test

questions were written.

        Fortunately, it turns out that a bit of money can solve society’s legitimate concern about teaching

the test. Elementary and secondary schools could use outside proctors to deliver the tests just before test-

time, administer and proctor the tests, and collect the tests and return them to the test-maker (who scores

them). With proctors, teachers would not be in contact with the tests at all and would have to rely on the

state’s curricular guidance to align their students’ knowledge with the tests (this is exactly what the state

wants them to do). Outside proctors would cost between $1 and $4 per student, depending on the number

of grades and subjects that a state decides to test. The maximum predicted cost of $4 per student is a bit

under 0.05 percent (five-hundredths of 1 percent) of American per-pupil spending. We could go beyond

proctors and insist that tests be based on larger batteries of questions (so that even students’ experience

could not be used to determine the specific questions on next year’s test). Test-makers typically raise the

cost of a test by about 10 percent if they are asked to supply fresh questions each year. Freshness in and

of itself does not cost much because test-makers can easily write numerous versions of a specific type of
                                                                                                           14

question. Greater freshness is not the same as test development, in which a type of question is written

and validated “from scratch.” In short, given that the average amount spent on tests now is $4.96 per

student, fresh tests would cost about $5.46 per student if schools were generally to ask for them (still

about six-tenths of 1 percent of American school spending). However, with good proctors, fresh test

questions are not as necessary.



                      VII. Final Thoughts on the Cost of Accountability Systems

        Every statistic contained in this chapter is taken from sources that are publicly, readily available.

Thus, people who oppose accountability based on its costs have probably neglected to do their homework

and collect the facts. Assessment systems are very inexpensive by any metric, even when we consider

elaborate and still-in-development systems like California’s.

        What conclusions ought we to draw from the fact that accountability systems are so inexpensive?

First, given that the systems’ low costs, we ought not to hesitate to improve them (by adding proctors,

developing better tests, and so on) if the improvements would generate better incentives for schools. The

cost of such improvements can come from other programs that will be only negligibly affected because

the other programs are so much more expensive. Second, accountability is so cheap, compared to other

programs that are popular and under debate (such as class size reduction), that assessment should be

given some benefit of the doubt. Even if the benefits of accountability are small, its benefit-to-cost ratio

is likely to be extremely high relative to that of other programs. Thus, even when a state’s budget

prevents it from pursuing many of the programs that parents and policy-makers would like to see enacted,

the state should still try putting some assessment in place. Having assessment in place will also make it

easier to evaluate the effects of other reforms. Finally, it is well known that the federal government

accounts for only a small share (between 6 and 7 percent, depending on the year) of the revenues of

American elementary and secondary schools. It is often difficult for the federal government to find
                                                                                                           15

programs that are both potentially important and affordable within its small education budget. The

federal government could very plausibly pay for a basic level of assessment in every state, thereby

encouraging all states to craft accountability systems that suit them but still meet minimal guidelines (for

instance: testing at least reading and mathematics; testing at least one elementary, one middle, and one

high school grade; using a national test in some grade to facilitate comparisons among states).

        The costs of accountability are such that the main barrier to good programs is not expense, but

the support and interest of education experts, policy-makers, and the public. Given the popularity of

accountability with the public, educators and policy-makers are the key people who will enable or disable

a state that is attempting to implement a useful accountability system.
