                   SIMPLE ANALYTICS OF DERT-EQUITY SWAPS


                                 ABSTRACT




     Recent   attempts   to resolve   the international debt crisis have
lead sane caintries to engage in debt-equity swaps.        The   paper

explores conditions under which such transactions are beneficial to
the debtor as .ell as the creditors.        It identifies a market failure

that may    prevent the emergence of autual ly beneficial swaps and
analyzes the   effects of   swaps on the   investment level in the debtor

caintr-y.     latter helps to evaluate the contrib.jtion of this
             The

policy to future difficulties with debt service payments.

     The debt crisis of the 1980's has inspired search for innovative

solutions to the debt problem.      Amongst the many proposals that have emerged

so far, debt forgiveness      and debt conversion schemes play a central role.       One


of the proposed mechsnisms for debt forgiveness is to establish an

international   corporation    that will buy back the debt of developing countries

and forgive part of it (see Peter B. Kenen (1983)).        The proposal has been


debated, but so far no action has been taken toward its implementation.

     Contrary to the Corporation's      proposal, debt conversion schemes    hse been

implemented in a number of countries,       including major debtors such as

             Brazil, Chile, Mexico and the Philippines,     and they are actively
Argentina,

considered by s number of other countries,       including Honduras,   Morocco and

Nigeria.     A typical debt conversion scheme specifies conditions for the
                                                                        in
exchange of debt for domestic assets, the entities that may psrticipate              it,


and longer-term rights end obligations.        In some cases the schemes are

                                                                       in others they
designed for foreign creditors or multinational corporations,

are designed for domestic residents,        where the intention of the latter is to

retrieve flight capital.       In many cases debt for conversion purposes is

aquired on the secondary market.       So far only a small share of debt has been
                                               -2-




converted by means of these schemes- -about 2% of the debt of countries that

have engaged in them--but they may become much more important in the fucure.

When debt is exchanged for equity it is called a debt-equity swap (see Lewis

S.   Alexander (l987a) for more factual details).

       One central idea behind the Corporation and the debt conversion schemes

is to take advantage     of the high discounts on debt on the secondsry market.

It is quite common for debts to be traded at 50 cents to the dollar, with some

debts being traded at even higher discounts.           Hence, it is argued, debt

forgiveness may be not very costly and the debtor may gain from the conversion

of cheap debt into holdings of other domestic assets.           In both cases the debt

burden is eased.

       This paper is concerned with debt-equity swaps in which foreign residents

are   a   party to the exchange (i.e.   ,   it does not deal with flight   capital).    As

a byproduct,     I also provide two results on debt forgiveness.       T suggest an

approach for dealing with these problems and demonstrate its usefulness by

addressing a number of key questions to which it can provide an answer.                These

questions     include the following:        What type of resource reallocations between

debtor and creditor can be achieved by debt-equity swaps?           What ere the

conditions     under which there exist swaps that are beneficial to both parties?

What are the effects of debt equity swaps and debt forgiveness on investment

in the debtor country?      By dealing with these issues one can examine the

usefulness of the frsmework.      It should, however, be made clear from the start

that I suggest a simple framework that can be extended or modified for

particular applications.      Here the concern is with the clarification of some

fundamental     issues rather than with particular applications.       For example, I
                                         -3-




assume the existence   of cspital controls in the debtor country up to the point

at which there ere no private capital movements.         This is convenient for

                                                                   for some countries
analytical purposes and it represents     a good approximation

(with effective   quantative   restrictions)   .   One may want to modify it for

applications to other countries.

     A minimal framework for dealing with some basic issues is developed in

the following section.       It is based on the assumption that the debtor's real

income is a random variable,     and that its foreign debt is government owned.

As a result of output fluctuations and limits on its ability to tax, the

government's capacity to service debt is also random.          Consequently,   it cannot

make the required debt payments in all states of nature.          A debt-equity swap

consists of an exchange of debt for claims to the random output.

     A characterizationof feasible reallocations          of the transfer of resources

from debtor to creditor across states of nature by means of debt-equity swaps

is provided in Section II.       Given the current situation in which swaps are

small relative to the stock of debt, the emphasis is on small swaps.             I show

that small Pareto-improvingswaps do not always exist.           I derive a necessary

and sufficient condition for their existence         and clarify its economic content.

     The implications of the existence of many creditors         are explored in

Section III.   I show that due to the fact that debt of the type considered in

this paper (i.e. ,   which   is fully repaid in some states but only partially

repaid in others, with the subset of states of full repayment depending on the

debt's size) is priced nonlinearly on international         financial markets.     This
                                                 -4-




generates   an externality across creditors.              Consequently,           there may exiat

small Pareto-improving         swaps that will not eventuate.

     In Section IV the model is extended in order to deal with investment.                           It

is shown that in this framework debt forgiveness reduces share prices and

investment,   and that a debt-equity swap raises share prices and investment

only if the cost of the swsp in terms of equity is sufficiently high.                          The

negative effect of debt forgiveness on investment results from a positive

income effect in the second period (the analysis is conducted in a two-period

framework).   As income increases           the demand for equity declines as a result of

a decline in desired savings.             Consequently,    share prices fall and so does

investment (for s more thorough anmlysis of debt forgiveness see Elhsnan

Helpmsn (1988b)).         Concluding comments are provided in Section V.



                                     I.   Minimal Framework

     The Debtor's output is given by             E,    where           denotes a random

productivity shock and          E   represents    its constant activity level in

production.   In the market interpretation of the model                   E       also represents    the

number of equities issued by domestic firms.                Due to controls on international

capital movements        E    is owned by domestic residents.            States of nature are

identified with productivity shock levels.                Thus, state         9    is the state in

which the productivity shock obtains the value                   0.


     The government taxes output at the rate                t,    so that output owners receive

income   (l-t)OE        in state    9.    In particular, the owner of one unit of               E    is

entitled to   (l-t)0         units of output in state        0.       The government has an

external debt      D.    Required service payments on this debt, which consist of
                                              -5-




principal plus interest,       are    RD   units of output in every state, where       R

stands for one plus the interest rate.              Tsx revenue is used to service the

debt.    I assume that there exist realizstions           of the productivity shock at

which tax revenue is insufficient          to cover the required debt service payment.

This is supposed to represent the situation of some major debtors who will not

be able to repay their debt in all stetes of nature                 Formally,

                        tOE < RD      with positive probability.

This implies that there exists a critical value              0, defined by


                —   RD/(tE),


such thst debt is fu)ly repaid in the high-productivity               states    0G,   but

cannot be fully repaid in the low-productivity             states           It is assumed
                                                                     OCOc
that in the low-productivity states, in which tax revenue falls short of debt

service payments,     creditors      receive the entire tax revenue.        I also assume

that    t   represents the highest possible tax rate, and that the government has

no other sources of income (the case in which some domestic firms are

government owned will be discussed at a later stage).

        It is clear from this specification that apart from states in which tax

revenue is insufficient        to cover debt repayment      (0<9) there typically also

exist states in which tax revenue exceeds debt repayment               (G>Oc)
                                                                                 One needs

therefore to state explicitly what is done in these states with tax revenue in

excess of debt repayment.         For the purpose of this study I assume that it is

redistributed    to the public as lump-sum trsnsfers)            Under these assumptions

state-contingent     consumption of Debtor residents is
                                                        -6-

(2')         c(9) —
                               (1   -
                                        t)OE + (tOE     -
                                                            RD)           for     C     9,


where consumption in low productivity states consists of after-tax                             output and

cunsumption in high productivity states consists of after-tax output plus the

lump-sum   transfer        tOE-RD.        Creditors         receive the state-contingent      payments


                               tOE             for      OO c

                               RD              for      90 c

In this setup Debtor residents have no explicit decision problem; they consume

their after-tax output plus government transfers.                         Creditor residents recieve

full debt repayment        in high productivity states and the tax revenue in low

productivity states-

       Now consider a debt-equity swap.                     Suppose that a).O         units of debt are

swapped for       eD   units of equity, where equity is measured in units of                         E.


assume that the Creditor cannot take a short position in equity.                              For the swap

to take place the government has to acquire the equity or to provide the

Creditor with the resources needed for its acquisition.                           There are several

mechanisms by means of which this can be done;                       I   will discuss some of them in

Section IV.       At this juncture the reader may find it easiest to assume that

the government      taxes away or confiscates the needed equity.                        After the swap,

required debt repayments are                   R(D-t)       in every state and the Creditor receives

(l-t)0e    in state        9    on account of equity holdings.                  Naturally,   for
                                                              -7-




sufficiently small values of               d            there still exist States in which the

government cannot fully repay the remaining debt.                                     Assuming that foreign-owned

income from equity ownership is also taxed at the rate                                          t,     debt is fully

repaid in states that satisfy

                                                   t9E        R(D      -h),

so that the critical value             9
                                           c   ,   which now            depends on         d,        becomes



(1)          8(A) — R(D      -




i.e.   debt is fully repayed in states                            98(1)         and       the Creditor receives the

tax revenue in states        99(d).                     In this case the consumption of Debtor

residents   equals



                        (1       -
                                     t)9(E          -
                                                         E)                                            for     8   8(d),
(2)     c(9;d,E) —

                        (1       -
                                     t)9(E          -    E) + [teE        -
                                                                              R(D    -
                                                                                         d)]           for     9




and the Creditor receives payments



                        (1       -
                                     t)9E +             t9E                    for         8         8 (d),
                                                                                                      C
         *
(3)     d (8;d,E) —

                        (1       -   t)9E + R(D               -   A)           for         8         9(A).



Thus, the swap reduces the Debtor residents'                                  income from claims to output in

all states and it increases their income from government transfers in high

productivity states as a result of the easing of the debt service burden.
                                           -8-




Moreover,    it increases    the set of states in which debt is fully repaid.       These

three factors need to be properly weighed in order to evaluate the

desirability of the swap from the point of view of the Debtor.            The Creditor

too hms to weigh three factors.        The swap increases his income in all states

on account of equity holdings,       it reduces hia income in high productivity

states as a reault of lower debt aervice payments,           and it increases the set of

starea in which he receives full repayment on the remaining debt.

      In order to evaluate the desirability of awapa, I aaaume that a

repreaentative    resident of the Debtor has a strictly concave

von Neuniann-Morgenstern utility function        u(c); i.e., the Debtor is riak

averse.     His subjective probability distribution of states--i.e.       ,   productivity
shocks--ia    representedby the cumulative distribution function          G(9), defined

on the interval [D,+w).         Hence, his expected utility from a given swap,

(Ac),     is our welfare criterion,     given by




(4)           U(A,e)   —   r u[c(9;A,efldG(9).
Equations    (1), (2) and (4) provide a valuation of every awap from the point of

view of the Debtor.

      As far as the Creditor is concerned, I aasume that he has access to

international    financial markets which enable him to hold a well diversified

portfolio.     Consequently,    his marginal utility of state-contingentpayments by
                                                         *
the Debtor are not affected by       the swap.     Let   p (9)   denote his marginal


utility of state-9 payments.        Then his expected utility of a swap is

                                   II.      Are Swaos Desirable?

        There are several methods of analysis                      that can be used to answer the

                                                                                          start with a
question posed in the title of this section.                          I have chosen.to

description of the effects of swaps on state contingent peyments of Debtor to

Creditor in order to gain insight into their possible role as risk sharing

devices.     This is followed by a derivation of asset indifference curves that

will be used in subsequent analysis.                     In particular, they will be used to

derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of saall

mutually beneficial swaps.             As I have explained in the introduction,                    this


paper focuses on small swaps.2                   These tools are then used to shed light on the

question:     How likely is the existence                 of mutually beneficial swaps?

        First, consider the effect of swaps on the state contingent                          transfers

from debtor to creditor.              Schedule       DAB          in Figure 1 describes this profile

prior to a swap.        The Debtor consumes the difference between DC                           and    DAB,

where the slope of          OC   is     E       (the stock of equity).          Now, given       a>O    and

e—0, the transfer of resources from Debtor to Creditor shifts to                                          with
                                                                                                DAABA
the Debtor consuming         the difference between OC                   and             This describes
                                                                               OAAB.
the effect of debt forgiveness.                   In the case of a debt-equity swap it is

                                                                                                          For

The resulting change in the Debtor's consumption profile is described in

Figure    2.       The Debtor gains in states which lie in the interval                        and
                                                                                     °1'2
loses in all other states (except, of course, in
                                                                   l     and         The Creditor

gains in states in which the Debtor loses and vice versa.

       Now consider the case in which the productivity shock in the Debtor

country is idiosyncratic;         i.e.   ,   it   is statistically   independent of economic

conditions         in the rest of the world.         Then one experts the Creditor's marginal
               *
utility    p (9)        to be the same in all states.           In this case the Creditor will

not agree to swaps which raise the Debtor's expected consumption level.

Hence, if          (i) both parties agree on the probability           distribution of the

productivity shock; and          (ii) the entire mass is concentrated           on two points,

say    9L and        9M   in Figure 2;       then there do not exist mutually beneficial

swaps.    This result stems from the fact that in this case a swap reduces the

Debtor's consumption in a low consumption state                          in which the marginal

utility of consumption is high, and raises it in a high consumption state

in which the marginal utility of consumption is low (see the figure).                       Suppose

that     (i,e)       is chosen so as to make the expected value of this consumption

change equal to zero, so ss to make the Creditor indifferent to the swap.

Then the Debtor will lose from it, as we know from the standard theory of

choice under risk (see the discussion following Proposition 1)                   .   This
demonstrates         that there exist conditions          under which there do not exist

mutually beneficial small swaps.3

       The general case is more easily treated in asset apace                  (dc).    For this

reason I present in Figure 3 the asset indifference curves
                                                       *             *

for the ease of smooth distribution           functions.    Every swap that leada to

points above the Debtor's indifference           curve and below the Creditor's

indifference curve is beneficial to both parties.              Hence, the figure

represents a situation           in which there exjst mutually beneficial awaps.      The

Creditor's indifference           curve is concave and the Debtor's indifference curve

can be concave or convex, ralative to the horizontal axis (see Helpman                (1988a,


Appendix)       for a formal proof).      It is instructive to understand the reasons

for the particular curvature           of these curves.    It is clear from Figure 1 that

every increase in A              increases the set of states in which the remaining debt

is fully repaid as well as repayment per unit debt in the other states.                These


changes make the remaining debt a more valuable asset.               For this reason the

larger     A,     the larger the Creditor's     loss from giving up an additional unit

of debt.        Consequently,      he requires a larger marginal compensation in terms of
                                                                             This explains
equity in order to maintain a constant expected utility level.

the concave shape of the Creditor's            indifference curve.    Similarly   for the


Debtor; the larger          A,     the more he stands to gain from a marginal debt

reduction.        Therefore, at the margin he has to give up more equity per unit

debt in order to maintain a constant expected utility level.               If he was risk

neutral, his asset indifference curve would have been concave,               just as the

Creditor's.        However,      risk aversion introduces convexity into the indifference

curve.      For these reasons his indifference curve can be concave or convex,

depending on the degree of risk aversion.

     From equations         (l)-(5) one can calculate      the slopes of these asset

indifference       curves

mutually beneficial small swaps if and only if the Crditor'a indifference

curve is steeper at the origin than the Debtor's indifference curve.                                       Hence,

        In order to gain a better understanding                   of the circumstances               in which

there exist Pareto-improving           small swaps, consider again the caae in which the

distribution is concentrated on three states;                         a low productivity atate

Hence, when             i.e. ,       there   are in effect only two states, (8) implies

MM , so that      there do not exist mutually beneficial small swaps, as I have

argued before.     This suggests that existence, of Pareto-improving swaps is
                                                          state in which the
possible only when there exists a third high productivity

debtor gains from the swap.                In particular, it is easy to see that for every

                                                 and values of the low and medium productivity
triple of positive probabilities

levels there exists a sufficientlyhigh value of                                  which ensures     M*>M,

                                                                                                is declining

             It is also clear that                      is more likely to be satisfied           the closer

     is to        i.e., when there is low risk aversion

                                    at medium to high consumption levels.
i.e., when there is risk neutrality
                                                 -14-



     To summerize,         there do not exist mutually beneficial swaps whenever there

exist only two states or the Debtor is risk neutral at medium to high

consumption    levels.       In the other cases mutually beneficial swaps exist only

when there are sufficientlyhigh productive states.



                                      III.   Many Creditors

     My analysis of conditions            that ensure the existence     of mutually

beneficial swaps is readily applicable to cases in which there exiata a single

creditor.     It   is,    however, often the case that there exists a large number of

creditors.     If they operate in concert, we can use the single creditor

results.     However,      in this case it is also necessary to specify a mechanism

that determines      the way in which they split the benefits of awapa.                 Which swap
ia agreed upon depends then on the bargaining
                                              game played by the Debtor and
the consortium of Creditors.            Every bargaining procedure yields its own
result.

     In this section I take up the case in which there exists a competitive

fringe of Creditors.          In this case it is still true that         U*(t,e)        represents

the valuation of a swap on international                financial markets;                       is
                                                                             i.e.,     U*(,E)
the value of the remaiming debt plus the value of the                                       In
                                                      mquired equity.

fact, the linearity of (5) together with (3) imply that this value can be
                          *
                         U (,e)—U
                                 *           *
decomposed into                      (A,O)-4-U (O,e),    where the first component

represents the value of remaining debt and the second represents                      the value of
                                                                                 *        *
equity.     The second component is linear in equity holdings;               U       (DE)U(OO)E.
Hence, the price of equity, which by a suitable choice of units equals

                           is constant.      On the other hand, the price of a remaining
                                            -15-




unit of debt, which equals U*(,O)/(D.),             is an increasing function of          A.


The latter point follows from my explanation         of the curveture    of the

indifference    curves in Figure 3.        To repeat, when A    increases   the remaining

debt is fully repaid in more states and the repayment per-unit debt in other

states increases as well.      Therefore     the unit value of remaining debt

increases   (see Helpman (1988a, Section 5) for a diagramatical          exposition of

this result).4

      What is the price of debt (in terms of equity) that the Debtor pays for a

swap of size     A?    In the presence of a competitive       fringe of creditors   it is

equal to the post-swap value of a unit of remaining debt.             For suppose it is

                                                              at a lower
higher, then every remaining creditor agrees to swap his debt

price.   And if it is lower, every creditor refuses to swap, because the resale

value of his asset is higher than the offered swap price.             Therefore,    the

equilibrium swap exchange rate (i.e. ,         relative   price) is



                            *
                           U (0,0)
(9)            x(A)—    *
                       U (A,0)/(D -   A)


where the denominator      on the right hand side represents the equilibrium price

of debt and the numerator represents the equilibriumprice of equity.                 Since

the numerator declines in       A,    (9) shows that




Prot,osition 2.       The larger the debt to be swapped, the lower the price the

        The nonlinearity in the pricing of debt on international            financial

markets    introduces    an externality across creditors.       It stems from the fact

that when a single creditor reaches a swap agreement the remaining creditors

make a capital gain on their debt.        The same argument applies to debt

forgiveness.      An attempt to buy debt on the secondary market in order to

forgive it--as in, say, Kenen's proposal-- rsises its price.                For this reason

secondary market discounts prior to the availability of information on

buy-backs    or purchases of debt in order to forgive it overestimate the

discounts that will prevail when the purchases           actually take place (see

Michael P. Dooley (1988) and Helpman (l988a, Section 6) on this point).                 In

addition,    the free rider problem that was discussed by Paul R. Krugman (1985)

can also be cast in terms of this externality.

        The Debtor's optimal decision     is   presented in Figure   3.     The curve

e-A/x(A)     represents    equilibrium market opportunities.       It is shown in Helpman

(1988a, Appendix)       that its slope is flatter than the slope of the indifference

curve     U*(.), and it is located to the right of the indifference curve.              This

reflects the above discussed externality.           Taking advantage of market

opportunities,        the Debtor's optimal policy is to swap           units of debt for

            This will raise his expected utility to U0.           Observe, however,     that
equity.

now the existence of small beneficial swaps to the Debtor requires                M<x(O),

where     x(O)   is the slope of the     E—A/x(d)     curve at the origin.      Clearly,

since     x(O).cM*,     it might happen that    x(O).CM.cM*.   In this case small

Pareto-improving        swaps exist, but will not eventuate.       Hence,
                                              -17-




Proposition 3.       In the presence of a competitive fringe of creditors there

exist circumstances in which no small swap will take place despite the

availability of Pareto-improving small swaps.



This result points out a market failure that may result from this externality.




                                      IV.     Investment

        This section deals with the effects of debt-equity swaps on investment in

the Debtor country.      In the process of this analysis I clarify some taxation

issues and the role of government           ownership of domestic companies.           In order

to deal with these problems it is necessary to somewhat extend the model.

Assume therefore     that there are two periods.              The discussion in the previous

sections applies to the second period, except for the debt-equity swap that

takes place in the first period.            Residents     of the Debtor country choose in

the first period consumption                and the amount of domestic equity holdings
                             cD
e.   As a result of restrictions       on international capital movements they cannot

hold foreign assets or borrow abroad, so that equity provides the only

instrument by means of which they transfer purchasing power from the first to

the second period.5 In this case (2) implies that second period consumption

can be written as

                         c(O;d,I,e)    — (1    -
                                                   t)Ge   +   T(9,d,I),
where     I   equals the investment level,           e—E-E     represents Debtor residents'

holdings of domestic equity, and            T(9,Ex,I)     represents      government transfers.

Transfers     are given by

                                                                                                   c
(10)           T(9,A,I) —
                                      t9E(I)    -
                                                    R(D        -   A)           for         9     9(A,I),

where the number of real equities                        F         is an increasing concave function of the

investment level; i.e.,               E—E).              For this reason the critical state

also depends on the investment level.                              The individual               investor in equity

chooses    e     taking A         and I         as given.

       Now the representative individual's preferences over first-period

consumption and equity holdings can be written as



(11)                              —            + 6                       -
                                                                             t)9e     +   T(9,A,I)]dG(9),
               V(c0,e;A,I)            v(c0)                   u[(l
                                                     Jo


where the right hand side is equal                        to the utility                  from first-period

consumption plus the discounted expected utility from second-period

consumption, with           &    being the subjective discount factor.                                 The individual's

budget constraint is



(12)
                c0

                                                              qC(A,I),


where q        denotes the price of equity,                          y       denotes first-period         output,

qE(I)-I    represents           the net value of domestic firms on the stock market (as in

Peter A. Diamond (1967)), and                   C(A,I)             represents             the cost of the swap in

terms of equity, with             qC(A,I)           being the tax imposed by the government in the

first period in order to squire the resources needed for the swap.                                            In the

case of debt forgiveness                  C(A,I)rnO.          Thus, the left hand side represents
                                                 -19-




spending on consumption snd equity, while the right hand side represents

resources   available      to the private sector.           The cost of the swap is     showed to

depend on     I.    For example, in the presence of a competitive fringe of

creditors   the swap exchange rste              x()     is a function of    I,   because it

depends on     E.    I assume that      C()       increases in      A.

     It is clesr from this description that for a given investment level a

swap involves a substitution of second-period for first-period taxes.                      The

government increases taxes in the first period (in which the swap is

performed) and reduces net taxes in the second period (in some states).

First-period taxes are needed in order to obtain the resources required for

the swap.     These csn be imposed directly, or indirectly by means of printing

money (inflation tax) or issuing domestic debt.                    The current model cannot dear

with the monetary aspects of the problem.                 But it should be clear that

resources   for the swap have to be extracted one way or another.                   There is an

alternative    to taxation if the government              owns domestic companies.      Suppose,

for example, that there are no taxes in the second period, but instead the

government owns a proportion t              of the domestic companies.           In this case an

equity provides       9   units of output in state            9.    Now suppose that the

government swaps its own equity for debt.                 Then, as long as the investment

level is constant,        the foregoing analysis goes through with every share in the

previous case replsced by         (1   -   t)    shares in the current case, provided

tE(I)(l-t)e.        The last condition states that the governmenthas enough shares

to perform the swap.         Combinations        of partial ownership and partial taxation

are also possible.        The essential point is that if the government owns equity,

it is required to redistribute             the excess of its income from equity over debt
                                                          -20-




repayment    to the private sector.                   The public is indirectly the owner of

government companies and its debt.

        The individual chooses                        and e      so as to maximize   (11)   subject to
                                               c0
(12).     Denoting by                                                                his marginal rate

of substitutionbetween equity and first period consumption, the first order

conditions of this problem yield



(13')         q—s(c0,e;d,I).



However,    due to the restrictions                   on capital movements,    the clearing of     the
first-period    commodity market requires                        c0+Iy and the clearing of       the    equity

market requires            e—E-C(d,I).           Therefore,       (13') and the market clearing

conditions    imply that the demand price of equity is



(13)          q(ii,I)      —   s[y       -   I,E(I)   -




Differentiation        of (13) yields



(14)               —   -             +
              q,            SeCd



It   shows that the demand price for shares is affected by two considerations.

First, the larger the swapped debt the more equity has to be relinquished,

which leaves domestic stockholders with less equity holdings.                               Since the

demand price       s()         declines in equity holdings,              this element brings about an

increase in share prices.                     Second, the swap has a direct effect on the demand
                                                 -21-




price for equity, which is represented by the second term on the right hand

side of (14).       This effect stems from government transfers.                  The larger      ,
the    larger the transfers       that the individual           receives in the second period,

and therefore the less he values equity which is used to transfer purchasing

power from the first to the second period (i.e., S5                     is   negative).    This

reduces the demand price for equity.                  Consequently,    the change in the demand

price depends on which one of these considerations                    extracts a stronger

influence.     If the former is stronger, the demand price rises.                    If the latter

is stronger, the demand price declines.                    The former is zero in the case of

debt forgiveness.           Therefore,    in the case of debt forgiveness the demand price

declines.

       Given an equity price q,             the net value of firms equals

                                              qE(I)
                                                       -   I.
I assume that firms choose the investment level so as to maximize their net

value (see Diamond (1967)).              Their equilibrium condition is



(15)          qE'(I) — 1.




This condition describes demand for investment as a function of share prices,

or alternatively,         the supply price of equity as a function of the investment

level.

        For every     A     conditions    (15) and (16) determine equilibrium             share prices

and investment.        The equilibrium determination of these variables is described

in Figure 4.        Curve     S   describes    the supply price of equity while curve D

describes    the demand price in the absence of swaps.                  The intersection point        A
                                            -22-




describes    equilibrium investment      and share prices.    Now suppose that a swap

takes place.        It does not affect the supply curve.      However,   the demand curve

at point A      increases    if and only if the condition for a demand price

increase applies.       Namely, if and only if the cost of a swap is sufficiently

high.     If it increases, investment and share prices go up; if it declines,

investment    and share prices decline.      Therefore,




qposition      4.     A debt-equity swap raises investment and share prices if and

only if the equity cost of the swap is sufficientlyhigh.



Since debt forgiveness does not involve giving up equity, this result alao

implies:



Proposition 5.        Debt forgiveness reduces investment and share prices.



The last propositionhas important implications.              It shows that debt

forgiveness    can bring about a reduction in the capacity to repay debt.          The

decline in investment reduces the set of states in which debt is fully repaid

and payments per unit debt in states in which it is only partially repaid.

For a fuller discussion of debt fotgiveneaa see Helpman (1988b).




                                    V.    Conclusions

        Debt-equity swaps and debt forgiveness are practical issues that require

careful analysis.       The results of this paper demonstrate that there do not

exist simple and clear-cut answers to a number of major questions, but they
                        -                     -23-



also show how to identify relevant considerations.             Some of the conclur ns

are:




1.     Small debt-equity     swaps can be beneficial     to both parties, but this is not

       always the case.

2.     In the presence of a compecicive fringe of credicors there is a uniqe
                                                 be performed,           with the pcice
       price at which a swap of a given size can

       being higher the larger the swap.

3.     Under these circumstances         small swaps may fail to take place despite the

       existence of Pareto-improving deals.

4.     Debt forgiveness may reduce investment in the debtor country, thereby

       imposing a secondary cost via a reduction of debt service payments.
5.     A   debt-equity swap may increase or reduce investment.



In all cases with ambiguous answers, we have identified the conflicting

elements that have to be assessed empirically.

                   it is necesssry to point out thac in practical evaluations         of
        Finally,

                                                     considerations   that have to be borne
debt-equity      swaps there exist additional

in mind.       For example, capital controls are typically not as tight as assumed

in the model, and it is therefore important to consider the effect of a awap

on net capital inflow.          This is the more so the larger the deviation of the

shadow price of capital from the market price.              And there exists the problem

of "round-tripping", which results from loopholes that enable investors to

obtain subsidies embedded in existing swap arrangements without fulfilling all

other obligations.          Naturally,    these problems exist on top of the problems

discussed in the paper and they deserve separate treatment.

    scholar in the Research Department          of the International Monetary Fund,

    and continued et MIT and Tel-Aviv University.           Many colleagues and

    seminar participants at the IMF, MIT, Harvard, Boston University,

    Princeton,    Columbia, Duke, and Chicago, contributed       to the clarification

    of various points.        I thank them all, and especially    Eduardo Borensztein,

    Other alternatives, such as the provision of public goods, are also

    possible.     The important point is to specify a mechanism for the

    valuation of these resources.        It should, however, be clear that the

    choice of a specification affects some of the results.           An example of an

    alternative    tax structure and its Implications are presented in Helpman

    (1988a, Section 9).

    One may also consider situations

    If, for example, the Debtor is risk averse, the Creditor's          marginal

utility is the same in every state,and both have the same subjective

probability distribution, then Pareto-Optima consist of allocations in

which the Debtor obtains the same consumption level in every state.

These allocations provide perfect insurance,       and they can be attained by

means of a swap in which the entire debt C         plus some bonds issued by

the Creditor are exchanged for the entire stock of equities           E.   Since my

interest is mainly in small swaps, this possibility is not considered

further.




However,      in this case there exists a mutually beneficial small negative

swap.    My assumption that excludes short positions in equity holdings

makes negative swaps non-feasible.



This is similar to the well known result that the value of a unit of a

firm's debt declines with its financial leverage.        See, for example,

Robert   C.   Merton (1974).   See also Jeremy I. Bulow and Kenneth Rogoff

(forthcoming)     and Alexander (1987b).



It is easy to add a domestic bond market to the model.        However,     in   the!

absence of capital movements       this market has to clear at zero

indebtedness.       Consequently   the following analysis would not be affected

by this modification.       In fact, one can calculate from what follows the

equilibrium      interest rate on this bond market.
