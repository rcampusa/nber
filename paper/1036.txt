       This paper contains three parts: a discussion of the tax
advantages of household capital (owner—occupied housing and
consumer durables) relative to business capital (structures and
producers durables) , an analysis of alternative mechanisms for
reducing these advantages (including the use of the mechanisms
since 1965) , and a brief enumeration of various attempts to lower
the residential mortgage rate relative to other debt yields that
have been employed during the past two decades or are currently

      Public finance economists have been concerned for some time with the

costs of misallocation of the American capital stock. Misallocation occurs ex

post when some capital earns a lower pretax net (of depreciation charges)

return than other capital. Many of the differences in ex post pretax returns

can be attributed to vagaries of the market place or economic uncertainty.

Expectations regarding the demands for products and the costs of imputs are

seldom fully correct, and often even the best of plans do not work out.

Because much capital is not malleable, or is so only at large cost, mistakes

are not easily corrected.

      On the other hand, many of the differences in average ex post pretax

returns across broad classes of capital can be attributed to systematic biases

in government tax policies that create differential wedges between ex ante

pretax and posttax returns on these classes. Because the market place tends

to equate posttax returns across investments, the wedges cause differences in

pretax returns and overinvestment in lightly taxed capital and underinvestment

in heavily taxed capital. As a result, productivity losses occur and national

income is lower than it would have been in the absence of the biases.     Some

sources of differential wedges that have been studied include: the double

taxation of corporate dividends, the relatively light taxation of short-lived

business capital (owing to its highly accelerated depreciation schedule
                                     —2—




and eligibility for the investment tax credit), and the more favorable tax
                                                          1
treatment of specific industries (such as oil and gas).

      In this paper, I feature another differential wedge, namely, the favor-

able taxation of income earned on household capital relative to that earned on

business capital. This general topic has been the subject of much of my

recent research, upon which I will draw extensively. My presentation is

divided into three broad parts: a discussion of the tax advantages of

household capital (owner-occupied housing and consumer durables) relative to

business—capital, an analysis of alternative mechanisms for reducing these

advantages (including the use of these mechanisms since 1965), and a brief

enumeration of various attempts to lower the residential mortgage rate

relative to other debt yields that have been employed during the past two

decades or are currently being advocated.



      I. The Tax Advantages of Owner—Occupied Housing and Durables


      Owner-occupied housing and durables receive two types of favorable tax

treatment relative to industrial capital. First and foremost, the cash flow

income from household capital (the implicit rents earned or net rental outlays

avoided) is not taxed, while that generated by industrial plant and equipment

is. Second, nominal capital gains realized upon sale are not taxed if the

proceeds are reinvested in another house within a reasonable period, and a

one-time gain of up to $125,000 is exempt without reinvestment for households

above age 55. With industrial structures, a realized gain from a sale is

taxed at the firm level and unrealized gains that are reflected in higher
                                            —3—




share prices are taxed when the shares are traded. Nominal capital gains on

consumer durables are not taxed at all, but these are unlikely to occur except

in a high inflation period owing to the generally high depreciation rate on

durables.

        Note that I have not identified the deduction of household interest

expense from the taxable income base as the fundamental source of the tax

subsidy to owner-occupied housing and durables. To understand this, consider

a household with marketable wealth equal to or in excess of the value of its

house and whose best alternative investment is home mortgages. The ability to

borrow mortgage money to invest in mortgages where the interest on the one is

deductible and on the other is taxable is obviously of no value.2 The tax

advantage to this household is the absence of taxation of the return on the

own equity invested in the house.3 Whether the house is equity or debt

financed, the magnitude of the advantage is directly related to the house-

hold's marginal tax bracket and to the level of nominal pretax returns in the

economy; the higher the bracket and the level of returns, the more valuable

the exemption. Because the tax advantage varies by marginal tax bracket of

household, overinvestment in owner-occupied housing and durables is greater

the   higher is the tax   bracket of the household.

        Now this is not   to say that the deductibility of household interest

payments is of no value to most households or that removal of this deduction

from the tax statutes would have no impact on the demand for owner-occupied

housing and durables. Such is hardly the case. The deductibility of interest

is a means of extending the    full   tax advantage of owner-occupied housing and

durables to the numerous less wealthy households who cannot entirely equity

finance their real assets. The deductibility is thus analogous to safe-harbor

leasing which extends the full advantages of tax credits and accelerated write
                                      —4—




offs available to profitable, slow or moderately growing firms to non-

profitable and/or rapidly growing firms.4 The underlying tax credits and

accelerated write off s, not the leasing, are the fundamental source of the tax

advantage.

      Again let me emphasize that the deductibility of household interest

expense is merely an extension of the basic tax advantage of household capital

to less wealthy households, not an additional advantage. It has been some-

times said that householdcapital isnegatively taxed owing to the ability to

deduct this interest from wage income. This view is incorrect. While there

is a negative          tax, there is an offsetting positive implicit tax in

that households will purchase owner—occupied housing and consumer durables

that yield them a lower pretax return than could be earned on other assets.5

At the margin, the implicit positive tax exactly outweighs the explicit

negative tax so that household capital is properly viewed as being zero taxed.

      The result of favorable tax treatment for owner-occupied capital is in-

creased demand. The increased demand for housing takes three forms. First,

owning households with given real incomes demand more housing than they would

otherwise, the increase being greater for those in higher marginal tax brack-

ets. Second, the number of households is greater than otherwise, and because

there are economies of scale in the provision housing services, more house-

holds with a lower average income demand more housing in total than do fewer

households with a higher average income. Third, the homeownership rate is

higher than if there were no tax advantages. Note that the first two of these

raises the share of capital in residential use.

      The tax advantage of owner—occupied housing increased with the acceler-

ation of inflation between the middle l960s and late 1970s because nominal

pretax interest rates increased and tax bracket creep occurred.6 The price of
                                    —5—




housing services fell because posttax real interest rates fell, the decline

being greater the higher was one's marginal tax bracket. As a result, the

demand for housing increased for households with a given real income, house-

hold formations accelerated (headship rates rose), the home ownership rate

increased, and some of the increased demand for housing units was met by

conversions of structures from industrial to residential use.



II. Methods of Reducing the Tax Bias in Favor of Owner-Occupied Capital


      There are at least •three means through which the tendency to overinvest

in owner—occupied housing and durables can be dampened or removed altogether.

I will discuss each in turn. Because the major concern from an allocation

point of view has been owner—occupied housing, the discussion is in terms of

this asset.

 The Standard Fixed Rate Mortgage and Credit Market Constraints

       As just noted, the bias toward housing tended to intensify with the

increase in inflation in the 1970s. I say tended because constraints caused

by imperfections in the housing finance instrument could have offset the

tendency. Given the rising inflationary premium in interest rates (and the

observed increase in the real asset price of housing) mortgage payments on the

standard fixed-rate mortgage tended to increase far more rapidly for poten-

tial home buyers than did nominal incomes. While households could expect the

real value of mortgage payments to be eroded rapidly by inflation, the initial

payments were tilted upward, making them "unaffordable,' even though the cost

of obtaining housing services actually fell.7 At the same time, existing

homeowners with standard fixed-rate mortgages found themselves paying a

below—market interest rate. To the extent that they would lose this rate if
                                    —6—




they "traded up" in response to the decline in the price of housing services,

they would be reluctant to do so.8 One might argue, then, that the effect of

the increased tax bias in favor of housing was largely offset by the usage of

the standard fixed rate mortgage.9 Thus there wasn't further overinvestment

in housing, and the economy did not suffer additional productivity losses.

      There are two problems with this argument. First, usage of the standard

mortgage instrument may not have greatly dampened housing demand in the

1970s)0 Most sellers were able to capture much of the value of their below—

market mortgage financing via loan assumptions and various owner-financing

arrangements. Also, many young households adjusted to the affordability

problem by altering the pattern of their real labor income to better match the

pattern of real mortgage payments. By postponing child raising, households

were able to tilt their real income forward in time to match the pattern of

real mortgage payments. The second problem with the offsetting-tendencies

argument was that the tax-bias effect is applicable to a broad range of

households, while the mortgage-instrument effect was generally applicable to

only a small subset of households: largely young, first—time homebuyers who

had not accumulated sufficient wealth generally or earned sufficient housing

capital gains specifically to allow them to achieve a moderate initial mort-

gage payment to income ratio via a large downpayment. If the mortgage-instru-

ment effect were sufficient in magnitude to lead to an optimal aggregate

distribution of structures between residential and industrial, then the

maldistribution of the housing stock among households would have been enor-

mous. Older, established households would have consumed too much housing, and

younger, starting-out households, far too little. One misallocation problem

would have been replaced by another, possibly worse one.
                                      —7—


     An alternative would be to attack directly the residential—industrial

capital misallocation problem. At the same time, the misallocation of the

housing stock among households could be minimized by the development and

usage of more efficient mortgage market instruments.     A number of relatively

new instruments would reduce the initial mortgage payment in an inflationary
               11
environment.        With price—level adjusted mortgages or PLANs, the initial

mortgage payment is based on a real, rather than nominal, interest rate,

and payments rise through time with the price level. With shared—appreci-

ation mortgages or SAMs, the initial payment is based on a below—market

nominal rate, in return for which the lender receives a share of the actual

appreciation in the underlying house. With graduated—payment mortgages,

payments rise from a reduced initial level at a prescribec rate for a specified

period. Finally, the negative impact of the mortgage capital gains on house-

hold mobility could bereduceci by use of adjustable—rate mortgages.


Removal of the Tax Bias for Owner—Occupied Housing

      The most obvious and direct method of eliminating the tax bias is to

remove its source, i.e., to tax the imputed rental income from owner—occupied

housing and maybe some of the capital gains. Economists have long advocated

this, but politicians generally do not want even to discuss it.    In fact, the

one—time exemption of a $100,000 gain (now $125,000) after age 55 is of recent

vintage. It was enacted well after most people understood the already favor-

able tax treatment of owner—occupied housing.     Nonetheless, some proposals

have been made to limit the deductibility of mortgage (and consumer credit)

interest. One would replace the interest tax deduction with a flat tax credit

of, say, 15 to 25 percent. This would reduce the maldistribution of housing

among households——the tax advantage would be the same for all, rather than
                                       —8—




rising with one's tax bracket--and, if the credit were low enough, it would

reduce the maldistribution of capital between residential and industrial.

Jimmy Carter's infamous effort to place a ceiling on the amount of interest

that could be deducted had a similar intent. This effort was especially en-

lightening regarding the politics of the matter because Congress rejected the

proposal even though the ceiling was set so high that few households were

expected to be affected.12

      The flat-tax proposals currently being debated in Congress would also

affect household interest deductions. Under the pure Hall-Rabushka plan, the

deduction would be eliminated. The Bradley-Gephardt multiple-layer plan would

be quite similar in effect to the above-mentioned tax credit proposal. Inter-

est would continue to be fully deductible, but at the taxpayers' initial tax

rate (14 percent under the plan), rather than at their higher marginal tax

rate. I should reemphasize, however, that removal of the mortgage interest

deduction is not equivalent to removal of the tax bias. The bias for wealthy

households who can fully equity-finance their houses would remain intact. The

bias would be reduced for other households in proportion to the amount of

external or debt financing required.

      Given the obvious political problems of removing the tax advantages for

owner—occupied housing, attention shifted in the late l970s to indirect

methods of discouraging overinvestment in housing.

Reduced Taxation of Industrial Capital

      In a paper Sheng Hu and I wrote four years ago, we argued that the bias

in favor of owner—occupied housing could be removed by taxing income from

industrial capital the same as income from housing, rather than doing the

reverse.13 That is, rather than taxing income from housing more heavily,

income from industrial capital could be taxed less heavily.   We then de—
                                      —9—




scribed a set of business tax cuts that would remove biases against long—lived

business capital (extend an enlargened investment tax credit to structures)

against unincorporated businesses (cease double taxation of corporate

dividends) ,   and against business capital generally. The latter was to be

achieved by switching to replacement cost depreciation and shortening tax

service lives. The mechanism by which the demand for owner-occupied housing

was to be reduced was an increase in real pretax interest rates driven by an

increased demand for funds by businesses to finance their capital expansion.
     Three years later, Congress enacted the Economic Recovery Tax Act

(tRTA). While this legislation enlarged some tax biases, most obviously that

against long—lived business capitai,' the general bias against business

capital was reduced by the sharp shortening of tax service lives tincluuing

that of rental housing). Of course, many woula contend that the high level

of real interest rates in the second ralf of 1981 ana the first halt of

l98z has been due to a very restrictive monetary policy designed to wring

out intlation, not to a surge in the tinancing of business investment.

ihe point, though, is that even with a monetary policy conducive to real

growth in the economy, real interest rates will remain higher than in the
pre ERTA years.
      ERTA has reduced the tax bias in favor of owner—occupied housing direct-

ly as well as indirectly via higher real interest rates. Recall that the

fundamental source of the bias is the failure to tax the return on equity

invested in one's own home. The magnitude of the bias then depends, at least

in part, on how heavily investments in assets other than one's own home are

taxed. The cut in the maximum tax rate on unearned income, the expansion of

allowable tax—exempt contributions to IRA accounts, the creation of the tax-

exempt All Savers certificate and eventual partial exclusion of interest

income from taxation, and the new exclusion for dividends reinvested in
                                      —10—




utilities all tend to lessen the relative tax advantages of homeownership.

      In order to deduce the likely impact of ERTA on the allocation of the

real capital stock, James Shilling and I constructed a simulation model of the

American economy.15 The model is highly simplified in that there are only

three types of private tangible capital -- owner-occupied and rental housing

and industrial capital -- and the aggregate capital stock is taken as given.

The special feature of the model is the division of households into four

income classes, each of which makes tenure choice and portfolio decisions.

All classes hold taxable debt and equities, while only the highest two classes

hold rental housing and tax-exempt securities. The fractions of the classes

that are homeowners initially rise from 0.49 (lowest income) to 0.90 (highest

income). The model was parameterized to conform with the American economy in

1977, the last year of income tax data available when the study began.

      Three aspects of the 1981 legislation were analyzed: the shortened tax

service lives of industrial capital and rental housing and the reduction in

the maximum tax rate on unearned income to 50 percent (this has a negliglble

impact on capital allocation) .   The major result of these provisions in our

analysis is a sharp increase in the demand for industrial capital that raises

interest rates (real) by 1.85 percentage points. The latter clearly reduces

the demand for owner—occupied housing. In our analysis, the demand for

housing by individual renters also declines, the impact of the increase in

interest rates overwhelming that of the more favorable tax treatment of rental

housing investment. However, the real price of housing services from rental

units rises by less than that from owner—occupied units so the number of

renting households increases (the aggregate honieownership rate falls by 1.3

percentage points). The net result is a roughly unchanged rental housing

stock. Most important, the share of total capital in industrial use rises by
                                       -11-




3½   percentage points and that in owner—occupied housing falls by a like
amount. While these results are only suggestive, the suggestion is that the

tendency to over-invest in owner—occupied housing (and, by analogy, consumer

durables) would be greatly dampened.



                           III. Other Subsidies for Housing


        To this point, I have discussed only one bias in favor of owner-occupied

housing, that attributable to the favorable (zero) taxation of income from

this asset. In this section, I note briefly a number of additional govern-

mental policies that alter the allocation of capital toward residential use by

lowering the cost of residential mortgage debt relative to other forms of

debt. These policies, which either have been employed in the past or are

advocated in the present, include: direct interest rate subsidies, the use of

tax—exempt mortgage revenue bonds, and tax advantages for lenders (the tax

preferences of thrifts and the mortgage interest tax credit proposed by the

President's Commission on Housing)

Interest Rate Subsidies

        Below—market interest rate subsidies were initiated in 1961 under the

Section 221 (d) (3) program, but they did not become an important factor until

the Section 235 and 236 programs established in 1968. Under these programs,

households were able to borrow at rates as low as one percent. In early 1973,

high levels of defaults and abandonments, as well as scandals entailing

bribery of FHA inspectors, led to the suspension of these programs.

        Below-market rate financing reappeared in 1974 with the Tandem plan in

which borrowing rates were lowered to 7½      percent.   The original Tandem was

designed to stimulate housing production during the 1974-75 housing recession,
                                       —12—




but the plan has continued in effect for multifamily housing. While a 7½

percent borrowing rate was a minor subsidy in 1976-78; in 1980-82, the subsidy

has been enormous. The Reagan administration is fully committed to getting

out of the business of providing 7½ percent multifamily mortgages as soon as

the in place pipeline of projects the Administration inherited is completed,

which will be shortly. Further, the Administration's position against any new

below—market rate subsidies can be inferred from its flat opposition to the

Lugar subsidy bill this past summer.

Mortgage Revenue Bonds

      Another means of lowering interest rates for homeowners has been the use

of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds (MRB5). With this financing, the

interest cost has been cut by about 20 percent, i.e., 3 percentage points when

mortgage rates are 15 percent. (Businesses, with 1DB issues, are well aware

of the advantages of tax-exempt financing.) A surge in the issuance of MRB5

occurred in the second half of 1978, and in the absence of restrictive

legislation, much of the housing stock would have eventually been so

financed.

      The 1980 Mortgage Subsidy Bond Act limited tax-exempt financing to

first—time home buyers who purchased inexpensive or moderately priced houses

(those having a price less than 90 percent of the average area purchase

price). That is, MRBs were to be used largely to overcome problems created by

the standard fixed-rate mortgage instrument in an inflationary period--to

correct for underinvestment by financially constrained households. Moreover,

the legislation prohibited issues of MRBs after the end of 1983. The Tax

Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982——with that title it is a wonder

that passage was ever in doubt——raised the price limit to 110 percent of the

average area purchase price and allows 10 percent of the financing to be used
                                -13-




by multiple, rather than first-time, buyers. However, the end-of-1983 cut off

remains.

      Some have been particularly critical of MRB5 because they tend to drive

up tax-exempt yields. In fact, this side effect is a plus from the viewpoint

of efficient capital allocation if one considers the tax-exempt status of

state and local governments to be economically inefficient. State and local

capital formation is favored under current tax law in a manner similar to

owner—occupied housing. The income generated by the capital is not taxed,

while the opportunity cost of funds is below-market owing to the exemption of

interest received on state and local debt. Under this view, it is preferable

to substitute housing for state and local capital via MRB financing than for

industrial capital via below-market rate taxable debt financing.

Tax Preferences for Investors in Mortgages

      Our last topic is tax preferences for investors in residential

mortgages. In the Revenue Act of 1962, tax preferences (computation of loan

loss reserves that far exceed a reasonable provision for expected loan losses)

of savings and loan associations were explicitly tied to a minimum investment

in housing-related loans and liquid assets. In the Tax Reform Act of 1969,

the tax preferences of mutual savings banks were similarly tied. Because of

these preferences, these institutions would be willing to earn a lower pretax

return on mortgages than on otherwise comparable debt instruments. If these

institutions were the marginal investors in mortgages, then competition among

them would result in borrowers paying the lower rate.   Depending on the

profitability of the institutions, the reduction could be as much as a half

percentage point.17 On the other hand, if these institutions are not the

marginal investors in mortgages (possibly because binding deposit rate

ceilings limit their ability to attract funds) or are not profitable (in
                                  —14--




which case the tax preferences lose value), then mortgage rates will not be

lowered by the tax preferences.

      One way to insure relatively low mortgage rates is to extend tax

preferences to all investors in mortgages, and one method of doing this is to

enact a universal mortgage interest tax credit (MITC). While a MITC has never

been adopted, it was part of the Financial Institutions Act of 1975 (which

passed the Senate but not the House) and it has been recently advocated by The

President's Commission on Housing. Although a specific level of credit was

not stated in the Report of the Commission, a 2 percent credit was apparently

contemplated. With yields on comparable debt securities at 14½ percent, in-

vestors in the 44 percent tax bracket would be willing to accept a 14 percent

pretax return on mortgages.18

      This half point reduction is, of course, small compared to the depth of

the interest rate subsidy available with the Tandem program and MRB financing.

Note, however, that the subsidy would apply to all housing, not just a small,

targeted part. The administration is not pushing passage of the MITC.



                                    IV. Summary


      Where all this leaves us in terms of the efficient allocation of capital

between industrial and residential uses? Probably in better shape than we

have been in a long time. The business tax cuts of 1981, even after the 1982

correction, and the personal saving incentives of 1981 (the cut in the maximum

tax on unearned income, the expansion of IRAs, etc.) have sharply lowered the

rate at which income from industrial capital is taxed at both the business and

personal levels. At current inflation rates, producer's durables are, like

consumer durables, effectively exempt from taxation. However, structures in
                                     —15—




industrial use are still taxed somewhat more heavily than structures in

residential use. On the other hand, the extent of below-market residential

mortgage financing is probably at a 20 year low. The Tandem funds have been

depleted, the Lugar plan was not adopted, no one is seriously pushing the

MITC, and the restrictions on MRBs remain relatively tight (and the end—l983

cut off is still intact)

      It would appear, then, that investment in real capital in the 1980s is

likely to be allocated more efficiently between residential and industrial

uses than in the 1970s. Two factors could upset this conjecture. First,

there is always the possibility of new legislative initiatives to favor

household borrowing. The strong support in Congress for the Lugar bill is one

indication. Second, there is also the possibility that the economy will be

reinflated. Because the taxation of business capital rises with inflation,

owing to FIFO accounting and historic cost depreciation, a higher inflation

rate would tend, again, to lead to overinvestment in household capital and

underinvestment in indusfrial capital.

1For a recent calculation of the productivity or efficiency loss from these

wedges, see J.G. Gravelle, "The Social Cost of Nonneutral Taxation: Estimates

for Non-Residential Capital," in Hulten (ed.) Depreciation, Inflation, and the

Taxation of Income from Capital, The Urban Institute Press, 1981, and Don

Fullerton, "Why Do Varying Effective Corporate Tax Rates Matter?," Special

Report, 1981 Effective Tax Rate Supplement, Tax Notes.



2lnsofar as high income households can borrow indirectly at taxable rates and

invest in tax—exempt securities (direct borrowing for these purposes is

against IRS regulations), the deduction of mortgage interest can have value to

such households. Note, however, that transactions or intermediation costs

limit this. Say that the cost of borrowing mortgages is 14 percent but that

the return for investing in mortgages (say GNMA securities) is only 12 percent

and that the return on tax exempts is 70 percent of 12 percent or 8.4 percent.

Households in the 40 percent tax bracket pay 8.4 percent after tax for

mortgage funds and cannot arbitrage between mortgages and tax exempts.



3Thus owner—occupied housing has a tax advantage in Canada even though

interest is not deductible.

rates and house prices would have resulted in a significant number of

households being affected.
