                                               ABSTRACT

We leverage a large-scale incentivized survey eliciting behaviors from (almost) an entire university
student population, a representative sample of the U.S. population, and Amazon Mechanical Turk
(MTurk) to address concerns about the external validity of experiments with student participants. Behavior
in the student population offers bounds on behaviors in other populations, and correlations between
behaviors are largely similar across samples. Furthermore, non-student samples exhibit higher measurement
error. Adding historical lab participation data, we find a small set of attributes over which lab participants
differ from non-lab participants. Using an additional set of lab experiments, we see no evidence of
observer effects.

1         Introduction

Lab experiments have been used to amass large amounts of data on human behavior in the
face of economic incentives. Yet, skepticism persists about whether experimental insights
can be generalized beyond experimental labs and university-student populations. Critics
express concern that experiments are conducted on populations behaviorally distinct from
those that generally interest economists, and in environments unlike those in which people
actually make decisions. Given the paucity of data that could alleviate such concerns, they
are difficult to address directly.1
        We provide a data-driven evaluation of several external validity concerns. Leveraging
unique data from the Caltech Cohort Study (CCS)—an incentivized, comprehensive be-
havioral survey of almost the entire undergraduate population of the California Institute
of Technology (Caltech)—we shed light on the behavioral differences between undergradu-
ates and other populations, and assess whether behavior is different in the laboratory. In
particular, we provide evidence relevant to three questions. First, are university students
behaviorally different than representative populations or convenience samples, specifically
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk)? Second, are those students who choose to participate
in lab experiments different from the general population? Third, do students change their
behavior in the lab?
        We show that correlations between elicited behaviors are similar across our student, repre-
sentative, and MTurk samples, although the elicited behaviors themselves are quite different.
Differences in correlations can largely be explained by statistical insignificance in represen-
tative and MTurk samples, driven by higher measurement error. We see some evidence for
differences in observable behaviors between the general student population and self-selected
lab participants, though these differences are confined to a minimal set of attributes that are
easy to elicit and control for. We see no evidence of participants behaving differently inside
    1
    In specific settings, there is some useful work that examines these issues. See the literature review below
for details.



                                                                                                             1
the lab than outside of it.
   Together, our results suggest that experiments utilizing undergraduate students, in or
outside of the lab, allow generalizable inferences about behavior. This is despite under-
graduates differing in important ways from other populations. In addition, we document
behavior patterns that are useful both in choosing a venue and population for the execution
of laboratory experiments and for the interpretation of experimental results.
   To address the questions listed above, we use a large-scale, online, incentivized survey
given to several different populations, as detailed in Section 3. The survey is designed to elicit
a battery of behavioral attributes: risk aversion, altruism, over-confidence, over-precision,
implicit attitudes toward gender and race, various strategic interactions, and so on. This
incentivized survey was run on four different populations. First, in the CCS, described
above, 90% of the entire undergraduate population of Caltech participated. The second
and third populations were a representative sample of the U.S., and a convenience sample
of U.S. residents from MTurk, each containing approximately 1,000 participants. These
datasets are unusually large for experimental work, and assure that we can detect even
relatively small differences. Finally, we brought the CCS into the lab, where approximately
100 Caltech students completed the same survey, but in a substantially different environment.
In addition, we wed the CCS data with historical data about lab participation in the Caltech
Social Science Experimental Laboratory (SSEL).
   We use similar analytic methods to address each question. First, we compare the mean
levels of elicited behaviors in different samples. Then we compare the underlying distribu-
tions. In general, statistically significant mean differences for a specific elicitation are associ-
ated with a first-order stochastic dominance relation between the different samples. Finally,
as most experiments inspect linkages between behaviors, attributes, and treatments—in a
word, correlations—we generate 55 correlations that we examine across datasets. We assess
the degree to which these correlations coincide across datasets.
   We see substantial differences in the average levels of elicited behaviors between the


                                                                                                  2
representative, MTurk, and CCS samples, as documented in Section 3. Generally, behaviors
in the representative and MTurk samples lie closer to one another than the CCS sample is to
either. However, even the representative and MTurk samples display substantial differences.
Furthermore, differences are quite apparent in the distributions of responses. For most
elicitations, response distributions are ranked via first-order stochastic dominance with the
CCS on one extreme, and the representative sample on the other. Substantively, this means
that conclusions from student populations can be useful indicators of lower or upper bounds
on behavior in other populations. Descriptively, university students seem to provide upper
bounds on “normative rationality” (they are less generous, more risk neutral, etc.) and on
“cognitive sophistication” (they exhibit greater cognitive skills and strategic sophistication).
       Correlations, however, exhibit far greater similarity, and disagreement is largely consis-
tent with the pattern of measurement error across samples. Most social science studies focus
on correlations between attributes, rather than levels. For example, risk attitudes or altru-
ism are often elicited, as they are suspected to be a potential channel for explaining some
observed behavior. In only 7% of the correlations we examine do two samples have statis-
tically significant correlations of the opposite sign. Moreover, the remaining disagreement
between samples is largely driven by statistical insignificance of specific correlations in the
representative and MTurk samples. Both of these samples have higher measurement error—
and thus greater attenuation of correlations—than the CCS.2 The fact that the pattern of
correlations is similar across populations is encouraging—while estimated relationships may
have trouble replicating from sample to sample, it is relatively unlikely that a new sample
will produce an opposite result.
       MTurk is widely used by economists. At the time of writing, a Google Scholar search
of “Mechanical Turk” and “Economics” yields over 23,000 results. Presumably, this is due
to MTurk allowing the collection of large volumes of data quickly and cheaply.3 We note,
   2
     See Gillen et al. (2018) for background on the assessment of measurement error, its effects, and statistical
approaches for overcoming it.

     While precise statistics of Mechanical Turk users are not released, estimates exist of an hourly “wage”
ranging between $1–$5. See http://priceonomics.com/who-makes-below-minimum-wage-in-the-mechanical/.


                                                                                                               3
however, that representative samples have similar features in terms of both ease of access
and cost. Our results suggest MTurk has few advantages over other samples—it provides
noisier observations than the student sample, while still suffering from concerns about repre-
sentativeness. Nonetheless, the correlations between behaviors seen using the MTurk sample
are fairly similar to those observed in the two other samples.4
    Students who choose to participate in lab experiments differ little behaviorally from the
overall population of students, as documented in Section 5. This addresses the concern
that the same attributes that cause a student to select into lab experiments may be driving
the results observed in certain experimental settings. For example, if lab participants are
motivated by altruism, lab results regarding altruism will be different from what would
be observed in the general population (see Levitt and List, 2007b). In order to assess
these concerns, we wed data from the CCS with records of participation in lab experiments
from the Social Science Experimental Laboratory (SSEL) at Caltech. As nearly all Caltech
undergraduates completed the CCS, we can compare responses of those individuals who
participate in lab experiments—unweighted or weighted by the number of experiments they
participate in per year—to the overall population of students. Lab participants are slightly
less generous, more risk averse, and more likely to lie. These differences, while statistically
significant, are small in magnitude.
    Finally, we observe behavior in the lab that is virtually identical to that on the incen-
tivized survey, as documented in Section 6. This addresses a concern that observer effects,
reviewed in the next section, are driving experimental results. For example, experimental
results on the relatively low levels of lying and high levels of generosity, compared with the
“rational” benchmark, may be an artifact of participants behaving differently when directly
monitored by experimenters, or simply wishing to appear more ethical (Levitt and List,
2007a,b). In order to examine these concerns, we invited students to the lab to take the

     There may be a use for MTurk in rapid prototyping and piloting. However, these practices are a subject
of considerable debate in the experimental community.



                                                                                                         4
CCS survey.5 We see hardly any differences between responses in and outside of the lab.
Thus, to the extent that observer effects are important, they are not particularly sensitive
to the level of monitoring by, or presence of, the researchers. Participants in our lab experi-
ments are, however, less generous, and score higher on cognitive tasks. Yet, we also find that
repeated administration of the CCS is associated with reductions in generosity and increased
performance on cognitive tasks.6 While we cannot rule out some lab-specific effects on these
measures, the results for generosity, at least, run counter to expressed concerns.
       Taken together, our findings should be reassuring to researchers using standard student-
based experiments. While we see large differences in behaviors across the vastly different
populations in the CCS, the representative sample, and MTurk, these differences have limited
impacts on most correlations between the behaviors we elicit. In addition, behavior in student
populations may offer convenient bounds on behaviors in other populations. Furthermore,
behavioral differences due to selection into the lab is limited in scope. Lastly, behavior in
the lab is practically indistinguishable from an experimental setting outside of the lab.
       We stress that our study is unable to speak to all concerns about the experimental
enterprise. For example, we do not address worries that individuals may respond differently
to choices that do not mimic the somewhat artificial designs often seen in the lab. We are
sympathetic to this view, and certainly believe that framing of decisions matters for choices.7
Nonetheless, we believe that treating each specific application as sui generis drastically limits
the generalizability of any observation made either in the lab or in the field. Instead, this
paper suggests that some observations on behavioral tendencies are consistent across samples.
Moreover, these observations can be made using standard lab or survey methodology. We
hope the methods we introduce in this paper open doors to further data-driven analyses of
other aspects of external validity.
   5
      Participants were not told ahead of time that this would be the experimental task, to avoid selection
effects that would be specific to that experiment.
    6
      Repeated surveys do not change other elicitations, see Subsection 4.2.
    7
      There are, however, several studies that illustrate the similarity of field and experimental lab data in
various contexts ranging from peer effects on productivity (Herbst and Mas, 2015) to tax compliance (Alm
et al., 2015) to corruption (Armantier and Boly, 2013).


                                                                                                            5
2         Related Literature

Each of the questions we address has important precedents in the literature. A small number
of papers compare students to representative populations and MTurk. In line with our re-
sults, university students are less generous than representative samples of Zurich and Norway
(Falk et al., 2013; Cappelen et al., 2015).8 In addition, MTurk participants behave similarly
to university students on a set of four “heuristic and biases” experiments and two games (all
non-incentivized), and may be more representative of the broader U.S. population (Paolacci
et al., 2010; Berinsky et al., 2012). We build on this work by comparing university students,
a representative sample, and MTurk across a wide range of incentivized, fundamental be-
haviors. In addition, our university sample is (almost) exhaustive, as opposed to prior work
that studies only a subset of the university population—usually those that self-select into
laboratory experiments.
        Several papers study whether students’ self-selection into lab experiments creates bias.
This work shows that selection into lab experiments from broader student populations—
such as those taking introductory economics—is not related to risk aversion or generosity
(Harrison et al., 2009; Cleave et al., 2013; Falk et al., 2013). Even so, guaranteed show-up
fees yield somewhat more risk-averse lab participants (Harrison et al., 2009). We add to this
work by assessing selection over a large array of fundamental behaviors, and using data from
(almost) the entire student population from which lab participants are (self-)selected.
        The literature studying observer (or Hawthorne) effects—the idea that the mere presence
of an experimenter may change behavior—is much larger than both of the literatures reviewed
above, combined. In the popular, and academic, imagination this effect is tied to a series of
    8
     Belot et al. (2015) look at behavior in five different games by student and non-student participants in
the pool of the Oxford experimental laboratory. While non-students are not drawn from a representative
sample, the results are in line with ours—non-students have more salient other-regarding preferences and are
less sophisticated in their strategic thinking. Exadaktylos et al. (2013) report similar results when looking
at dictator, ultimatum, and trust games played by lab participants who are either students or not. They
further report similarity in responses of occasional and frequent participants. See also Falk et al. (2013) for
a related study focusing on trust games. Fréchette (2016) reviews experiments conducted with non-standard
participants, including animals, people living in token economies, and so on.



                                                                                                             6
experiments, most conducted by Elton Mayo, that took place at Western Electric’s factory
in Hawthorne, Illinois in the late 1920s and early 1930s (see Mayo, 1933). When studying
the impacts of physical conditions on productivity, workers under observation seemed to
out-perform those in a control group, even when identical conditions were imposed.9
       In dictator games, Hoffman et al. (1994) find an observer effect, while Bolton et al. (1998)
do not.10 These studies all use a between-participant design, with different participants in
different treatments. In contrast, we use a within-participant design—we consider the same
participants in different environments. Our comparison of behavior in the lab, where at least
one experimenter was present throughout the experimental sessions, to an incentivized online
survey, which participants took at a time and place of their choosing, with no supervision,
provides a test of the presence of an observer effect across a wide range of fundamental
behaviors. By and large, we find little evidence of an observer effect.11
       More broadly, controversy over lab experiments’ value and the use of student populations
is nearly as old as the methodologies themselves, with vocal critics and defenders. Concerns
about lab data’s generalizability go back to at least Orne (1962), and have been discussed
in various papers (see, for example, Guala and Mittone, 2005; Schram, 2005). They have
received a great deal of attention in a sequence of papers by Levitt and List (2007a, 2007b,
2008). Multiple recent papers advocate the usefulness of lab and experimental data (largely
in response to Levitt and List—see, for instance, Falk and Heckman, 2009; Kessler and
Vesterlund, 2015; Camerer, 2015). While we certainly do not speak to all concerns voiced
over the experimental enterprise, we provide some data-based insights on the extent of general
selection issues regarding experiments and surveys run on student populations.
   9
     The original results of these experiments may not actually show an observer effect (see Jones, 1992;
Levitt and List, 2011; as well as a survey of experiments in Gillespie, 1993). Follow-up studies in economics
have also produced mixed results.
  10
     Similarly, Laury et al. (1995) see no observer effect in public goods games. Comparing online and lab
responses, Anderhub et al. (2001) also find few differences in a particular game reminiscent of a consumption-
saving problem.
  11
     An important caveat to this statement is that we cannot test whether participating in a study in and
of itself affects behavior. Given the fact that lab experiments are not naturalistic, it is difficult to envisage
an experiment that could test for such an effect. Nonetheless, our results suggest that, even if some such
responses are present, they are not sensitive to the level of monitoring by the researchers.

3        The Data

The foundation of our analysis is the Caltech Cohort Study (CCS), a repeated, incentivized
survey covering over 90% of the Caltech student body. We administered the same survey,
with additional demographic questions, to two other populations: a representative sample,
and a convenience sample from MTurk. The survey itself elicits an array of behavioral
attributes including risk aversion, discounting, competitiveness, cognitive sophistication, im-
plicit attitudes toward gender and race, generosity, honesty, overprecision, a probabilistic
measure of lying, and so on. Here we describe the samples in more detail, before proceeding
to a brief description of elicitations we use heavily throughout this paper.


3.1       The Student Samples

Caltech is an independent, privately-supported university located in Pasadena, California.
It has approximately 900 undergraduate students, of which ∼ 40% are women. The Caltech
Cohort Study (CCS) is comprised of various versions of an incentivized survey administered
in the Fall of 2013, 2014, and 2015 and the Spring of 2015.
       The data used in this paper come almost exclusively from the Spring 2015 installment,
which utilized the same version of the survey run on the other populations we inspect. Other
surveys contained some, but not all, of the elicitations used here. In the Spring of 2015,
91% of the enrolled undergraduate student body (819/899) responded to the survey.12 The
average payment was $29.08 and the median time for survey completion was 35 minutes.13
It is important to note that there is little concern about self-selection into the CCS from the
participant population, due to our 90%+ response rates.
  12
     To obtain such a high participation rate, we promoted the survey through multiple emails. By the third
installment the students viewed it as a well-known feature of the Institute. As shown in Appendix Table
A.3, there are no statistically significant differences in behavioral measures between the overall population
and the 374 people who took the survey after a single reminder, the 530 that took it within a week of launch,
and the remaining 289 people who took it after a week had passed.
  13
     Similar participation rates across all our surveys limited attrition. In particular, of those who had taken
the survey in Spring 2015, 96% also took the survey in the Fall of 2014. Similarly, of those who took the
survey in 2013 and did not graduate, 89% also took the survey in the Fall of 2014.



                                                                                                              8
       In Section 5, we use records from the Social Science Experimental Laboratory (SSEL)
at Caltech. These records provide the number of experiments each individual in the SSEL
participant pool attended. For the cohorts entering between 2011 and 2014, 403 students
participated in at least one experiment held at SSEL by the Summer of 2015. Of those
who were eligible to participate in the CCS, 96% (350/370) responded to the CCS Spring
2015 survey.14 Conditional on participating in at least one experimental session, the median
participation rate was 2 experiments per year.
       In Section 6, we utilize data from a series of lab experiments we conducted in Summer
2015. These experiments asked participants to fill out the Spring 2015 survey on SSEL’s
computers, with us present in the room. The experiments were advertised with a neutral
name so as not to introduce selection due to the content of the experiments themselves. There
were 97 participants in our lab experiment, and the average payment was $34.94 (with a
show-up fee of $10). The median completion time was 31 minutes, slightly shorter than the
median completion time of the CCS when run online. Of the 97 experimental participants,
96 responded to the Spring 2015 CCS survey.
       Caltech is highly selective, which may raise concern that our student population is dif-
ferent from the pool utilized in most lab experiments. Such a concern should be mitigated
by the following observations. First, replication of standard experiments and elicitations—of
risk, altruism in the dictator game, and so on—yield similar results to other student pools
(see the Online Appendix in Gillen et al., 2018, for details). Second, while top-10 schools
account for 0.32% of the college-age population in the U.S., top-50 schools enroll only 3.77%
of that population (using the U.S. News and World Report rankings). Thus, there seems to
be little cause for concern that Caltech students are more “special” than students utilized
in many other lab experiments. We do, however, believe that expanding the approach here
to a wider set of universities and experimental labs, as well as experimental settings, would
be of great use. We hope the methodology we offer increases the feasibility of such studies.
  14
    As only enrolled students were eligible to participate, only 370 of the 403 students could participate due
to early graduations or leaves of absence.


                                                                                                            9
3.2     The Representative Sample

Survey Sampling International (SSI) was founded in 1977 and provides a platform for survey
researchers around the world to recruit panels of respondents based on various demographic
attributes. In Spring 2017 we utilized the SSI participant pool to run the CCS Spring 2015
survey on a representative sample of the U.S. population. We had 1,001 participants that
were representative of the U.S. population across age, income, and gender. The average
payment was $10.26, with an additional $3 required by SSI for each survey completion.15
The median completion time was 33 minutes.


3.3     Amazon Mechanical Turk

In Spring 2016 we conducted our survey with a sample of 995 U.S.-based Amazon Mechanical
Turk (MTurk) users. The average payment was $10.50 per participant.16 The median
completion time was 35 minutes.
    With the emergence of MTurk and other convenience samples as an important resource
for scholars, some recent work has already characterized the demographic profile of MTurk
users, and its comparison to the U.S. population (see, for example, Ipeirotis, 2010; Berinsky
et al., 2012; Huff and Tingley, 2015). We find similar patterns comparing the MTurk and
representative samples, which are summarized in Appendix Table A.1.17


3.4     Description of Elicitations

Throughout this paper we examine a standard set of elicitations that we believe are par-
ticularly important for experimental work. Precise question wordings can be found in the
  15
     We paid SSI $3 per respondent. We do not know what fraction of that amount was passed on to the
participants themselves. These incentives are at least four times as large as standard participant payments
through SSI. We were dissuaded from using larger amounts.
  16
     This is considered a fairly high wage on MTurk for a task that took about half an hour to complete. As
mentioned in the Introduction, current estimates of an hourly “wage” on MTurk range between $1–$5.
  17
     Overall, MTurk workers are younger, somewhat more educated, have lower incomes, and are more likely
to be single than participants in the representative sample.

tokens were valued at $1 for our student sample, while 300 survey tokens were valued at $1
for our representative and MTurk samples. Participants were paid for all tasks. The location
of questions within the survey was determined at random. Since we observe no order effects,
we report aggregate results throughout.


3.4.1    Risk Elicitations

We used three different risk elicitation techniques.18


Risky Projects: Following Gneezy and Potters (1997), participants were asked to allocate
an endowment of tokens between a safe option (keeping them), and a project that returns
some multiple of the tokens with probability p, otherwise returning nothing. In Spring 2015,
two projects were used: the first returning 3 tokens per token invested p = 35% of the time,
and the second returning 2.5 tokens 50% of the time.


Risky Urns: Two Multiple Price Lists (MPLs) asked participants to choose between a
lottery and sure amounts. The lottery would pay off if a ball of the color the participant
chose was drawn. The first urn contained 20 balls—10 black and 10 red—and paid 100
tokens. The second contained 30 balls—15 black and 15 red—and paid 150 tokens. Taking
the first MPL as an example, participants were first asked to choose the color they wanted
to pay off, if drawn. They were then presented with a list of choices between a certainty
equivalent that increased in units of 10 tokens from 0 to 100 or the gamble on the urn.19


Qualitative: Following Dohmen et al. (2011), participants were asked to rate themselves,
on a scale of 0–10, in terms of their willingness to take risks.
  18
    For an overview of risk elicitation techniques, see Charness et al. (2013).
  19
    In order to prevent multiple crossovers, the online form automatically selected the lottery over a 0 token
certainty equivalent, and 100 tokens over the lottery. In addition, participants needed to make only one
choice, and all other rows were automatically filled in to be consistent with that choice.




                                                                                                           11
3.4.2      Discounting (δ)

Participants were asked a hypothetical question about how much money we would have to pay
them in 60 days to forego a $150 payment delayed by only 30 days after the completion of the
survey.20 This was converted to a monthly discount rate (δ) using standard techniques, that
is δ = $150/answer. As this task featured hypothetical incentives, there were many extreme
answers. We therefore trim the top and bottom 10% of answers—those that demand less
than $150, or more than $400.


3.4.3      Dictator Giving

There were four tasks that asked participants to allocate a stock of tokens between themselves
and another randomly chosen anonymous participant. In the first dictator game, participants
were given a stock of 300 points, and in the second, 100 points. In a third dictator game,
any amount given to the other participant was doubled; in a fourth, points allocated to the
other participant were halved. In both of these latter tasks, allocations were made out of a
stock of 100 points.


3.4.4      Prisoner’s Dilemma

There were two symmetric Prisoner’s Dilemma games with different payoffs. However, pay-
offs were scaled by a common factor to keep the same relative incentives across the two
games. Participants were told that, for each game, they would be randomly matched with
another participant at the end of the survey, and paid based on their own choice and the
choice of the other participant.


3.4.5      Lying

Two questions were meant to (probabilistically) measure the willingness of participants to lie.
Both asked participants to toss a coin some fixed number of times, and report an outcome.
 20
      Having both payoffs in the future removes any effects of present bias.


                                                                                            12
In the first task, participants were asked to report the number of heads they got in 5 coin
tosses, knowing they would be paid 30 tokens for each. In the second, participants were asked
to report the number of switches (or number of runs minus one) they got in a sequence of
10 coin tosses, knowing they would, again, be paid 30 tokens for each.


3.4.6      Cognitive Tasks

We used two types of cognitive tasks.


Raven’s Matrices: Participants were asked to complete five Raven’s Matrices, which are
commonly used for assessing abstract reasoning, see Raven (1936). Each Raven’s Matrix con-
sisted of a 3x3 matrix with eight of the nine cells featuring a geometric design. Participants
had to choose the correct geometric pattern to complete the matrix out of six possibilities.
Participants were given 30 seconds to complete each task, and were paid 20 tokens for each
correctly completed matrix.


Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT): Participants responded to variations on the three
questions from Frederick (2005). These questions have an “obvious” wrong answer, and thus
are designed to measure individuals’ ability to reflect on problems and override immediate
intuitions.21 As in the Raven’s Matrices task, participants were given 30 seconds to complete
each question and paid 20 tokens for each question answered correctly.


3.4.7      Confidence in Guesses

Following the over-precision task of Ortoleva and Snowberg (2015), participants were asked
to guess the number of jellybeans in (a picture of) a jar, and then rate how confident they
were about their guess. Ratings were on a six point scale, ranging from “not confident at all”
to “certain.” Participants repeated this task three times, and we averaged their responses.
 21
      We used variations on the original questions, as some responders may have been exposed to the originals.




                                                                                                           13
3.4.8    Competition

The essential elements of Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) were presented to participants.
First, they had three minutes to solve as many sums of five two-digit numbers as they could.
They were told they would be grouped with three other participants at random. If they
solved the most sums correctly within their group of four, they would receive 40 tokens
per correct sum. Next, participants repeated the task, but were asked before whether they
preferred to be paid the same way as in the first one, or whether they preferred to receive
10 tokens per correct sum regardless of others’ performance. This second task provides an
elicitation of willingness to compete.22


3.4.9    Implicit Association Tests (IAT)

We assessed implicit attitudes toward gender and race separately using two Implicit Attitude
Tests (IATs; Greenwald et al., 1998).23 Although controversial, IATs are often viewed as
measures of discriminatory attitudes.



4       Comparison of Different Samples

We begin our analysis by comparing different participant pools: university students (from
the CCS), a convenience sample (from MTurk), and a representative sample of the U.S. (from
SSI). We see large differences in the average levels of the behaviors we examine. For most
behaviors there are clear first-order stochastic dominance relationships between the samples,
with the CCS on one extreme and the representative sample on the other. This implies that
results from experiments on university students may usefully bound behaviors in representa-
tive samples. In particular, students behave in a more normatively rational and cognitively
sophisticated way. These mean differences do not tend to lead to disagreement in the signs
  22
     For further details, see Gillen et al. (2018).
  23
     These scores are derived from the differences between mean latencies across the two combined classi-
fication stages in each of the IATs, see Greenwald et al. (2003). The gender task measured the implicit
association between gender and the sciences or humanities.


                                                                                                      14
of correlations between behaviors. The differences in the levels of statistical significance
associated with those correlations are broadly consistent with differences in measurement
error across the samples. In particular, the CCS exhibits more significant correlations and
also the lowest level of measurement error.


4.1       Differences in Behavior

The average measures of each behavior are quite different across the three samples, as shown
in Table 1. In the case of the CCS, this should be unsurprising, and perhaps even reassuring,
as students at elite universities are an extraordinary set of individuals. Moreover, prior
research has established links between intellectual ability and various behaviors such as risk
aversion and discounting (Dohmen et al., 2010, 2018). This implies that a population with
higher than average cognitive ability should exhibit different behaviors.
       It is also clear from Table 1 that the representative and MTurk samples are closer to
each other than either is to the CCS.24 Moreover, the average levels of behavioral measures
in the MTurk sample are usually between those in the representative sample and CCS.
In fact, several measures—reflecting risk attitudes, discounting, confidence, and attitudes
towards race—show no significant difference across the MTurk and representative samples.
For risk aversion, the magnitude of the differences between the CCS and other samples
vary across measures. Differences are the most substantial for the Risky Projects measures.
These elicitations mimic a stock/bond portfolio choice (or risky/safe assets) that resemble
investment decisions and are therefore particularly important for many economic settings.25
       The mean differences we report are not only statistically significant, they are also sub-
stantially large. A summary measure of statistical difference between two samples is the
number of control variables needed in order for the two samples to be balanced on the re-
  24
     The differences we see are not due to differences in gender and race composition, as can be seen from
Appendix Table A.6. This table re-weights the CCS sample to match the gender and racial composition of
the representative samples.
  25
     Gillen et al. (2018) also show that these elicitations are relatively stable over time, exhibit less measure-
ment error, and generate different responses across genders.

maining variables. For the representative and MTurk samples, one would need to control for
10 of the variables in Table 1 for those samples to be statistically balanced on the other 10.
For the representative and CCS sample, one would need 12 controls. Finally, for the MTurk
and CCS samples, one would need 9 controls.
       In magnitude terms, the differences between samples are large. For example, differences
in the amount allocated in the Risky Project measures are between 15–25% of the maximum
possible differences, or around 50–75% of a standard deviation of these measures within a
given sample. The differences in discount rates are similarly substantial in terms of sample
standard deviations.26 Differences in giving in dictator games are also large, corresponding to
approximately 10% of the budget. This last point is important as it suggests that generosity
in student populations, sometimes viewed as a student or lab artifact, may actually offer a
lower bound of generosity in the overall population.27 Nonetheless, we note that comparative
statics across our variants of the dictator game are similar across our samples and identical
for our MTurk and representative samples. We return to a general analysis of the connections
between elicited behaviors in Section 4.3.
       The distributions of various behavioral elicitations, in Figure 1, display a clear pattern:
there is a first-order stochastic relationship between the CCS and the representative sample
in most behaviors.28 Additionally, the distribution in the MTurk sample is generally closer
to the representative sample, as implied by Table 1. In some cases, we also see a clear
first-order stochastic relationship between the MTurk distributions and those of the CCS
and the representative sample, although this is less common. Overall, these facts imply that
the differences in means in Table 1 are not driven by small groups of people with extreme
  26
     This can be directly calibrated to real-world examples. Suppose someone has a monthly salary of $6,000.
Assume that a one-month training decreases income in that month by $4,000, but increases it to some amount
y thereafter. With a monthly discount rate of 0.67 (MTurk and representative), the future wage y would
need to be at least $8,000. With a discount rate of 0.77 (CCS), the future wage y would need to surpass
only $7,200 to justify the investment in training.
  27
     This observation is in line with prior work on this elicitation, see Falk et al. (2013) and Cappelen et al.
(2015), as well as the discussion of the literature in Section 2.

behaviors, but are instead population-level shifts.
   As the CCS exhibits first-order stochastic dominance relationships with the other sam-
ples, it offers bounds on the behaviors we measure. Observations in the CCS serve as an
upper-bound on the distribution of risk aversion, discounting, lying, and performance on
intellectual tasks, and a lower bound on generosity, as shown in Figure 1. Overall, the Cal-
tech student population is closer to the ideal of normative rationality and exhibits greater
cognitive sophistication than the other populations we examine. This might be useful for
experiments mimicking certain economic environments—say, ones where participants stand
for professional investors in large firms. However, it may also lead to muted “behavioral”
aspects of choice when using university students as a sample population.



                                                                                                                                         18
   Participants in the CCS exhibited wide variation in their enthusiasm to complete the
surveys, with some completing the survey as soon as it was announced, and some waiting
several weeks. We find no correlation between the speed at which participants responded
to the survey and the behavioral proxies we measure. Specifically, while surveys of the
MTurk and representative samples were completed within a couple of hours, and a few days,
respectively, it took multiple weeks and reminders to obtain the same level of participation in
the CCS. As shown in Appendix Table A.3, there are no statistically significant differences in
behavioral measures between the overall population and the 374 people who took the survey
after a single reminder, the 530 that took it within a week of launch, and the remaining 289
people who took it after a week had passed. We see one exception, detailed in Table A.4:
those that took more than a week to take the CCS were much less likely to participate in
experiments in the Caltech Social Science Experimental Laboratory (SSEL). This further
suggests that the fact that we were unable to survey ∼9% of the Caltech undergraduate
student body does not significantly impact the results discussed here, and previews the
results in Sections 5 and 6.


4.2    Learning and the CCS

A final difference between samples is that the CCS was repeated multiple times with many
of the same participants. This repetition may have affected responses in a number of ways,
including through participants learning about how to respond to the incentivized tasks, or
about their own preferences. Changes in distributions of responses over time could then
imply that responses in later installments of the CCS survey are an artifact of repetition,
rather than a reflection of what one would see in a standard lab setting. Fortunately, we
find few differences in the distribution of responses on the CCS over time.
   Of the few tasks that were repeated across multiple versions of the survey there were only
two classes of elicitations with strong variation over time: cognitive tasks (CRT and Raven’s
Matrices), and giving in the dictator game. The first panel of Figure 2 shows the typical


                                                                                            19

pattern of responses comparing the first installment of the CCS, in the Fall of 2013, with
the installment we focus on here, conducted 1.5 years later. The distributions of responses
on the two installments of the CCS for the Second Risky Project are nearly identical, and
clearly different than those emerging from MTurk and the representative sample.29 The
second panel shows the atypical pattern in Dictator Giving, where participants showed far
more generosity initially: so much so that the distribution is quite similar to that observed
on MTurk. Thus, it appears that although the CCS features a less generous participant pool
than the representative sample, this difference is exaggerated by some participants changing
their behavior as they complete the task multiple times.30
   The two cognitive exercises were introduced on the Spring 2015 survey, and the same
questions were repeated in the Fall of 2015. Focusing on those participants who took both
surveys, and did not participate in our lab experiment in the Summer of 2015 (500 people),
the mean CRT score was 1.67 in the spring and 1.95 in the fall. Similarly, the mean number
  29
     The Fall 2013 survey contained only one risky-project task, which was identical to the Second Risky
Project task on the Spring 2015 CCS. The description of these two tasks (first, second) was chosen without
regard to their longevity on the survey.
  30
     Those who first participated in the CCS after Fall 2013 also seem less generous, suggesting that some
behavioral change is due to social interactions, rather than interactions with the task itself.


                                                                                                                              20
of Raven’s Matrices was 1.85 in the Spring, and 1.91 in the fall. Thus, repetition of these
tasks may widen the gap in performance between the CCS and other pools. However, the
difference we observe with first-time responders is clear.


4.3       Similarity of Correlations

Experimental work is often concerned with the correlations between attributes. Attempting
to connect behaviors with each other, with demographics, or with a treatment, boils down
to an examination of correlations. Thus, in this subsection, we examine the correlations
between different behaviors in our data, with the results shown in Figure 3. Our method
of comparison is motivated by a very simple notion of replication. In particular, if a study
documents a particular statistically significant correlation in a particular sample, would a
statistically significant correlation of the same sign be found in another sample? Although
this notion is quite simple, it is close to those used in recent multi-study replication exercises
(Camerer et al., 2016; Open Science Collaboration, 2015).31
       Figure 3 displays the sign and significance (at the 10% level) of correlations in the three
samples: first the representative sample, then MTurk, then the CCS. When there are multi-
ple elicitations of an attribute, we use the first principal component of these elicitations. A
positive and significant correlation is denoted with a “+”, a negative and significant correla-
tion is denoted with a “−”, and an insignificant correlation is denoted with a “0.” When all
three samples agree, we use a single symbol in that cell. The threshold of p < 0.1 is chosen
conservatively, although many readers may prefer a cutoff of p < 0.05. Appendix Figures
A.2 and A.3 are similar to Figure 3, but use p-value cutoffs of 0.05 and 0.01, respectively.32


  31
     Statistical comparisons of correlation matrices are complicated by the fact that a random perturbation
in one variable affects its correlations with all other variables in the matrix. Most methods model the joint
distribution of variables as a multi-variate normal, and test for differences between estimated distributions.
For a useful overview, see Diedenhofen and Musch (2015). As many of our variables are clearly not normally
distributed, and statistical differences are less important than how differences would manifest themselves in
substantive conclusions pertaining to the relationships between variables, we use a different approach.
  32
     Those figures lead to similar conclusions. However, as significance restrictions become more demanding,
fewer correlations are significant, which mechanically causes the appearance of more agreement.

     Notes: T indicates complete agreement, T complete disagreement, and T two out of three samples agreeing.
       There is a lot of consistency between the correlations observed in the three samples. In
only four out of the 55 correlations we examine (7%) is there a strong disagreement—with a
positive and statistically significant correlation in one sample, and a negative and statistically
significant correlation in another. In 23 cases (42%) there is complete agreement between
the three samples. The remaining cases show an agreement in the sign of a correlation
(if significant), and disagreement is simply due to one or two of the samples exhibiting
statistically insignificant correlations.
       Much of the “moderate” disagreement is driven by statistically insignificant results in
either the MTurk or representative sample (or both). Indeed, of the 28 moderate disagree-
ments, 20 feature statistically insignificant correlations in the representative sample, 16 in
the MTurk sample, and only 9 in the CCS, which has an ∼18% smaller sample size. As cor-
relations may be attenuated by noise, or measurement error, we next turn to an examination
of the extent of measurement error across these three samples.


4.4       Measurement Error

We use a simple method to ascertain the extent of measurement error in a sample, building on
Gillen et al. (2018). Our method relies on the inclusion of several duplicate elicitations in our
survey(s), such as the First and Second Risky Project, the two Risky Urns (MPLs), and so
on. To understand how these are used to assess measurement error, consider two elicitations
of the same underlying parameter X ∗ . In particular, X a = X ∗ + νX
                                                                   a
                                                                     and X b = X ∗ + νX
                                                                                      b
                                                                                        ,
      a    b
with νX , νX i.i.d., mean zero, random variables.33 Then, we have that:

   Using this relationship, Table 2 shows that the CCS has the lowest measurement error
of the three samples in all elicitations except for IAT Race. These differences are often
significant when comparing the CCS and the representative sample. As greater measurement
error leads to greater attenuation of estimated correlations, variations in noise across our
samples can help explain the patterns we identified in Figure 3.
   The differences in the amount of noise across our samples raise caution on certain con-
clusions derived from comparing correlations using student data and data from other pop-
ulations. Measurement error could cause significant correlations in student samples not to
replicate in other samples. In view of recent concerns about the lack of reproducibility
of experimental results (see Ioannidis, 2005, and references that follow), our observations
emphasize the importance of techniques to deal with measurement error in experiments,

                                                                                              24
especially when using non-student samples (Gillen et al., 2018).34 Furthermore, our analysis
suggests a natural cost-benefit tradeoff: while student-based studies often entail higher costs,
they imply lower noise. Such cost-benefit analysis also suggests that MTurk may have few
advantages over representative samples. Indeed, the costs of running a study on a represen-
tative or MTurk sample are comparable. So is the level of measurement error. However,
MTurk is not representative and is associated with greater levels of measurement error than
those seen in our student sample.



5        Selection into the Lab

The prior section indicated that representative and student populations yield similar correla-
tions between elicitations, despite differences in levels of elicited behaviors and measurement
error. This comparison was done using a survey that covered nearly the entire population
of Caltech students. In contrast, lab experiments include non-random, and possibly non-
representative, samples of university students: those who select to go to the lab. In this
section we ask whether selection into the lab results in non-representative behaviors in that
population. Broadly speaking, we find very few differences between the population that goes
to the lab and the overall university population.
       In principle, participants who select into experiments may have different attributes than
those who do not. This difference would reduce our ability to extrapolate from lab ex-
periments, even to the population of students from which participants are drawn. This is
especially relevant for particular classes of experiments. For example, generosity is commonly
observed in the lab (see, for example Roth, 1995, for references). However, if individuals who
contribute to others’ research by showing up to the lab are more generous than the overall
population, these conclusions might lack external validity (see Levitt and List, 2007b).
  34
    The incentives used for our student population are on par with standard payments in experimental labs.
It would be interesting to investigate whether student studies run with lower incentives, comparable to those
used on MTurk and on our representative sample, yield comparable behaviors and measurement errors. On
MTurk, DellaVigna and Pope (2017) suggest that incentives have a substantial impact on performance in a
simple-effort task.

                                                                                                          25
       The CCS offers a unique opportunity to examine selection into lab experiments. Given
the high response rate, the surveys provide an array of attributes of the underlying population
of potential participants. Data from the Caltech Social Science Experimental Laboratory
(SSEL) supply the full record of participation in lab experiments for each student. We can
therefore identify lab participants in the CCS data, and compare the patterns of their elicited
behaviors to those of the underlying population of students.
       We examine two ways of characterizing the population that goes to the lab. The first sim-
ply compares responses, on the CCS, of the population that has participated in at least one
experiment in SSEL with the entire population in the CCS. The second compares responses
weighted by participation with the entire CCS population. For this second comparison, we
weight responses of those who go to the lab by their lab experience—that is, the average num-
ber of times per year a CCS participant went to the lab. Behavior measures weighted by
participation mimic behavior (on the CCS) of the average population one would see across all
lab experiments.35 The averages for each population are displayed in the first three columns
of Table 3, while the final two columns compare the two lab-going populations to the overall
population that participated in the CCS.
       We see little difference between the population that goes to the lab and the overall
population. Indeed, the only statistically significant difference in behavior is in the amount
allocated in the First Risky Project. In addition, the subsample that goes to the lab has a
significantly greater proportion of females.
       The difference between the average lab population—the lab population weighted by lab
experience—and the overall population is more significant, but small relative to the differ-
ences between the samples explored in the previous section. The average lab participant is
more risk averse, more willing to lie, and less generous than the overall university popula-
tion. The largest differences, in the Second Risky Project and Dictator Giving, are less than
  35
    There are two caveats to this exercise. First, because we do not observe all cohorts in the Spring 2015
survey for the full time they are at Caltech, we effectively have a slice of their overall participation records.
Second, the number of experiments run at SSEL fluctuates over the years, which impacts the number of
experiments available to students at different times.

one-fourth and one-sixth, respectively, of the corresponding differences when comparing the
representative sample and the CSS.36
       The average differences we observe are again indicative of first-order stochastic domi-
nance relations in the underlying distributions, as shown in Figure 4. The panels of this
figure display the cumulative distribution functions corresponding to the same selected set
of elicitations depicted in Figure 1 for the overall and lab-going subpopulations of the CCS.
These images echo the message emerging from Table 3—lab participants are similar to the
underlying population, with some small differences for certain elicitations when weighting
the set of participants by lab experience.37
       Overall, lab participants are more risk averse, less generous, and more willing to lie on the
Spring 2015 CCS. The previous section documented that the CCS sample is less risk averse
than the representative or MTurk samples. As lab participants are more risk averse than
their underlying population, risk behaviors for the lab-going population are slightly closer to
the representative and MTurk samples. Nevertheless, the Caltech lab participants are still
significantly and substantially less risk averse than participants in the other two samples.
Generosity, as reflected by Dictator Giving, displays the opposite pattern: lab participants
are even less generous than the underlying student population, which increases the difference
with the other samples. This is particularly interesting in view of a frequent concern that
generosity in experiments is an artifact of behavior in the lab due to selection of participants
who are willing to spend time helping researchers and therefore more likely to be generous
in general. While the differences in Reported Heads or Reported Switches are small, lab
participants are, if anything, more likely to lie than their underlying population, and certainly
relative to the other two samples. This implies that conclusions about reluctance to lie in
experiments (see Gneezy, 2005; Erat and Gneezy, 2012, and papers that followed) are not
a consequence of selection into the lab. This is a particularly important counter-factual to
  36
     Comparing responses of those who participate in experiments more than the median number per year
to those who participate less than the median number produces no statistically significant differences, see
Appendix Table A.5.

the literature that suggests that lab participants choose actions that make them look more
“moral” or “ethical” (see, for example, Levitt and List, 2007a,b).
   Finally, we see largely similar correlation patterns across subsamples, although smaller
subsamples produce more statistically significant results. Figure 5 is an analogue of Figure 3,
where each entry corresponds, from left to right, to the sign and significance of the correlation
in the CCS overall population, the subset of CCS participants who showed up to at least
one SSEL experiment, and that same subset weighted by lab experience. Once again, a
positive and significant correlation (at the 10% level) is denoted with a “+”, a negative and
significant correlation is denoted with a “−”, and an insignificant correlation is denoted with
a “0.” When all three samples agree, we use a single symbol in that cell.

     Notes: T indicates complete agreement, T complete disagreement, and T two out of three samples agreeing.
       There is substantial agreement between the signs of correlations in the full CCS sample
and the subset of lab participants, whether or not they are weighted by lab experience.
None of the cells exhibit complete disagreement—a positive and significant correlation in
one sample, and a negative and statistically significant correlation in another. In 37 of the
55 (67%) correlations, there is full agreement. In 40 of the 55 (73%), correlations have the
same sign when considering the overall CCS population and the subset of lab participants
weighted by lab experience—the subsample with the largest differences in Table 3 and Figure
4. In only four of the cells (7%) in which there is some disagreement is the correlation within
the overall CCS population insignificant. Thus, most disagreement is due to one of the
smaller samples exhibiting an insignificant correlation. This is unsurprising: smaller samples
have larger standard errors, and thus lower levels of significance.38 In only one of the 18
cells in which there is some disagreement, corresponding to the correlation between gender
and lying, is there a statistically significant difference across samples. In that cell, the only
statistically significant difference (at the 10% level) is between the correlation found in the
overall CCS population and that found when participants are weighted by lab experience.
       In summary, we see some selection effects in lab participation, though the lab-going
subsample is non-representative in terms of only a few behaviors. In fact, several concerns
voiced in the literature about selection into the lab driving experimental results—for example,
in the context of social preferences—are not borne out by our data. Lastly, correlations
between attributes appear remarkably similar for lab participants and the population from
which they are drawn.
       It would be fairly easy to control for the selection effects we identify. Only a small
set of attributes—one risk elicitation, one dictator game, and one lying task—are jointly
statistically significant, while others are not.39 That is, if one controlled for only three
  38
      Once again, analogous figures for 5% and 1% significance levels are shown in the Appendix, in particular
Appendix Figures A.5 and A.6. Those figures generate similar conclusions. However, as before, when sig-
nificance restrictions become more demanding, fewer correlations are significant, which mechanically causes
the appearance of more agreement.
   39
      Specifically, the First Risky Project, Dictator Giving, Doubled, and Reported Heads, are jointly statis-
tically significant. All other elicitations are jointly statistically insignificant.

variables in Table 3, the sample would be statistically balanced on the other 17. A particular
implication of this fact is that the difference in the gender composition of lab participants
does not explain much of the average differences we observe.



6        Behavior in the Lab

Although the lab-going subpopulation exhibits similar behaviors to the overall university
sample, it is still possible that being in the lab, or being observed by experimenters, would
result in profound changes in behavior. Indeed, the Hawthorne or observer effect, reviewed
above, has been a topic of discussion for over 80 years. In this final section of analysis, we
show that, to the extent that an observer effect plays a role, its impacts are not sensitive to
the level of monitoring of participants. We see few differences between behavior in and out
of the lab, and what differences do exist are in line with learning in the lab.
       In order to compare responses in the lab to responses in the online CCS, we conducted
a sequence of experiments at SSEL in the Summer of 2015. We invited students from the
cohorts covered by the survey to participate.40 We were present in the lab for all sessions.
In total, 97 students participated, 55% of which were women. This is in agreement with,
but somewhat more extreme, than the over-representation of women in lab experiments ob-
served in the previous section. Lab participants retook the CCS survey from the Spring of
2015, which allows us to compare whether the lab environment itself changes participants’
responses. Ninety-nine percent (96/97) of the students participating in our lab experiments
also participated in the Spring 2015 CCS survey. On average, participants spent a compa-
rable amount of time filling out the survey online (35 minutes) and in the lab (31 minutes).
       Average responses in the lab and on the survey are very similar. The first column of Table
4 shows the average responses on the Spring 2015 CCS of those who came to our Summer
2015 experiments. Consistent with the results in the previous section, respondents are more
  40
    Experimental sessions were separated by a few months from the Spring and Fall installments of the
survey. The name of the experiment was intentionally not indicative of its content, so participants were not
aware they would be completing the CCS survey in the lab when signing up.

likely to be female, less altruistic, and more risk averse. The second column displays the
same behaviors elicited from the same population, but this time in the lab. As can be seen,
on most behaviors the differences are small in magnitude and statistically insignificant.
   Statistically significant differences exist for three elicitations. In the First Risky Urn, stu-
dents are statistically significantly more risk averse in the lab, though the difference is small
in magnitude (less than 4% of the maximal price that can be submitted as a willingness to
pay). In the two cognitive tasks—Raven’s Matrices and CRT—lab participants significantly
outperform survey participants. At face value, this suggests that lab participants might be
somewhat more attentive or more willing to exert effort than outside of the lab. However,
it is also consistent with what we see for CCS participants in general when they take an
additional survey, as discussed in Subsection 4.2. Despite these differences, when controlling
for only one of these variables—the number of correct Raven’s Matrices—the samples are
balanced on the other 19.
   Indeed, a careful inspection of our results for the cognitive tasks does not allow us to
reject either a learning effect or a lab-based performance effect. Recall that for participants
who took the Spring and Fall 2015 survey, and did not participate in our lab experiment in
the Summer of 2015 (500 people), the mean CRT was 1.67 in the spring and 1.95 in the fall.
Similarly, the mean number of Raven’s Matrices was 1.85 in the Spring, and 1.91 in the fall.
The increase for these participants is not as substantial for those who participated in our lab
experiment, indicating some lab-based effect. On the other hand, 90 out of 96 participants
in our lab experiment took the Fall 2015 survey, and their average scores were 2.19 for the
CRT, and 2.79 for the five Raven’s Matrices. This persistent improvement in performance
is consistent with a learning effect.
   Also consistent with some learning are the distributions of Dictator Giving, shown in
Figure 6, which depicts the analogous cumulative distributions to Figures 1 and 4 across the
lab and survey environment. Although there is no statistically significant difference in means
for this elicitation, the distribution in the lab first-order stochastically dominates that of the

survey. This is consistent with the learning effect in the dictator game illustrated in Figure
2. For all other distributions, except for those of the number of correct Raven’s Matrices,
the distributions in the lab and on the survey are nearly identical.
   Correlations between measures are, almost uniformly, statistically indistinguishable be-
tween the lab and the survey environment. However, as our sample of lab participants is
relatively small, many correlations are insignificant simply due to high standard errors.41
We therefore include the analogue to Figures 3 and 5 in Appendix Figure A.7.
   In summary, we see little difference between behavior in the lab and outside. The overall
similarity between results generated through lab experiments and online surveys is in line
  41
     Indeed, 45 of the 55 correlations we inspected in our SSEL data and in our CCS data—restricted to
participants who participated in our lab experiment—were insignificant.

game or public goods games (see, for example, Laury et al., 1995; Bolton et al., 1998).42



7        Discussion

In this paper, we leverage a large-scale survey run on multiple populations to answer three
questions. First, are university students behaviorally different than representative popu-
lations or convenience samples, specifically Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk)? Second,
are those students who choose to participate in lab experiments different from the general
student population? Third, do students change their behavior when they are in the lab?
       Correlations between behaviors are similar across the student, representative, and MTurk
samples, although the distributions of individual behaviors are quite different. Differences
in correlations can largely be explained by statistical insignificance in the representative and
MTurk samples, driven by higher measurement error. We see some evidence for differences
in observable behaviors between the general student population and self-selected lab partic-
ipants, though these differences are confined to a minimal set of behaviors that are easy to
elicit and control for. We see no evidence of observer effects—differences in behavior when
completing tasks in the lab while being observed by experimenters.
       Taken together, our findings should be reassuring for researchers using standard student-
based experiments, and those who might like to rely on their results. In particular, this study
provides evidence that generalizable inferences about human behavior are possible from lab
experiments. There are other advantages of lab experiments that our study does not speak
to directly. Indeed, the lab is often said to enable more intricate experimental designs, by
allowing experimenters to provide detailed instructions and monitor participants’ attention.
       We caution that we cannot address the concern that different framings of problems, or
different backgrounds or experiences of participants, would not affect behavior. We expect
  42
    These results are also in line with Anderhub et al. (2001), who compared behavior in the lab and online,
albeit with different participants in each, and in only one game.



                                                                                                         36
they would. For example, a participant in an online or lab auction may behave differently
from a seasoned bidder in FCC auctions.43 In practice, it would be quite unusual for a
practitioner to take evidence from a student-based lab sample directly to public policy.
Instead, a scholar might design a mechanism on the basis of lab insights. The resulting
policy would then be field tested to ensure insights carry over, and to allow fine-tuning of
the policy’s details. It is precisely this sort of protocol that our study supports.
    In general, concerns about external validity focus on how findings will extend to different
people, different environments, and / or different choices. Our study has much to say about
external validity concerns due to different participant populations and provides insights on
the effects of particular environments (incentivized survey or lab). We hope the methodology
we introduce opens the door to future data-driven studies of other facets of external validity.
