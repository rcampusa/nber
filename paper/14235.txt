How Does Shared Capitalism Affect Economic Performance in the UK?

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper uses nationally representative linked workplace-employee data from the British 2004 Workplace
Employment Relations Survey to examine the operation of shared capitalist forms of pay--profit-sharing
and group pay for performance, employee share ownership, and stock options--and their link to productivity.
It shows that shared capitalism has grown in the UK, as it has in the US; that different forms of shared
capitalist pay complement each other and other labor practices in the sense that firms use them together
more than they would if they chose modes of pay and work practices independently; and that workplaces
switch among schemes frequently, which suggests that they have trouble optimizing and the transactions
cost of switching are relatively low. Among the single schemes, share ownership has the clearest positive
association with productivity, but its impact is largest when firms combine it with other forms of shared
capitalist pay and modes of organization.

          There are three reasons for exploring the impact of shared capitalism – employee

shared ownership, payment via stock options, profit sharing and related group incentive

pay -- on economic outcomes in the UK.

          The first is that shared capitalism is widespread. Table 1 shows the incidence and

coverage of the major shared capitalist modes of pay in Britain for private sector

workplaces with 5 or more employees in the 2004 Workplace Employment Relations

Survey. Around one-fifth of workplaces had some form of employee share ownership

scheme, which includes the Save as You Earn (SAYE) – an all-employee plan that gives

workers tax breaks when they save to purchase their employer’s shares but that does not

require that they purchase the shares; the share incentive plan (SIP)-- an all-employee

scheme that offers tax breaks for employees holding shares in the company for which

they work; and the Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) – where companies can grant

chosen employees or directors up to £30,000 of tax and national insurance advantaged

share options. The majority of the stock ownership plans are open to all non-managerial

employees in part because the tax code usually requires such coverage to obtain tax

breaks.

          Turning to profit sharing and related group incentive pay, one-quarter of

workplaces had some form of profit-related pay for non-managerial employees, and one-

quarter had some form of group-based payment by results, which is akin to gain-sharing

in the US. The vast majority of share ownership schemes and over two-thirds of profit-

related pay schemes cover all non-managerial employees. The percentage of employees

with these schemes exceeds the percentage of workplaces with the schemes because

larger workplaces are more likely to choose to pay workers in these ways.
                                                                                              3
       The fourth row in the table combines the three group-level performance pay

methods into an additive scale that takes the value 0 if the firm has none of these

methods, 1 if it has one, 2 if it has two, and 3 if it has all three methods. It shows that

half the firms have at least one scheme and that 62% of workers are covered by at least

one scheme. Shared capitalism is, from this metric, as much part and parcel of the British

capitalist economy as it is of the American economy.

       The last row of the table gives the proportion of workplaces and employees who

receive variable pay as individuals either through pay for performance or through merit

pay. We treat these modes of payment separately because the “sharing” is related to

individual performance as opposed to group performance and is thus more akin to piece

rate pay than profit-sharing.1

       The second reason for examining shared capitalism in the UK is that the amount

and nature of shared capitalist arrangements have changed over time. Profit-related pay

and share-ownership schemes grew in the 1980s, spurred by government tax incentives.

Data from Bryson, Pendleton, and Whitfield (2008, tables 5 and 6) on workplaces with

25 employees or more show that the proportion of private sector workplaces with some

shared capitalist scheme increased from 40% in 1984 to 63% in 2004. The proportion of

firms having profit-related pay increased from 19% to 44%, the proportion having group

pay for performance increased from 15% to 25%, and the proportion having employee

ownership increased from 22% to 28%.




1
  Factor analyses of the five types of performance pay – individual payments-by-results,
merit pay, group payments-by-results, share ownership and profit-related pay – identified
two factors with eigen values above 1. Share ownership and profit-related pay load
together, as do individual payments-by-results and merit pay. Group-level payments-by-
results had a lower loading which was pretty similar across the two factors.
                                                                                           4
          The third reason is that the UK government has encouraged shared capitalist

modes of pay with favorable tax treatment over time. In the 1980s the Conservative

government gave tax advantages to profit-related pay. Since 1997 the Labour

government has given tax advantages to share ownership schemes at the expense of

profit-related pay schemes, which became fully taxable.2 Unlike the US, which gives tax

breaks for collective ownership of shares through ESOPs, the UK gives breaks for

individual share ownership. HM Revenue & Customs estimates that for 2002-2003 the

Treasury spent about £800 million in tax relief per annum on these schemes (Oxera,

2007a, p. 3). To see whether this is justifiable the Treasury commissioned an extensive

econometric study of the impacts of shared capitalism on productivity (Oxera, 2007a,

2007b), whose findings we compare with ours shortly.

          Our analyses uses linked employer-employee data from the British 2004

Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS) 3 to estimate the impact of shared

capitalism on productivity and to assess some of the mechanisms by which it produces

different outcomes at different workplaces. The 2004 WERS provides cross-sectional

information on some 1500 private sector workplaces obtained from HR managers and

from employees working in those workplaces. With the survey weights used throughout

results are nationally representative of workplaces with 5 or more employees in Britain.

          We find that:

          1) Different forms of shared capitalist pay complement each other in the sense

that firms are more likely to have them in combinations than if they chose forms of pay

independently.

       2) Firms change modes of compensation frequently, with some adopting

schemes and others eliminating them so that the gross changes in schemes are far more

numerous than the net changes.

       3) Shared capitalist pay is positively associated with other forms of pay and

workplace arrangements: individual payment by results, employer reports of devolving

decision-making to employees, using subjective appraisals of worker performance,

monitoring of outputs, and reduced monitoring of workers.

       4) Firms with shared capitalist pay, particularly with share ownership schemes,

have higher labor productivity than firms without such forms of pay. The impacts of

shared capitalism on productivity are larger when the firm combines several schemes.

Conceptual Issues

       The traditional rationale for shared capitalist pay is that it aligns worker and

employer objectives in maximizing output. To do this, shared capitalism must overcome

free-rider problems associated with any group incentive system and deal with the fact that

virtually any contingent pay, including piece rates for individuals, gives incentives for

some forms of desirable behavior but not for other forms.4 Principal/agent problems are

ubiquitous in a world where contracts are necessarily incomplete.

       Shared capitalism is normally associated with certain modes of work

organization. Since firms that pay workers on the basis of firm or group performance do

so in the hope of inducing them to take actions that improve firm performance, they are

also likely to empower workers to make decisions that affect performance, particularly

4
  Annual profit-sharing bonuses may, for example, induce workers to try hard in the short
run but to neglect activities that benefit the firm over a longer horizon. Worker
ownership whose benefits do not reach workers until they retire may fail to induce
workers to try hard in the present. Piece rates or tournaments can reduce cooperation and
the sharing of knowledge at workplaces and even induce one worker to sabotage a rival.
                                                                                           6
where the employee has private information about the production process. Group

incentive pay may also be used as an incentive for workers to share their knowledge

about the production process with other workers and the employer (Levine and Tyson,

1990; Jones, 1987).

       By contrast, giving workers greater decision-making power absent financial

incentives might adversely affect motivation (Ben-Avner and Jones, 1995): “they want

me to do more without paying me more”. And giving shared capitalist pay without

greater decision-making power may also fail to affect productivity: “they are making my

income risky by varying my pay with performance without giving me autonomy to raise

performance”.

       Shared capitalist modes of pay should also be associated with a shift in

management monitoring from watching what workers do to monitoring their final

products. When the firm cannot readily observe effort but can monitor outputs, incentive

pay related to outputs will motivate effort, substituting for monitoring effort. By contrast,

when the firm finds it easier to monitor workers than to monitor output, we would expect

the firm to use straight-time pay.5 Indeed, Frederick Taylor viewed output-based pay as a

mechanism for the avoidance of shirking.6 The advent of ICT-based monitoring,

including on-line monitoring, electronic point-of-sale equipment and electronic time




5
  Daniel and Millward argue (1983: 205): “Traditionally the purpose of PBR systems of
pay has been to encourage workers to increase effort and output….In practice….there has
been a tendency for PBR to become more an instrument of management control designed
to ensure consistency of output.”
6
  Gallie et al. (1998) show that control of workers through close supervision, pay
incentives and appraisal systems all grew in Britain in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
                                                                                           7
recording gave management new tools to monitor previously difficult-to-monitor jobs

and output, potentially making this interaction more important than in the past.7

       Some analysts view individual pay for performance as the polar opposite of group

incentive pay. Individual pay for performance is a form of piece rate that induces

employees to improve their personal output (and maybe to sabotage the output of others

if that might improve their chances for a promotion) whereas group pay induces them to

work cooperatively with others. Either you work for yourself or you work for the group.

Under some conditions, the two forms of pay may indeed be antithetical but under others

individual pay for performance can complement group incentive pay. Consider a situation

in which maximizing output and profits requires that workers do their own work and also

help others. In this case management will need two instruments to induce workers to

spend some time working on their own and some time working cooperatively. Just as

profit-seeking managements mix imperfect objective measures of performance with

subjective evaluation (Baker, Gibbons, Murphy, 1994), management could mix pay for

individual performance and pay for group performance to induce workers to undertake

both activities. Management could even use individual pay for performance as a tool

against the temptation to free-ride on the group.

       The most far-reaching hypothesis in recent analyses of the effect of human

resource management on productivity and labor practices is the ‘complementarities

thesis’ that advanced labor practices work most effectively when bundled together into a

consistent high-performance workplace (Ichniowski et al, 1996; Pil and MacDuffie,

7
  White et al. (2004: 100) estimated that in 2002 ICT-based monitoring systems were
‘already covering around half the workforce and appear to be spreading rapidly’. Half of
the workplaces with ICT monitoring were using it to evaluate individuals (op. cit., 96).
                                                                                           8
1996). This hypothesis implies that firms should adopt shared capitalist modes of pay

and complementary forms of work organization as a package rather than introducing

them individually. Some analysts go further and link shared capitalism with the firm’s

competitive strategy (Huselid, 1995; Schuler and Jackson, 1987). They argue that firms

that compete on the basis of the quality of output should be more attuned to group

incentives than firms that compete on the basis of low cost of generic output, where piece

rates might be more effective.

       We examine the notion that shared capitalist modes of pay and work organization

has important complementarities in two ways.

       First, we test whether firms choose combinations of pay schemes in proportions

that diverge from what we would expect had they chosen them as independent draws

from separate urns. Under the null hypothesis, if 50% of firms have profit sharing and

50% have employee share ownership, the proportion of firms with both profit-sharing

and employee ownership would be 25%. If the complementary hypothesis is correct, the

proportion of firms with both practices would exceed 25%, whereas if the forms are

substitutes, the proportion with both practices would fall short of 25%. Using a

regression design, we also examine whether individual pay for results, managerial

monitoring, and worker decision-making are related to shared capitalist modes of pay,

other factors held fixed. If the complementary hypothesis is correct, the shared capitalist

practices should have positive effects on worker-friendly practices and negative effects

on hierarchical control practices

       Second, we follow the bulk of the complementary literature by estimating

production functions that relate output to inputs, including modes of compensation, and

test for complementary relations among modes of compensation. If the complementary
                                                                                             9
hypothesis is correct, shared capitalist practices X and Z will have greater effects on

output when they operate together than when they operate separately. This implies that

the regression coefficient on interaction terms such as their product XZ should be

positive.

       As with other production function models, without identifiably exogenous

variation in input variables – in this case shared capitalist pay as well as capital and labor

inputs - the regression results are best interpreted as reflecting associations among

endogenous variables. Depending on the heterogeneity among firms, moreover, the

associations could be affected by selectivity and thus differ from the associations we

would get from randomly assigning compensation and practices among firms. Still, our

two-part analysis -- looking for complementary links in the combinations of shared

capitalist modes of pay and looking for such links in production functions -- provides a

stronger test of the hypothesized positive effect of shared capitalism on outputs than

would analysis of either combinations or production functions separately.

Combinations of Practices

       Figure 1 uses a Venn diagram to display the incidence of combinations of profit-

related pay, share ownership, and group-based incentives in private sector workplaces

with 5 or more employees in the WERS 2004 data. Our test of complementarity in these

data compares those proportions with the proportions that would result if the firm

selected practices independently on the basis of the proportion in the entire sample. The

bottom part of the figure gives the actual incidence of each element in the diagram and

the incidence we would expect from the binomial distribution of independent draws

based on the proportion of each mode in the population. Half of the workplaces have no

group-based incentive payments, which is statistically significantly different from the
                                                                                          10
39% predicted from the independent hypothesis. Twenty-seven percent had one

scheme compared to 43.5% predicted to have a single scheme; 17% of workplaces had

two schemes, which is close to the 15.5% predicted to have two schemes, but 6.2% had

all three schemes, which is over three times the 1.7% predicted to have three schemes.

Thus, there were more workplaces at the extremes of the distribution than predicted – the

sign of complementarity.

       Using the 1984 Workplace Industrial Relations Survey, which surveyed

workplaces with 25 or more employees, we made similar computations for that year.

These data show a pattern that is similar to that in 2004, albeit with much lower levels of

the use of the various schemes. In 1984 59.5% of workplaces had no form of shared

capitalist pay compared to a predicted level of 52.9%; 25.3% had one form of the pay

compared to a predicted 36.6% whereas 13.7% had two such forms compared to a

predicted 9.2% while 1.4% had three such forms compared to a predicted 0.7%. More

workplaces had 2 or 3 forms of shared capitalist pay and more had 0 forms of shared

capitalist pay than predicted. In sum, the calculations for 1984 as well as for 2004 reject

the null hypothesis that workplaces select shared capitalist modes of compensation

independently in favor of the complementary hypothesis.

Changes in modes of pay

       The 2004 WERS Panel provides panel data on a random sub-set of a nationally

representative sample of workplaces with 10 or more employees that the survey

interviewed in 1998. The longitudinal file allows us to examine changes in shared

capitalist modes of compensation over time. Rows 1 and 2 of Table 2 record the

incidence of different schemes in the panel data in 1998 and 2004. We differentiate the

deferred profit-related pay systems from the others to highlight the fact that the incidence
                                                                                           11
of profit-related pay declined due to the cessation of the tax advantage given to

deferred profit-related pay schemes. The percentage with other profit-related schemes

remained constant at 42 per cent; the percentage of workplaces with employee share

ownership schemes also remained stable, so that the primary increase in shared capitalist

modes of compensation occurred through a 10 percentage point increase in group

payments by results. The net change figures in row 3 show rather modest changes in the

overall distribution.

       But the part of the table labeled changes in distribution shows that beneath the

stability in the non-deferred PRP schemes and in the employee share ownership schemes

there is considerable switching among schemes by workplaces. Underlying the 42%

constant proportion of workplaces with profit-related pay exclusive of the deferred

schemes are shifts in nearly one-third of the workplaces: 15 per cent of workplaces

adopted profit-related pay while 15 percent ended schemes other than the deferred ones

that lost tax privileges. Similarly, underlying the 20% constant percentage of workplaces

with Employee Share Ownership Schemes is a change in 19 per cent of workplaces.

Even the group payments-by-results, which increased by 10 percentage points from 1998

to 2004, show a gross change of 27 percentage points.

       How should we interpret this huge difference between net and gross changes?

One interpretation of the high amount of switching is that it reflects experimentation on

the part of employers in search of the best arrangements. Another interpretation is that

firms change practices because the optimal compensation system changes, perhaps

because what matters to employers is the ‘newness’ of a scheme rather than the attributes

of a particular payment method. Whichever interpretation is right, it would seem that

these changes are not major overhauls in employer practices, implying that the treatments
                                                                                          12
and the inputs required to maintain them are unlikely to be large – that is, switching

costs are low.

        To see how the shifts in programs among workplaces might work themselves out

in the long run, we have applied Markov chain analysis to the 1998-2004 panel data.

Specifically we organized the data into transition matrices whose elements are the

probabilities of moving from a given combination of practices to other combinations and,

on the assumption that the transition probabilities are constant, estimated the equilibrium

or steady state distribution of practices.

        Table 3 records our results. Panel A defines the state variables simply as the

number of shared capitalist pay programs at a workplace. Since there are four possible

states, from 0 to 3 programs, the transition matrix is 4 by 4. We raised the matrix to the

power 2000 to obtain the steady state distribution. The columns labeled 1998 and 2004

give the proportion of workplaces with the specified numbers of programs in each year,

while the column labeled equilibrium is our estimated steady state distribution. It

“predicts” that the number of workplaces with 2-3 programs will rise while the numbers

with 1 program will remain nearly constant, so that shared capitalism will increase

gradually over time. Panel B defines the state variables as each of the combinations in

our Venn diagram. Since in this case there are eight possible states, the transition matrix

is 8 by 8. The calculations here tell a similar but more detailed story about change. The

Markov analysis predicts a drop in the proportion of workplaces with only ESOS in

contrast to the increase in that proportion from 1998 to 2004 and an increase in the

proportion with ESOS and profit-related pay in contrast to the decrease in that proportion

form 1998 to 2004.
                                                                                               13
          Consistent with the analysis of the 2004 patterns in Figure 1, the analysis of the

panel data supports the complementarity hypothesis, with the number of workplaces

having all three programs and the number expected to have more in the future exceeding

the number that would be found if firms selected the modes of compensation

independently.

Relation to other workplace practices

          To examine the relation between shared capitalism and other workplace policies

and practices – individual payment by result, worker autonomy, and managerial

monitoring of work activity, outputs, and appraisals -- we use a linear regression model.

The dependent variables in the regression are the measures of workplace policies and

practices. The key independent variables are the forms of shared capitalist

compensation.8 The regressions hold fixed factors such as industry, size of the

workplace, size of firm and the like.

          Table 4 presents the regression coefficients on dummy variables for employee

stock ownership, group payment by results, and profit-related pay; and on dummy

variables for the seven independent categories in the Venn diagram.

          The dependent variable in columns 1 and 2 is a dichotomous measure of whether

workers receive individual payment by results (see Appendix). The estimated

coefficients show that individual pay by results is more likely in the presence of shared

capitalist pay than otherwise. In column 1 the biggest effects occur for group payment by

results, indicating that these two forms of compensation are very closely linked. In

column 2 the largest coefficient occurs when workplaces have all three forms of shared

capitalist pay. These results suggest that, as argued, individual and group payment for

8
    Results were not sensitive to the use of probit or ordered probit estimation.
                                                                                                14
results are complements, though we have no reliable way with the WERS data to

determine whether firms with the two modes of pay are in fact choosing the optimal

levels.

          The dependent variable in columns 3 and 4 is merit pay, which is based on a

subjective assessment of individual performance by a supervisor or manager. Again,

there are indications of a positive association with share capitalism, but in this case it is

confined to an association with profit-related pay.

          Columns 5 and 6 measure employee autonomy in decision-making as reported by

human resource managers in response to a question regarding “the extent to which you

would say that individuals in the largest occupational group: have variety in their work,

discretion over how they do their work, control over the pace at which they work,

involvement in decisions over how their work is organized?” The responses have a four

point scale (“a lot, some, a little, none”), from which we formed a summated rating that

went from 0 (‘none’ on all four items) to 12 (‘a lot’ on all four items).9 Ten per cent of

workplaces scored less than 5 on this scale, 47 per cent scored 5-8 and 44 per cent scored

9 or more.

          The regression coefficients show modestly greater autonomy for worker decision-

making in the presence of shared capitalist pay than otherwise, with the primary impact

coming through profit-related pay in column 5 and the combination of profit-related-pay

and group payment for results in column 6. While it is dangerous to compare results from

different surveys across countries, the link between shared capitalist pay and employee

decision-making seems weaker in the UK than in the US.10

       The dependent variable in columns 7 and 8 measures the extent of managerial

monitoring of worker inputs. It is based on responses to questions about whether

workplaces used managers or supervisors to monitor the quality of work, whether

supervisors have the power to dismiss workers, and whether workplaces have a high

percentage (20%+) of supervisors among their employees, and on whether the firm

reports that employees monitor the quality of their own output (in which case a point is

deducted from this scale). This variable is scaled from 0 to 4 (see footnote to the table

for details). The regression coefficients show that share capitalism is not significantly

associated with managerial monitoring of worker inputs.

       The dependent variable in columns 9 and 10 is a measure of employer monitoring

of outputs. It is based on questions regarding the use of inspectors in separate

departments, customer surveys, keeping records of faults and complaints, and the use of

records to monitor labor productivity targets. This variable is scaled from 0 to 4. The

regression coefficients show that shared capitalist pay is strongly associated with more

managerial monitoring of outputs, with employee share schemes having the largest

impact in column 9 and the presence of all three schemes or the combination of share

schemes and group payments-by-results having the largest impact in column 10.

   As an alternative measure, we also examined employee responses to an analogous
question: “In general, how much influence do you have over the following….What tasks
you do in your job, the pace at which you work, how you do your work, the order in
which you carry out tasks, the time you start or finish your working day?” with responses
coded using an additive scale comparable to that used for employers. Because there were
five questions the scale ran from (0, 15). This variable was unrelated to shared capitalist
modes of pay.
                                                                                              16
           Finally, columns 11 and 12 examine the relation between employer use of

appraisal systems of how workers are doing and shared capitalist pay. The measure of

appraisal is an additive scale based on whether the firm appraises all non-managerial

staff, if appraisals occur half-yearly or quarterly, and if non-managerial pay is linked to

performance appraisal. This variable is scaled from 0 to 3. The positive regression

coefficient on the share ownership dummy variable in column 11 shows that workplaces

with shared ownership modes of pay do more appraisal of employees than other

workplaces. In column 12 the message is similar with large coefficients on the

interaction relating to workplaces that have stock ownership and on the coefficient on the

‘only share ownership’ dummy variable.

           The associations between shared capitalist compensation and the other policies

and practices shown in these regressions do not tell us how management coordinates the

various pay schemes to form a coherent working environment but they do support the

notion that shared capitalist arrangements work best in conjunction with other

innovations in the employment relationship consistent with the model we sketched out

earlier.

Basic productivity relations

           ‘Share ownership offers employees a real stake in their company…encourage(s)

the new enterprise culture of team work in which everyone contributes and everyone

benefits from success… Employee share ownership has a contribution to make towards

increasing Britain’s productivity.” (HM Treasury, 1998: 1-2)

           To see how shared capitalist modes of pay affect productivity we estimate

production functions. We have three measures of productivity. The first measure is an

index based on the responses of human resource managers to the question: ‘Compared
                                                                                             17
with other establishments in the same industry how would you assess your workplace’s

labor productivity?’ Responses are ordered in a five-point scale from ‘a lot better than

average’ to ‘a lot below average’. Of the 1,512 human resource managers who answered

this question in the 2004 WERS, 6% thought their workplace’s productivity was either

‘below’ or ‘a lot below average’11, 42% thought it was ‘average’, 42% thought it was

‘better than average’ and 10% described it as ‘a lot above average’. Most British studies

of the effect of modes of compensation on productivity have used questions of this form

in their analyses.12

          We supplement this measure with two accounting measures collected in the 2004

WERS by a Financial Performance Questionnaire: gross output per worker (the ratio of

total value of sales of goods and services over the past year to total employment); and

gross value-added per worker (the ratio of total sales minus the total value of purchases

of goods, materials and services divided by total employment). 13 These measures are

correlated with one another at 0.39. But they are not correlated with manager reports of

productivity relative to the industry average, suggesting that the financial performance

questionnaire and human resource manager reports on productivity contain different

information about the workplace.

          Given these three measures, our first inclination was to give more weight to the

accounting measures in our productivity analysis. The accounting measures underlie

standard production function regressions and are more objective than the management


11
 We collapsed the responses ‘a lot below’ and ‘below average’ into a single category
due to the small number of responses in that part of the distribution.

     Kersley et al. (2006: 287-289) compare alternative productivity measures.
13
  The FPQ questionnaire is: www.wers2004.info/wers2004/crosssection.php#fpq. Chaplin et al.
(2005) describe the data and administration of the questionnaire.
                                                                                          18
reports. But we quickly learned that the accounting measures have problems. Only 47

percent of workplaces participating in WERS responded to the financial performance

questions, and some responses were such large outliers that we dropped them from the

analysis.14 After trimming the top and bottom 2.5 percent of values, we had valid data for

586 workplaces for productivity measured as sales per employee and for 524 workplaces

for productivity measured as value-added per employee.15 This reduced our sample by

about 60%. We will give roughly equal weight to the three estimates in our assessment

of the effects of shared capitalism on productivity.

       Table 5 gives the coefficients for the association between the three measures of

productivity and the incidence and intensity of shared capitalist pay in terms of the

proportion of workers covered. All models are run with sampling weights that are the

inverse of the probability of sample selection. The weights for the models that use the

financial performance questionnaire data also adjust for non-response, as described in

Chaplin et al. (2005). We use a robust estimator to account for heteroskedasticity. The

coefficients in models (1) and (2) are from ordered probits for the subjective measure of

labor productivity relative to the industry average. The coefficients in models (3) and (4)

and in models (5) and (6) are from linear regression models for log sales per employee

and log value added per employee, respectively.

       The odd-numbered columns give the results for the incidence of shared capitalist

forms of pay. They show share ownership schemes are positively associated with labor

productivity on all three productivity measures while neither profit-related pay nor group

14
   Most of the data relate to an accounting period ending in 2004, with some data relating
to a period ending in 2003. Where data did not relate to a full calendar year we adjusted
accordingly.
15
  The estimation samples are a little lower because we dropped a few observations with
missing dependent variables.
                                                                                          19
pay for performance have any noticeable relation to productivity. The even-numbered

columns give the results when the measure of shared capitalist pay considers the

coverage of the pay system – whether it includes all workers or just management and

perhaps a select few others. They show that the stock ownership schemes that enlist all

employees raise productivity by all three of our measures, while schemes targeted at

managers only are positively associated with sales per employee. Again, the other forms

of shared capitalism have little relation to the measures of productivity.

Complementarity in production

       For our production function test of the complementarity of shared capitalist forms

of pay, we regressed each of our measures of productivity on dummy variables for the

seven independent categories in the Venn diagram. The calculations in Table 6

summarize the results. There is evidence for complementarity in the effects with each of

the measures of productivity, but the particular mixture of pay systems that have the

largest impact on productivity differs among the productivity measures.

       In the regression for managers’ perception of productivity the biggest impacts

occur when workplaces have all three forms of pay, or have employee share ownership

and profit related pay or employee ownership and group pay for benefits. This indicates

that the positive impact of share ownership found in Table 5 occurs when share

ownership is combined with profit-related pay or group pay for results.

       By contrast, in the regression in which productivity is measured by sales per

worker, the biggest impacts on productivity occur when workplaces have employee share

ownership and profit related pay or employee ownership and group pay for results.

Having share ownership by itself does better than having all the schemes together.
                                                                                           20
       The interactions are weakest in the value added regression, with the biggest

impacts occurring when workplaces combine employee share ownership with group pay

for results followed by combining it with profit-related pay.

       Finally, if we simplify the regressions by replacing the share ownership

interactions with a single dummy identifying share ownership in combination with group

payments-by-results and/or profit-related pay, the dummy is positive and significant for

all three productivity measures, confirming that combinations of share capitalism systems

which include share ownership are positively correlated with productivity, however we

measure it.16

Comparison with prior literature and Oxera-Treasury

       Our production function study follows a long line of UK analyses of the effects of

shared capitalism. Many analysts have used earlier waves of the WERS to examine the

effects of various forms of shared capitalism on manager reports of financial outcomes or

labor productivity. Some have used surveys of particular sectors with quantitative

measures of productivity such as sales or value added, often with in the order of 100

firms. Bryson and Freeman (2007) and Oxera in its analysis for the UK Treasury

(Oxera, 2007, appendix 2) summarize this work. The two reviews show that the majority

of studies find positive effects of shared capitalist pay on productivity or financial

outcomes, while some find negligible effects and virtually none find negative effects.17


16
  The coefficients and t-statistics for share capitalist bundles incorporating share
ownership are 0.492 (2.96) for managers’ assessments of productivity, 0.444 (2.12) for
sales per employee and 0.035 (2.10) for value added per employee.
17
  A count of the studies in the Oxera report shows that ten of the thirteen that estimated
the effects of profit-sharing found that it was associated with higher productivity while
seven of the ten studies that examined share ownership found that it was associated with
higher productivity.
                                                                                            21
They also find that the pay schemes that have positive effects vary across studies and

sometimes within the same study depending on the measure of outcomes or data under

analysis.

       After we completed our research, the Treasury released a study that comes as

close as we could imagine to giving a definitive analysis of the effects of tax-advantaged

modes of shared capitalism on productivity. This study has the largest sample of any

done in the UK – 16,844 firms – obtained by matching HM Revenue & Customs’

administrative data on Approved Profit Sharing systems, SAYE systems, and CSOP

systems to measures of productivity based on sales from the Financial Analysis Made

Easy (FAME) data set. In addition, the Oxera-Treasury study obtained measures of

productivity for 7,633 companies based on value added from the Annual Respondents

Database (ARD) provided by the Office of National Statistics. The Oxera-Treasury study

covered enough years and firms to permit a panel analysis with fixed effects as well as

cross section comparisons of firms with and without particular schemes.

       The results of the Oxera-Treasury study confirm the finding in our study and in

the bulk of the earlier literature that shared capitalism raises productivity. When the study

measures output by sales (p iii) “on average, across the whole sample, the effect of tax-

advantaged share schemes is significant and increases productivity by 2.5% in the long

run”. It also finds important complementarities in the effects that are consistent with our

results: “there are further benefits to be gained from operating several types of schemes”,

with gains accruing primarily to companies that have both tax advantaged and not tax-

advantaged schemes; and with large gains for the SAYE share ownership scheme.

       With its large sample size and use of panel data as well as cross section data, the

Oxera-Treasury analysis has arguably generated the strongest findings thus far on the
                                                                                           22
effects of shared capitalism in the United Kingdom. Surprisingly perhaps given the

sample size, the Oxera-Treasury study reports variation in results that resemble those in

our study and others using smaller data sets: lower estimated productivity gains when

output is measured with value added than with sales; different estimated effects across

sectors; and different estimates of which schemes matter most when output is measured

in value added than when output is measured in sales. The study notes that it lacks

information on coverage of schemes or on other business practices of firms (as in the

WERS) that could cast additional light on the impacts of the schemes.

Conclusion

       In sum, shared capitalism has grown in the UK, as it has in the US; firms use

various forms of shared capitalist pay together and often accompany them with other

labor practices, consistent with the complementary hypothesis. But firms switch among

schemes frequently, which suggests that they have trouble optimizing and that the

transactions cost of switching are relatively low. Among the single schemes, share

ownership has the clearest positive association with productivity, but its impact is largest

when firms combine it with other forms of shared capitalist pay. Given that even the large

sample Oxera-Treasury study finds sizable variation across groups, schemes, and

measures of productivity, additional studies using administrative data or the richer but

smaller WERS files are unlikely to greatly advance our knowledge of what makes shared

capitalism work in the UK. To advance our knowledge further would seem to require

studies that focus specifically on capitalist firms per the US NBER 14 firm study with

questions and case analyses directed at particular hypotheses about their operation.

   Note: n=587 private sector workplaces in WERS panel. All data are survey weighted. Last column based
   on analyses by James Mitchell, NIESR, for which we are grateful. Transition matrix A (in fact A' to ensure
   each column sums to unity) is raised to the power 2000. Since one of A's eigenvalues is unity we have an
   ergodic Markov chain and the long run forecast is thus independent of the current state.

   ensure that they sum to unity

             Notes:
             (1) INDPBR (0,1): individual payments-by-results. MERIT(0,1): merit pay. DECISION (0,12): employer perceptions of employee
             decision-making autonomy among employees in the workplace’s largest occupational group or ‘core employees’. HR managers were
             asked: “Using the scale on this card, to what extent would you say that individuals in [ TITLE OF THE LARGEST
             OCCUPATIONAL GROUP] here have variety in their work, discretion over how they do their work, control over the pace at which
             they work, involvement in decisions over how their work is organized?” The scale on the card was “a lot, some, a little, none”. An
             additive scale was created running from 0 (‘none’ on all four items) to 12 (‘a lot’ on all four items). MON IN (0,4): additive scale for
             the monitoring of worker inputs , the workplace scoring a point when the quality of employees’ work is monitored by supervisors, if
             some/all supervisors can dismiss employees for unsatisfactory performance, where 20%+ of employees are supervisors. A point is
             deducted if employees monitor the quality of their own work (co-monitoring). Finally a point is added to the scores so they range
             from 0,4 rather than -1,3. MON OUT (0,4) additive scale for monitoring outputs scoring a point when the quality of output is
             monitored through inspectors located elsewhere, through customer surveys, records of faults/complaints are kept, there are targets for
             productivity and records are kept. APPRAIS (0, 3) additive scale for appraisal systems scoring a point when all non-managerial staff
             are appraised, appraisals occur half-yearly or quarterly, and non-managerial pay is linked to performance appraisal.
             (2) All models contain following controls: firm size (3 dummies); single-workplace organization (single dummy); industry (12
             dummies); foreign owned (single dummy); workplace aged 25+ year (single dummy); recognises union for pay bargaining (2
             dummies); largest occupational group (8 dummies); has many competitors (single dummy); product market is growing (single
             dummy). In addition the INDPBR models contain controls for monitoring inputs, outputs, appraisal and decision-making; the
             decision-making models contain controls for monitoring inputs and outputs and appraisals; and the monitoring and appraisal models
             contain controls for decision-making.

Appendix: Survey Questions Used to Derive Share Capitalism Variables

The share capitalism measures are derived from the following survey questions.

Payments-by-results (PBR)

“Do any of the employees in this establishment get paid by results or receive merit pay?
On this card is an explanation of what we mean by payment by results and merit pay.”

Card reads:
1. Payment by results

‘Payment by results’ includes any method of payment where he pay is determined by the
amount done or its value, rather than just the number of hours worked. It includes
commission, and bonuses that are determined by individual, establishment or
organization productivity or performance. It does not include profit-related pay schemes.

2. Merit pay

‘Merit pay’ is related to a subjective assessment of individual performance by a
supervisor or manager.

Follow-up questions establish the occupations covered by PBR and the percentage of
non-managerial employees covered. In addition the following question establishes
whether PBR is calculated at individual, group or organization level:

“Thinking just about payment by results, what / What) measures of performance are used
to determine the amount that employees receive?”
PROBE: Which others? UNTIL 'None'.
1) Individual performance/output,
2) Group or team performance/output,
3) Workplace-based measures,
4) Organization-based measures,
5) Other measures

Profit-related pay

“Do any employees at this workplace receive profit-related payments or profit-related
bonuses?”

Follow-up questions establish the occupations covered by PRP, the percentage of non-
managerial employees covered, and the percentage in receipt of PRP payments. In
addition the following question establishes the organizational level at which PRP is
calculated if the workplace is part of a larger organization:

“For what part of your organization is the amount of profit-related pay
calculated….Workplace, Division/Subsidiary company, Organization as a whole?”
                                                                                       33
Share schemes

“Does this company operate any of the employee share schemes listed on this card for
any of the employees at this workplace?
PROBE: Which others? UNTIL 'None'.
1) Share Incentive Plan (SIP),
2)Save As You Earn (SAYE or Sharesave),
3) Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI),
4) Company Share Option Plan (CSOP),
5)Other employee share scheme,
6) None of these”

Card reads:
1 Share Incentive Plan (SIP) – a tax and NIC advantaged plan where employees can
purchase shares and companies can give employees free shares or matching shares 2 Save
As You Earn (SAYE or Sharesave) share options scheme – tax advantaged scheme where
employees save to purchase their employer’s shares.
3 Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI) - where smaller companies can grant up to a
total of £3 million of tax and NIC advantaged share options to their employees
4 Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) – where companies can grant each of their
employees up to £30,000 of tax and NIC advantaged share options
5 Other employee share scheme

Subsequent questions identify the occupations eligible for share ownership schemes and
the percentage participating in schemes.

Recent introduction of performance-related pay

Over the past two years has management here introduced any of the changes listed on this
card? PROBE: Which others? UNTIL 'None'.:
1) Introduction of performance related pay
2) Introduction or upgrading of computers
3) Introduction or upgrading of other types of new technology
4) Changes in working time arrangements
5) Changes in the organization of work
6) Changes in work techniques or procedures
7) Introduction of initiatives to involve employees
8) Introduction of technologically new or significantly improved product or service
9) None of these
