Are Reference Points Merely Lagged Beliefs Over Probabilities?

                                          ABSTRACT

What explains the mixed evidence from laboratory tests of Kőszegi and Rabin’s (2006 and later)
model of expectations-based reference-dependent preferences? We investigate one hypothesis: to
become (behavior-affecting) reference points, probability beliefs have to sink in—being merely
lagged, as the theory requires, is not sufficient. Past experiments with conflicting findings
exogenously endowed subjects with beliefs that were equally lagged, but possibly unequally
sunk-in. In four experiments, whose designs replicate past KR-nonsupporting experiments, we
add new sink-in manipulations that endow individuals with additional, visual/physical probability
impressions. Our findings are more KR-supporting in an endowment-effect setting but not in an
effort-provision setting.

1         Introduction
Kőszegi and Rabin’s (2006, 2007, 2009, henceforth KR) theory of reference-dependent pref-
erences has emerged in the past decade as a fruitful, generally applicable framework.1 It
combines the idea of loss aversion from Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) prospect theory
with an explicit, testable theory of expectations-based reference, relative to which gains and
losses are assessed. The model appears consistent with a diverse set of empirical observa-
tions, and has inspired an increasing number of theoretical applications. However, direct lab
experimental tests of key predictions of the theory have yielded mixed results. This paper
aims to investigate why.
        We focus on an important subset of the relevant evidence to date. Specifically, of the
observed phenomena that the theory holds potential to explain, two receive special attention
in KR’s first (2006) paper: the endowment effect and negative wage-elasticity of labor supply
(or effort provision).2 Perhaps naturally, the first lab experimental tests of the theory focused
on these two phenomena—and so do we.
        We investigate the endowment effect in section 2, and effort provision in section 3. As a
preparatory step, after reviewing the basic KR (2006) framework (in section 2), in each of the
two sections we first re-solve the model for one central experimental paradigm (i.e., a specific
experimental setup used in past work), corresponding with one of the two phenomena. We
then review lab evidence from these paradigms, arguing that it is rather mixed—perhaps
more mixed than has been generally appreciated. In the course of doing so, we revisit
several potential explanations, including the possibility that the theory’s predictions in these
experimental setups are not as robust (e.g., to the choice of equilibrium concept) as is
commonly believed, and the related possibility that some of these past experiments are not
as clean tests of the theory as is commonly assumed.
        We argue that the picture that emerges from these preparatory steps varies across the

Sprenger (2018).

      KR’s focus on these two phenomena is highlighted in the abstract: “Applying the model to consumer
behavior, we show that willingness to pay for a good is increasing in the expected probability of purchase
and in the expected prices conditional on purchase. In within-day labor-supply decisions, a worker is less
likely to continue work if income earned thus far is unexpectedly high, but more likely to show up as well as
continue work if expected income is high.”

two paradigms. In what has come to be called the exchange paradigm of endowment-effect
experiments, two theoretically equivalent lab setups—Ericson and Fuster (2011, henceforth
EF) and Heffetz and List (2014, henceforth HL) yielded conflicting results: the former
appears supportive of the model, while the latter does not. In what we term the table-
counting paradigm of effort-provision experiments, in contrast, clean and robust supportive
evidence has failed to materialize to date. The original supportive evidence of Abeler, Falk,
Goette, and Huffman (2011, henceforth AFGH)—the creators of this paradigm—does not
seem as clean as it appeared at first; was subsequently only weakly replicated by Camerer
et al. (2016) with a substantially larger sample; and was recently found by Gneezy, Goette,
Sprenger and Zimmermann (2017, henceforth GGSZ) to not easily generalize. We describe
these experiments, analyze the model’s predictions in each case, and argue that of all the
experimental treatments that have been conducted in this paradigm, a subset of GGSZ’s
treatments appear the cleanest implementation-wise.
   The present paper’s main contribution is to offer, and experimentally investigate, one
specific, previously understudied, hypothesis: reference points are not merely lagged
expectations, as the theory postulates; rather, they are sunk-in expectations.
We explain these terms shortly. In a nutshell, our hypothesis shifts focus away from a
merely time-based definition of reference points towards a more perceptions-based one. Im-
portantly, under this hypothesis, past experiments could generate different findings in spite
of successfully manipulating equally lagged expectations because—and to the extent that—
expectations did not sink in with subjects equally across experiments. In turn, this could
have been due to, for example, differences in experiment-specific implementation details of
the expectations manipulation (e.g., the use of language, visuals, repetition, etc.). We ex-
perimentally investigate this hypothesis in four new experiments—two per paradigm—by
adding to past experiments new treatments that are designed to directly manipulate sink-in.
   In section 2’s main part, we add new sink-in treatments to the endowment-effect experi-
mental setup of HL. We show, with two new experiments (total N = 480), that our hypothesis
holds promise to resolve much of the apparent inconsistency across EF’s and HL’s findings.
Specifically, under the new sink-in manipulation, behavior changes in a direction consistent
with the model’s prediction, though some nuances remain regarding the choice of equilibrium


                                             3
concept.
       In section 3’s main part, we investigate the new sink-in hypothesis in the effort-provision
context.      Having argued in that section’s preparatory part that clean and robust KR-
consistent evidence in the AFGH table-counting paradigm is yet to materialize, and having
found, in section 2’s endowment-effect setup, that a new sink-in treatment can move results
to be more KR-consistent, we import the new treatment into this paradigm. We first import
a version of the new treatment that is as close as possible to the one that we used in the
endowment-effect setup. Our new experiment (N = 127), modeled after what we argue is
GGSZ’s cleanest variant, fails to yield evidence that is more consistent with KR than past
evidence in this setup, although, again, interpretations depend on the choice of equilibrium
concept. We then try what we think is a stronger sink-in treatment, tailored more closely to
the specific details of the setting, in our fourth and final experiment (N = 120). We again fail
to find that results significantly move in the KR direction. We discuss potential explanations
for the failure of this paradigm to yield clean, robust KR-consistent findings, and its contrast
with the endowment-effect exchange paradigm, in our concluding discussion in section 4.
       Two conclusions cautiously emerge from our investigation. First, our sink-in hypoth-
esis seems promising. Our endowment-effect findings suggest that the designers of future
experimental tests of the theory should pay careful attention to whether they manipulate
sunk-in expectations or merely lagged expectations. Second, the table-counting paradigm
may be problematic as a test of the theory (in concrete ways that we discuss in sections 3
and 4). Together, these two conclusions should help steer future experimental effort in what
we believe are productive directions.

       We close this introduction by elaborating on our main hypothesis: that reference points
are sunk in (rather than merely lagged ) beliefs. In KR’s theory, reference points are lagged
expectations, defined as “probabilistic beliefs . . . held in the recent past about outcomes.
. . . Specifically, a person’s reference point is her probabilistic beliefs about the relevant
consumption outcome held between the time she first focused on the decision determining
the outcome and shortly before consumption occurs.”3 KR further clarify in a footnote:
   3
    These quotes are from KR (2006), pp. 1134 and 1141. We find KR’s term “probabilistic beliefs” unnec-
essarily ambiguous: it could mean, for example, beliefs that occur with different probabilities. We prefer
(and use) the term “probability beliefs,” to more clearly convey that these are beliefs about probabilities


                                                    4
       Our theory posits that preferences depend on lagged expectations, rather than expec-
       tations contemporaneous with the time of consumption. This does not assume that
       beliefs are slow to adjust to new information or that people are unaware of the choices
       that they have just made—but that preferences do not instantaneously change when
       beliefs do. When somebody finds out five minutes ahead of time that she will for sure
       not receive a long-expected $100, she would presumably immediately adjust her expec-
       tations to the new situation, but she will still five minutes later assess not getting the
       money as a loss.

In this example, where long-held expectations are suddenly updated, a five-minute lag is
not enough for moving the reference point. But in experimental tests of the theory, a five-
minute lag is often all that subjects are given for moving their reference point. To the extent
that some such experiments find KR-consistent evidence due to having successfully caused
subjects to move their reference point, five minutes must be enough in those settings.
    Under our hypothesis, what moves the reference point is not the passage of time per se,
but some sense of internalization of, or getting used to, the new expectations—which we
refer to as sink-in. It is not inconceivable that sink-in takes as little as a few minutes in a
low-stakes, no-prior-expectations lab experiment, but takes much longer in a higher-stakes,
long-held-expectations setting.
    More generally, in the naturally occurring, real-world situations that the example illus-
trates and, more importantly, that the theory sets out to explain in the first place, time
appears to be strongly correlated with sink-in. Indeed, it is difficult to find counter examples
where time is not a great healer. But a time-based definition of reference points may cease
to be useful in lab experiments, where this naturally occurring correlation is broken down
by the very experimental design that aims at testing the theory—a design based on instant
endowment of exogenous expectations (rather than on natural emergence of expectations
over time, with experience and learning), followed by an assessment, within a few minutes,
of their effect on behavior.
    The new sink-in manipulations that we introduce in this paper are meant to strengthen
sink-in in exactly these lab situations where sink-in through the mere passage of time is not an
(i.e., a belief is simply a probability distribution over outcomes).

option. To do so, these manipulations add visual/physical probability impressions through
active engagement of subjects with repeated demonstrations of realizations of the relevant
probabilities. To the extent that they are successful, our manipulations may be helpful in
the context of other experiments. Importantly, we conduct our experiments using, to the
extent possible, existing designs of published work. We do this for reasons that are both
practical—we can pool our newly collected data with previously collected data to increase
sample size where appropriate—and substantial—we believe that puzzling past results are
best investigated by exploring experimental variations on the original designs that change
one element at a time. As we mention in section 4, we hope that future work will push these
investigations forward into new paradigms and domains that we have not yet studied.



2     The Endowment Effect (Exchange Paradigm)

2.1     The Basic KR Framework

A consumer’s utility,


                         u (c∣r) = ∑ mk (ck ) + ∑ µ(mk (ck ) − mk (rk )) ,
                                    k             k


is a function of two K-dimensional bundles, denoted by c (consumption) and r (reference).4
Utility is separable across dimensions and consists of two components. The first, “consump-
tion utility,” corresponds to standard (reference-independent) utility. The second, “gain-loss
utility,” corresponds to prospect theory’s reference-dependent utility, with µ (x) = ηx for
x > 0, and µ (x) = ηλx for x ≤ 0. The parameter η > 0 is the weight an individual attaches to
gain-loss utility, and λ > 1 is her “coefficient of loss-aversion,” quantifying by how much the
pain from a loss (relative to the reference point) is greater than the pleasure from a gain of
equal size. Both c and r can be stochastic, and individuals maximize expected utility.
    The reference r is determined endogenously, in what KR term a personal equilibrium
   4
     For a detailed exposition and discussion, see Kőszegi and Rabin (2006). Kőszegi and Rabin (2009)
generalize this basic framework and embed it within a multiple-period dynamic framework. We return to
this point in section 4, and discuss how the updated framework may affect our analysis.




                                                  6
(PE).5 It is a rational-expectations equilibrium in the following sense. Given a consumer’s
expectations regarding the state of the world—represented by a probability distribution over
choice sets—she forms expectations regarding choice outcomes—a probability distribution
over consumption bundles—by making a choice plan under each possible state. These expec-
tations over outcomes are rational in that they are consistent: a consumer who holds them
as her reference will indeed find that following through, by making the ex ante expected (=
planned) choices, maximizes her utility.
      As we will see in the next subsection, PE does not always make a sharp prediction,
as there may be multiple PE: more than one plan may be optimal to follow through once
the expectations it induces became the reference point. Therefore, KR also introduce a
refinement: “Insofar as a person is free to make any plan so long as she will follow it
through . . . she will choose her favorite plan.” This refinement, termed a preferred personal
equilibrium (PPE), is indeed just a preferred PE: when more than one PE exists, a PPE is
the one that maximizes ex ante expected utility. In other words, when an individual can
form more than one set of expectations regarding outcomes which, once her reference, is
consistent with optimal choices ex post—she will choose as her reference point the ex ante
preferred one, assuming she can.


2.2       Theoretical Predictions

To apply KR’s framework to an endowment-effect setup, consider a 2-dimensional consump-
tion bundle c = (c1 , c2 ), where c1 and c2 are consumer goods, e.g., mugs and pens. In the
beginning of an experimental session, a subject is endowed with a unit of one of the items.
The subject is immediately informed that with (positive) probability q she will be permitted,
in the end of the experiment, to exchange her endowed item for the other item. Specifically,
in the end of the experiment she will choose “keep” or “exchange,” and her choice will be
implemented with probability q; with probability 1 − q she will keep her initially endowed
item regardless of her choice.
      Assume w.l.g. that m1 (0) = m2 (0) = 0 and that the subject is initially endowed with the
bundle (1, 0). She knows that in the end of the experiment she will either choose “keep,”
  5
      For a formal definition, see section F.1 in the appendix.


                                                        7
in which case she will keep her (1, 0) bundle with certainty, or choose “exchange,” in which
case she will replace her certain bundle with the lottery {(1, 0), 1 − q; (0, 1), q}.
      We now analyze the subject’s maximization problem. Consider first a subject who, in the
beginning of the experiment, plans to choose “keep” in the end of the experiment. Accord-
ingly, she forms expectations to consume the bundle (1, 0). If in the end of the experiment she
indeed chooses “keep,” then her reference bundle (1, 0) will coincide with her consumption
bundle, and her utility—expected as well as realized—will just be m1 (1), with no gain-loss
terms. On the other hand, if in the end of the experiment she deviates by choosing “ex-
change,” then her utility will be m1 (1) with probability 1−q and m2 (1)+ηm2 (1)−ηλm1 (1)
with probability q. It is thus straightforward to show that given expectations to keep item
1, she will indeed choose “keep” as long as

                                            m1 (1)   1+η
                                       m≡          ≥      .                                      (1)
                                            m2 (1) 1 + ηλ

In other words, the choice “keep” is a PE as long as (1) holds.
      Alternatively, consider a subject who, in the beginning of the experiment, plans to choose
“exchange” in the end of the experiment. Accordingly, she forms expectations to consume
the bundle (1, 0) with probability 1 − q and the bundle (0, 1) with probability q. Given such
reference bundles, it can be shown that she will indeed choose “exchange” in the end of the
experiment as long as
                                           1 + (1 − q + qλ) η
                                     m≤                         .                                (2)
                                          1 + ((1 − q) λ + q) η
Thus, when (2) holds, the choice “exchange” is a PE.
      While (1) is independent of q, (2) is not. When q approaches 0, the RHS of (1) and (2)
coincide, and a unique PE exists: choose “keep” iff (1) (and “exchange” otherwise).6 This
result illustrates KR’s explanation of past endowment-effect findings, from lab setups where
subjects were endowed with item 1, and did not expect to be able to exchange it later (so
q ≈ 0 seems a reasonable interpretation of the setting). If η = 0 or λ = 1, the model reduces to
the standard model, which predicts that subjects will choose “keep” iff m ≥ 1; that is, they
  6
    Notice that (a) when q = 0 there is no choice to be made, and (b) the PE is unique except for the
razor’s-edge case m = 1, where both “keep” and “exchange” are a PE (and a PPE). In what follows, we
assume away such cases.


                                                  8
will choose the item with higher consumption utility. But with η > 0 and λ > 1, subjects
will choose “keep” over a wider range of the ratio m, that includes values below 1. For
example, with η = 1 and λ = 3, subjects will choose to keep item 1 as long as m > 12 . The
endowment effect will then be generated by subjects with m ∈ [ 12 , 1]; outside this interval,
subjects choose according to consumption utility.
       The model can thus explain past endowment-effect findings. But so can alternative loss-
aversion models that do not assign an explicit role to expectations; for example, models that
posit that the reference bundle is simply the endowed bundle (1, 0). To directly test the
expectations channel, KR-inspired experiments varied q across conditions. What does the
model predict for low versus high q?
                                                                                    1+η
       We start with PE. As q grows from 0, a region grows for m above             1+ηλ   where both “keep”
                                                                                                1+ηλ
and “exchange” are a PE, and when q = 1 this region stretches all the way to                     1+η .   Thus,
under PE, the model predicts the q ≈ 0 endowment effect to weakly decrease with q, and
potentially even reverse. Whether and how much it actually decreases (and even reverses)
depend on how subjects choose among two possible PE—a choice that increasingly many
subjects face as q grows.
       If subjects choose a PPE (by comparing the expected utility under either PE), then it
can be shown that they will choose the unique PPE “keep” iff (1) for q ∈ (0, 1+η(λ+1)
                                                                             2+η(λ+1) ), and
                  1−(1−q)η(λ−1)             1+η(λ+1)
“keep” iff m ≥    1+(1−q)η(λ−1)   for q ∈ [ 2+η(λ+1) , 1]. Thus, as q increases, the endowment effect is
                                                                      1+η(λ+1)
predicted to first remain constant at its q ≈ 0 level until q =       2+η(λ+1) ,   and then continuously
and monotonically weaken with q. Notice that when q reaches 1, the PPE simplifies to
“keep” iff m ≥ 1. That is, the KR model’s PPE prediction approaches the standard model’s
no-endowment-effect prediction as subjects approach a condition where they know in the
beginning of the experiment that in the end of the experiment they will be asked to choose
between the certain bundles (1, 0) and (0, 1).
       In summary, the model predicts, first, an endowment effect at low q’s regardless of which
equilibrium concept, PE or PPE, applies.7 Second, it predicts that at high q’s, the effect
   7
    The analysis above shows that while in PPE, the size of the predicted endowment effect at low q is
independent of q, in PE it does in general depend on q (and on how subjects choose a PE). But as long
as q remains relatively low, the model predicts, under reasonable assumptions, a similar endowment effect
under PE and PPE. To bound the difference, consider the extreme case where all subjects choose “exchange”
whenever it is a PE—so the PE-predicted endowment effect shrinks with q as steeply as possible. Recall that


                                                     9
should not be larger than the low-q effect; it could remain roughly constant, shrink, or
reverse—depending on how subjects choose among multiple PE. Third, if subjects choose a
PPE, then the effect would never reverse: it would remain constant as long as q is below the
         1+η(λ+1)
cutoff   2+η(λ+1) ,   then start shrinking with q, and eventually disappear at q = 1. Notice that
this cutoff can be quite high. For example, with η = 1 and λ = 3, it is q = 56 .


2.3      Past Evidence

EF (Ericson and Fuster, 2012) conducted an experiment that fits the above setting, using two
slightly different designs. In both designs, they endowed subjects with a mug, and let a coin-
                                                 1                     9
flip determine the probability—low (q =          10 )   or high (q =   10 )—with   which subjects would later
be permitted to trade the mug for a pen. In EF’s preferred, later design, the coin was visibly
flipped in front of N = 45 subjects, making it clear to subjects that their assignment into
low or high treatment was randomly determined. 77% and 43% of mug owners, respectively,
chose “keep” in the low and high treatments—a large low-high difference in a direction
consistent with subjects choosing a PPE.
    In contrast, in EF’s earlier design—which was otherwise similar to the later design—the
random assignment of N = 63 subjects into the low and high treatments was not transparent
to the subjects: “subjects were simply told that they have a 10% or 90% probability of
permitted trade, without being informed that this probability was randomly assigned.” With
this earlier design, EF found the opposite result: 38% and 71%, respectively, chose “keep”
in the low and high treatments. As EF observe, the earlier design is confounded along the
lines suggested by Plott and Zeiler (2007): if subjects do not observe that the probability
with which trade is permitted—low or high—was assigned to them at random, they may
mistakenly perceive their assigned probability as informative regarding the mug’s value. In
particular, a subject who is given an item and is allowed to trade it with only low probability,
may mistakenly infer that the endowed item is of lower value than the alternative. But the
effect reversal EF find is so dramatic that it suggests to them that the PPE-consistent
with η = 1 and λ = 3, the PE-predicted effect at q ≈ 0 is generated by subjects with m ∈ [ 21 , 1]. In comparison,
even in this boundary case, at q = 16 for example, the effect would still be generated by all subjects with
       7
m ∈ [ 11 , 1]. In what follows, we assume that the implied difference in the predicted effect is negligible.




                                                         10
effect found in the cleaner design is rather fragile, and may be easily washed out by subtle
implementation details. We return to this important point in section 3, when discussing
evidence from effort-provision experiments that are potentially confounded similarly to EF’s
early design.
       Contemporaneously with EF’s experiments, and independently of them, HL (Heffetz and
List, 2014) also conducted an exchange experiment testing KR. As we explain in detail
shortly, from the point of view of KR’s model, HL’s experiment was theoretically equivalent
to the cleaner design of EF. HL subsequently ran two additional experiments, explicitly
designed to also eliminate some implementation differences (that the theory does not specify)
between their original experiment and EF’s, eventually reaching a substantially larger sample
(N = 560) than EF’s. (We reproduce the relevant results from these two experiments in table
1, subsection 2.5 below.) However, in spite of the clean design, the theoretical equivalence,
and the elimination of some implementation differences, HL found, for the most part, a
statistically insignificant but persistent negative low-high difference. This finding’s direction
is opposite to a PPE prediction, and allows HL to reject a large PPE-consistent difference.
In particular, HL’s 95% confidence intervals—from each of their experiments separately, and
certainly when they are pooled together—always reject a 34-percentage-point difference like
that found in EF’s clean design. Of course, since HL cannot reject the null of no difference,
their finding is consistent with subjects choosing the same PE at all q values.8
       Of HL’s three experiments, the most relevant for our purposes is a condition called
“Experiment 2, More Endowment.” While it qualitatively replicates the findings from HL’s
Experiments 1 and 3, it is the simplest setup that was purposefully designed to be comparable
to EF’s setup. Briefly, it is based on a 2 × 2 experimental design, with two “assignment”
conditions (Coin-Mug vs. Coin-Pen) and two “expectations” conditions (Weak Expectations
   8
    These endowment-effect experiments follow the simple item-versus-item design of Knetsch (1989)—i.e.,
the exchange paradigm. Other endowment-effect experiments follow the more complex item-versus-money
design of Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler (1990)—i.e., the valuation paradigm—where willingness to accept
and/or willingness to pay are elicited for an endowed item. The latter include the pioneering study by Smith
(2008); Ericson and Fuster’s (2011) willingness-to-accept experiment (N = 112) with findings that support
KR’s prediction; an attempt to replicate them with a larger sample (N = 262) by Camerer et al. (2016),
with weaker KR-supportive findings (a statistically weaker (p = 0.055) effect with relative size 69% of the
original); and the recent experiments by Goette, Harms, and Sprenger (2017), who report finding tentative
support for the model, albeit with results that “are sensitive to small changes in experimental design.”




                                                    11
vs. Strong Expectations). Participants are presented with two goods, a mug and a pen,
and are asked to toss a coin which, as they subsequently learn, determines which of the two
goods is assigned to them. Participants are then told that they own the assigned item: it
“belongs to you as a gift to take home.” However, they are also told that with probability
                                                                                                    9
q they will be able to exchange their item for the other item if they want to; q =                  10   and
1
10 ,   respectively, in the Weak and Strong Expectations conditions.9 Participants are quizzed
to verify that they understand the procedure and the related probabilities—hence providing
evidence that correct probability beliefs have been established by participants. After the
quiz, participants fill out a survey whose sole purpose is to pass time, thereby providing
a (short) lag and turning said probability beliefs into lagged beliefs. Having completed
the survey, participants choose “keep” or “exchange”; are asked exit questions; have the
10%/90% uncertainty resolved; and receive their gift accordingly. (For differences between
this and HL’s other experimental conditions, see appendix E.)
       HL find that assignment affects choice: participants are more likely to keep the item
assigned to them by the coin-flip than to trade it. But opposite to the PPE prediction
and to EF’s clean finding, the effect is smaller in the Strong than in the Weak Expectations
treatment, although the difference is not statistically different from zero. In HL’s Experiment
2’s More Endowment condition, that opposite difference is 20 percentage points. Thus, HL
find no evidence of a PPE-consistent effect of expectations on choice when expectations are
implemented as merely lagged verified probability beliefs.
       Since the contrasting findings in EF’s and HL’s experiments cannot be explained within
the KR framework, one has to search for explanations outside the model. Such a search lacks,
by definition, the advantage of being guided by the theory and, importantly, the discipline
that such guidance imposes (through limiting the degrees of experimental freedom). On the
other hand, it is the only way we could think of for resolving the above empirical puzzle—of
contrasting findings in two clean, theory-equivalent settings. To avoid selective reporting of
evidence, we report the full details of all the new treatments we tried.
   9                                                                        9      1
    Recall that while EF’s experiment has two expectations treatments (q = 10 and 10 ), it has no assignment
treatments (all subjects are endowed with a mug). Thus, it is after the transparent random mug/pen
assignment in HL’s experiments—which serves a purpose similar to that of EF’s transparent random coin
flip—that HL’s design is theoretically equivalent to EF’s clean design, and that the two fit the theoretical
setup analyzed in subsection 2.2 above.


                                                    12
       Our new treatments are designed to explore the hitherto untested hypothesis that lagged
beliefs may not in themselves be sufficient for establishing a reference point. Rather, the
lagged beliefs need to be accompanied by a subjective component, through which choice
is actually affected. Simply put, said beliefs need to sink in. If this hypothesis is at least
somewhat true, then there must be something in EF’s setup whose absence in HL’s setup
could explain the different findings. HL present evidence that the missing component could
not have been mere understanding of the instructions, of the experimental procedures, or
of the actual probability distributions faced by individuals. The missing component could,
however, have been emotional sink-in that could have resulted from EF’s procedures. As
detailed in EF’s Experimental Methods appendix, these included (a) written instructions
on the computer screen, with subjects stepping through each line individually; (b) verbal
instructions read by the experimenter to the entire room; and (c) graphical instructions on
the computer screen. In contrast, HL’s procedures included only written instructions on
paper (with no graphics). Our new experiments investigate the idea of the missing sink-in
component by adding to HL’s experiment a new treatment, designed to directly increase (or
not) emotional sink-in.


2.4       New Experiments

Our first experiment was conducted at the RatioLab at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
The master document from which the experimental instructions were created is available
(translated back into English) in appendix A, along with a photo of the experimental setup.10
The instructions closely follow the instructions from the More Endowment treatment in HL’s
Experiment 2, with the following adjustments. First, minor adjustments are made to the
text for improving flow and streamlining explanations, and to the procedures for adjusting
to the different locality. For example, the university-logoed mug and pen are replaced with a
reusable water bottle and a chocolate bar. Second, the randomization procedure (involving
a random number in a sealed envelope) that determines whether to implement subjects’
  10
     As explained in what follows, yellow and purple highlights in the master document each represents a
different expectations treatment, while green and red highlights each represents a different demonstration
treatment.




                                                   13
keep/exchange choice is simplified: subjects roll a standard (six-sided) die in the end of the
experiment; the outcome can either be 4 ( 16 , or 17% chance) or not ( 56 , or 83% chance).
Thus, in the new experiment, q ∈ { 16 , 65 }.
   Third, and most importantly, we added an additional instructions page, where partici-
pants face a new demonstration-of-probabilities treatment. The new treatment is designed
to turn mere (verified) understanding of experiment-relevant probability distributions into
something that is more vividly experienced and therefore is more likely to sink in. We first
describe the new instructions page that we devised, and then explain the thinking behind
its different elements.
   Right after participants answer the two comprehension-quiz questions (see p. 3 of the
experimental instructions in the appendix) and the experimenter verifies that their answers
are indeed correct, and just before filling in the personality test (now on p. 5), the new p. 4
now opens with the text:




   Half of the participants (randomly assigned within each of the two Expectations treat-
ments) see the above version of the text. The other half see an identical version except
that “4” is replaced with “an even number” and “not 4” is replaced with “an odd number.”
Together with the rest of the new instructions page—which, as described below, is identical
across the two versions—we label the versions “1-in-6 Demo” treatment and “50-50 Demo”
treatment, respectively. This new manipulation hence extends the original 2 × 2 experimen-
tal design to a 2 × 2 × 2 design: Assignment (bottle vs. chocolate) × Expectations (weak vs.


                                                14
strong) × Demonstration (1-in-6 vs. 50-50). The new 1-in-6 Demo treatment is designed to
help probability beliefs sink in, by generating a stronger link from participants’ probability
beliefs—i.e., their mere understanding that trade will be possible with probability 1-in-6 or
5-in-6—to actual, repeated and tangible experience of probabilistic outcomes; and the new
50-50 Demo treatment is designed to be a clean control: it applies the exact same procedures
to a “neutral” distribution that is less relevant to the choice elicited in this experiment.
   In the rest of the instructions page participants are asked how many squares they colored
in red and blue; they are reminded how the outcome of a later die roll (4 vs. not 4) will
determine which item they take home; and they are asked whether the ratio between blue
squares and red squares is larger than, smaller than, or equal to the ratio between the chance
that their choice will determine which item they take home and the chance that their choice
will have no effect. The page closes with the following instructions and questions:




   As repeatedly mentioned above, the purpose of this new page-long Demonstration treat-
ment is to go some way in turning mere beliefs over distributions—those beliefs are verified
on the previous instructions page—into something that feels more real to participants, sinks
in more, and may hence have more effect on participants’ reference point—and therefore,
on their choice behavior. In the absence of a theory to guide us how to turn beliefs over


                                              15
probabilities into those hoped-for choice-relevant reference points, we looked for ideas outside
of economics. We found inspiration in the literature on teaching probabilities to children.
Aimed at helping children to develop intuitions regarding probabilities and to therefore be
able to “grasp the essence” of probability problems (see, e.g., Gage, 2012, and the references
therein), that literature discusses several classroom-ready procedures that are devised with
the purpose of turning abstract probabilities into more concrete concepts. These procedures
include, on the teacher side, using multiple representations and, in particular, using whole
numbers rather than fractions (natural frequencies rather than probabilities) and, on the
student side, building “visual impressions” of how probabilistic events unfold by recording
and tallying realizations using pens in different colors or even tangible Lego-like blocks.
   The new Demonstration treatment consists of a combination of these procedures. Con-
sider participants under the 1-in-6 treatment. First, they repeatedly engage in the physical
act of rolling the die and recording the outcome using visually contrasting colors; they may
therefore “train” themselves both in the emotional exercise of hoping for a certain outcome
and comparing it with an actual realization and in the experience of glancing over a vivid
graphic that conveys the history of realizations so far. Second, they tally the different out-
comes (colored squares) and are asked to compare their ratio with the ratio of probabilities
with which their choice vs. the initial coin-flip would determine their take-home item; an-
swering this question requires them to spend some time thinking about said realizations
graphic in the context of the odds related to their actual take-home gift. Third, participants
choose words ranging from “No chance at all” to “Completely certain” for expressing their
“subjective feelings regarding probabilities”; the six questions, in which participants con-
struct statements about their own prospects (e.g., “If I choose ‘Keep,’ . . . the chance that I
will take home. . . ”), are aimed at further linking the above physical, visual, and emotional
experiences with the beliefs over probabilities that were verified on the previous instructions
page.
   At the same time, participants under the 50-50 treatment also go through the same
procedures (rolling, coloring, tallying, etc.). But they are being “trained” in grasping the
essence of a simple probability distribution that is not closely related to their probability
beliefs pertinent to the decision problem faced in this experiment. Of course, said procedures


                                              16
could themselves directly affect behavior, including by having some residual effect on sink-in,
or merely by extending the time lag between forming expectations and making a choice. The
original 2 × 2 (no-demonstration) design is therefore an alternative, or an additional, control.
Indeed, we had no strong priors, prior to collecting the data, on where in the conceptual
span between the original design and the new 1-in-6 treatment we should think of the new
50-50 treatment as placed.
       More generally, our combination of the above elements into a Demonstration treatment
was based to a large extent on our intuition and on feedback from colleagues, rather than on
a formal model. Hence, prior to collecting data, we considered our Demonstration treatment
an exploration of ideas rather than an ultimate test of some formal model of sink-in, and
we acknowledged that a finding that the treatment has no detectable effect on choice or,
alternatively, a very large such effect, should be viewed as the result of a joint test of our
ideas (including our sink-in hypothesis), intuitions regarding procedures, and—as always—
somewhat arbitrary implementation details.
       Shortly after our first experiment, we conducted a second experiment at a different facility
of the RatioLab. It was aimed as a replication attempt of the new 1-in-6-Demo treatment.
Its instructions and procedures closely follow that treatment in the first experiment, with
the following arguably modest modifications that, we hoped, would slightly improve the
experimental design (an English translation of the master document is available in appendix
B, along with a photo of the experimental setup). First, we rearranged the questions at
the bottom part of p. 4—the Demonstration treatment page—in a way that was meant
to streamline flow and improve readability.11 We made this change because an analysis of
response patterns in the first experiment suggested that the original flow may have been
unnecessarily confusing to some subjects.12 Second, we modified the opening sentence on
  11
      Recall, the Demonstration treatment page (which opens with the text reproduced on p. 14 above) asks
subjects to roll a die 18 times, color a box blue when the die shows 4 and red otherwise, tally the colored
boxes, and answer questions aimed at further linking these physical, visual, and emotional experiences with
the probability beliefs that are relevant to the experiment. Our rearranging of the questions consisted of
eliminating a question about probability ratio, clarifying a reminder about experimental procedures and
moving it closer to the relevant questions, and boldfacing “keep” and “exchange” to improve readability.
   12
      We report this analysis in appendix G, and show that the revised flow in Study 2 indeed seems to
improve on the original flow, with little to no evidence suggesting confusion regarding the demonstration-
page questions in Study 2. (When reporting Study 1’s results below, we also report them for the subsample
of subjects that excludes those whose response patterns may suggest confusion.)



                                                    17
p. 6—the choice-elicitation page—from “You will shortly roll a die to determine whether
you can choose to exchange the item you own.” to “You will shortly roll a die to determine
whether your choice, which you will make on this page, will determine which item you will
take home with you.” This modification was aimed at reducing the possibility of a demand
effect due to potentially implying that choosing “exchange” is desirable. Third, we made
a few modifications to the rest of the instructions after the choice-elicitation page; these
modifications could therefore not affect choice.13


2.5       Results

269 subjects participated in the first experiment (Study 1). It ran from March 28 to May
18, 2016, in 19 sessions with estimated average and median duration of 38 minutes.14 An
additional 211 subjects participated in our follow-up, second experiment (Study 2), which
was conducted from May 26 to June 16, 2016, in 15 sessions with average and median
duration of 38 and 37 minutes, respectively.15 Of the 269 and 211 participants in the two
experiments, respectively, 246 (91.4%) and 196 (92.9%) answered the two comprehension
questions correctly on first attempt. Our results are based on all participants; as a robustness
check, we also report results for only these correct-on-first-attempt participants.
       Table 1 presents our main results. The table’s structure is a condensed version of the
structure of HL’s tables, which in turn are modeled after Plott and Zelier’s (2007) Table 1.
       Panel A summarizes the findings from our two new experiments. We start with Study
1’s 50-50 Demo treatment. Its Weak Expectations column reports an endowment effect of
22 percentage points, driven by coin-flip assignment: while 74% of the 34 coin-bottle par-
ticipants chose to keep the bottle, only 52% of the 31 coin-chocolate participants chose to
exchange the chocolate for a bottle. The effect is sizable but not statistically strong (two
  13
     Most notably, we added new post-choice statements to the exit questionnaire on p. 7 of the instructions
(see appendix B). These were meat to explore new ideas for future research.
  14
     Exact start/end time was not recorded in six of the sessions. Each session included 12–16 partici-
pants, seated in cubicles in one or two lab rooms (with 4–12 participants per room). Within each room,
the four Expectations×Demonstration treatments were preassigned to alternating cubicles (unbeknown to
participants). 40% of the participants were male.
  15
     Each session included 8–19 participants, seated in cubicles in one lab room (located on a different campus
relative to the first experiment); the two expectations treatments were preassigned to alternating cubicles.
Excluding 4 participants who entered conflicting gender data, 57% of the participants were male.

sample, two-sided equality-of-proportions test p-value = 0.07). Next, the Strong Expectations
column of Study 1’s 50-50 Demo treatment shows that once coin-flip assignment determines
final consumption with 5-in-6 rather than 1-in-6 probability, said endowment effect shrinks
to 0 (p = 0.98), as 62% of both coin-bottle and coin-chocolate participants choose the bottle.
While we cannot statistically reject equality of the effect across the two expectations treat-
ments, we note that the direction of change of the effect (from 22% to 0%) is inconsistent
with a PE (or a PPE).16
       This finding from our 50-50 Demo treatments qualitatively replicates HL’s results from
the comparable no-demonstration treatments on which our experimental design is based.
Panel B summarizes these results (reproduced from HL’s tables 2 and 3). In the comparable
treatment in HL’s Study 2 an endowment effect of 31 percentage points (p = 0.01) shrinks
to 11 points (p = 0.40), and in HL’s Study 3 an effect of 16 points (p = 0.08) shrinks to 8
points (p = 0.40).17 While we again lack the power to reject equality of the effect across the
Weak and Strong treatments, the picture that emerges across the three experiments is rather
consistent. Taken together, the data are suggestive of a mechanism that affects choice in a
direction weakly opposite to KR’s PE and PPE predictions. Of course, the KR mechanism
may also be at play; however, our results suggest that in HL’s no-demonstration setup and
in our 50-50 Demo setup, that opposite mechanism—whatever it may be—has a consistently
stronger effect.
       The picture changes dramatically when switching from 50-50 Demo (or no demonstra-
tion) to 1-in-6 Demo, as shown in the rightmost two columns of panel A, Study 1. Now,
under Weak Expectations there is no endowment effect—indeed, the table shows an insignif-
icant “anti-endowment” difference of −6 percentage points (p = 0.60)—while under Strong
  16
     As summarized in the last paragraph of section 2.2 above, the model predicts an endowment effect at low
q’s (Strong Expectations) regardless of which equilibrium concept, PE or PPE, applies. In contrast, we find
no endowment effect (0%). At high q’s (Weak Expectations), the effect is never predicted to grow from its
low-q level; it could remain constant, shrink, or reverse—depending on how subjects choose among multiple
PE. In contrast, we find a large but not statistically strong effect (22%). Finally, if subjects choose a PPE,
the model predicts the low-q effect—which we do not find—to remain constant as q increases, and eventually
shrink once q exceeds a certain cutoff that depends on η and λ and may lie above our Low Expectations
q = 56 .
  17
     As discussed above and as reported by the q’s in Table 1, Weak and Strong Expectations in HL’s
experiments are somewhat weaker and stronger, respectively, than ours. However, the differences—1-in-10
and 9-in-10 probability of coin-flip assignment determining final consumption, relative to 1-in-6 and 5-in-6
in our experiments—may be too small to be detectable in our data.

Notes: Percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number. All p-values are from two-sample two-sided
tests of equality of proportions. Results in panel B are reproduced from Heffetz and List (2014, tables 2
and 3). A two-sided, eight-sample test of equality of diff-in-diff in proportions—testing the null of no effect
of the 1-in-6 Demo treatment—yields p = 0.04 in panel A, Study 1, and p = 0.02 in panel C.

Expectations there is a 20-point effect (p = 0.08). This 20-point effect at low q, as well
as the direction of its change relative to the higher q, are consistent with PE and PPE.
The null hypothesis that this change, from −6 to 20 points, under 1-in-6 Demo is equal
to the opposite change, from 22 to 0 points, under 50-50 Demo, is rejected with p = 0.04
(two-sided, eight-sample test of equality of difference-in-difference in proportions, reported
in table notes).18    19


       Study 2, aimed mainly to collect more data under 1-in-6 Demo (with a slightly improved
design), qualitatively replicates the relevant findings in Study 1, albeit less dramatically: a
statistically insignificant 9-point effect (p = 0.37) increases to a statistically suggestive 20-
point effect (p = 0.04) when moving from Weak to Strong Expectations—consistent with PE
and PPE.
       Panel C pools together all 822 observations from panels A and B. It thus summarizes all
the evidence we have to date from this experimental design, consolidating the 50-50 Demo
and no-demonstration treatments.
       In the pooled data, under 50-50 Demo or no demonstration, the endowment effect de-
creases from a statistically significant (p = 0.001) 21 percentage points in Weak to a not
significant (p = 0.26) 7 points in Strong Expectations, offering no support to KR’s predic-
tions. In contrast, under 1-in-6 Demo, the effect increases from 2 points (p = 0.75) in Weak
to 20 points (p = 0.008) in Strong Expectations, consistent with PE and, to some extent and
under certain parameter values, with PPE. The null that this 18-point increase is equal to
the 14-point decrease under 50-50 Demo or no demonstration is rejected with p = 0.02 (see
table notes).
       In summary, the evidence in table 1 suggests that while probability beliefs with no (or no
relevant) probability demonstration appear to impact the endowment effect in a way that
  18
      We use a Z-test. Under the null of equality of difference-in-difference in proportions, denoting each
sample’s proportion and size pi and ni , the point estimate [(p1 − p2 ) − (p√3 − p4 )] − [(p5 − p6 ) − (p7 − p8 )] is
approximately normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation Σ8i=1 pi (1 − pi )/ni .
   19
      Throughout the paper, when discussing statistical tests, we always report p-values. When using adjec-
tives to describe them, we follow the proposal in Benjamin et al. (2017) to adopt new norms that change the
conventional threshold for statistical significance. Accordingly, we reserve the term “statistically significant”
for results with p-values below 0.005, and refer as “statistically suggestive” to results with 0.005 < p < 0.05.
Our rejection, with p = 0.04, of the null that our demonstration-of-probabilities variation in Study 1 has no
effect is, therefore, statistically suggestive.

does not support KR’s predictions, probability beliefs with the relevant demonstration—
devised to increase sink-in—can reverse this finding, and impact the effect as the model
predicts.20 Appendix tables A.1 and A.2 probe the robustness of this finding by replicating
table 1 for two subsets of its 822 subjects: the 647 subjects excluding those who answered
at least one of our and HL’s probability-understanding quiz questions incorrectly on first
attempt; and the 682 subjects excluding those whose response patterns on the probability-
demonstration page may suggest confusion (see footnote 12 and the text around it). Results
in these tables move around but remain generally similar; statistical significance drops due
to smaller samples. In particular, in panel C, the effect of our new 1-in-6 Demo treatment
discussed above—an 18-point increase vs. 14-point decrease in table 1 (p = 0.02)—becomes
an 13-point increase vs. 18-point decrease in table A.1 (p = 0.04), and a 20-point increase vs.
13-point decrease in table A.2 (p = 0.03).



3      Effort Provision (Table-Counting Paradigm)

3.1     Theoretical Predictions

Consider a different 2-dimensional consumption bundle, c = (x, e), where x is money (a good)
and e is effort (a bad). A lab subject in AFGH’s (Abeler, Falk, Goette, and Huffman, 2011)
and GGSZ’s (Gneezy, Goette, Sprenger, and Zimmermann, 2017) experiments provides effort
working on a tedious and repetitive task. Her decision when to stop working is the main
                                                                                                               1
outcome of interest. She is informed at the outset that once she stops, with probability                       2

she will receive her accumulated earnings (we) according to a known piece rate (or wage)
                               1
w, and with probability        2   she will instead receive a known (possibly degenerate) lottery
  20
     The results in the pooled data in panel C under 1-in-6 Demo have another interesting implication. An
early purist interpretation of KR suggested that an appropriately minimalist notion of endowment—that
strips endowment of the expectations it typically comes with, and, importantly, of past confounds (e.g., à
la Plott and Zeiler 2007)—should not in itself generate a detectable endowment effect. As evidence to the
contrary has accumulated (e.g., by HL), this idea has mostly been abandoned. These new results may revive
a sink-in-adjusted variant of this idea. Specifically, that in panel C under 1-in-6 Demo, coin-flip assignment is
not found to cause any meaningful endowment effect (d = 2%, p = 0.75) in Weak Expectations but generates
an effect (d = 20%, p = 0.008) in Strong Expectations, is perfectly consistent with the following updated
idea: an appropriately minimalist notion of endowment—that strips endowment of the appropriately sunk-in
expectations it typically comes with, and of other past confounds—does not in itself generate a detectable
endowment effect.



                                                       22
that is independent of her effort. Specifically, she is informed that she will receive: we with
probability 21 ; a relatively high amount H with probability p ≤ 21 ; and a relatively low amount
                     1
L with probability   2   − p.
   A subject hence knows early on that she will later have to choose e and will receive
as a result the lottery (we, 21 ; H, p; L, 12 − p). AFGH and GGSZ vary H, L, or p across
treatments (we provide full details in the next subsection), and investigate subjects’ effort
choices. They derive theoretical predictions under the assumptions that mx (x) = x and that
me (e) = −c(e), c′ (e) > 0, c′′ (e) > 0. That is, utility increases linearly in money, and decreases
in effort according to a cost function c(⋅) with standard properties.
   A full analysis of a subject’s maximization problem is included in appendix F. It is
substantially more complicated than in the endowment-effect context above. There, finding
all possible PE required examining the only two possible choice plans—keep or exchange—
and, for each, considering only a single possible deviation. Similarly, finding a PPE involved
comparing at most two possible PE. In sharp contrast, in this effort-provision application
there is a continuum of possible plans e, and, for each, a continuum of possible deviations e′ .
The appendix uses two alternative approaches. First, using (rather cumbersome) algebra,
it provides a full case-by-case analysis. Then, in its last section (F.4), it shows an intuitive
graphical alternative.
   Two conclusions emerge from the analysis in the appendix. First, without characterizing
how subjects choose among PE, one could not draw conclusions regarding how a subject’s
chosen effort level changes with p. There is a range—formally, a closed interval—of effort
levels e that are PE at a given p, and while the PE range generally moves up with p, it can
do so sufficiently slowly that much of the PE range overlaps across all possible p. That is,
subjects in a low-p experimental condition may exert more, less, or equal effort relative to
subjects in a high-p condition.
   Second, if subjects choose a PPE—which we show to be unique—then effort level increases
with p for we ∈ [L, H], and is independent of p otherwise. Intuitively, since consumption
utility is linear in money—formally, mx (x) = x—and since gain-loss utility is piecewise
linear—formally, µ (x) = ηx for x > 0, and µ (x) = ηλx for x ≤ 0—the marginal benefit of
effort depends only on the cumulative probabilities of those among the reference points L


                                                23
and H that are below versus above we. (Without these assumptions, the marginal benefit
of effort would in general depend on both the probability and the distance from we of each
reference point.) These cumulative probabilities are affected by p only when L ≤ we ≤ H;
otherwise, L and H are either both above we, or both below it, with constant cumulative
probability (= 12 ) regardless of p.21


3.2       Past Evidence

In AFGH’s experiments, a subject provides effort by counting the number of zeros in tables
that consist of 150 randomly ordered zeros and ones. AFGH choose this task because (a) it is
boring, so effort can be assumed costly; (b) it is pointless (the output is clearly worthless to
the experimenter), so reciprocity towards the experimenter can be assumed away; (c) it does
not require prior knowledge and offers limited learning possibilities; and (d) performance in
it is easily measurable. To familiarize subjects with the task (so they learn their cost of effort
c(⋅) prior to forming expectations), as well as to get a measure of subjects’ performance, the
experiment contains a first, preparatory part, where subjects are introduced to the task and
work on it for four minutes for a piece rate of 10 cents per completed table.
       Having completed the first part, subjects receive instructions for the second, main part of
the experiment, introducing the experimental setup from the previous subsection. The piece
rate is w = 20 cents per correctly counted table, the lotteries are degenerate—p ∈ {0, 12 }—
and the fixed payments are L = 3e and H = 7e. Thus, a subject knows that once she
stops counting tables, with 50% chance she will receive her acquired earnings, and with 50%
  21
     In the theoretical-predictions sections of their papers, AFGH and GGSZ derive predictions using a
different equilibrium concept: choice-acclimating personal equilibrium (CPE). Introduced in Kőszegi and
Rabin (2007), CPE is meant to capture situations where one commits to a choice well in advance (“makes
a committed decision long before outcomes occur”), as in, e.g., the purchase (or not) of an insurance policy.
Since early commitment rules out the possibility of later deviation, one chooses her preferred option among
any option in the choice set—taking into account the lagged expectations that her early choice will induce—
rather than choosing a PPE among only the (more limited, and more difficult to find) set of PE.
   The analysis of CPE is, therefore, substantially more straightforward than that of PE and PPE. However,
CPE appears less relevant in this setup because subjects cannot commit well in advance to a certain amount
of effort. For this reason, we derive predictions from PE and PPE (as we do for the endowment-effect
application). We note however that a CPE analysis leads to the same qualitative conclusions above from a
PPE analysis: for we outside the interval [L, H], effort level is independent of p, while inside the interval it
increases with p. (See GGSZ’s detailed appendix for some discussion, and analysis of PE and PPE, along
with additional equilibrium concepts and alternative expectations-based reference-dependence models, e.g.,
Bell 1985, and Loomes and Sugden 1986.)



                                                      24
chance she will instead receive a known fixed payment—3e if she is in a “low” treatment; 7e
if she is in a “high” treatment. Importantly, because the lottery is degenerate, and because
subjects do not know that the other treatment exists, subjects in the 3e condition do not
imagine that they could have been in a 7e condition, and vice versa.
       As has been noted in the literature, this design is confounded: it could make the fixed
payment a natural attractor in the eyes of subjects, resulting in more effort in the 7e condi-
tion (and more bunching around 7e) independent of any KR-predicted effects. For example,
as Ericson and Fuster (2011) note in their introduction, AFGH’s effort-provision experiment
is subject to the same confound that was found in EF’s own endowment-effect experiment
to strongly affect (indeed, reverse) outcomes: “In this study, subjects are not informed that
the level of the fixed payment (high/low) is randomly assigned. As a consequence, subjects
may make (potentially mistaken) inferences from the amount of the fixed payment about
the “appropriate” amount of effort to provide, and this could contribute to the observed
treatment effect (e.g., if the fixed payment is perceived as an indication of how much the
experimenter expects participants to work).”22 While in EF’s experiment the confound of
subjects’ potential inferences is expected—and was indeed found—to move behavior in a
direction opposite to that predicted by the KR model, in AFGH’s experiment this confound
is expected to move behavior in the same direction as that predicted by the model.23
       AFGH’s main finding is that on average, subjects (N = 120) work for a longer time
(p = 0.044) and earn more money (p = 0.046) in the high (7e) treatment. The general
direction of the high-low difference is consistent with a PPE. But subsequent analysis and
data collection suggest that overall, the evidence is less supportive of the model than it
first appeared. We highlight four points. First, inconsistent with PPE (or, for that matter,
CPE; see footnote 21), some of the high-low difference is found outside the [3, 7] interval.
  22
      In an earlier draft, Ericson and Fuster (2010) add a concrete example: subjects could, for instance,
“think that the fixed payment they may receive instead of their piece rate earnings was calibrated to be close
to the piece rate earnings the average participant accumulates.”
   23
      AFGH take great care in their thoughtfully designed baseline experiment to rule out almost all other
alternative mechanisms and confounds one could think of. For example, they convincingly rule out peer
effects, social comparisons, and conformity considerations, by having subjects arrive to the experiment one
at a time (at least 20 minutes apart) and be alone in a room during the experiment. They also rule out,
by running additional clever treatments, gift-exchange motives and the worry that the fixed payment is
particularly salient.




                                                     25
Second, the main finding, i.e., the high-low difference in average earnings, did not strongly
replicate with a larger sample (N = 318) by Camerer et al. (2016), who found an insignificant
(p = 0.160) effect with relative size 36% of the original. Third, as discussed above, the
general direction of the difference is also predicted by simpler explanations, some of which
could even be considered simple “demand effect” explanations. (Moreover, such alternative
explanations may be more consistent with a difference inside as well as outside the [3, 7]
interval.) Finally, in what is arguably a cleaner design—three of GGSZ’s nine treatments
discussed below—findings are inconsistent with PPE. We now elaborate on this last point.
   In the conclusion of their paper, AFGH propose for future work a version of their ex-
periment that replaces the single fixed payment with a (nondegenerate) lottery across two
distinct fixed payments. Formally, their proposal amounts to switching from p ∈ {0, 12 } to
p ∈ (0, 12 ). The modified experiment is designed to distinguish between models where the
reference point is the mean of the expected outcomes (e.g., Bell 1985, Looms and Sugden
1986, Gul 1991) and models where the reference point is the entire distribution of expected
outcomes (e.g., KR). We note that the modified experiment is, in addition, a cleaner test of
these models: since a nondegenerate lottery means that all subjects are presented with both
L and H and may receive each with a positive probability (which differs across treatments),
any mistaken inferences from L or from H to the “appropriate” amount of effort to provide
are likely to affect subjects much more uniformly across treatments.
   GGSZ run nine different treatments. In addition to the original two treatments, which
across the Atlantic become $3 and $7, they run seven new treatments, including three that
implement the proposed (nondegenerate) lottery design. In these three treatments, L = $0,
H = $14, and p = 18 , 28 , or 83 . Any mistaken inferences by subjects from L and H are held
fixed across all subjects: in all treatments subjects are exposed to both L and H, as they
may actually receive both $0 and $14, each with at least     1
                                                             8   probability. In addition, as noted
by GGSZ, the extreme levels of L and H may make them less likely to be perceived as
informative signals regarding the appropriate amount of earnings.
   GGSZ’s findings in these three treatments are difficult to explain by any model we are
                                              1
aware of: effort sharply decreases from p =   8   to p = 82 , and then recovers in p =   3
                                                                                         8   to a little




                                                  26
above its level in p = 18 .24
       Overall, our interpretation of the data from AFGH’s and GGSZ’s effort-provision exper-
iments in this table-counting paradigm is that they do not provide clean or robust evidence
consistent with a PPE.25 Trivially, the data are consistent with PE: without specifying how
subjects select among multiple PE, the model does not rule out change in either direction
(or no change) of effort with p.
       We summarize our reading of this part of the literature as follows. AFGH’s baseline
design is confounded in a way that has been shown by EF (albeit in a different setting) to
dramatically affect behavior. In the cleaner, nondegenerate-lottery design of GGSZ, where,
from subjects’ perspective, all is held fixed other than the relative probabilities of the two
fixed payments, the evidence contrasts with any model we are aware of—expectations-based
or not. Moreover, while confounded and therefore difficult to interpret, AFGH’s baseline
findings were found substantially smaller in Camerer et al.’s (2016) replication attempt with
a substantially larger sample. (Also, GGSZ’s extension of AFGH’s treatments to additional
fixed-payment treatments show that they do not easily generalize; see footnote 24.)
       Our new experiments add sink-in manipulations to two new versions (high and low)
of GGSZ’s nondegenerate-lottery treatments. Their purpose is to investigate whether the
absence of clean and robust PPE(/CPE)-consistent evidence in the table-counting paradigm
could be explained, at least in part, by expectations not having appropriately sunk in. As
we report below, the answer appears to be negative: our new treatments do not significantly
change the above picture, as we fail to find significant high-low differences in effort. In our
concluding discussion in section 4 we discuss other potential reasons for this general absence
of clean and robust PPE(/CPE)-consistent evidence in this paradigm.
  24
      We reproduce these findings below (section 3.4, table 2, panel B). GGSZ’s other treatments effectively
repeat AFGH’s original single-fixed-payment design, with $0, $3, $7, or $14, and are therefore subject to the
original confound. The findings in these treatments, like those in the three cleaner treatments we focus on,
are also difficult to explain: effort is lower in the $3 than in the $7 treatment (as in the original experiment),
but in the $0 treatment and $14 treatment effort is roughly as high as in the $7 treatment. See GGSZ’s
figure 2.
   25
      Equally, they do not provide clean or robust evidence consistent with a CPE (see footnote 21). Of course,
the fact that GGSZ, in their cleaner (nondegenerate) implementation of this paradigm, find that subjects
respond to the probability p in any direction provides strong evidence against the standard model, where p
should not affect behavior.

3.3       New Experiments

Our first effort-provision experiment (Study 3) was conducted at the Business Simulation
Lab at Cornell University. The master document from which the experimental instructions
were created is available in appendix C, along with a photo of the experimental setup.26 As
explained in the previous subsection, the instructions come in two parts. The instructions
closely follow GGSZ’s instructions, which in turn closely follow (the English translation
of) AFGH’s instructions. We made the following adjustments. First, we increased the
show-up fee from $5 to $10 (it was 5e in AFGH). Second, we again replaced the original
randomization procedure (involving cards in two or eight sealed envelopes) with a procedure
involving a coin flip and a die roll: when a subject decides to stop working, she flips a
coin; if she flips heads, she receives her acquired earnings; if she flips tails, she rolls a die
to determine whether she receives $0 or $14, according to whether she rolls a 4 or not,
and to which experimental condition she is in. While theory invariant, this modification
serves three purposes: (a) it makes the Demonstration treatment from our endowment-effect
experiments readily importable to this setup; (b) it slightly expands the probability variation
                         1          5            1
across treatments, to    12   vs.   12   (from   8   vs. 38 ) without having to use many envelopes; and
(c) it may help to shift subjects’ focus from this unconditional probability variation to the
conditional probability variation 1-in-6 vs. 5-in-6 (conditional on flipping tails), which, due
to being twice as wide, may help make the variation feel more substantial.
       Most importantly, as in our first two experiments, we added an additional instructions
page, containing the Demonstration treatment. The additional page follows what used to
be the last instructions page in GGSZ. Thus, just after participants answer the example
questions and the experimenter verifies that their answers are indeed correct, and just before
they start the second part of the experiment on the computer, the new p. 6 opens with the
text: “You are almost ready to start the table-solving task on the screen. Before you do,
we would like to demonstrate to you the randomness of a die roll.” The rest of the page
follows closely the Demonstration-treatment page from Studies 1 and 2, with much of the
  26
    Cyan and purple highlights in the master document represent different expectations treatments, while
green and red highlights represent (as before) different demonstration treatments. The top and bottom
screenshots on page 3 of the document correspond, respectively, with the cyan and purple treatments.




                                                         28
text identical, verbatim, to the text in Study 2 (see footnote 11 above).
       Having completed the Demonstration page, participants start the second part of the
experiment on the computer screen. The experiment is implemented using the z-Tree (Fis-
chbacher 2007) code generously provided by GGSZ. We made no substantial modifications
to the code besides adjusting the wording of the on-screen reminder (of the randomization
procedure and condition) to match our modified randomization procedure (see screenshot
on p. 3 of the instructions in the appendix).27
       Study 4 was conducted three months after Study 3. Like Study 2, its main purpose was
to collect more data under a 1-in-6 Demo condition. However, in contrast with Study 2,
whose design closely followed that of Study 1 in order to probe the replicability of Study 1’s
findings, in Study 4 we aimed to create a yet stronger 1-in-6 Demo treatment in order to
stress-test Study 3’s non-findings. With this motivation, we moved Study 4’s probability-
demonstration component from the paper instructions to the computer screen. This allowed
us to adapt it to the specific randomization procedures in this experiment, creating a demon-
stration that attempts to closely simulate subjects’ coin-and-die experience. Since the setup
of Studies 3 and 4 was otherwise identical, Study 3’s instructions and photo (provided in
appendix C) remain relevant for Study 4, with only three differences. First, the blue and
red markers (in the photo) are no longer provided. Second, the probability demonstration
page (the last page of the instructions) is dropped. And third, the last sentence of the re-
maining instructions is modified to read: “After you have answered the example questions
correctly, the experimenter will start a computerized demonstration on the screen. After the
demonstration, you will start the second part of the experiment.”
       Appendix D provides screenshots of the computerized demonstration, followed by a de-
tailed step-by-step description of subjects’ experience during the demonstration. Here we
provide a brief overview. The header “This is a demonstration.” appears in bold on all
screens. An early screen introduces the die on the table as a fair die (as in Studies 1–3)
  27
     While we purposefully kept the instructions language (both on paper and on the screen) identical to
GGSZ’s wherever possible, we did change “on” to “into” in the original on-screen instruction “Please contact
the experimenter by stepping on the corridor” (this line appears only after subjects stopped working, i.e.,
after all data have been collected). On the other hand, although we noticed that the original z-Tree code
in fact considers miscounts of at most one zero (in either direction) as correct counts, we modified neither
the code nor the instructions, opting instead to keep this minor discrepancy between code and instructions,
thus keeping results as comparable as reasonably possible.

and, in addition, the coin on the table as a fair coin (unlike previous studies). The screen
explains, among other things, that “we would like to demonstrate to you the randomness of
coin flips and die rolls,” and that during the demonstration

       we will ask you to imagine that you solved different amounts of tables. For each
       amount, we will ask you to flip the coin, and if you flip tails, we will ask you to also
       roll the die. In total, we will ask you to do this twelve times, and each time you will
       enter the coin and die outcomes.

On the following screens, as subjects follow this procedure, a “Demonstration history” table
adds one column at a time, each time recording a (randomly chosen) would-be number
of tables solved, its corresponding amount of acquired earnings, the outcome of the coin
and, if relevant, the die (after subjects actually tossed or rolled them), and the amount
of money the subject would hypothetically get under the demonstrated scenario. Different
colors mark each column according to that outcome: green for acquired earnings (in both
treatments), blue or red for $0 (by treatment), and red or blue for $14 (by treatment). The
demonstration ends with three questions regarding subjects’ felt chance of each outcome.
Figure 1 reproduces an example of the final demonstration screen, with all of the subject’s
answers recorded and displayed. The average duration of Study 4’s demonstration was similar
to that of Study 3: almost 12 versus almost 13 minutes, from the end of each experiment’s
first stage to the start of its second stage.28


3.4     Results

127 subjects participated in Study 3, which ran from September 15 to October 20, 2016.29 An
additional 120 subjects participated in Study 4, which ran between January 24 and February
  28
     For completeness and comparability with Studies 1 and 2, appendix figures A.5–A.8 present, by ex-
perimental cell, the means and 95% confidence intervals, and the entire distributions, of responses on the
Probability Demonstration page (Study 3) or screens (Study 4). The figures convey no big surprises. They
suggest that, first, subjects react as expected to Demonstration condition in terms of fraction of blue squares
and, in Study 4, also of green squares. Second, subjects also respond largely as expected to the feelings-
regarding-chances questions. Finally, as in Studies 1 and 2, Demonstration condition has essentially no effect
on subjects’ responses to the feelings questions.
  29
     We had to discard 14 prior observations and restart the experiment on September 15, after discovering
and fixing a z-Tree programming error that created a mismatch between the experimental condition in the
written instructions and on the screen. We had to discard another participant who, in a session on October
12, was mistakenly handed the wrong instructions, creating a similar mismatch. These are not included in
our 127-subject sample.

23, 2017. Table 2’s panel A presents the two studies’ main findings. The six results columns
correspond to the four treatments in Study 3 followed by the two treatments in Study 4.
For comparability, each column reports the statistics that GGSZ report in their table 1: p,
N , mean, median, and S.D. In addition, the panel reports the difference (d) in acquired
earnings between each of the three High-Low pairs, and its p-value.
   We start with Study 3. Under 50-50 Demo, average acquired earnings of the 31 subjects
in Low Expectations (p =        1
                                12 )   is $5.81, compared with $6.65 for the 31 subjects in High
Expectations (p =   5
                    12 ).   The difference, d = $0.84, is in the direction predicted by KR, but is
not statistically significant (t-test p = 0.42). For comparison, panel B reports results from
the treatments in GGSZ on which our experimental design is based. It shows that the $0.84
difference we find under 50-50 Demo essentially replicates the (also not significant) $1.00
difference found by GGSZ with no probability demonstration, between their two treatments
                                         1
that are closest to ours, i.e., p =      8   and p = 83 . (For completeness and as a reminder, panel
B also shows that in another GGSZ treatment, p = 28 , that is between these two treatments,
acquired earnings are significantly lower, creating a sharp non-monotonicity that is not
predicted by any model we are aware of—including, of course, the standard model—and
that does not easily lend itself to a sink-in explanation either.) Back to panel A, the $0.84
difference between Low and High Expectations does not change much (it grows slightly,
to dc = 0.98, with pc = 0.33) in an OLS regression that linearly controls for productivity
(measured as acquired earnings in the experiment’s first part), hour of the day (10am–7pm),
school day vs. weekend/break (0/1), and female vs. male (0/1).
   The next four columns in panel A show that our 1-in-6 Demo treatments do not make
the High-Low difference (significantly) larger. In fact, in Study 3, the (still insignificant)
High-Low difference is now negative (d = −$0.56, p = 0.70; dc = −$0.97, pc = 0.48). Study
4’s computerized demonstration, where subjects experience both the coin and the die, may
have been more effective in moving the results in the KR direction: its High-Low difference
is positive and is 31–45% larger than Study 3’s difference under 50-50 Demo, but it is still
statistically insignificant (d = $1.22, p = 0.18; dc = $1.28, pc = 0.15).
   Finally, for completeness and for further increasing backward comparability, appendix
table A.3 reproduces table 2 but replaces acquired earnings with time spent working—an

4        Discussion and Conclusion
All models are wrong. Defining reference points as lagged probability beliefs may be a
useful simplification for writing an applicable theory, but in reality reference points may be
more than merely lagged beliefs. The evidence presented in this paper supports a variant of
this hypothesis in one endowment-effect context. In one effort-provision context, however,
where clean, robust evidence of reference points as lagged beliefs has previously not been
consistently found, our attempt to replace merely lagged beliefs with sunk-in beliefs does
not significantly strengthen the evidence.
       Under the sink-in hypothesis, while clean tests of the theory need to manipulate reference
points by carefully manipulating nothing but lagged probability beliefs, useful tests of the
theory need to manipulate reference points by manipulating sunk-in beliefs. Yet, the sink-in
hypothesis does not rule out the possibility that while a correct theory should define reference
points as sunk-in beliefs, a useful theory should keep defining them as lagged beliefs.30
       These questions of useful versus clean/correct theories and tests are closely related to
  30
     In other words, even if the sink-in hypothesis is correct, it does not necessarily follow that sink-in should
be explicitly incorporated into the model. Such rewriting of the model may make it a more complete and
accurate explanation of the world, but one could argue that a model should not aim for such completeness
and accuracy in the first place. While a comprehensive discussion is beyond the scope of this paper, we
note that according to this view, the KR model correctly reduces the rich, intractable, real-world concept of
expectations to the simple formal concept of lagged probability beliefs (or information regarding probability
distributions). Although in the real world probability beliefs are rarely exogenously endowed and often
emerge with experience and learning, over time, in ways that render them inherently different from endowed
probability beliefs, designing “clean” lab experiments that disentangle reference-point-relevant expectations
from mere probability beliefs to demonstrate said difference is a futile exercise. Of course the model is
incomplete—any model is an inherently incomplete rendering of reality—but it is tractable and hence useful.
While it may be useful to investigate the links between theory and evidence—and in particular, in our
context, to investigate what else, beyond lagged probability beliefs, is necessary to endow subjects with in
order to find KR-esque effects in the lab—lagged probability beliefs should be viewed merely as a useful
modeling device, and should not have been taken literally in the first place.
   In this view, rather than using our findings in this paper to change the theory (i.e., the math, or the
definitions), one should use them to clarify the link between theory and evidence, and to make sure that
when designing clean tests of the theory, the tests are made clean on some dimensions but not on those
where we already know that the theory is not (and is not meant to be) literally true.



                                                       34
another question: what is versus what is not an experimental confound. Consider Knetsch’s
(1989) first endowment-effect demonstration in his original exchange-paradigm experiment.
His subjects overwhelmingly chose to keep a randomly-assigned owned object rather than
trade it for another. But his experiment has subsequently been considered confounded, for
example due to the information considerations discussed above, demand effects, transaction
costs (the endowed item is already in subjects’ possession when they have to make a choice),
and other reasons. In the context of KR’s model, an additional potential design weakness has
been pointed out: reference points as lagged probability beliefs are not directly manipulated;
instead, subjects are simply endowed with an item, and the researcher has to infer their
expectations regarding future consumption. But under the hypothesis that expectations
have to sink in to become reference points, Knetsch’s original design, while not clean, may
be useful. Indeed, it may be more useful than the arguably cleaner designs of EF and HL:
simply endowing a subject with a mug as a gift may help expectations sink in more effectively
than carefully presenting a subject with a mug and laboriously explaining a randomization
procedure through which, with high probability, she will keep it no matter what she later
chooses. Similarly, in the effort-provision context, what we and others refer to as AFGH’s
degenerate-lottery confound may have had an effect on choices in part because it is an
effective way, if not a clean way, to make expectations sink in. (This account however
does not explain the results from the follow-up studies that replicated AFGH’s original
degenerate-lottery design.)
   While we acknowledge these possibilities, our new treatments are designed to isolate, and
directly manipulate, a sink-in component. In the endowment-effect setting, where these new
treatments are found to have an effect, it is important to also note what they do not do.
Relative to HL’s original no-demonstration findings and their qualitative replication in our
50-50 Demo condition, the 1-in-6 Demo condition does not improve (indeed, change) the
explanation of the experimental procedures or of the relevant probabilities, and, measured
by the proportion of subjects who correctly answer the quiz questions on first attempt,
it does not meaningfully improve subjects’ understanding of the procedures. In addition,
relative to the 50-50 Demo condition, the 1-in-6 Demo condition does not change the time
that passed between the outset of expectations formation and eventual choice. Finally, the


                                             35
reversal of the direction of change of the endowment effect across these two conditions rules
out a probability-weighting explanation.31
       We close this discussion with speculation regarding the failure of the effort-provision
table-counting paradigm to provide clean and robust KR-consistent evidence to date, in-
cluding under our new sink-in manipulations in Studies 3 and 4, and its contrast with our
endowment-effect findings in Studies 1 and 2.
       We start with theory. When analyzing the experimental setups and deriving theoretical
predictions in sections 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, and appendix F, we followed the original papers (i.e.,
AFGH, EF, GGSZ, HL) and used the basic framework in Kőszegi and Rabin (2006, 2007).
Kőszegi and Rabin (2009) embed this basic framework within a general multiple-period dy-
namic framework. They generalize earlier equilibrium concepts, including PPE and CPE,
and specify the assumptions under which the generalized model and its updated solution
concepts reduce to the earlier model and solution concepts, which now become special cases.
An analysis of the original experiments using this updated “news utility” framework, while
overdue, is beyond the scope of the present paper. Simply put, such analysis would embed
the less-than-hour-long experiments within the rest of subjects’ lives. In particular, it would
take into account the rational expectations, or “consumption plans,” subjects hold, upon
entering the experimental lab, regarding future consumption—i.e., consumption during the
experiment and, importantly, after leaving the lab. It would also analyze the updating of
these expectations/plans during the experiment, as subjects learn about new consumption
opportunities. Preliminary analysis suggests that the updated framework may affect predic-
tions in the effort-provision setup more than in the endowment-effect setup. One reason is
that while subjects likely have relevant expectations, upon entering the lab, regarding the
amounts of effort and money they will consume during and after the experiment, they may
have effectively no consumption plans regarding small items to be surprisingly endowed with
and possibly exchange. We cautiously speculate that a more complete analysis may therefore
provide one potential explanation for the hitherto unexplained findings in the table-counting
  31
      See, e.g., Hertwig and Erev’s “The description-experience gap in risky choice” (2009): “. . . the general
pattern can be summarized as follows: in decisions from experience, people behave as if the rare events have
less impact than they deserve according to their objective probabilities, whereas in decisions from description
people behave as if the rare events have more impact than they deserve (consistent with cumulative prospect
theory).”


                                                      36
paradigm.
   Within the special-case framework of KR (2006), as we discuss above and show in ap-
pendix F, PE and PPE are substantially more difficult to calculate in the effort-provision
than in the endowment-effect experiments. This may itself suggest, again cautiously, that the
theory may be less relevant in the specific table-counting setup, where endogenous rational-
expectations equilibria are perhaps less likely to instinctively arise. Beyond these cautions
arguments, recall that without the PPE refinement and under a wide range of parameter
values, PE does not rule out effort that increases, decreases, or remains constant with p.
Trivially, this in turn means that without specifying how individuals choose among multiple
PE, all past findings (including AFGH, Camerer et al. 2016, GGSZ, and our new Studies 3
and 4) could be accommodated. In contrast, in the endowment-effect setup, the effectively
unique PE under low q does imply nontrivial, falsifiable predictions. Specifically, it implies
an endowment effect at low q that should not increase with q—consistent with what we find
under 1-in-6 Demo in Studies 1 and 2.
   In addition to adopting the updated and generalized KR (2009) theoretical framework,
and using it to both analyze past evidence and develop new experimental paradigms, future
research could investigate further-refined variants of our still-underspecified sink-in hypoth-
esis. For example, related to the above discussion about confounds, consider the notion
that the extreme levels of L and H in a $0/$14 table-counting design may make them less
likely than in a $3/$7 design to be perceived as plausible, relevant signals regarding the
appropriate amount of earnings. We mentioned this idea in section 3.2 in support of the
therefore cleaner $0/$14 design. But what if a necessary precondition for expectations to
sink in is for them to be perceived as plausible and relevant in the first place? For another
example, in an alternative, competitive effort-provision paradigm, where a second mover ex-
plicitly competes against a first mover, Gill and Prowse (2012) provide evidence supportive
of expectations-based reference-dependent-preferences models. They conclude that in their
setting, effectively no lag is required for expectations to become reference points: “Given the
tiny temporal gap between the agents’ effort choices and the outcome of the tournament, our
results indicate that, at least in our competitive framework, the adjustment process is essen-
tially instantaneous.” Could competition foster sink-in, and could lagged beliefs be replaced


                                              37
with sunk-in-through-competition beliefs? We leave these questions for future research.
