                                              ABSTRACT

        In many countries, especially poor countries, a heavy burden of taxes, bribes, and bureaucratic
hassles drives many producers into the informal sector. Is this situation explicable only as a consequence
of either the ignorance or the ineptitude of the state authorities? On the contrary this paper shows that we
can attribute the existence of a large informal sector to the fact that, because productive endowments
contain important unobservable components, the state cannot adjust the amounts that it extracts from
producers in the formal sector according to each producer's endowment. Given this fact we find that, if
either the distribution of endowments is sufficiently inegalitarian or the production of private substitutes
for public services is sufficiently easy, then the state would extract a large enough amount from producers
in the formal sector that poorly endowed producers would choose to work in the informal sector. This
result obtains both for a proprietary state, which maximizes its own net revenue, and for a hypothetical
benevolent state, which would maximize the total net income of producers. But, we also find that a
proprietary state would create an informal sector for a larger set of combinations of parameter values than
would a hypothetical benevolent state.

       Many authors, Hernando De Soto (1989) being a prominent example, have pointed out
that in many countries, especially poor countries, a heavy burden of taxes, bribes, and bu-
reaucratic hassles drives many producers into an informal sector.1 Producers in the informal
sector avoid much of this burden, but they must produce with less assistance from public
services than is available to producers in the formal sector. These public services include the
protection of property rights by the police and the courts as well as public utilities, such as
roads, electric service, potable water, and sewage disposal.
       Why does the state impose such a heavy burden that many producers choose to work
in the informal sector? Is it just an unfortunate fact explicable only as a consequence of
either the ignorance or the ineptitude of the state authorities? The present paper suggests
a diﬀerent answer. We show that, because productive endowments contain important un-
observable components, with the result that the state cannot adjust the amounts that it
extracts from producers in the formal sector according to each producer’s endowment, then
the state might decide to extract a large enough amount from producers in the formal sector
that poorly endowed producers choose to work in the informal sector.
       We obtain this result in two radically diﬀerent models of the state. One model assumes
that the state is proprietary, which means that the state maximizes its net revenue.2 This
   1
       Using data from Latin American countries in the early 1990s, Norman Loayza (1996) Þnds the size
of the informal sector is positively correlated with tax burdens, as well as labor market restrictions and
ineﬃcient government institutions, and negatively correlated with real per capita GDP. Using data from 69
countries Eric Friedman, Simon Johnson, Daniel Kaufmann, and Pablo Zoido-Lobaton (2000) Þnd that costs
of bureaucracy and corruption, rather than oﬃcial taxes, are the key factor for an existence of the informal
sector.
   2
       Herschel Grossman(2000) characterizes a proprietary state as the instrument of a ruling elite, which is a
generic name for whatever group appropriates the net revenues of the state. Membership in the ruling elite
can include a monarch and his court, the military, the professional politicians, and the bureaucrats. The
present paper is not concerned with how the members of the ruling elite divide the net revenue of the state
among themselves.



                                                        1
net revenue consists of taxes and bribes minus expenditure on public services.3 The other
model considers a hypothetical benevolent state that would maximize the total net incomes
of producers.
       We begin the analysis of a proprietary state by showing that, if the state were able to
observe productive endowments, then a proprietary state would extract from each producer
the maximum amount consistent with each and every producer choosing to be in the formal
sector.4 Next, we assume, more realistically, that productive endowments include important
components that are not directly observable. These unobservable components can include
attributes like knowledge and ability as well as intangible resources like reputation, connec-
tions, Þnancial backing, and market power. In addition, although productive endowments
are correlated with incomes, we assume that, as seems to be a common characteristic of poor
countries, the state is not able to monitor incomes with any precision, at least not without
incurring prohibitively large costs. Under these assumptions the state cannot adjust the
amounts that it extracts from producers in the formal sector according to each producer’s
endowment.
       Given this constraint we show that, if either the distribution of endowments is suﬃciently
inegalitarian or the production of private substitutes for public services is suﬃciently easy,
then the proprietary state would choose to extract a large enough amount from producers in
the formal sector that poorly endowed producers would choose to work in the informal sector.
Under these conditions the state would lose net revenue if it were to decrease the amount that
it extracts from producers in the formal sector in order to induce poorly endowed producers
to work in the formal sector.
   3
       Bureaucratic hassles do not directly produce revenue but make it possible to extract bribes. Thus, taxes,
bribes, and bureaucratic hassles combine to generate revenue for the state.
   4
       Our analysis assumes that goods produced in the informal sector and in the formal sector are perfect
substitutes. Douglas Marcouiller and Leslie Young (1995) consider a related model that assumes less than
perfect substitutability between goods produced in the formal and informal sectors.



                                                        2
       We also analyze the behavior of a hypothetical benevolent state with unobservable en-
dowments. A benevolent state’s Þrst-best solution would be to provide the amount of public
services that would maximize total net output with all producers working in the formal
sector. But, this Þrst-best solution would be feasible if and only if the state could collect
enough taxes from producers in the formal sector to pay for this amount of public services.
       Otherwise, the benevolent state would look for the second-best solution, under which
it would provide a smaller amount of public services than in the Þrst-best solution. In
one possible second-best solution the benevolent state would set taxes as high as possible
consistent with all producers choosing to work in the formal sector. In another possible
second-best solution the benevolent state would set taxes even higher, with the result that
poorly endowed producers would choose to work in the informal sector.
       Although either a proprietary state or a hypothetical benevolent state could create an
informal sector, this analysis does not imply that the state’s objective does not matter for the
existence of an informal sector. We Þnd that, if the parameters are such that a proprietary
state were indiﬀerent between having and not having an informal sector, then the benevolent
state would set taxes low enough to induce all producers to work in the formal sector. Thus,
we obtain the important result that a proprietary state would create an informal sector for a
larger set of combinations of parameter values than would a hypothetical benevolent state.

Production in the Formal Sector and in the Informal Sector
       Assume that each of N well endowed producers has an endowment of K units of
productive resources, whereas each of n poorly endowed producers has an endowment of k
units of productive resources, where K is larger than k.5 Normalize the unit for measuring
population such that N + n = 1. Let T and t denote the number of units of output that
   5
       The assumption that producers are either well endowed or poorly endowed focuses the analysis on the
conditions under which an informal sector exists. In this setup, if an informal sector exists, then it consists
of the n poorly endowed producers. An extended model in which distribution of endowments had more
than two realizations would yield additional implications about the size of the informal sector. Such an

                                                      3
the state extracts in the form of either taxes or bribes from, respectively, each well endowed
producer and each poorly endowed producer in the formal sector. If the state could observe
the endowment of each producer, then it could choose diﬀerent values for T and t.
       Let G denote the number of units of output that the state provides to producers in
the formal sector in the form of public services.6 These public services serve as intermediate
goods in production. Producers in the formal sector can access these public services freely,
but the state costlessly prohibits access to producers in the informal sector.
       Let Ω denote the average endowment of productive resources, where Ω ≡ NK + nk.
Also, let Ωf denote the amount of productive resources employed in the formal sector, where
Ωf ≡ M K + mk, and where M and m, 0 ≤ M ≤ N, 0 ≤ m ≤ n, are, respectively, the
fractions of well endowed producers and poorly endowed producers who choose to work in
the formal sector.
       Let Zf denote net output in the formal sector – that is, gross output less the amount of
output used to provide public services. Assume that producers in the formal sector combine
their endowments of productive resources with public services according to an aggregate
Cobb-Douglas technology. Thus, we have

(1)                                  Zf = Ωαf G1−α − G,         0 < α < 1.

For simplicity this formulation implicitly assumes that public services are strictly rival.
       Let Yf     and yf       denote, respectively, the net incomes of well endowed and poorly
endowed producers in the formal sector. Gross production per unit of productive resources
extended model also would allow analysis of the decision to participate in production. The present analysis
implicitly assumes that k is large enough that all producers choose work, either in the formal sector or in
the informal sector, over the alternative of not participating in production.
   6
       For simplicity the analysis abstracts from infrastructure. Although the main implications of our analysis
would be unchanged if the provision of public services required infrastructure, as well as current output,
allowing for infrastructure would involve a dynamic analysis.



                                                        4
in the formal sector equals gross production in the formal sector, Ωαf G1−α , divided by
the amount of productive resources employed in the formal sector, Ωf . To calculate the
gross income of each producer in the formal sector, we multiply gross production per unit of
productive resources by the endowment of each producer in the formal sector, either K or
k. Accordingly, allowing for taxes and bribes, we have

(2)                   Yf = (G/Ωf )1−α K − T           and    yf = (G/Ωf )1−α k − t.

       Any producer who chooses to work in the informal sector does not pay taxes or bribes,
but also does not receive any public services. Let S and s denote the number of units
of output that each well endowed and poorly endowed producer in the informal sector,
respectively, would allocate to the provision of substitutes for public services.7 Assume that
this allocation yields the equivalent of µS or µs units of public services, 1 > µ > 0, where
µ measures the cost of producing private substitutes for public services. For example, if it
costs the state one unit of output per producer to provide producers in the formal sector
with a unit of a public service, then it would cost each producer in the informal sector a
larger amount, 1/µ units of output, to provide a private substitute for a unit of this public
service.
       Let Yi and yi denote, respectively, the net incomes of any well endowed and poorly
endowed producers who choose to work in the informal sector. Assume that each producer in
the informal sector would combine his substitutes for public services with his endowment of
productive resources according to the same Cobb-Douglas technology that producers use in
the formal sector. Thus, allowing for output allocated to the provision of private substitutes
for public services, we have

(3)                       Yi = K α (µS)1−α − S        and    yi = k α (µs)1−α − s.
   7
       De Soto (1989) tells an isomorphic story in which each producer in the informal sector pays bribes to
obtain access to public services. See Grossman (1995) for another story in which the maÞa provides public
services to the informal sector.


                                                      5
      Assume that any well endowed producer in the informal sector would choose S to
maximize Yi . Similarly, any poorly endowed producer in the informal sector would choose
s to maximize yi . The solutions to these choice problems are

                                1      1−α                             1    1−α
(4)                  S = (1 − α) α µ    α    K   and   s = (1 − α) α µ       α     k.

Substituting equations (4) into equations (3), these solutions imply that

                                       1−α                                   1−α
(5)                 Yi = α[(1 − α)µ]    α    K   and   yi = α[(1 − α)µ]       α     k.

      Let Zi denote net output in the informal sector. From equations (5) we have

                                                                   1−α
(6)                Zi = (N − M )Yi + (n − m)yi = α[(1 − α)µ]        α      (Ω − Ωf ).

Let Z denote total net output, where Z = Zf + Zi .
      Finally, assume that each producer would choose to work in the formal sector if and
only if he would not have a larger net income in the informal sector. Thus, each of the
well endowed producers would choose to work in the formal sector if and only if Yf ≥ Yi .
Similarly, each of the poorly endowed producers would choose to work in the formal sector
if and only if yf ≥ yi . Equations (2) and (5) imply that these conditions are equivalent to
                                                             1−α
                       (G/Ωf )1−α K − T ≥ α [(1 − α)µ]        α    K        and
(7)
                                                            1−α
                       (G/Ωf )1−α k − t ≥ α [(1 − α)µ]       α    k.

Equations (7) tell us that, given a producer’s endowment of productive resources and the
total amount of productive resources employed in the formal sector, a producer would choose
to work in the informal sector either if the state would extract a large enough amount from
him if he were to work in the formal sector, or if the state provides a small enough amount
of public services to producers in the formal sector, or if producing private substitutes for
public services is suﬃciently easy.

                                                 6
A Proprietary State with Observable Endowments
      Let R denote the net revenue of the state, where

(8)                                 R = M T + mt − G.

Equation (8) says that the net revenue of the state equals the total number of units of output
that the state extracts in the form of either taxes or bribes from producers in the formal
sector minus the number of units of output that the state provides to producers in the formal
sector in the form of public services. Assume for now that the state can easily observe the
endowment of each producer. Accordingly, the state can choose diﬀerent values for T and
t.
      To maximize R, the proprietary state would choose T, t, and G such that Yf = Yi ,
yf = yi , and dR/dG = 0. These conditions say the following: After observing endowments,
the proprietary state would set t and T such that each producer earns the same net income
in the formal sector as he would earn in the informal sector. In other words, the proprietary
state would extract from each producer the maximum amount consistent with all of the
producers choosing to work in the formal sector. Also, the proprietary state would provide
the amount of public services such that, given that all producers choose to work in the formal
sector, the state’s net revenue is maximized.
      These choices imply that with a proprietary state and observable endowments we would
have M = N, m = n, and, hence, Ωf = Ω, as well as G = G∗ , T = T ∗ , and t = t∗ ,
where
                                           1
                           G∗ = (1 − α) α Ω,

                                           1−α             1−α
(9)                        T ∗ = (1 − α)    α    (1 − αµ    α    ) K,   and

                                          1−α              1−α
                           t∗ = (1 − α)    α     (1 − αµ    α    ) k.


                                                   7
   Let R∗ denote the net revenue of a proprietary state with observable endowments.
Substituting M = N, m = n, T = T ∗ , t = t∗ , and G = G∗ into equation (8), and
recalling that Ω ≡ N K + nk, we have

                                               1−α            1−α
(10)                         R∗ = α (1 − α)     α    (1 − µ    α    ) Ω.

   Let Z ∗ denote total net output with a proprietary state and observable endowments.
Substituting Ωf = Ω and G = G∗ into equations (1) and (6) and summing, we have

                                                                       1−α
(11)                   Z ∗ = Ωα (G∗ )1−α − G∗ = α (1 − α)               α    Ω.


A Proprietary State with Unobservable Endowments
   Now assume that, although from a combination of observation and experience the state
knows the distribution of endowments, the state can neither observe nor infer the endowment
of each producer. In the present setup these assumptions mean that the state knows the
possible endowments, K and k, and the numbers of well endowed and poorly endowed
producers, N and n, but that the state does not know who has K and who has k. As
a result the state cannot choose diﬀerent values for T and t. Instead the state sets both
T and t equal to a common value, denoted by X.
   With the state extracting the same amount from both well endowed producers and poorly
endowed producers, the net incomes of each well endowed producer and each poorly endowed
producer in the formal sector are

(12)             Yf = (G/Ωf )1−α K − X     and         yf = (G/Ωf )1−α k − X.

Equations (5) still give the net incomes that well endowed producers and poorly endowed
producers would have in the informal sector.
   Again, assume that each well endowed producer would choose to be in the formal sector
if and only if Yf ≥ Yi , and each poorly endowed producer would choose to be in the formal

                                               8
sector if and only if yf ≥ yi . These conditions are now equivalent to
                                                                     1−α
                             (G/Ωf )1−α K − X ≥ α [(1 − α)µ]          α    K    and
(13)
                                                                    1−α
                             (G/Ωf )1−α k − X ≥ α [(1 − α)µ]         α     k.

         With unobservable endowments the net revenue of the state is given by

(14)                                        R = (m + M )X − G.

To maximize R, the proprietary state chooses X such that this choice results in either8

(15)                                       Yf > Yi    and yf = yi

or

(16)                                       Yf = Yi   and yf < yi .

The proprietary state also chooses G such that dR/dG = 0.
         If the state chooses X to satisfy conditions (15), then the amount that it extracts from
each producer in the formal sector is such that well endowed producers have a larger net
income in the formal sector than they would have in the informal sector, whereas poorly
endowed producers have the same net income in the formal sector as they would have in the
informal sector. In this case all producers choose to work in the formal sector. If, instead,
the state chooses X to satisfy conditions (16), then it extracts so much from each producer
in the formal sector that well endowed producers have the same net income in the formal
sector as they would have in the informal sector, whereas poorly endowed producers have a
     8
         This analysis implicitly assumes that the state announces, either by word or deed, and irrevocably
commits itself to its choice of X before producers choose whether to work in the formal sector or the
informal sector. See Grossman and Noh (1990, 1994) for an analysis that focuses on the time consistency of
the tax policy of a proprietary state.


                                                       9
larger net income in the informal sector than they would have in the formal sector. In this
case well endowed producers choose to work in the formal sector, whereas poorly endowed
producers choose to work in the informal sector.
       Suppose that the proprietary state chooses X to satisfy conditions (15). From equations
(5) and (12) the equality, yf = yi , implies that to satisfy conditions (15) the state sets X
such that

                                                                           1−α
(17)                            X = (G/Ω)1−α k − α [(1 − α)µ]               α     k.

Equation (17) together with the condition dR/dG = 0 implies that M = N, m = n, and
hence, Ωf = Ω, as well as G = G|m=n and X = X|m=n , where

       Let R|m=n denote the net revenue of a proprietary state with unobservable endowments
and with all producers in the formal sector. Substituting M = N, m = n, G = G|m=n ,
and X = X|m=n into equation (14), and recalling that Ω ≡ N K + nk, we have9

       Let Z|m=n denote total net output with a proprietary state, unobservable endowments,
and all producers in the formal sector. Substituting Ωf = Ω and G = G|m=n into equations
(1) and (6) and summing, we have

                                                                                 1−α

   9
       For R|m=n , as given by equation (19), to be positive, µ must be smaller than k/Ω, which is smaller
than one. If µ were not smaller than k/Ω, then the proprietary state would not consider choosing X to
satisfy conditions (15).


                                                       10
   Suppose, instead, that the proprietary state chooses X to satisfy conditions (16). From
equations (5) and (12) the equality, Yf = Yi , implies that to satisfy conditions (16) the
state sets X such that
                                                                             1−α

Equation (21) together with the condition dR/dG = 0 implies that M = N and m = 0,
as well as G = G|m=0 and X = X|m=0 , where
                                                   1
                            G|m=0 = (1 − α) α NK              and

   Let R|m=0 denote the net revenue of a proprietary state with unobservable endowments
and with only well-endowed producers in the formal sector. Substituting M = N, m = 0,
G = G|m=0 , and X = X|m=0 into equation (14) we have
                                               1−α              1−α
(23)                     R|m=0 = α (1 − α)      α      (1 − µ    α    ) (Ω − nk).

   Let Z|m=0 denote total net output with a proprietary state, unobservable endowments,
and only well endowed producers in the formal sector. Substituting M = N, m = 0, and
G = G|m=0 into equations (1) and (6) and summing, we have
                                                                                   1−α

An Informal Sector or Not?
   To decide whether to choose X to satisfy conditions (15) or conditions (16), the propri-
etary state compares R|m=n , as given by equation (19), with R|m=0 , as given by equation
(23). From these equations we see that R|m=0 is larger than R|m=n if and only if
                                       1−α         1−α
                               (k/Ω)    α    −µ     α        1 − nk/Ω
(25)                                         1−α         <            .
                                  1−µ         α                 k/Ω

                                                   11
Condition (25) implies that, either if k/Ω is suﬃciently small or if µ is suﬃciently large,
then choosing X to satisfy conditions (16) results in larger net revenue for the state than
would choosing X small enough to satisfy condition (15).
   Here we have a central result of our analysis:

      If the proprietary state cannot observe the endowment of each producer, and if
      either the distribution of endowments is suﬃciently inegalitarian or the produc-
      tion of private substitutes for public services is suﬃciently easy, then to maximize
      its net revenue the proprietary state extracts from producers in the formal sec-
      tor a large enough amount that poorly endowed producers choose to work in the
      informal sector.

This result is consistent with the observation that in poor countries, which commonly have
large informal sectors, the distribution of endowments typically is relatively inegalitarian,
and the quality of public services typically is poor.
   Figures 1 and 2 illustrate this result by depicting alternative Laﬀer curves, with the
net revenue of the state, R, on the vertical axis and the amount that the state extracts
from each producer in the formal sector, X, on the horizontal axis. As these Þgures
show, the proprietary state faces a trade-oﬀ in that either it can extract as much as X|m=n
from every producer or it can extract as much as X|m=0 from well endowed producers,
but collect nothing from poorly endowed producers. If condition (25) is not satisÞed, then
Figure 1 is relevant. In this case, the amount of the decrease in R at the point at which X
exceeds X|m=n is large enough that the state’s net revenue is larger without an informal
sector. Alternatively, if condition (25) is satisÞed, then Figure 2 is relevant. In this case, the
amount of the decrease in R at the point at which X exceeds X|m=n is small enough that
the additional revenue that the state collects from well endowed producers by increasing X
to X|m=0 is larger than the revenue that the state foregoes by causing poorly endowed
producers to work in the informal sector.

            Figure 2: Proprietary State with an Informal Sector
   Comparing G|m=n and G|m=0 , as given by equations (18) and (22), with G∗ , as
given by equations (9), we also see that, whether or not the proprietary state chooses to
have an informal sector, it would not provide as much public services as it would provide if
endowments were observable. If the state chooses to satisfy conditions (15), then the value
of G that maximizes R is smaller with the state extracting X from all producers than
with the state extracting T from well endowed producers. Alternatively, if the state chooses
to satisfy conditions (16), then the value of G that maximizes R is smaller with only
the well endowed producers in the formal sector. Furthermore, comparing equations (20)
and (24) with equation (11) we also can easily conÞrm that, whether or not the proprietary
state chooses to have an informal sector, net total output is smaller than it would be if
endowments were observable.

A Hypothetical Benevolent State with Unobservable Endowments
   A hypothetical benevolent state would choose G and X to maximize the total net
income of producers subject to the Þscal budget constraint, R = (M + m)X − G ≥ 0. In
making these choices a hypothetical benevolent state would take as given that well endowed
producers and poorly endowed producers would choose to work in the formal sector if and
only if G and X satisfy conditions (13).
   The Þrst-best solution to this problem would involve choosing G to maximize total net
output, Z = Zf + Zi , with all producers working in the formal sector and with the Þscal
budget constraint satisÞed as an equality. Summing equations (1) and (6) for Zf and Zi ,
and setting G and X to satisfy dZ/dG = 0, conditions (13), and R = 0, this solution
would imply m = n, M = N, and, hence, Ωf = Ω, with G = G̃ and X = X̃, where
                                                         1−α
                       (G̃/Ω)1−α k − X̃ ≥ α [(1 − α)µ]    α    k   and
(26)
                                        1
                       X̃ = G̃ = (1 − α) α Ω.

   Let Z̃    denote total net output under the Þrst-best solution of a benevolent state.

                                            13
Substituting Ωf = Ω and G = G̃ into equations (1) and (6) and summing, we have

                                                              1−α
(27)                      Z̃ = Ωα (G̃)1−α − G̃ = α (1 − α)     α    Ω.

   From equations (9) and (26) we see that G̃ is equal to G∗ . Thus, in the Þrst-best
solution a hypothetical benevolent state, in addition to choosing to have all producers work
in the formal sector, also would provide the same amount of public services as would a
proprietary state if endowments were observable. Furthermore, as we see from equations (11)
and (27), total net output would be the same under the Þrst-best solution of a hypothetical
benevolent state as it would be with a proprietary state and observable endowments. The
Þrst-best policy of a hypothetical benevolent state, however, would diﬀer from the policy of
a proprietary state in that with unobservable endowments a hypothetical benevolent state
would collect the same amount of taxes from each producer, but would collect only enough
taxes to Þnance the provision of public services.
   The Þrst-best solution given by conditions (26) would be feasible if and only if these three
conditions in G and X are mutually consistent. Furthermore, mutual consistency obtains
if and only if the parameters satisfy

                                 1  k       α   1−α k
(28)                                  −1 ≥     µ α    .
                                1−α Ω      1−α      Ω

Condition (28) implies that, if and only if µ is not too large and k/Ω is not too small,
then the hypothetical benevolent state can collect enough taxes from producers in the formal
sector for the Þrst-best policy to be feasible.
   If the parameters µ and k/Ω fail to satisfy condition (28), then the hypothetical
benevolent state would look for the second-best solution. In one possible second-best solution
a benevolent state would provide the maximum amount of public services that it can Þnance
with all producers working in the formal sector. In this solution the benevolent state would
set X such that yf equals yi and would set G equal to X. This solution would imply


                                                  14
m = n, M = N, and, hence, Ωf = Ω, with G = G̃|m=n and X = X̃|m=n , where
                                                                   1−α
                   X̃|m=n = (G̃|m=n /Ω)1−α k − α [(1 − α)µ]         α     k    and
(29)
                   X̃|m=n = G̃|m=n .

Equations (29) imply that in this possible second-best solution, although taxes would be low
enough that all producers would choose to work in the formal sector, the amount of public
services would be smaller than it would in the Þrst-best solution.
   Let Z̃|m=n denote total net income in this possible second-best solution. Substituting
Ωf = Ω and G = G̃|m=n into equations (1) and (6) and summing, we have

(30)                        Z̃|m=n = Ωα (G̃|m=n )1−α − G̃|m=n .

   The other possible second-best solution would be to choose G such that dZ/dG = 0
with only well-endowed producers working in the formal sector. This solution would imply
m = 0 and M = N, with G = G̃|m=0 and X = X̃|m=0 , where
                                                   1
                               G̃|m=0 = (1 − α) α N K      and
(31)
                               N X̃|m=0 = G̃|m=0 .

Equations (31) imply that in this possible second-best solution taxes would be high enough
that poorly endowed people would choose to work in the informal sector. Also, because only
well endowed people would work in the formal sector, the amount of public services in this
possible second-best solution would be smaller than it would in the Þrst-best solution.
   Let Z̃|m=0 denote total net income in this possible second-best policy. Substituting
M = N, m = 0, and G = G̃|m=0 into equations (1) and (6) and summing, we have
                                             1−α                 1−α
(32)                    Z̃|m=0 = α (1 − α)    α    [Ω − (1 − µ    α    )nk].

   From equations (22) and (31) we see that with only well endowed producers working in
the formal sector a hypothetical benevolent state and a proprietary state would provide the

                                              15
same amount of public services. Thus, as we see from equations (24) and (32), with only
well endowed producers working in the formal sector total net output would be the same
with a hypothetical benevolent state as with a proprietary state. A hypothetical benevolent
state, however, would collect only enough taxes to Þnance the provision of public services.
   If the parameters do not satisfy condition (28), then a benevolent state would choose
between these two possible second-best solutions by comparing Z̃|m=n , as given by equation
(30), with Z̃|m=0 , as given by equation (32). This comparison reveals that, if either k/Ω
were suﬃciently small or µ were suﬃciently large, then Z̃|m=0 would be larger than
Z̃|m=n . In this case a hypothetical benevolent state would choose to collect enough taxes
from each producer in the formal sector that poorly endowed producers would choose to work
in the informal sector. The state would make this choice because, with either k/Ω being
suﬃciently small or µ being suﬃciently large, if the state were to set taxes on producers in
the formal sector low enough to induce the poorly endowed producers to work in the formal
sector, then it would be able to provide only a small amount of public services.

Comparison of a Proprietary State and a Hypothetical Benevolent State
   Does this analysis imply that only the observability of productive endowments is impor-
tant for the existence of an informal sector? Does not the state’s objective also matter?
In this section we compare the set of combinations of parameter values that would cause
a proprietary state to create an informal sector with the set of combinations of parameter
values that would cause a hypothetical benevolent state to create an informal sector.
   To facilitate this comparison consider values of the parameters such that R|m=n , as
given by equation (19), is positive and either equal to or larger than R|m=0 , as given by
equation (23). Under these conditions a proprietary state either would be indiﬀerent between
choosing G and X to have or not to have an informal sector or would prefer to choose G
and X not to have an informal sector. From equation (19) we see that R|m=n > 0 implies
                                          1−α          1−α
(33)                              (k/Ω)    α    − αµ    α    > 0.

                                                16
In addition, from equations (19) and (23) we see that R|m=n ≥ R|m=0 implies
                               1−α        1−α                    1−α
(34)                  [(k/Ω)    α    −µ    α    ] k/Ω ≥ (1 − µ    α    ) (1 − nk/Ω).

   Conditions (33) and (34) do not imply either that condition (28) is satisÞed or that con-
dition (28) is not satisÞed. As we have seen, if condition (28) is satisÞed, then a hypothetical
benevolent state would choose the Þrst-best solution in which all producers work in the for-
mal sector. Alternatively, if condition (28) is not satisÞed, then a hypothetical benevolent
state would choose the second-best solution in which poorly endowed producers work in the
informal sector if and only if Z̃|m=0 would be larger than Z̃|m=n .
   How do conditions (33) and (34) relate to the relation between Z̃|m=0 and Z̃|m=n ? To
answer this question, begin by comparing Z|m=n , as given by equation (20), with Z|m=0 ,
as given by equation (24). Using equations (20) and (24) we see that conditions (33) and
(34) together imply

(35)                                        Z|m=n > Z|m=0 .

This result says that, if the values of the parameters were such that a proprietary state either
would be indiﬀerent between having poorly endowed producers work in the formal sector or
in an informal sector or would prefer having poorly endowed producers work in the formal
sector, then total net output would be larger if G and X were chosen to induce poorly
endowed producers to work in the formal sector.
   Next, recall that Z̃|m=0 , as given by equation (32), is identical to Z|m=0 , as given by
equation (24). Hence, using inequality (35), we see that inequality (33) and equation (34)
together imply

(36)                                        Z|m=n > Z̃|m=0 .

   Also, recall that G̃ is the value of G that would satisfy dZ/dG = 0. Thus, because
d2 Z/dG2 is negative, we know that, for any value of G smaller than G̃, dZ/dG would
be positive.

                                                     17
   Comparing equations (18) and (26) we see that G|m=n is smaller than G̃. Moreover,
although we do not have an explicit expression for G̃|m=n , we can infer that, for any
given combination of values for the parameters, G|m=n would be smaller than G̃|m=n .
This inference follows from the observation that, either with a proprietary state setting G
equal to G|m=n or with a hypothetical benevolent state setting G equal to G̃|m=n , the
state’s gross revenue, either X|m=n or X̃|m=n , would be the maximum consistent with
all producers working in the formal sector. But, a proprietary state would spend only a
fraction of X|m=n on the provision of public services, whereas a hypothetical benevolent
state would spend all of X̃|m=n on the provision of public services. In addition, X̃|m=n
would be larger than X|m=n because the provision of more public services would make it
more attractive for producers to work in the formal sector.
   Because G|m=n is smaller than G̃|m=n , and because, over this range of values of G,
dZ/dG is positive, we also infer that, for any given combination of values for the parameters,
Z̃|m=n would be larger than Z|m=n . Hence, using inequality (36), we see that conditions
(33) and (34) together imply

(37)                                  Z̃|m=n > Z̃|m=0 .

Inequality (37) tells us that, whether or not condition (28) is satisÞed, if the values of the
parameters were such that a proprietary state either would be indiﬀerent between choosing
G and X to have or not to have an informal sector or would prefer to choose G and X
not to have an informal sector, then a hypothetical benevolent state would choose G and
X such that all producers would work in the formal sector.
   Here we have another central result of our analysis:

       The set of combinations of parameter values for which a proprietary state would
       choose not to have an informal sector is a subset of the set of combinations of
       parameter values for which a hypothetical benevolent state would choose not to
       have an informal sector.

                                             18
Summary
   This paper has shown that a heavy burden of taxes, bribes, and bureaucratic hassles
that, especially in poor countries, drives many producers into the informal sector does not
imply that the state authorities are either ignorant or inept. On the contrary this paper has
shown that we can attribute the existence of a large informal sector to the fact that, be-
cause productive endowments contain important unobservable components, the state cannot
adjust the amounts that it extracts from producers in the formal sector according to each
producer’s endowment. Given this fact we found that, if either the distribution of endow-
ments is suﬃciently inegalitarian or the production of private substitutes for public services
is suﬃciently easy, then the state would extract a large enough amount from producers in the
formal sector that poorly endowed producers would choose to work in the informal sector.
This result is consistent with the observation that in poor countries, which commonly have
large informal sectors, the distribution of endowments typically is relatively inegalitarian,
and the quality of public services typically is poor. Moreover, this result obtains both for
a proprietary state, which maximizes its own net revenue, and for a hypothetical benevo-
lent state, which would maximize the total net income of producers. But, we also found
that a proprietary state would create an informal sector for a larger set of combinations of
parameter values than would a hypothetical benevolent state.
