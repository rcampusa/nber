                                            ABSTRACT

We study empirically technology diffusion across countries and over time. We find significant evidence
that technology diffuses slower to locations that are farther away from adoption leaders. This effect
is stronger across rich countries and also when measuring distance along the south-north dimension.
A simple theory of human interactions can account for these empirical findings. The theory suggests
that the effect of distance should vanish over time, a hypothesis that we confirm in the data, and that
distinguishes technology from other flows like goods or investments. We then structurally estimate
the model. The parameter governing the frequency of interactions is larger for newer and network-based
technologies and for the median technology the frequency of interactions decays by 73% every 1000
Kms. Overall, we document the significant role that geography plays in determining technology diffusion
across countries.

           We study empirically technology di¤usion across countries and over time. We …nd signi…cant
      evidence that technology di¤uses slower to locations that are farther away from adoption leaders.
      This e¤ect is stronger across rich countries and also when measuring distance along the south-
      north dimension. A simple theory of human interactions can account for these empirical …ndings.
      The theory suggests that the e¤ect of distance should vanish over time, a hypothesis that we
      con…rm in the data, and that distinguishes technology from other ‡ows like goods or investments.
      We then structurally estimate the model. The parameter governing the frequency of interactions
      is larger for newer and network-based technologies and for the median technology the frequency
      of interactions decays by 73% every 1000 Kms. Overall, we document the signi…cant role that
      geography plays in determining technology di¤usion across countries.


1    Introduction
Technology disparities are critical to explain cross-country di¤erences in per capita income.1 Despite
being non-rival in nature,2 and involving no direct transport costs, technology di¤uses slowly both
across and within countries. These slow ‡ows can result in signi…cant lags between the time of
invention and the time when a technology is initially used in a country. Even when a technology
has arrived in a country, it takes years and even decades before it has di¤used to the point of having
a signi…cant impact on productivity. These observations have led economists to study why does
technology di¤use slowly, and what explains cross-country di¤erences in its speed of di¤usion.

     See, for example, Romer (1990). This property steams from the fact that once invented, the use of a technology
by one producer does not preclude others from using it.


                                                        1
       Existing empirical studies on technology adoption have treated adoption units (e.g. countries,
cities, or …rms) as independent.3 Consequently, they have tried to link a country’s technology adop-
tion patterns to the country’s characteristics (e.g. human capital, institutions, policies, adoption
history, etc.).4 This empirical approach to the drivers of technology adoption ignores the possi-
bility of cross-country interactions in the adoption process. This assumption might be restrictive.
Adopting a technology requires acquiring knowledge5 which often comes from interactions with
other agents. The frequency and success of these interactions is likely to be shaped by geography.
Technological knowledge is likely to be more easily transmitted between agents in countries that
are close than between agents located far apart. Similarly, the payo¤ to adopting a given technol-
ogy (e.g. railways) may be a¤ected by the adoption experience of neighboring countries. These
mechanisms may generate correlated adoption patterns across nearby countries. To explore the
empirical importance of these mechanisms, in this paper we explore the presence of cross-country
interactions in technology adoption that are mediated by geographical distance. In particular, we
study empirically the di¤usion of technology across time and space.
       A clear impediment to collecting evidence on the presence of geographic interactions in technol-
ogy adoption is the lack of comprehensive datasets that directly document the di¤usion of speci…c
technologies across countries. In this paper we study the di¤usion over time and space of 20 major
technologies in 161 countries over the last 140 years using data from the CHAT dataset (Comin
and Hobijn 2004, 2010). Our interest lies in exploring the presence of cross-country correlations in
technology adoption that are mediated by geographical distance. To this end, we measure how far
a country is from the high-density points in the distribution of technology adoption in the other
countries. We denote this measure the spatial distance from other country’s technology or, to ab-
breviate, the spatial distance from technology (SDT).6 After controlling for country and time …xed
e¤ects, a negative correlation between SDT and adoption implies that countries that are further
away from those where the technology di¤uses faster tend to experience a slower adoption of the
technology.7
       In Section 2 we present a battery of empirical …ndings. We estimate a strong and signi…cant
negative partial correlation between SDT and a country’s adoption, after controlling for per capita
income and technology-speci…c country and time …xed e¤ects. We also explore whether the spatial
correlations in adoption are purely driven by the spatial correlation in income or in other variables
strongly correlated with income. To this end, we control for a measure of the spatial distance from

      Potential users of the technology …rst learn about its existence and properties, then, they need to learn how to
use it, and …nally they need to …gure out how to apply it to an existing production process or to new ones.
    6
      Formally, the SDT of a country is de…ned as the scalar product of the (log) adoption levels in the rest of the
countries and the distance to each of these countries.
    7
      The construction of SDT might raise concerns of endogeneity, since adoption is a function of all other countries’
adoption rates. In the next section we argue that these concerns are minor if we have many countries and so the
contribution of any one country to the distribution of adoption is small. In Appendix B we also argue that, even
with a small sample of countries, the upper bound of the bias generated by endogeneity is rather small and certainly
irrelevant for our substantive results.

other countries per-capita income (SDI), constructed in a way parallel to SDT. We …nd that the
sign and magnitude of SDT in our di¤usion equations is una¤ected by the inclusion of SDI. We
also explore the robustness of the association between SDT and technology adoption to various
speci…cations and samples. We …nd robust and signi…cant e¤ects of SDT on technology di¤usion
across sectors, technologies, and income levels, as well as when we use distinct country samples to
compute SDT.
      The correlated adoption patterns we document could result from the spatial correlation of other
drivers of technology adoption which are independent of income.8 We further explore this possibility
in two robustness checks. First, we follow the di¤usion literature and control for measures of the
three most signi…cant predictors of di¤usion: human capital, trade openness, and institutions.9
Introducing these controls does not a¤ect the signi…cance or magnitude of the association between
SDT and adoption. Second, we show that although the correlation between SDT and adoption
is robust across all the technologies in our sample, the correlation between technologies of the
rank of countries in their speed of adoption is fairly low (around 0.2). Hence, a technology-speci…c
pattern of omitted variables would be necessary to account for the geographic patterns of technology
dynamics that we uncover. Even though it is hard to imagine what this set of omitted variables
could be, we acknowledge that our methodology cannot rule out this possibility. Our goal is to
describe, for what we believe is the …rst time, the spatial patterns of technology di¤usion across
countries and to make the case that these patterns can be parsimoniously rationalized by models
of spatial technology di¤usion.
      In order to provide a richer characterization of the spatial patterns of technology di¤usion, we
also take on Jared Diamond’s hypothesis that technologies di¤use along latitudes.10 We construct
measures of SDT based on latitude and longitude distances, and run a horse race between the
two. We …nd that, consistent with Diamond (1997), SDT across latitude distances has a stronger
association with technology adoption than SDT across longitude distances. This …nding is remark-
able since our sample does not include any technology where climatic reasons might suggest that
distance across latitudes is a larger impediment for di¤usion than distance across longitudes.
      We explore further the mechanisms that drive these spatial di¤usion patterns by developing a
simple model which borrows from the literature on external e¤ects and contagion11 , as well as recent
papers that have emphasized the importance of individual knowledge exchanges for growth (e.g.
Eaton and Kortum, 1999, Lucas, 2009, and Lucas and Moll, 2011). In particular, our stylized model
is based on two key assumptions. First, technology is di¤used through interactions between adopters
and non-adopters. Second, interactions are random and more likely between agents located nearby.
The model’s implications are consistent with our empirical …ndings. The theory also guides us in
exploring new dimensions of the data. In particular, it predicts that the geographic interactions
in adoption, as measured by the e¤ect of SDT, should diminish over time as technology di¤uses.
  8
    This possibility is related to the re‡ection problem emphasized by Maski (1993).

Going back to the data, we document that this implication holds in virtualy all the technologies
and samples studied. Furthermore, we provide a parsimonious statistical characterization that …ts
well the time variation in the e¤ect of SDT on technology adoption.
   We then go a step further and use the time patterns of geographic interactions in adoption to
structurally estimate the two parameters that characterize the model. Using a simulated method
of moments (SMM) estimator where the initial geography of adoption matches the variance of
the initial distribution of adoption in the data, we show that our simple model can generate time-
varying interaction e¤ects that closely resemble the data for nineteen out of the twenty technologies
in the sample. Our estimates of the structural parameters of the model help us understand better
the spatial di¤usion process. In particular, they show that the frequency of interactions has been
higher for newer than for older technologies and that spatial interactions decline by 73% every 1000
Kms.
   The fact that the impact of distance on technology di¤usion dies out over time in this very
systematic way, distinguishes technology from other economic ‡ows, like migration, trade, or FDI.
These other ‡ows have also been shown to decline with distance due to transport cost and other
migration restrictions. However, in clear contrast with technology, for people, goods, and investment
‡ows, the e¤ect of distance does not dissipate over time. Once technology is di¤used, distance does
not matter because ideas and innovations only need to be conveyed to each individual once and can
then be used repeatedly afterwards. This particular characteristic of technology, which distinguishes
it from other ‡ows, is very much present in the data, both in our purely empirical speci…cation,
and in the estimated structural model.
   Despite the intuitive appeal of cross-country interactions in technology adoption, the literature
has not been able to document its presence and to assess their contribution to the large cross-country
di¤erences in technology adoption. Some strands of the literature have explored the presence of
knowledge spillovers associated with research and development activities. Broadly speaking, this
approach has been pursued in two di¤erent ways. One has used patent citations data mostly within
rich countries (Ja¤e, Trajtenberg, and Henderson, 1993, Almeida, 1996, Thompson and Fox-Kean,
2005). Another has used cross-country data to study the e¤ects of a country’s R&D expenditures
on other nearby countries’TFP (see Keller, 2004, for a comprehensive survey). However, innovation
and adoption are distinct phenomena and it is unclear whether the knowledge and factors relevant
to adopt a technology are related to those that matter for innovating. Furthermore, to explain
cross-country di¤erences in adoption it seems more appropriate to rely on cross-country spillovers
than within-country spillovers. In addition, given the typical length of gestation lags, a positive
correlation between Solow residuals and R&D expenditures may just re‡ect international cyclical
co-movement rather than international technology di¤usion. A …nal strand of the literature has
studied adoption directly using micro-level data for simple agricultural technologies such as new
crops or high yield seeds (e.g. Foster and Rosenzweig,1995, and Bandeira and Rasul, 2006). These
studies have also found evidence of spatial correlations in adoption patterns across individuals.
   We view our approach to identify the presence and strength of geographic interactions as com-


                                                  4
plementary to approaches that use more detailed and speci…c data, for particular circumstances,
that allows for somewhat cleaner identi…cation. Those approaches are necessarily limited to study
one (or at most a few) technologies which typically are very simple (e.g. fertilizers, seeds) and
not representative of the continuum of technologies in the economy. Furthermore, studies based
on one quasi-natural experiment are, by design, anecdotal and so inference to the wider economy,
other periods, or other technologies remains a challenge. Finally, and perhaps most important for
our purpose, micro data cannot identify the presence of cross-country interactions in technology
adoption. Geographic interactions in adoption may take place along di¤erent channels depending
on the distance between the adoption units. As a result, the forces identi…ed at short distances
might be distinct to the ones we uncover here.12
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present our non-structural em-
pirical approach, the data, and the …ndings from our non-structural exploration. In Section 3 we
develop our simple stylized model and derive some testable implications. We contrast them with
the data in Section 4. In Section 5, we estimate the model structurally. Section 6 concludes.


2    Empirical exploration
In this section, we start our investigation of the role of geographic interactions on technology
di¤usion. We begin by imposing minimal structure in order to try to uncover general and robust
patterns in the data.
    Our empirical methodology is based on the following econometric speci…cation:


                           xjct =   j j
                                    1c Ic   +   j j
                                                2t It   +   j
                                                            3 yct   +   j j
                                                                        4 x ct   +   j
                                                                                     5 y ct   +   j
                                                                                                  ct            (1)

The dependent variable, xjct ; is the level of adoption of a technology j in country c in year t: Technol-
ogy adoption measures come from the cross-country historical adoption technology (CHAT) dataset
(Comin and Hobijn, 2004, 2009, and 2010). To maximize the country representation of the sample,
we focus on 20 major technologies, listed in Table 1.13 Broadly speaking, the technologies studied
belong to three sectors, transportation, communication, and industry. They cover, in an unbalanced
way, technology di¤usion in 161 countries going back until 1825. For each technology measure, (e.g.
tons*kilometer transported by rail per capita), we take logarithms and add a technology-speci…c
constant that ensures that xjct is always positive.14 Adding a constant is inconsequential for the
dependent variable, but it is relevant for the interpretation of the SDT term that we discuss below.
    Given the time series length for some of our technologies, they may eventually become dominated
by newer technologies. Because our interest is on the phase in which technologies di¤use, we censor
  12
     Micro estimates of the strength of geographic interactions in adoption (Rode and Weber, 2012) or in innovation
(Kerr and Duke, 2012) …nd that the e¤ect of interactions becomes negligible beyond very short distances (e.g. a
couple of kilometers).
  13
     We select the 20 technologies with observations for the largest number of countries and that are relevant for a
variety of sectors.
  14
     In particular, we add the minimum of xjct along c and t; for the years used in the regressions.



                                                              5
the time series to eliminate the obsolescence phase. We achieve this by censoring the data once
the adoption per capita of the leader (i.e. the country with higher adoption per capita) starts to
decline.
   Income a¤ects the demand for the goods and services that embody new technologies. This
mechanism is orthogonal to the forces we explore in this paper and we control for it by including
log of domestic income per capita (yct ) as an independent variable. Controlling for income also takes
care of the potential e¤ects of foreign business cycles on domestic technology adoption. This is the
case, to the extent that international business cycles a¤ect the domestic economy (only) through
the domestic income level.Of course, we can control for domestic income because the dependent
variable in our analysis is a direct measure of technology adoption (as opposed to something much
closer to income such as TFP). We use Madison (2005) data to construct the (log) of per capita
GDP (in 1990 dollars).

                                             Tractors

   In all our regressions we include technology-country dummies, Icj ; and technology-year dum-
mies, Itj : Country dummies capture country-speci…c factors that a¤ect technology di¤usion and
that are relatively constant over the time-span in which the technology di¤uses. These might in-
clude geographical variables (e.g., remoteness, size of the country, density, ruggedness, climate,...),

                                                    6
institutional variables (e.g. political regime, expropriation risk,...) or historical endowment (e.g.,
familiarity with related technologies, education system, ...). Note that we allow country dummies
to di¤er across technologies to capture the possibly di¤erent e¤ect that persistent factors have on
di¤erent technologies.
       The inclusion of time and country dummies a¤ects the identi…cation of the estimated coe¢ cients.
The country …xed e¤ects imply that the estimates re‡ect correlations of the change in the dependent
variable with the change in the adoption level, xjct : That is, with the di¤usion of the technology.
Technology-year dummies remove the average evolution of the di¤usion process for each technology
which may vary across technologies for a variety of factors largely orthogonal to our analysis.15
As a result, the estimated coe¢ cients capture the di¤erential e¤ect on technology di¤usion of the
dependent variables in a country relative to the rest.
       The centerpiece of our exploration of the presence of geographical interactions in adoption is
the spatial distance from other countries’technology (SDT). Intuitively, SDT is just an interaction
between the (log) of adoption in other countries and how distant they are. In principle, there are
many di¤erent ways to construct these interactions. In Appendix A, we present several alternatives
and show the robustness of the basic empirical …ndings to these various speci…cations of SDT. Our
baseline way to compute the interaction between technology and distance is as the scalar product
of a vector of (log) adoption levels in the other countries and the vector of distances (thousands of
kilometers) to these other countries. Formally,

                                                         X
                                              xj ct =           dck xjkt
                                                        8k6=c

where dck is the distance between countries c and k:
       Note that, when the number of countries is large, the vector of adoption measures in the rest
of the world, xjkt ; is almost the same across countries, and the cross-country variation in SDT
comes from di¤erences in the matrix of distances. Therefore, in the cross-section, SDT is highly
correlated with the remoteness of the country. Because the matrix of distances is constant over
time (other than due to changes in the sample composition) this direct e¤ect of remoteness on
adoption is captured by the technology-speci…c country …xed e¤ects. Therefore it does not a¤ect
                         j
the identi…cation of     4:
       Since the matrix of distances is constant over time, time variation in SDT is generated by the
di¤usion of technology (i.e., from xjkt ). As technology di¤uses, xj ct increases slowly in countries
located close to places where technology di¤uses faster. Conversely, xj ct increases faster in places
that are farther from countries where technology di¤uses faster. Therefore, if being close to adop-
tion leaders is bene…cial for the di¤usion of technology, we should observe that xj ct is negatively
correlated with adoption, xjct : This is the logic behind the identi…cation of          j
                                                                                        4:   Note that, since we
                                                    j
include time dummies, the identi…cation of          4   comes from the relative change of SDT in countries
  15
    These may include the nature of the technology, its capital intensity, when the technology was invented (Comin
and Hobijn, 2010), etc.

that are close to adoption leaders vs. those that are far (not from absolute changes in SDT).16
       Of course, geographic interactions may take place along variables other than technology. Trade
is an obvious example. However, the terms that arise in standard gravity equations used in inter-
national trade17 are all captured in the regressors included in (1) independently of our variable of
interest xj ct .18 A literature in political science (e.g. Simmons et al., 2007) has also emphasized the
international di¤usion of institutions and markets.19 These other forms of geographic interactions
may, in principle, a¤ect the adoption dynamics in a country. To increase our con…dence that the ge-
ographic interactions we are identifying with SDT occur through technology and not through these
alternatives mechanisms, we introduce another control that we call spatial distance from (other
countries’) income (SDI). SDI is de…ned in an analogous way to SDT but rather than computing
it with other countries’adoption, we use other countries’(log) per capita income. Formally, SDI is
de…ned as

                                                             X
                                                y   ct   =           dck ykt :
                                                             8k6=c

       The controls we add in equation (1), and below in Section 2.8, are a way of addressing, in an
imperfect way, the re‡ection problem (see Maski, 1993) that arises in our speci…cation. Of course,
there might be other geographic interactions that a¤ect the adoption dynamics in a country. Given
the scope of our study in terms of number of countries, technologies, and time, it is extremely hard
(and impossible given our data) to identify exogenous changes in SDT and their e¤ect on adoption
dynamics. Hence, we have to rely on the argument that it is hard for us to think of variables that
a¤ect di¤usion, that are geographically correlated, that change over time according to the patterns
we uncover below, and that are not correlated with income (and therefore captured by SDI). In
Sections 2.8 and 4, we further explore the data to uncover new features of the relationship between
SDT and di¤usion. These features further constrain the set of potential omitted variables that can
account for our …ndings by forcing them to be technology-speci…c and to present stringent time-
varying patterns. Still, if such variables existed, they could be in‡uencing our results and we could
be confounding the e¤ect of di¤usion with the e¤ect of these other variables. In Sections 4 and 5
  16
     That is the reason why our …ndings are robust to various speci…cations of SDT as shown in Appendix A.

     The gravity equation that has proven to be an accurate way to predict bilateral trade ‡ows, T Rc;c0 , between
countries, is given by

                                                           dc;c0
Taking logs and adding across all other countries, we obtain
                                                        X                        X
                              trct = + 1 yct + 2             yc0 t +         3        dc;c0 +   ct :             (3)

Note that the regressors in (3) are captured by the controls in (1). In particular, the log income term controls for
the e¤ect of own income, the country …xed e¤ect controls for the distance term and, when there are many countries,
the time dummies basically capture the average income of the other countries. Hence, SDT identi…es e¤ects distinct
from standard gravity e¤ects.
   19
      We explicitly explore the relevance of this hypothesis for technology di¤usion below.



                                                              8
we show that a simple parsimonious model of technology di¤usion can capture well the pattern we
…nd in the data. This, we believe, lends further credibility to our interpretation of the technology
di¤usion patterns we document in the data.
     It is important to be aware that there is a potential endogeneity bias concern in the estimation
of the regression in (1). Speci…cally, adoption in country c enters in the construction of the SDT
                                                                       j
of the other countries. If SDT a¤ects adoption (i.e.                   4   6= 0), then the adoption levels of the
other countries will also be a¤ected by adoption in c: But because SDT in c is computed using
                                                                                                                      j
adoption in the other countries, it will indirectly be a¤ected also by adoption in c. If in reality                   4
                                                                                                  j
is negative, the endogeneity of SDT is likely to introduce a negative bias in                     4:   This is the case
because a higher adoption in country c;       xjct ;   increases SDT in the other countries which, because            j
                                                                                                                      4
is negative, should result in smaller adoption, xtkt ; which in turn leads to a smaller SDT for country
c:
     There are two reasons to believe that this bias is not a signi…cant concern in practice. First,
when the number of countries in the sample is large, the e¤ect of a country’s adoption on the
                                                                                  j
other countries SDT is negligible. Second, under the null (i.e.                   4   = 0) there is no endogeneity
bias and so the standard test to reject the null is still valid. Still, in Appendix B we conduct some
back-of-the-envelope calculations and show that even in regressions where we use smaller samples,
the endogeneity bias generates less than 0.3% of the standard deviation in SDT and can account
for less than 3% of the magnitude of the estimated coe¢ cients. We conclude that the estimates of
 j
 4   reported below are not signi…cantly a¤ected by an endogeneity bias.

2.1    Empirical …ndings
Our empirical approach is ‡exible and we shall take advantage of this ‡exibility in several ways.
We …rst investigate the presence and strength of geographic interactions in technology adoption
in various sectors and country samples. We are also able to disentangle the nature of geographic
interactions in adoption by decomposing the SDT variable along several dimensions.

2.2    Pooled regressions
We start by running regression (1) in our full sample of countries. Table 3 reports the estimates of
the e¤ects of SDT on technology adoption in our four speci…cations. The column labeled Speci…ca-
                                            j
tion 1 reports the estimate of              4   in the …rst speci…cation, where only the e¤ect of SDT is constant
across technologies. This is the most ‡exible speci…cation. We …nd a negative, signi…cant (at the
1% level) e¤ect of SDT on a country’s adoption. As discussed above, this suggests that countries
that are far from adoption leaders tend to adopt new technologies more slowly than countries that

   Each column corresponds to one speci…cation of regression (1). Speci…cations 1 and 3 allow for technology-speci…c
SDI coe¢ cients. Speci…cation 0 is the only one that does not include the SDI controls.

are close. From the statistics in Table 2, it follows that the magnitude of this e¤ect is economi-
cally relevant. In particular, a reduction of one standard deviation in SDT leads to an increase in
adoption by 17% of one standard deviation.
                                                                                          j
       In the …rst column, labeled Speci…cation 0, we report the estimate of              4    in a regression that
does not include the SDI control (in Speci…cation 1 SDI is included but it is allowed to vary
by technology, we denote this by T.S., for ‘technology speci…c’, in all tables). Comparing the
…rst two columns it seems clear that controlling for SDI does not reduce the estimate of geographic
interactions in technology. Columns 3 through 5 show that the e¤ect of SDT on technology adoption
is robust across the four speci…cations we explore. Columns 3 and 4 explore the sectoral variation in
geographic interactions in adoption. Transportation is the default option. Therefore, the coe¢ cient
of SDT for transportation technologies corresponds to the …rst row. The rows labeled “SDT
Com.” and “SDT Ind.” report the di¤erential coe¢ cient of SDT for communication and industry
technologies, respectively, relative to the coe¢ cient for those in transportation. The ranking of the
coe¢ cients of SDT on di¤usion across technologies is not robust. In Speci…cation 3, the strongest
e¤ect is in communication technologies, while in Speci…cation 4, the strongest e¤ect of SDT on
technology di¤usion is found in transportation technologies.

2.3      The importance of geography for rich and poor countries
After showing the signi…cance of geographic interactions in adoption dynamics, one may wonder
whether their relevance is uniform across countries. To explore this question, we split the countries
in our sample in two groups depending on whether in 1990 their income per capita was above or
below 12000 dollars according to the estimates in Madison (2005).22 Then we run regression (1)
separately in both subsamples.
       Tables 4 and 5 report the estimates for the sample of rich and poor countries, respectively. The
e¤ect of SDT on a country’s adoption is signi…cant both for rich and poor countries. Still, it is
signi…cantly larger for rich than for poor countries implying that distance from adoption leaders
slows down adoption more in rich countries than in poor ones. There are also di¤erences in the
sectors where geographic interactions in adoption are most relevant. For poor countries, we observe
stronger e¤ects of SDT on a country’s adoption of communication technologies. For rich countries,
                                                                                  j
it depends on the speci…cation. In Speci…cation 3, the estimates of               4   are highest in industry while
in the fourth speci…cation they are highest in transportation.

2.4      Decomposing SDT
A natural next step consists in exploring whether the characteristics of the countries with whom
a country interacts also matter. To investigate this possible dependence, we decompose the SDT
variable in two parts. Namely,
                                                         X
                                     xjRICH
                                       ct   =                      dck xjkt ;
                                                 8k6=c & k2RICH


and

                                                         X
                                    xjPctOOR =                     dck xjkt ;
                                                 8k6=c & k2P OOR

where xjRICH
        ct   captures the geographic interactions in adoption with rich countries and xjPctOOR the
interactions with poor countries. Note that, for all countries, xj ct = xjRICH
                                                                          ct   + xjPctOOR : The SDI
variable can be decomposed in an analogous way.
       Table 6 estimates regression (1) allowing for di¤erent coe¢ cients in the rich and poor com-
ponents of SDT. The data again speaks clearly. Adoption interactions with rich countries a¤ect
technology adoption between four and …ve times more than interactions with poor countries. In-
cluding a similar decomposition for SDI does not a¤ect signi…cantly the estimates of the e¤ects
of the two SDT terms. Since adoption leaders are rich countries, we interpret these …ndings as
evidence that it is particularly detrimental to be far from adoption leaders.

2.5      Longitude vs. latitude
Jared Diamond conjectured in his 1997 best-seller book “Guns, Germs and Steel” that, due to
the speci…city of crops to particular climates, technologies have di¤used along a given latitude
rather than across latitudes. Our simple econometric framework can be adapted to test Diamond’s
hypothesis. In particular, we can compute separate SDT variables using distances in the east-west
dimension (SDT EW) and in the north-south dimension (SDT NS). Diamond’s hypothesis is that
distance along the north-south axis slows down technology di¤usion more than distance along the
east-west axis. Therefore, if Diamond’s hypothesis is correct, we should observe a higher e¤ect of
SDT NS on adoption than of SDT EW.
       We start by introducing separately the two SDT terms in Table 7. We …nd that the coe¢ cient on
SDT across latitudes (SDT NS) is higher than SDT across longitudes (SDT EW). In all regressions
we include SDI terms that use the same measures of distance as the corresponding SDT term. The
absolute and relative size of the e¤ects of SDT NS and SDT EW on adoption is robust to whether
the coe¢ cient of the SDI terms varies or not across technologies.

       In Table 8 we compare the spatial distance interactions across latitudes and longitudes. As
hypothesized by Diamond, being in a distant latitude is a higher barrier to the di¤usion of tech-
nologies than being in a distant longitude. The estimates imply that distance across latitudes slows
down adoption approximately forty seven times more than distance across longitudes!
       Con…rming the Diamond hypothesis in a sample of technologies without any crops is somewhat
surprising. Actually, other than tractors, our sample does not contain any agricultural technology.
Clearly, Diamond’s rationale for the greater importance of latitude distances for technology di¤usion
is not relevant for technologies such as cars or telephones which can work equally well at di¤erent
latitudes or longitudes. Providing and testing alternatives explanations for this …nding is beyond the
scope of this paper. However, we can advance one hypothesis that may be worthwhile investigating
in future work. Namely, the di¤usion of early agricultural technologies could have created a series
of networks and trade routes along latitudes that have been used since then for the di¤usion of

    Each column corresponds to either Speci…cation 1 or 2 of the regression in (1). SDT and SDI are computed using
distance either along longitude (…rst two columns) or along latitude (third and fourth columns).

future research.

2.6    Early adopters
We focus next on the countries that adopt each technology relatively early. For each technology,
we de…ne early adopters as the 15 countries with earliest data on adoption and track them until
the end of the sample. Speci…cally, we limit the left hand side variable to observations from early
adopters and we compute the SDT and SDI variables using only information from countries that
are early adopter.27 This exercise is relevant because, by design, the panel used in the estimation
and in constructing the interactions variables is roughly balanced (there is still the possibility that
a country drops from the sample, but this is not a signi…cant concern in CHAT). Therefore, this
exercise may provide reassurance that the geographic interactions in adoption we have uncovered are
robust to controlling for the sample of countries considered. In addition, early adoption dynamics
may be interesting in themselves.
    Table 9 reports the estimates of (1) for early adopters. Qualitatively the results are the same as
when studying the full sample. The coe¢ cient of SDT is negative and signi…cant, and it is largest
for transportation technologies. However, there are signi…cant quantitative di¤erences between the
estimates reported in Tables 3 and 9. The estimates of the geographic interactions in adoption
for early adopters (with other early adopters) are four times larger than the equivalent e¤ects for
the full sample. This should not be surprising since early adopters are rich countries and we have

     SDT NS and SDI NS are computed using distance along latitudes. SDT EW and SDI EW are computed using
distance along longitudes. In Column 1, SDI NS and SDI EW vary by technology.
  27
     The smaller sample of countries makes the potential endogeneity problem raised above a more relevant concern.
In Appendix B we calculate a bound on the e¤ect of this endogeneity bias. We …nd that the true coe¢ cient can be
larger than the coe¢ cient reported by only 0.000022. Given the magnitude of the estimated coe¢ cients reported in
Table 7, this proves the endogeneity bias essentially irrelevant in practice.

2.7    Discussion
So far, our exploration has identi…ed geographic patterns of technology di¤usion and has shown,
with more to come in the rest of the paper, that these patterns are general to the extend that they
hold for a large number of countries and technologies. However, as argued above, interpreting the
source of these patterns is not obvious. Even though our …ndings are consistent with the presence
of signi…cant geographic interactions in adoption, the correlation between SDT and adoption might
just re‡ect the omission of some relevant driver of adoption that presents the appropriate cross-
country correlation. The shadow of this possibility is impossible to rule out completely. However, we
can perform further exercises that inform us about the nature of the geographic di¤usion patterns
we have uncovered.
    The …rst exercise consists of studying the robustness of the our …ndings to controlling for some
of the variables that have been previously documented as drivers of adoption. Though the number
of potential controls is unlimited, relatively few variables have been identi…ed empirically as drivers
of technology di¤usion. The cross-country literature, by-and-large, has been centered on three

     Each column corresponds to a speci…cation of the regression in (1) for the balanced sample of early adopters.
SDT and SDI are computed only with early adopters. In Speci…cations 1 and 3, the coe¢ cient of SDI can vary by
technology.

variables: human capital, institutions, and trade openness.29
       We introduce these drivers of technology, zct ; in our regressions in two ways.30 First, we include
them as controls in regression (1) to allow for a direct e¤ect of a country’s level of z in its technology
                                                                                                        j
level. Note that the bias from omitting these controls may generate the estimates of                    4   we estimate.
In addition, the return to adopting a technology may be a¤ected by its neighbors level of z (e.g.
the more open they are the higher the returns to adoption). To control for this possibility, we
construct spacial distance from other countries z’s for the three controls (human capital, openness,
and democracy) in the same way we have constructed SDT and SDI.

       Table 10 through 12 present the results from introducing these controls one at a time and Table
13 introduces all three at once. The main …nding is that the importance of SDT in regression
(1) does not diminish by controlling for other drivers of technology or for the spatial distance

from other drivers. The only control that reduces somewhat the estimate of                          4   is democracy,
in the speci…cations where we allow the coe¢ cient of democracy and SD-democracy to vary by
technology (see Table 11). On average, the coe¢ cient of both democracy and SD-democracy are
positive suggesting that competition in the political system favors technology di¤usion but that
a country does not bene…t from being close to other democracies. Human capital and trade are

     See, for example, Caselli and Coleman (2001) for human capital, Comin and Hobijn (2008) for institutions, Coe
and Helpman (1995) for trade and Comin and Hobijn (2004) for all three.
  30
     The data on democracy comes from Polity IV. In particular we use the “Polity2” variable which measures the
degree of competition in the political system. Data on trade openness comes from the Penn World Tables 7. in
particular we use the variable "openc" which measures the share of exports plus imports over GDP. The data on
human capital comes from CHAT which contains data on enrollment rates in secondary education. The data on
human capital and democracy goes back to the beginning of the 20th century, while the data on openness starts in
1960.

drivers of technology adoption in the literature suggests that SDT is introducing a new source of
variation in di¤usion dynamics.

    The relationship between SDT and adoption is pervasive. Throughout the paper we show that
the patterns we identify hold for many diverse technologies and for a variety of country subsamples.
How likely are these patterns to arise from the omission of a relevant driver of adoption in regression
(1)? The answer depends on whether the identity of the countries where technology di¤uses faster
and more slowly is the same across technologies or not. If the rankings of countries based on
                                                                                  j
their speed of di¤usion are the same across technologies, the estimates of        4   we have observed
could be generated by a country-level (omitted) variable that presents the appropriate correlation
with di¤usion, the appropriate cross-country correlation, and which is not correlated with our
controls. Instead, if the country rankings in terms of the speed of di¤usion di¤ers signi…cantly across
technologies, then the required pattern of omitted variables needs to also be technology-speci…c.
Given the number of technologies we study, the odds of this being the case are signi…cantly lower.

    A few examples may help illustrate the nature of our …ndings. Take the case of aviation cargo.
The countries where our measure of adoption has increased the most over the period studied are
Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium and France. Clearly, these countries are geographically close to
others where the technology has di¤used fast. Two of the countries where it has di¤used most slowly
are Brazil and Australia which, in the balanced sample, are among the furthest from the fast di¤u-
sion area. Tractors, whose sample covers mostly developing economies over the period 1961-2000,
also di¤used slowly in Australia, as well as in Argentina and Bolivia, while, over this period, they
can vary by technology.


                                                    19
di¤used faster in sub-saharan Africa (Burkina Faso, Botswana, Angola). These examples illustrate
the correlation between a neighbor’s di¤usion experience and a country’s own experience. But they
beg the following question. Does technology systematically di¤use more slowly in Australia? The
answer is negative. Raillines is a technology that di¤uses relatively fast over the period studied
(1876-1914) in Australia. Interestingly, Australia is close to some of the countries in our sample
where raillines di¤used fast over this period (e.g. Japan and Sri Lanka) and far from others where
it di¤used more slowly (e.g. Egypt and UK).
    To investigate more systematically adoption experiences across technologies, for each technology
we rank countries according to the increment in adoption between the …rst and last year in the
balanced sample. Then, we compute the pairwise correlation between country rankings for each pair
of technologies. The average number of countries that coincide in a pair of technology rankings is 7.
That is, on average, there are 8 non-coincident countries when comparing the samples for a pair of
technologies. The average correlation among the country rankings between technology pairs is 0.19.
When we weight the pairwise correlations by the number of observations the average is only 0.22.
These low correlations suggest that countries with faster di¤usion for a particular technology might
experience slower di¤usion for others.34 Hence, a technology-speci…c pattern of omitted variables is
needed to account for the negative correlation between SDT and adoption that we document. This
…nding, we believe, signi…cantly raises the bar for the omitted variable explanation of our results,
and supports our claim that there are important geographic interactions in adoption.


3     The simplest model
3.1    Description
We now present a simple mechanical model to represent and analyze the forces we have uncovered
so far. A model can also help us parametrize the e¤ects we …nd in the data and can point to
some new hypothesis to test. For these purposes we want to propose the simplest theory of human
interactions that can accommodate the temporal and geographic e¤ects that are present in the
data. The theory we propose is a theory of social interactions in which agents meet randomly with
other agents and adopt new technologies if the agents they meet have already adopted (similar to
the mechanism in Eaton and Kortum, 1999, and Lucas, 2009). We also assume that agents meet
more frequently agents that are close by. The model speci…es stochastically who do agents meet
and when do they adopt new technologies. Agents make no decisions. The result is a mechanical,
mathematical description of adoption rates over time and space. Adoption dynamics are governed
by the rate of meetings among agents ( ) and the decay in the meeting probability over space ( ).
These are the two key parameters we estimate for each technology in Section 5.
  34
     Note that this is only the case for the change in adoption. For the level of adoption Comin, Hobijn and Rovito
(2006) …nds a much larger correlation.

3.2       Formalization
Consider an economy where a mass N of agents are located uniformly in space. Space is given by
the closed interval [0; 1]. Time, t = 0; 1; ::: is discrete. We consider the di¤usion of a technology
that is …rst adopted at time t = 0. Let G (0; `; t) denote the fraction of agents at location ` and
time t that have not adopted the technology. The fraction of agents that have adopted is, therefore,
given by G (1; `; t) = 1            G (0; `; t).
       Agents meet randomly with                       agents per period. We assume that the new technology strictly
dominates the old one, so if an agent meets someone that has adopted the new technology already,
he adopts immediately. A meeting between two agents that have not adopted does not lead to any
technology upgrading. The parameter                              governs the frequency of meetings and therefore determines
the speed of technology adoption.
       Agents meet more frequently with agents that locate close to them. In particular, the probability
that an agent at location ` meets an agent at location r is e                                      j` rj   times lower than the probability
of meeting an agent that lives at `: The parameter                                   governs the importance of space for technology
adoption. A high           implies that agents meet with agents far away from them very infrequently and
therefore that di¤usion is very localized.
       The probability of not adopting in period t + h conditional on not having adopted in period t
at location r is then given by
                                                                           "R 1                                           #       h

                                    =             ln             G (0; `; t) e               d`        ln                     e                   d` :   (4)

       The above equation implies that if G (0; `; 0) < 1 for some interval of positive Lebesgue measure
L 2 [0; 1], G (0; `; t) < 1 for all ` and t and G (0; `; t) is increasing over time for all `. That is, if a
non-trivial number of agents adopted in period t = 0, then the technology di¤uses to all locations
and adoption increases over time at all locations.
       The e¤ect of geography enters the model only through the distribution of the …rst adopters,
G (0; ; 0) : To illustrate this, consider an example without geography where G (0; `; 0) = g < 1 for
all `. So the same fraction of agents in all locations have already adopted at time zero. Then
@ ln G (0; `; t) =@t =       ln G (0; `; t) so @ ln G (0; `; 0) =@t =                         ln g: One can then guess and verify that
                                                                                                                t                            t
the solution of the di¤erential equation is given by G (0; `; t) = ee                                               ln g      = g e :35 In this example
  35                                (t) ln g
       Guess that G (0; `; t) = e              , so ln G (0; `; t) =     (t) ln g and so

                                                         @ ln G (0; `; t)            @ (t)
                                                                          =                ln g:
                                                               @t                     @t
                                                                                                           t                          t
Hence,      (t) = @ (t) =@t and so             (t) = e t : This implies that G (0; `; t) = ee                  ln g
                                                                                                                        = ge :

    The example above eliminates the importance of space using two assumptions. First, assuming
that the number of meetings is independent of the location ( is constant). An assumption we will
maintain throughout. Second, it assumes that the density of adoption at t = 0 is uniform. This
second assumption is unrealistic and should be modi…ed. Initial adoption is in general concentrated
geographically. For example, it is probably concentrated close to the inventor of the new technology.
Therefore, a natural way to add geography is to add heterogeneity in initial conditions. In Section 5
we do this by estimating the variance of initial adopters from di¤usion dynamics and then comparing
this variance with the one we observe in the data. However, to illustrate the implications of the
model, the simplest way is to start with an interval of locations that adopts initially, while all other
areas start with no adoption whatsoever. Formally, the initial conditions now are
                                                             (
                                                                 g < 1 for ` 2 [0; a]

    The resulting dynamics are more complicated than before and cannot be fully solved analytically.

for all ` and so for a < ` < `0 , @ ln G (0; `; 0) =@t < @ ln G (0; `0 ; 0) =@t. Since G (0; `; 0) is decreasing
in `, this implies that @ ln G (0; `; t) =@t < @ ln G (0; `0 ; t) =@t; and thus

                               @ 2 ln G (0; `; t)

The previous arguments result in the following two implications:
    Implication 1: The fraction of non-adopters is lower in locations closer to the source of
innovation.
    Implication 2: The fraction of non-adopters declines proportionally faster in locations closer
to the source of innovation.
    Since this process implies that in the limit all locations adopt fully so G (1; `; t) = 1 for all `,
we can also conclude that:
    Implication 3: The e¤ ect of distance on the level of adoption vanishes over time.
    The parameters       and     a¤ect the growth in the fraction of adopters as well as their level. It
is easy to conclude from equation (4) that

                                                     @ 2 ln G (0; `; t)

Therefore, the larger     the faster adoption grows over time. It is harder to draw analytically other

them with the help of numerical examples. Figures 1 to 3 show three examples with                                                                                                                                                  = 0:05 and

of adopters over space in 10 di¤erent time periods, with equal intervals between them. The right
panel represents the density of adopters over time for 10 points in space (again, equally spaced).
                          The results are clear, intuitively, and expected: First, the density of adopters decreases as we
move away from `, and the slope (in logs) decreases with time. The slope increases in absolute
value with . Second, in all locations adoption increases monotonically over time, with the fraction
of non-adopters falling proportionally slower in locations farther away from the initial innovation
(in the examples ` = 0). Finally, the growth rate of adoption increases with the number of meetings
per period, :

                            The regressions presented in Section 2 show that Implications 1 and 2 are consistent with the
data. In particular we found that the coe¢ cient on SDT in (1) is negative and signi…cant. We now
proceed to contrast the other prediction. In particular, we are interested in Implication 3, which
tells us that the e¤ect of SDT on adoption should vanish over time. This prediction is speci…c to
the fact that agents that have adopted a technology can use it repeatedly in the future, and do
not require any future interactions with adopters. In our view, this is a fundamental feature that
distinguishes technological ‡ows from migration, trade, or FDI ‡ows.

data. In particular, in 13 out of 20 technologies in the unbalanced sample, and in 19 out of 20 in

of technologies in both the unbalanced and balanced samples have negative estimates of aj ; positive
estimates of bj and estimates of cj that often are close to zero and are almost always smaller (in

    The time-varying pattern of the estimates of j4 that we uncover contrasts with the evidence from gravity equations
that the elasticity of trade with distance has increased over time (Head and Mayer, 2011). This further suggests that
the geographic interactions in adoption we are identifying are distinct from traditional geographic trade interactions.

5    Structural estimation
After exploring the presence of geographic interactions in adoption in the data with a reduced form
speci…cation, it is informative to study the spatial di¤usion of technology in a more structured way.
In particular, a structural estimation may serve two purposes. First, it allows us to understand
whether a model as stylized as ours can generate key features of the di¤usion patterns we observe
in the data. Second, it helps identify deep parameters that in our model govern the frequency
of interactions between agents and how geographic distance a¤ects the probability of a successful
interaction. These parameter values can in turn be used to quantify spatial growth models, as in
Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg (2011).

         We consider a sample of 15 countries and locate them evenly spaced in the unit interval so that
  their locations can be indexed by j = f1; 2; :::; 14; 15g.40 As we have seen in the simulations,
  geography matters for the di¤usion of technology. In particular, di¤usion dynamics are a¤ected by
  the location of adoption leader. We place the leader in the middle of the interval (i.e. j = 8).
         When bringing the model to the data we need to specify three initial characteristics of the
  modeled economy: the length of the geographic area, the initial adoption level for the leader, and the
  initial adoption level for the followers. We set the length of the interval of locations in the model to
  the maximum distance across countries in the balanced sample for each technology. This calibration
  is important to generate SDT variables with similar variance as in the data. Furthermore, with
  this calibration, we can interpret our estimates of           as implying that the probability of a meeting
  declines by a factor of e      for every additional 1000 Kms of distance between agents.

       This sample size corresponds to the balanced panel we have used above. In our structural execises we focus on
  this sample because simulating the unbalanced sample has the additional complexity of countries entering the sample
  at di¤erent times.

         We recognize that while di¤usion in the model is measured by the percentage of adopters, CHAT
  variables measure the amount of output produced with the technology (per capita) or the number
  of units of the technology (per capita). The di¤erence between adoption measures in the model and
  data is that the data includes an intensive margin (i.e. number of units of technology per adopter)
  that in the model is absent. We make the model and data comparable by introducing an intensive
  margin speci…ed as a log-linear function of income. Since the baseline regression in (1) already
  controls for log income, adding an intensive margin amounts to just adding a technology-speci…c
  constant. We compute this constant from the leader’s adoption (in CHAT) in the terminal period,
  T . In particular, in the model, as time goes to in…nity, the fraction of adopters goes to 1. Therefore,
  the (log) intensive margin, xj ; is equal to


                                                      xj = max xjiT .

   Given our calibration of the intensive margin, xj ; the initial (log) fraction of adopters in the
leading country is given by
                                            max log Gji0 = max xji0                       xj ;                               (7)

where maxi xji0 is the maximum (log) adoption level in CHAT for technology j in the initial year.
   In the data, followers di¤er in their initial adoption levels in the initial year. In order to capture
this initial heterogeneity we set the (log) of the share of initial adopters to
                               P   j

   We then use our model of di¤usion to generate time-series of the share of adopters, Gjit , asso-

the model and the data.

   To compute the model’s counterpart to                        4t   we proceed as follows. First, we compute the model
time-series for SDT (SDT M ) as,
                                                                          X

                                                                                 x
                                                                          k6=i

                                                  j
   Then, the model’s counterpart to               4t   is given by the estimated ~ jt from the following regression:
                                                                     X

                                                                             t      it           it :                        (8)

   We choose       ; ; and     to minimize the sum of squared distances between the series of data

the evolution of the e¤ect of SDT on adoption well for nearly all technologies in our sample. The
average R2 is 89%, and the median 93%. For all technologies except one, ~ j is initially negative,      t

of geographic interactions in adoption and the decline in their intensity as technology di¤uses and

is quite intuitive. has two e¤ects on ~ jt : First, a higher probability of contacts, , increases the
unconditional probability of adopting a technology especially for those close to the adoption leader.
This force leads to a higher (in absolute value) initial estimate of ~ j . Second, a higher leads to
                                                                                  t
faster di¤usion and to a more even cross-country distribution of adoption which reduces the bene…ts
of the proximity to adoption leaders. As a result, a higher tends to reduce (in absolute terms)
estimates of ~ jt in subsequent periods. The steepness of the pro…le of j4t is particularly important
to identify because, as we shall see below, the other two parameters also a¤ect the level of ~ j ,                   t
  42
     The fact that typically ~ jt
                                does not converge to zero is due either to the fact that technologies have not fully
di¤used or that, with country …xed e¤ects, ~ jt does not need to asymptotically converge to zero. Intuitively, the
country …xed e¤ects introduce positive (asymptotic) dispersion on the RHS. Therefore, ~ jt cannot converge to zero as
the dispersion of the LHS goes to zero. ~ jt needs to converge to some negative value to undo the dispersion introduced
on the RHS by the country …xed e¤ects.

but they do not have a clear impact on the steepness of the pro…le. These e¤ects are evident in
Table 16 and Figure 6. Technologies with very high estimates of (e.g., internet, cellphones) tend
to have point estimates of ~ j that are initially large and, importantly, tend to exhibit very steep
                                t
pro…les for ~ jt . Conversely, technologies with low estimates of such as ships, tractors, or trucks
tend to have low (in absolute terms) initial values of ~ j and ‡atter pro…les.

       The parameter    also has two e¤ects on ~ jt : For     very high, contacts take place predominantly
with agents from the same      location.43    Therefore, there is little room for geographic interactions
in adoption and the estimates       ~j   are low (in absolute value). A reduction in delta allows for the
                                     t
possibility of contacts with other locations which opens the possibility of bene…ting from being
close to the leader. As a result, a decline in delta leads to higher ~ j (in absolute terms) when
                                                                              t
is high. This force can be seen at work, for example, when comparing the pro…les of ~ jt for radios
vs. telephones.44 For lower values of , a reduction in    reduces the relevance of location for the
frequency of contacts leading to lower absolute values of jt .

    Recall that we simulate a version of the model with a discrete number of locations.
  44
    Note that     and are similar in both technologies and the lower estimate of for telephones leads to larger
(absolute) values of ~ jt for telephones than for radios.


                                                      31
      Finally, a higher          tends to decrease (in absolute terms) the pro…le of ~ jt : Intuitively, hetero-
geneity in initial adoption increases the dispersion in SDT. This tends to reduce the coe¢ cients
~ j (in absolute value). This e¤ect is evident, for example, when comparing steel produced with
 t
electric arc furnaces (eaf) vs. blast oxygen furnaces (bof), or trucks with telegrams.
      Analysis of estimates –To gain further con…dence in our structural estimation, we can compare
the estimates of          with the actual cross-country dispersion in initial adoption among followers.
After all, our motivation to introduce             in the estimation was to account for initial heterogeneity
in adoption among followers. Reassuringly, the estimates of                    are quite similar to the standard
deviations in initial adoption levels. In particular, the correlation between the estimated and actual
cross-country dispersions in initial adoption is 0.67. The average dispersion in the data is 1.54, while
the mean of        is 1.17.
      The point estimates of            and    provide valuable information about the spatial and temporal
di¤usion processes. The average estimate of               is 0.15 with a median of 0.10. The average estimate
of is 2.50 with a median of 1.31. These estimates suggest that the probability of a meeting declines
by 73% (= 1        e   1:31 )   for the median technology for every additional 1000 Kms of distance between
agents.
      The estimates vary signi…cantly by technology. The standard deviation of the estimates of
across technologies is 0.19, while for           it is 2.84.    is highest for cell phones and the internet, and
lowest for telegrams and tractors.             is highest for ATMs, radios, and cars and lowest for aviation
passengers, internet and cellphones.

      The number of technologies (20) is probably too small to identify all the cross-technology
patterns in      and present in the data. However, careful examination of Table 16 suggests a positive
association between the estimates of               and the invention dates of technologies. The correlation
between these two variables is 0.48 and it is statistically signi…cant at the 5% level. That is, the
di¤usion of newer technologies has been fostered by more frequent contacts among agents and
therefore has been faster. Figure 7A plots the relationship after controlling for the sector. The

two percentage points higher. This …nding is consistent with the acceleration in the speed of
di¤usion of technologies documented in Comin and Hobijn (2010) using a very di¤erent model and
econometric techniques.47 In Figure 7B we conduct a similar exercise for : However, we do not
…nd an association between               and the invention date.


6         Conclusions
In this paper we have used a new data set of direct measures of technology to study technology
di¤usion across time and space. Our …ndings indicate that understanding technology di¤usion over
space is crucial to understand the speed of technology di¤usion. Countries that are far away from
the adoption leaders bene…t less rapidly from these technologies. In contrast to ‡ows of goods,
people, or investments, the spatial e¤ects we identify for technologies vanish over time. For most
technologies this implies that the e¤ect of geography is initially strong, decays over time, and
eventually disappears. As far as we know, this is the …rst paper to document these patterns in
adoption rates for a large number of technologies and countries.
         The empirical pattern of technology adoption over time and space is well accounted for by
a simple model of random interactions. The model determines a pattern of adoption for each
technology given two key parameters. The frequency of interactions (governed by             ) and the
spatial decay in the probability of interactions (given by ). Our structural estimation of the model
provides estimates of these parameters for each technology. These estimates show that interactions
are more frequent for more recent technologies. Perhaps more important is that our paper provides
estimates of structural parameters that can be used to inform spatial theories of growth (as in
Eaton and Kortum, 1999, and Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg, 2011). The speed and spatial scope of
technology di¤usion is a key component to the quantitative implications of these theories. Thus, we
hope that the evidence on the signi…cance of the spatial and temporal links in technology adoption
we document will prove helpful to stimulate future research in these areas.

7     Appendix A: Robustness to other speci…cations of SDT
This appendix illustrates the robustness of our basic results to di¤erent speci…cations of the SDT
variable. To this end, we compute the technology distance interactions, SDT, using the following
two alternative speci…cations. De…ne SDT2 and SDT3 as
                                                    X xkt

                                                    8k6=c


and

                                                 X                  dck
                                  SDT 3 = log(           e(xkt )          );
                                                 8k6=c

where, as above, xkt denotes the log of adoption per capita in country k at time t, and dck denotes
the distance (in thousands of km) between countries c and k; and               is a parameter that we calibrate.
As our baseline speci…cation, these alternatives are also sensible ways to capture the interaction
between adoption in other countries and how far they are from c. One important di¤erence is that
the presence of geographic interactions in adoption would lead to positive coe¢ cients (rather than
negative) of SDT 2 or SDT 3 on country c technology level.
    We use the alternative speci…cation to de…ne SDI for each of these formulations, and run
Speci…cation 1 of the pooled regression (1) for each of the three di¤erent measures of SDT. Table
18 presents the coe¢ cients of SDT. (We denote our baseline speci…cation SDT 1.) It is clear that
we obtain signi…cant geographic interactions from adoption regardless of the speci…cation. In the
context of SDT 3, we have tried various values of     and the results are not sensitive to its value.

    Table 19 reproduces the estimates of the coe¢ cients of the interaction terms when decomposing
them between the latitude vs. longitude parts for the two speci…cations of SDT presented above.
Again, it is clear from the table that, as in our baseline speci…cation of SDT, interactions along
latitudes have stronger e¤ects on adoption than along longitudes.

8      Appendix B: Upper bound of endogenity bias
In the appendix we detail the back-of-the envelope calculations about the impact of the endogeneity
                                                  j
of the SDT variable on the estimates of           4:   To this end, let’s suppose that country c0 s adoption level
increases by one standard deviation (2.46 in the balanced sample). Since the average distance in
the balanced sample is 7.5 (thousands km), the SDT of the other countries will increase on average
                                      j
by 18.45. Since the coe¢ cient        4   is -0.0007 (from Table 7, Column1), this should lead to an average
reduction in the adoption for the 14 countries other than c of 0.0129 (=                    0:0007   18:45). If the
average country is 7.5 thousand Kms from country c, then these declines in adoption will reduce
the SDT of country c by 1.35 (= 0:0129                  7:5   14). Since the standard deviation of SDT in the
balanced sample is 385, the endogenous increase of SDT represents just 0.35% (= 1:35=385) of the
observed dispersion of the independent variable (i.e. SDT).
      The small share of the dispersion of SDT generated by its endogeneity limits the magnitude
                                                   j
of the bias this has on the estimate of            4:     To get an approximate bound on the size of the bias,
suppose that SDT can be decomposed between the exogenous (SDTx ) and the endogenous (SDTn )
components as follows:


                                              SDT = SDT x + SDT n                                                  (9)
                                                                            j
To get a back-of-the-envelope bound on the e¤ect of SDTn on                 4;   let’s consider a univariate version
of regression (1) where adoption (x) is the dependent variable and SDT the independent one. In
that case,
                                                  ^ j = Cov(SDT; x)
                                                    4     2 (SDT )

where Cov stands for covariance and               2 (:)   is the variance. Using (9) and some straightforward
                     j
manipulations,       4   can be decomposed between the exogenous and the endogenous components as
follows:


                                      Exogenous               Endogenous
                                 z     }|     { z      }|       {
                         ^j      Cov(SDT x ; x) Cov(SDT n ; x)
                          4    =    2 (SDT )
                                               +    2 (SDT )
                                          x
                                 Cov(SDT ; x)                     (SDT n ) (SDT )
                                                           n
                               =    2 (SDT )
                                               + Corr(SDT    ; x)
                                                                   (SDT )    (x)

With the information we have, it is possible to bound the endogenous component (i.e. the second
                                                                                                  (SDT n )
term). Corr(SDT n ; x) must be higher than                 1. From our previous calculations,      (SDT )    = 0:0035:
And from the descriptive statistics in the balanced sample, (SDT )    2:46
                                                              (x) = 385 = 0:0064: Therefore, the
endogenous component of ^ j is higher than -0.000022. This represents 3% of the estimate we obtain
                                  4
       j
for    4   which is -0.0007.
