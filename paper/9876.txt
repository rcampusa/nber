                                           ABSTRACT


       This paper examines a natural experiment in which students at a large state university were
randomly assigned roommates through a lottery system. We find that on average, males assigned

to roommates who reported drinking in the year prior to entering college had one quarter-point lower
GPA than those assigned to non-drinking roommates. The 10th percentile of their college GPA is half
a point lower than among males assigned non-drinking roommates. For males who themselves

drank frequently prior to college, assignment to a roommate who drank frequently prior to college
reduces GPA by two-thirds of a point. Since students who drink frequently are particularly
influenced by frequent-drinking roommates, substance-free housing programs could potentially
lower average GPA by segregating drinkers. The effect of initial assignment to a drinking roommate

persists and possibly even grows over time. In contrast, students’ college GPA is not influenced by
roommates’ high school grades, admission test scores, or family background. Females’ GPAs are

not affected by roommates’ drinking prior to college. Overall, these findings are more consistent
with models in which peers change preferences than models in which they change endowments.

1. Introduction

          Although economics has historically taken preferences as given, focusing on the

effects of changing endowments, technology, or institutions, a recent theoretical literature

examines endogenous preference formation, in particular through peer influences and

through habit formation. For example, Becker and Murphy [1994] argue that current

consumption of addictive goods is complementary with future consumption, and Laibson

[2001] presents a cue theory of consumption, in which exposure to cues triggers addictive

cravings. Akerlof [1997] and Akerlof and Kranton [2000] model choice of identity.

          Universities seem an apt place to look for endogenous preference formation both

from peer influences and through habit formation. Students are separated from parents

and many of their previous peers, and have an opportunity to choose a new identity.

College is also a main locus of substance abuse, with 40% of students reporting binge

drinking at least once within the past two weeks (Wechsler et al., 2000).3 After tobacco,

alcohol is the most frequently abused drug in the United States and many addictions

develop in college.

          Universities also offer an opportunity to overcome some of the notorious

econometric problems associated with identifying peer effects. This paper examines a

natural experiment in which students at a large state university are randomly assigned

roommates through a lottery system.

          We find that on average, males assigned to roommates who reported drinking in

the year prior to entering college had one quarter-point lower GPA than those assigned to


3
 In their 1999 survey, Wechsler et al. defined binge drinking as "the consumption of at least five drinks in a row for
men or four drinks in a row for women during the 2 weeks before the completion of the questionnaire."

non-drinking roommates. Peer effects are concentrated at the bottom of the GPA

distribution: assignment of a roommate who drank in high school reduces the 10th

percentile of GPA by 0.43 points. Peer effects persist and perhaps even grow stronger

over time; assignment of a first-year roommate who drank prior to college reduces

second-year GPAs by almost a half point. Students who themselves drank frequently in

high school are most affected by frequent-drinking roommates; their average GPA

decreases by almost a full point on average if their roommate drank frequently prior to

college. These effects are strong relative to the effect of own academic background.

       Just as important as the peer effects we find are those we do not find. In contrast

to the strong effect of roommate drinking on males’ academic performance, we find no

evidence that females’ GPAs are affected by roommates’ drinking prior to college. We

also find no evidence that roommates' prior academic performance or socio-economic

background affects student GPA.

       Our findings are more consistent with models in which peer effects operate by

influencing preferences than with those in which peers change narrowly interpreted

endowments, for example by providing help with homework or by disrupting study. A

simple model in which peer effects work by disruption of study is hard to reconcile with

the persistence of peer effects into the second year of university despite the fact that the

vast majority of students change roommates from their first to second year of college.

This, together with the absence of peer effects from roommate prior academic

performance or socio-economic background, suggests that peer effects in this

environment work much more strongly through preferences than through narrowly-

interpreted endowments.


                                              2
       Given that students who themselves drank frequently prior to college are most

affected by frequent-drinking roommates, policies that tend to concentrate such students

together will reduce average GPA. This may be a side effect of many universities'

policies of allowing students to choose "substance-free" housing.

       This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature. Section 3

describes the institutional background and the data we use, and checks whether

roommates are randomly assigned. Section 4 examines the effect of randomly assigned

roommates' pre-college characteristics on college GPA. Section 5 examines how naïve

estimates of peer effects differ in a self-selected sample, arguing that in our context,

selection may actually lead to a downward bias on naïve estimates of peer effects.

Section 6 presents simple models in which roommate drinking affects GPA either by

disrupting study or through peer effects on preferences and habit formation. Section 7

argues that the effect of roommate drinking persists over time and is strongest at the

bottom of the GPA distribution and for people who themselves drank in high school,

consistent with the model of peer effects on preferences and habit formation. Section 8

analyzes the effects of different sorting patterns on average GPA. Section 9 concludes.

2. Literature

        Many studies argue that substance abuse is subject to substantial peer effects by

documenting a positive association between teenagers’ substance use and substance use

among their peers, controlling for other factors (e.g., Botvin et al. 1998, Cumsille et al.

2000, Leibsohn 1994, Brook et al. 1990, Reis and Reily 2000, and Wechsler et al. 1995).

        However, it is often difficult to empirically determine whether a correlation

between peers' outcomes is due to peer effects, to self-selection of similar peers, or to

common shocks affecting the peer group. Sacerdote (2001) makes an important advance

over the previous literature by exploiting random housing assignment to assess peer

effects among Dartmouth students.4 While Sacerdote finds strong evidence that

randomly-assigned roommates have correlated first-year GPAs, he finds only weak

evidence that students are affected by pre-determined roommate characteristics.5 The

distinction is important because an alternative interpretation of high correlation of

outcomes but weak and non-robust effects of pre-determined roommate variables on

GPA is that roommates experience common shocks. Sacerdote discounts this possibility,

arguing that his results are robust to controlling for the residence hall to which students

are assigned. However, common shocks could also occur at the room or floor level within

4
  Zimmerman (1999) examines the effect of roommate assignments at Williams College, but several data
limitations make it difficult to draw any firm conclusions from this work: 1) Students who were assigned
requested roommates were not excluded from the analysis; 2) the details of the roommate assignment
process are not known with certainty for much of the sample period; and 3) roommate assignment was only
random conditional on housing preferences, but the analysis does not control for housing preferences since
data on these preferences have been destroyed, so correlations between roommate outcomes could be due
to similarities between students who listed similar housing preferences.
5
  Sacerdote notes that “the effects on GPA from randomly assigned roommate background are modest in
size and statistical significance.” In particular, he assesses the effect of an academic background index
incorporating SAT scores and high-school performance on roommate outcomes. When entered linearly, the
roommate academic background index is not a significant predictor of GPA. If the roommate index is split
into dummy variables for the top 25%, bottom 25% and middle 50% of scores, it enters significantly, but
when one controls for own academic background, as seems appropriate, it is significant only at the 10%


                                                    4
residence halls. For example, roommates may be more likely to both get the flu or

mononucleosis at the same time. They may choose the same teaching assistant in classes

they take together, and if teaching assistants vary in ability or grading standards this will

produce correlation in roommates’ GPAs. Roommates will be subject to common shocks

to the extent that rooms may differ in size, quality, or soundproofing. Roommates will

have the same resident advisor on their floor, and variation in the extent to which resident

advisors support students with emotional problems, enforce alcohol policies, or

encourage students to take difficult classes could produce correlation in roommate

outcomes. Correlation between outcomes is thus insufficient to determine the extent to

which the underlying probabilities of various outcomes for a particular student depend on

the characteristics of the peers with whom she interacts. To see this, consider a

hypothetical set of students who each are indifferent between seeing a movie or studying

on a particular night, and hence flip a coin to decide. Suppose that roommates coordinate

their decisions based on a single coin flip, while non-roommates each flip their own coin.

In this example, roommate outcomes will be correlated, but a student’s probability of

studying does not depend on his or her roommate assignment. Yet unless pre-determined

peer characteristics affect outcomes, parents, students, and policymakers should be

indifferent to choice of peers. We therefore focus on the effect of roommates’ pre-

determined characteristics on student outcomes.

        The Dartmouth study finds that first-year roommates’ GPAs are correlated, but

their senior year GPAs are not correlated. This is consistent with the possibility that

correlation in first-year GPA is due in part to common shocks, such as flu or a bad


level. The effect of roommate academic background thus does not seem particularly robust in the
Dartmouth sample.

teaching assistant, with minimal long-run impact. In contrast, we find that the effect of

roommates’ high-school drinking on GPA persists over time, consistent with a habit

formation model.

       A further advantage of focusing on the effect of roommates’ predetermined

characteristics on student outcomes is that this approach sheds light on the channels

underlying peer effects. Our finding that roommate academic and socio-economic

background does not affect GPA but that roommate drinking prior to college strongly

reduces males’ college GPA suggests that peer effects in this context operate through

preferences rather than endowments, and points to a potential role for habit formation.

       A further difference between the studies is that in addition to the sample of

students who participated in the lottery process, we also have access to a sample of

students who selected their own roommates, which allows us to analyze the importance

of the selection problem in this context. Finally, our analysis differs from Sacerdote’s in

that we examine a large state university, which may have quite different social dynamics

than Dartmouth.




3. Institutional Background and Data

       This section reviews the institutional background of the university (sub-section

2.1) and the roommate assignment process (sub-section 2.2). It then confirms that the

data we use are consistent with random assignment of roommates (sub-section 2.3).




                                             6
3.1. Institutional Background

          Our data are taken from a large, academically strong, state university. Students at

the university performed well in high school, achieving an average aptitude test score

around the 90th percentile of the national distribution and an average grade point average

between 3.5 and 4.0. The university is only slightly above average in student

consumption of beer, wine and liquor6 and was never listed as one of the top twenty party

schools from 1997-2002 in the Princeton Review’s annual best 311 college rankings.

          Students at this university typically live in residence halls their first year at the

university, but then move off campus, either to apartments shared with other students or

to fraternities. A survey administered in the winter of 2002 to a sample of students who

entered the university in 1998-2000 and who were randomly assigned to their first-year

roommate found that 67% moved out of the dormitories by sophomore year, with 20%

joining fraternities. Fraternities are associated with heavy drinking: 73% of students in

the survey who joined a fraternity report drinking more than once a week over the past

year compared to 37% of students who never joined a fraternity, and 45% of students

who joined a fraternity report binge drinking more than once a week over the past year

compared to 25% of non-fraternity students.7 A rush process which involves a sequence

of fraternity parties takes place during students’ first year, but students do not usually

move into the fraternity until their second year. As discussed above, drinking is a major

problem in many U.S. universities. Since the increase in the legal drinking age to 21

made drinking illegal for the overwhelming majority of first-year college students,

  Data for the university was compared to aggregate national data [“CIRP/UMR National Results.” Updated 20 June
2001. <http://web.umr.edu/~assess/results/cirpdrht.html>. Cited June 22, 2002.].
7
  Binge drinking was defined according to Wechsler et al. (1999): the consumption of at least five drinks in a row for
men or four drinks in a row for women. These percentages reflect drinking after joining the fraternity.

universities have had to crack down on public drinking. One side effect has been to move

drinking inside students’ rooms, potentially increasing the extent to which students are

affected by their roommates’ drinking habits.

3.2. The Roommate Assignment Process

       A subset of first-year students at the university are assigned roommates randomly,

conditional on gender and a few housing preferences. Since our identification strategy

takes advantage of the roommate assignment process, it is worth reviewing this process.

First-year students can elect to live in an enrichment living center, in which case they

need to submit an essay to be considered for admission, or to select a specific roommate,

in which case the housing office will honor the request as long as it is mutual. Those who

opt for neither option and who meet the lottery deadline are assigned rooms randomly,

conditional on gender and four basic housing preferences: environment (substance-free

housing, non-smoking roommate, do not mind smoking roommate, and smoker), room

type (single, double, triple occupancy, and other), geographic area of campus, and gender

composition of hall and corridor. For some of these preferences, students could indicate a

first, second, and third choice.

       For students participating in the lottery, roommate assignment should be random,

conditional on gender and basic housing preferences. We call a combination of gender

and housing preferences (including first, second, and third choices when applicable) a

cell. In all regressions below, we control for the cell that a student has chosen.

       Our main sample (henceforth called the "lottery sample") consists of those

students who did not request a particular roommate, elected not to live in an enrichment

living center, met the lottery deadline, and were assigned to live with at least one

                                              8
roommate. Of the approximately 7,500 first year students from the 1997 and 1998

entering classes for whom we had data, 25% decided to live in enrichment living centers,

18% requested particular roommates, 30% lived alone as first year students, and 57% of

the students did not meet the lottery deadline, leaving 1,357 students in our sample. A

second group of students who requested their roommate will be used for comparison

purposes and is termed the "roommate request sample."

       Randomization within the lottery sample implies that our results will be internally

valid for this population but, to assess external validity, it is useful to compare lottery

participants to the population as a whole. Table 1 compares the lottery sample with the

whole sample of entering students and with the roommate request sample. Students who

were randomly assigned are fairly similar to those who were not, but the lottery sample

contains a slightly larger proportion of females than the other two samples and a much

smaller percentage of African-American students (3% in the lottery sample vs. 7% in the

whole sample and 10% in the roommate request sample). Lottery students perform

slightly better academically (as measured by cumulative GPA in both college and high

school), although they do not score higher on the admissions test.

       Of course, the fact that students made it into our sample suggests that they are

different in some ways from other students. The students in our sample are likely to have

few pre-existing social ties at the university, since they did not select a roommate. This

lack of pre-existing social ties may make them particularly susceptible to peer influences.

Moreover, at least some of those with a strong identity would have opted for an

enrichment learning center, and thus left our sample.




                                               9
          Our baseline data is based on administrative records and the Entering Student

Survey of the Cooperative Institutional Research Program (also known as the CIRP),

which was taken by 89% of students who entered the university in 1997-1998. Students

fill out the CIRP at the beginning of orientation, which is offered to incoming students in

weekly sessions throughout the summer. According to housing officers, very few

students will have met their roommate before filling in the survey.

          The Entering Student Survey contains a section in which respondents are asked

whether they undertook certain activities frequently, occasionally, or not at all during the

last year.8 The list of activities includes "Drank beer" and "Drank wine or liquor."9 We

classified as "frequent drinkers" the 15% of the population who answered "frequently" to

at least one of the two drinking-related questions. We classified as "occasional drinkers"

the 53% of the population who were not "frequent drinkers,” but answered "occasionally"

to at least one of the two drinking-related questions. Students who reported not drinking

beer, wine, or liquor in the last year were classified as "non-drinkers." There are only

small differences in self-reported high-school drinking behavior between males and

females; however, male and female students may have different interpretations of

“frequent” and “occasional” drinking.

          We use the term “roommate” to refer to the initial roommate who was assigned to

occupy the same room on the first day of the academic term. Our estimates thus have an

Intention to Treat (ITT) interpretation. Since the university does not allow roommate

changes during the first six weeks of classes (except for extreme cases involving

8
  99% of our sample students came straight from high school to college, so for most students the term “last year” refers
to their senior year in high school.




                                                          10
violence), and strongly discourages any roommate changes during the first year, less than

5% of students switch roommates during their first year. Hence using initial roommate

characteristics as instrumental variables for actual roommate characteristics would be

likely to increase slightly our estimates of peer effects.

            About 81% of students in our sample had only one roommate. For those students

with multiple roommates, roommate characteristics were defined as the average value of

each roommate’s characteristics if the characteristic was a continuous variable. Students

who had at least one roommate who drank frequently were coded as having a frequent-

drinking roommate. Students who had at least one roommate who drank occasionally but

no frequent-drinking roommate were coded as having an occasional-drinking roommate.

Sample sizes were too small to examine whether students are influenced by the average

of their roommates’ characteristics or by other measures (such as the minimum or

maximum) of roommate characteristics.

2.3. Random Assignment Checks

            Information from the university suggests that students from the lottery sample

with the same housing preferences and gender should be randomly assigned to their

roommates and residence halls. To verify this, we first interviewed housing officers and

reviewed the documentation of the computer software used to make housing assignments.

We then verified that initial roommates’ background characteristics were not significantly

correlated by running regressions in which student background characteristics (such as

admissions test score, high school GPA, parental background, high school activities,




9
    Response rates for these questions are above 98% of those who filled in the CIRP.

                                                            11
goals, views, etc.) were regressed on their initial roommates' average and a set of housing

preference cell dummies.10

          Given that the error terms in the regressions described above may not be normally

distributed, we assessed significance by comparing the coefficient from running the

regression on the actual data to the distribution of coefficients obtained from regressions

ran on 1,000 simulated samples. In each simulated sample, we matched each reference

student with a randomly chosen roommate from the pool of roommates originally

matched to reference students in the cell. We checked for correlation in 151 variables.

Ten out of 151 regression coefficients turned out significant for the lottery sample, out of

which seven had a positive sign and three had a negative sign. The distributions of the

coefficients and the t-statistics obtained from the simulations are approximately normal.

Our test which compares the regression results using the actual data to the simulated

distributions shows that 141 variables fall within the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles and 10

variables are out in the 5% tail of the distribution.11 If roommates were indeed assigned

randomly and the 151 characteristics were independent, then a calculation using the

binomial theorem shows that we should expect 10 or more variables to be in the 5% tail

with probability 22.5%. For plausible degrees of correlation, the probability would be

even greater.

          The test we employed has reasonable power. In the "roommate request" sample,

52 of 151 coefficients are in the 5% tail. In a set of artificial data where the top 10% of

10
   In performing these random assignment checks, we restricted the sample to contain each roommate pair only once.
Allowing students to appear both as a reference student and then as a roommate would induce an artificial negative
coefficient. To see this, note that in a cell with two observations, the match AB where A is the reference student and the
match BA where B is the reference student, a regression of own characteristics on roommate characteristics within the
cell will yield a negative coefficient because if a student has a higher level of the characteristic than the cell average
then his roommate has a lower than the cell average. Since many cells are small, this bias is significant.
11
   We find similar results using a standard t-test.

                                                           12
students in each cell in the reference sample and the roommate sample were matched

together and the remaining 90% were randomly matched, 18 out of 151 coefficients are

in the 5% tail of the simulated distribution. If characteristics were independent, this

would occur with probability 0.0006.




4. Effect of Roommates’ Pre-College Characteristics on College GPA

          The main outcome we examine in this paper is cumulative GPA at the end of the

summer of 1999, which corresponds to GPA at the end of the second year for the 1997

cohort, and to GPA at the end of the first year for the 1998 cohort. Controlling for cell

dummies ensures that we examine differences in outcomes among students who

expressed identical housing preferences, but were assigned roommates with different

backgrounds.

          In the lottery sample as a whole, neither roommates' academic background

variables (high school GPA and admissions test score12) nor roommates family

background (parental income and education) are associated with a student's college GPA

(Table 2).

          When males and females are grouped together, the point estimate of the effect of

roommates’ high school drinking on GPA is negative but insignificant (Table 2, columns

4 and 5). However, this average treatment effect conceals dramatic heterogeneity.


12
   Since some students took only the SAT, others took only the ACT, and some took both, we standardized test scores
based on concordance tables [Pommerich et al., 2000] and restandardized this measure by subtracting the sample mean
and dividing by the standard deviation of the sample. Hence the regression coefficients on this variable can be readily
interpreted as the change in the dependent variable associated with an increase of a standard deviation in admissions
test scores. For our sample, a standard deviation in admissions test scores is approximately equivalent to 110 points in
the SAT exam and to 2.7 points in the ACT exam.


                                                          13
          Males’ GPAs are reduced by 0.28 points by having a roommate who drank

frequently in the year prior to college and by 0.26 points by having a roommate who

drank occasionally (Table 3). This is equivalent to 0.46 standard deviations of a lottery

student's college GPA. For comparison, the effect of roommate drinking on college GPA

is slightly larger than the effect of a 1/2 point reduction in a student's own high school

GPA and is equivalent to the effect of 50 SAT points or 1.2 ACT points in the students’

own aptitude test. (This represents about 0.25 standard deviations of the national

distribution).13

          Since our drinking variables were constructed based on a survey in which the

students subjectively characterized their drinking during the last year into just three

categories: “frequent,” “occasional,” or “not at all,” roommate drinking is likely to be

measured with considerable error. The coefficient on this variable may therefore

understate the effect of roommate drinking on male students’ GPA. In particular,

respondents may have had very different views about what constitutes occasional and

frequent drinking, and this may account for the similarity of the coefficients on the two

variables. Moreover, the standard errors-in-variables problem due to classical

measurement error could be exacerbated if students who drink more frequently had a

higher subjective threshold for classifying themselves as “frequent” rather than

“occasional” drinkers. Given that the coefficients on our two drinking variables (frequent

drinking roommate and occasional drinking roommate) were similar, we also ran our

regressions grouping the two drinking variables into one. In this regression, the new

  We were not able to estimate precisely the effect of floor or building level drinking, but point estimates suggest that a
10-percentage point increase in the proportion of frequent drinkers in the corridor (building) is associated with a 0.03
(0.17) reduction in college GPA.

drinking variable had a very similar coefficient (-0.27) and a very high level of

significance (p-value=0.005).14

          Almost all students stayed enrolled after their first year, and thus remained in our

sample. Six students from the lottery sample were not enrolled in 1998, and 26 –

approximately 2% of the lottery sample - were not enrolled in 1999. For males, point

estimates from probit regressions of a dummy for enrollment on roommate drinking and

other controls suggest that having a roommate who drank occasionally prior to college

reduces the probability of being enrolled by one percentage point (Table 4). While this

effect is large relative to the less than 2% background probability of non-enrollment, it is

not statistically significant. Given that the overwhelming majority of students remained

enrolled, any attrition bias is likely to be small for mean outcomes.15

          One possible reason for the difference in results between males and females could

be that college-age males are simply more susceptible to peer influences than college-age

females. However, there may be some institution-specific factors as well. Since drinking

is reportedly more likely to take place in male than female rooms, a male with a drinking

roommate is more likely to be exposed to drinking than a female, and will have a harder

time avoiding cues or disruption. Moreover, considerable drinking takes place in

fraternities, and many first-year students attend a series of parties at fraternities to


14
   This specification check suggests that the results are not due to data mining. Further evidence against the data mining
hypothesis is provided by an alternative specification which allows more precise estimation, albeit at the cost of
potentially introducing some bias. All of our regressions control for a complete set of housing preference cells,
including up to three choices for some of the housing preferences. An alternative approach is simply to control for the
first choice on each dimension, i.e. to construct a more relaxed definition of cell by ignoring second and third choices.
This provides more degrees of freedom at the cost of potentially introducing some bias. But given that the
randomization checks still go through with this more relaxed cell definition, the bias introduced is not likely to be large.
When we use the relaxed cell definition that increases the number of observations per cell, the t-statistics on frequent
and occasional drinking roommates become –3.2 and –3.62 respectively.
15
   As discussed below, attrition bias may be more substantial at the bottom of the GPA distribution if students with very
low GPAs were more likely to drop out.

determine which ones they want to join. Males may be likely to attend fraternity parties

together with their first-year roommates.




5. Selection

       In many contexts, non-experimental estimates of the correlation between peers

would arguably yield stronger correlations than would be found by experimental

estimates. This will be the case to the extent that people who are similar on unobservable

characteristics choose to associate with each other. In our case, selection seems to operate

in the opposite direction. Although males in the lottery sample have lower GPA if their

roommate drank in high school, this is not the case in the roommate request sample

(Table 5), where students were likely to know each other prior to coming to the university

and chose to be roommates. A possible explanation is that students only make it into our

sample if they are accepted by the university, and do not matriculate at another

university. Within the roommate request sample, any negative effect of peers on

academic performance may have already occurred by the time the students apply to

college, and therefore would be picked up in admissions and matriculation decisions.

Thus, for example, if some students are affected adversely by having close friends who

drink heavily and others are not, then those who are adversely affected and perform

poorly in high school will not show up in our sample, since they will not have been

admitted to the university in the first place.

       Regressions of outcomes on outcomes also yield weaker effects in the roommate

request sample (Table 6). Point estimates in the lottery sample indicate a positive

contemporaneous association between own and roommate GPA, similar to that found by

                                                 16
Sacerdote, although the coefficients here are not statistically significant. Depending on

which covariates are included, an increase of one point in roommates’ GPA is associated

with a 0.045 to 0.124 point increase in own GPA for the whole lottery sample. Among

males, a 1-point increase in roommate GPA is associated with a 0.150 to 0.248 point

increase in own GPA, depending on covariates.16 For males in the lottery sample, a one

point increase in roommates' average GPA is associated with a 0.248 point increase in

one's own GPA, controlling for own high school grades, test scores, parental background,

and drinking. For the roommate request sample this coefficient is -0.031. This is

consistent with the hypothesis that any peer effects have already been incorporated in the

students’ high school grades and in the admissions decision.

         Selection may also explain why own drinking prior to college is not a stronger

predictor of college GPA (see, for example, Table 3). The effect of students’ high school

drinking may already be picked up in their high-school grades and in the admissions

decision. Taken together, these results suggest that selection bias in peer effects models

may be quite complicated, potentially being negative as well as positive.




6. Potential Reasons for Effect of Roommate Drinking Prior to College

         Several factors could potentially account for the negative effect on males’ GPA of

being randomly assigned a roommate who drank prior to college. We will not be able to

definitively test all potential hypotheses. In particular, the data do not allow us to test




16
   Sacerdote (2001) finds a one point increase in roommates’ GPA is associated with a 0.120 (SD=.039) increase in
students’ own GPA during their freshman year at Dartmouth.

whether students are affected by past roommate drinking or by current drinking.17 We

also cannot completely rule out the possibility that students are influenced by some

variable correlated with roommate drinking (rather than by roommate drinking itself),

although it is worth noting that the CIRP background survey provides rich information on

students’ background, attitudes, and behavior, and that we find strong effects of

roommate drinking, but no effects for other roommate characteristics, such as frequency

of television watching or degree of socializing.18 Rather than trying to fully exhaust all

potential explanations for the roommate drinking effect, we focus on two simple models

below. The first focuses on the possible disruptive effect of roommate drinking while the

second focuses on peer influence on preferences and on habit formation. In the first

model, roommate drinking affects the set of opportunities available to students, since

frequent drinking roommates make noise and don’t offer help with homework or

conversations about Kant over dinner. In the second model, roommate drinking affects

student preferences, rather than affecting the set of choices they face.



6.1. A Model of Disruption

     Consider a simple model in which students can spend their time in three different

types of activity: studying, drinking, or other activities which are not study but do not

17
   In Manski’s terminology, this is the inability to distinguish endogenous social interactions from exogenous social
interactions. So for example, our study cannot determine whether a program aimed at reducing alcohol drinking on
campus will have a multiplier effect.

18
  We found that roommate TV watching and roommate degree of socializing had no significant effect on own college
GPA. Furthermore, the effect of roommate drinking continues to be negative and significant even after controlling for
roommate TV watching or roommate socializing. We do not have a measure of drug use from the CIRP, but we
explored whether the roommate’s degree of “partying” prior to college had an effect on college GPA. We found that it
did have a negative and significant effect at the 10% level in some specifications, and that the roommate drinking
coefficients continued to be negative (and at similar magnitudes as in table 3) but only the occasional drinking
roommate coefficient was still statistically significant when we included the roommate partying variable in the
regression. We believe that the latter result may be due to students possibly interpreting “partying” as an activity that
involves drinking.

                                                           18
disrupt roommate studying (such as listening to music on headphones). Suppose students

i and j are roommates. Let pi denote student i’s probability of drinking, qi the probability

of studying, and hence 1 – pi – qi the probability of doing other things. Suppose that

effectiveness in study is reduced by µ by a drinking roommate, for example, because the

roommate is noisy when drunk. Alternatively, drinking itself could play no causal role

but people who drink could also tend to be noisy or play loud music and watch a lot of

TV. Student i’s first-year learning is then

                                      Li1 = qi (1 − µpj ).                                (1)

Thus, student i’s learning is reduced by roommate drinking in proportion to the extent

student i would otherwise have spent time studying:

                                        ∂Li1
                                             = − µqi                                      (2)
                                        ∂p j

and

                                        ∂ 2 Li1
                                                = −µ .                                    (3)
                                       ∂qi ∂p j



       Hence under the pure disruption model, students who themselves drink heavily

should be less affected by drinking roommates than students who study heavily. One

possible complication is that grades could be a non-linear function of study. If grades are

a very concave function of studying, then the negative effect of initial roommate drinking

might be greatest for students who don’t spend much time studying (for whom the

marginal effect of learning on grades is highest). However, it seems unlikely that the

concavity would be strong enough to offset the fact that students who spend little time

studying in any case are unlikely to have their study disrupted by roommate drinking.

                                              19
       If roommates stay together in their second year with exogenous probability α and

the choice of a sophomore-year roommate is otherwise independent of the first-year

roommate, second-year learning is

                                   Li 2 = C i + αqi (1 − µp j )                              (4)

where Ci is a constant reflecting the expected amount of learning student i would achieve

with a new roommate. In this case,

                                        ∂Li 2
                                              = −αµqi .                                      (5)
                                        ∂p j

       Data from a survey of students in later entering classes (1998-2000) suggest that

about 17% of students randomly assigned roommates through the housing lottery remain

with their roommate for more than two semesters. Setting α = 0.17, this simple

disruption model thus implies that the effect of initial roommate assignment on second-

year grades should be 17% of the effect on first-year grades.

       To the extent that some second-year courses build on material covered in first-

year courses, failure to learn during the first year could reduce capacity to learn during

the second year and thus hypothetically the negative effect of disruption by the assigned

freshman year roommate on second-year grades could be more than 17% as large as the

effect on first-year grades. However, while at least 25% of second-year courses have a

first-year prerequisite, the effect of initial assignment to a drinking roommate on second

year grades in classes for which there is a prerequisite is actually insignificantly positive,

while that in subjects without prerequisites is strongly negative. (We also find no

evidence that the extent of drinking by the initially assigned roommate affects whether

people take classes with prerequisites). Thus it seems that even a somewhat richer model



                                               20
which allowed for cumulative learning would suggest a much smaller effect of initial

roommate drinking on second-year grades than first-year grades.

       The disruption model also suggests that even in a sample of students who self-

select roommates, students with drinking roommates should obtain lower GPAs

conditional on pre-college academic performance and admissions decisions. This is

because even if the student socialized with his future roommate prior to college, the

drinking would be more likely to disrupt study when the students are roommates than

when they live at home, and hence the impact of the future roommate would not have

been reflected in grades prior to college.

       In summary, the pure disruption model suggests that 1) assignment of a drinking

roommate should most seriously affect students who spend a lot of time studying and

would otherwise have done well in school; 2) as a corollary, students who drink should

be less affected by roommate drinking than students who do not drink themselves; 3) the

effect of first-year roommate assignment on second-year grades should be approximately

0.17 times the effect of first year roommate assignment on first year grades; and 4)

assignment to a drinking roommate should be negatively correlated with college GPA

even in a self-selected sample.



6.2. A Model of Habit Formation and Peer Effects

   Having a drinking roommate could also potentially affect academic performance

through peer effects in preferences and through habit formation. The medical and

psychological literature suggests that alcoholism, which affects around 15% of the U.S.

population, has a strong genetic component but that it also responds strongly to



                                             21
environmental influences. More generally, alcohol consumption has cumulative effects

on all drinkers (Gardner and Lowinson [1993], Beatty et al. [2000], National Institute of

Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [2001]).

     Suppose that students are endowed initially with an idiosyncratic drinking propensity

d ∈ (0,1) . This could reflect either genetic susceptibility or the students’ environment

prior to college. Student i (with propensity di) obtains instantaneous utility

                                                                                 1 2

                                                                                 2

standard concave function incorporating both the utility of consumption and the disutility

of expenditure on alcohol. The C term captures peer effects under which students wish to

drink more if their roommate drinks more. The D term captures the possibility that

students who drank more last year may want to drink more this year. The form of our

utility function thus allows for the possibility that past drinking ( X it −1 ) and present

drinking (Xit) are complements, and for the possibility that peer drinking (Xjt) is

complementary with own drinking (Xit). The complementarity between past and present

drinking could represent either physical or psychological addiction or simply increased

alcohol tolerance. A process of reinforcement of past positive experiences can increase




19
  The coefficient on the quadratic term is simply a normalization, while the restrictions on the size of C
and di are required to guarantee the existence of an equilibrium. The assumption that a single student-
specific term, di, multiplies the entire term in brackets allows students to vary only along one dimension,
and is an analytical simplification; obviously in reality variation occurs along several dimensions. We
simply require correlation along these dimensions.

current desire to drink.20 Complementarity between roommate drinking and own drinking

similarly occurs if seeing others drink may be a cue which triggers cravings for drinking.

Laibson’s [2001] cue-theory of consumption offers a microfoundation for both types of

complementarity. We assume that students with greater drinking propensity are more

susceptible to addiction and more sensitive to cues from peer drinking.

     We consider a three period model (t=0, 1, 2, representing high school, first year of

college and second year of college). Each period each student i maximizes his utility

from alcohol consumption, taking Xit-1 and Xjt as given; we consider “naïve” students

who do not consider the effect of today’s alcohol consumption on preferences for future

drinking in deciding how much to consume today.21

     In period 0, students are in high school and have no roommate. Student i chooses Xi0

                        1 2
to maximize diXit –       Xit . Hence Xi0 = di. In period 1, the first year of college,
                        2

student i’s best response function is of the form

                                       X it = d i (1 + CX jt +DX it −1 )                               (7)

and in a Nash equilibrium with roommates choosing drinking simultaneously, student i

chooses drinking

                                       d i (1 + DX it −1 + Cd j (1 + DX jt −1 ))
                              X it =                                               .,                  (8)

21
    We expect that similar qualitative results would obtain if students place small enough nonzero weight
on future outcomes when making drinking decisions.

                        ∂d j

from own drinking, and since roommate drinking and own drinking are complements,

this increases own drinking.

     Now suppose that student learning is given in each period by

                                               Lit = Lit − γX it                                            (9)


where Lit is total potential learning.23

     The total effect of roommate initial drinking dj on own learning operates through

several channels since dj affects Xj0 ( = dj) as well as the parameters of the roommate’s

utility function. Using the chain rule,

22
   Note that it is not relevant to apply this model for habit formation for many repetitions or to consider
steady states of the process as t gets large. This is because Xit may get very large for students susceptible to
habit formation (Di positive) because of the presence of the Xit–1 term. We think of t as being small
(students are observed for at most three years).
23
   There is strong physiological, psychological and neurological support for alcohol-induced learning
impairment (Parsons [1998], Oscar-Berman et al. [1997], Parsons and Nixon [1998], Beatty et al. [2000]).
The functional form of the relationship between drinking and learning impairment (and between learning
and grades) is less clear. Linearity is assumed as in the disruption model for simplicity. Physiological
evidence (Evert and Oscar-Berman [1995], Parsons and Nixon [1998]) suggests the true relationship may
be concave, with the marginal effect increasing for higher consumption levels and the total effect
increasing with cumulative lifetime consumption. Incorporating this in our model would not change the
basic results and would reinforce the result that the most severe effects occur for frequent drinkers.

    Because of the multiple effects, explicit formulae for these partial derivatives are too

complicated to be useful. However, it is easy to check that all the partial derivatives are

positive, so learning in both the first and second year of university is negatively affected

by roommate drinking prior to college. Moreover, because of the complementarities in

drinking across students and across periods, it is also clear that these effects are

increasing in both roommate drinking propensity and own drinking propensity (so

empirically we will observe the greatest effect on learning for frequent drinking students

with frequent drinking roommates).

    Note also that under the model, the effect of initial roommate assignment may grow

over time even if roommates do not all stay together. To see this observe first that if

roommates stay together then X i 2 > X i1 > X i 0 = d i and X j 2 > X j1 > X j 0 = d j . (It is

so the effect of initial roommate drinking on learning grows over time. Given that not all

roommates stay together, overall the effect of initial roommate assignment may either

grow or shrink over time.

       The model of habit formation and peer effects in preferences implies that 1) the

negative effect of roommate pre-college drinking on own GPA will be greatest for those

who themselves drank in high school; 2) the effect of initial roommate assignment may

either grow or shrink over time; and 3) students assigned roommates who drank more

prior to college should drink more in college. The next section tests some of these

implications.




7. Characterizing the Effect of Roommate Drinking

       This section further explores the effect of initial roommate assignment on males’

GPA. It argues that effects are not uniform, but concentrated on the bottom of the GPA

distribution; that they persist over time; and that they are particularly strong for those

who themselves drank frequently prior to college. Taken together, these facts are more

consistent with a model of habit formation and peer effects in preferences than with a

disruption model.




                                              26
7.1. Effect on Distribution of GPA

         Roommates’ drinking does not seem to simply cause a uniform downward shift in

males’ GPA, but rather to greatly reduce the lower tail of GPA, to somewhat decrease

median GPA, and to have a smaller impact on the upper tail of GPA (Table 7). For

example, having a roommate who drinks occasionally reduces the 10th percentile of GPA

by 0.5 points with a t-statistic of more than 2.5, but has an insignificant effect of -0.05 on

the 90th percentile of GPA.24 The effect at the bottom of the distribution may be in fact

underestimated due to attrition bias, since the dropout rate is higher for males who were

assigned roommates who drank frequently in high school. There is little interaction

between having a roommate who drinks and predicted entering GPA based on a student’s

own academic background variables. This suggests that the large effects at the lower

quantiles are not due to a particularly adverse effect of drinking roommates on students

with low predicted GPA, but rather to large impacts on some students and weaker

impacts on others. It also suggests that the results may generalize beyond the particular

type of student at this university and are potentially relevant to less selective institutions.

         Note that the large effect at the bottom of the distribution of GPA is consistent

with the hypothesis that a few students are badly affected by roommate drinking, as

might be the case if some students are more vulnerable to addiction than others, for

genetic or other reasons. In contrast, the disruption model suggests that effects should be

strongest for students who study frequently, and thus that effects should, if anything, be

concentrated at the top of the distribution.



24
  The results should be interpreted with caution since GPA is an ordinal, rather than a cardinal, measure,
and since the maximum possible GPA is 4.0.

                                                    27
7.2. Dynamics of peer effects

          Male students whose roommates were frequent drinkers in high school have

GPAs 0.18 points lower in their first year and 0.43 points lower in their second year

(Table 8). This suggests that peer effects persist, and possibly even grow from the first to

second year of university, although it is worth bearing in mind the difference between the

two coefficients is not statistically significant.25

          As noted earlier, only about 17% of students live with their initial randomly

assigned roommate for more than 2 semesters.26 If the disruption theory was the only

force at work, so that habit formation played no role and so that students who no longer

shared a room with their first-year roommate during their second year were no longer

affected by these roommates, we would observe the negative peer effects from alcohol

consumption fade over time as students move away from the disruptive environment.

But, as indicated earlier, the effects persist in the second year. Furthermore, contrary to

the prediction of the disruption model, we tested and rejected the hypothesis that the

second year effect is equal to the first year effect multiplied by the proportion of students

who stayed together in their second year (0.17). The persistence of the effect of initial

assignment to a drinking roommate is consistent with the model of habit formation.

          Together with Johanne Boisjoly, Greg Duncan, and Jacque Eccles, we recently

obtained data which will allow us to look at longer term effects of roommate drinking.

Dropout rates are greater over this longer period, and hence bias is more of a concern in

25
   To test whether the difference is significant or not, we ran a fixed-effect regression at the cell level where the
dependent variable is the difference between second-year GPA and first-year GPA. Augmenting the regression with
the option “cluster” in Stata at the room level means that there is no a priori restriction on the error structure at the
room level. We find that the coefficient of the frequent drinking roommate variable is large but not estimated precisely
resulting in a p-value of 0.15.



                                                           28
looking at longer-run outcomes. However, in preliminary analysis in which students who

drop out are treated as having the GPA associated with their final semester in residence,

point estimates suggest that the effect of initial assignment to a roommate who drank

frequently prior to college is quite persistent over time, although significant levels drop.

Point estimates also suggest that the effect of initial assignment to a roommate who

drinks occasionally moderates over time, although the estimated effects remain large.

These data will be analyzed further in future work.

           Another factor that may explain the persistence of peer effects over time could be

cumulative peer selection along the lines of Akerlof [1997]. Suppose that once one starts

associating with a particular person, one becomes more similar to that person. One then

chooses other peers who are similar to the original peer and the process repeats itself and

intensifies. For example, a student who is assigned a first-year roommate who drinks may

also interact with other students in the same residence hall who do not drink much, and

hence may drink only moderately during the first year of college. But the roommate

may move into a fraternity his sophomore year, and if the student follows, the student’s

peers in sophomore year may drink even more than in freshman year. However, we find

only weak evidence that students randomly assigned roommates who drank prior to

college were more likely to join fraternities. About 21% of male students who were

assigned roommates who drank frequently in high school joined fraternities, compared to

16% of those who were assigned roommates who did not drink in high school. However,

this difference was not statistically significant.




26
     Based on a survey administered in the winter of 2002 to a sample of students who entered the university in 1998-


                                                           29
7.3. Interaction Between Own and Roommates’ High School Drinking

         For male students who drank frequently in high school, having a roommate who

also drank frequently is associated with a particularly sharp decline in GPA (Table 9).

The last column of Table 9, which reports results from a regression run only on males

who drank frequently, suggests that having a roommate who drank frequently is

associated with a 0.99 point lower GPA. An analysis using the whole lottery sample to

estimate interactions between own and roommate drinking also suggests that frequent

drinkers are significantly more strongly influenced by frequent-drinking roommates than

are occasional drinkers, but the implied effect of a frequent-drinking roommate on a

frequent-drinking student's GPA is smaller (around 0.67).27

         The particularly high susceptibility of frequent-drinking students to frequent-

drinking roommates is consistent with our second model. The subset of the population

with high drinking propensity is more vulnerable to high drinking roommates, and is also

likely to have drunk more in high school.

         We did not find any evidence that susceptibility to drinking roommates varied by

characteristics other than sex and pre-college drinking. For example, there is no evidence

that religious students were less subject to influence by roommate drinking or that the

degree of similarity of roommates, as reflected in the number of similar responses to the


2000 and who were randomly assigned to their first-year roommate.
27
   This specification allows for nine possible interactions between own drinking (frequent, occasional,
none) and roommate drinking (frequent, occasional, none) and omits the interaction between non-drinker
and frequent drinking roommate. The drawback of using this specification relative to the one reported in
Table 9 is that it assumes that the other explanatory variables (own and roommate academic background,
own and roommate parental background, and test dummies) have the same effect on college GPA for
frequent drinkers as for occasional drinkers and for non-drinkers. The advantage is that it uses a larger
sample, which should increase the precision of our estimates. In the regression with interactions the
coefficient of frequent drinker interacted with frequent drinking roommate is –0.40 with a t-statistic of –



                                                       30
CIRP questionnaire, affected the strength of peer effects. However, our inability to find

these effects may be due to our small sample size.

        In our main sample, we do not have data on students' subsequent drinking or in

fact, any outcome data other than registrar data. However, in ongoing work with Johanne

Boisjoly, Greg Duncan, and Jacque Eccles, we are administering surveys to several

cohorts of entering students. Preliminary evidence from these surveys suggests that

students assigned to roommates who reported drinking in the year prior to entering

college are more likely to drink after the first year of college. We find that 59% of male

students who were assigned a frequent drinking roommate the first year reported drinking

alcohol more than once a week, compared to 39% of those who were assigned a non-

drinking roommate (Table 10). Similarly, 94% of males who were assigned to a frequent

drinking first-year roommate report ever having been involved in binge drinking,

compared to 81% of those assigned a non-drinking first-year roommate. However,

preliminary work suggests that the statistical significance of these differences is sensitive

to the choice of econometric specification.

        Taken as a whole, the results presented in this section are more consistent with the

hypothesis that roommates influence each other’s preferences than with the hypothesis

that roommates who drink are disruptive, altering students' choice sets. First, counter to a

simple disruption model, students who themselves drank frequently in high school are

particularly susceptible to roommates who drank. Also counter to the disruption model,

the roommate effect is concentrated in the bottom quantiles of the GPA distribution.

Third, the effects of initial roommate assignment persist during the second year although


2.02, confirming that having a frequent drinking roommate has a substantially higher effect for frequent

                                                    31
only 17% of students lived with their first-year roommate after the first year. Finally, the

fact that students assigned to roommates who reported drinking in the year prior to

entering college are more likely to drink after the first year of college is more consistent

with the model of peer effects and habit formation than with the disruption model. Table

11 summarizes why we tend to favor the peer effects and habit formation hypothesis over

the disruption hypothesis.




8. The Effect of Sorting on Average GPA

          The finding in Section 7.3 that males who drank frequently in high school are

particularly susceptible to roommates who drank frequently implies that the way in which

roommates are matched together will affect average GPA in the university. Assuming

that the estimated coefficients for roommates’ high school drinking listed in Table 9 are

the true peer effects on a student’s college GPA, matching two frequent drinkers together

and two non- drinkers together yields an average overall GPA 0.36 points lower than

matching frequent drinkers and non-drinkers together (Table 12). Positive assortative

matching, in which students with similar drinking habits are matched together, would

reduce average GPA within the lottery sample by 0.065 points relative to random

assignment. Negative assortative matching, in which frequent drinkers are matched with

non-drinkers, increases average GPA by 0.024 points relative to random assortment.28



drinkers than for non-drinkers.

28
   Of course, people might not report their drinking habits accurately if the university sorts them on the basis of self-
reporting drinking. Moving from positive assortative matching to random assignment has a much bigger effect on
average GPA than moving from random assignment to negative assortative matching, because frequent drinkers are
particularly susceptible to being paired with other frequent drinkers. Since only 15% of students at the university drank
frequently in high school, only .15 x .15 = 2.25% of roommate groups combine two frequent drinkers under random

                                                           32
          Many universities have responded to alcohol problems by allowing students to

choose substance-free housing. Substance-free housing may affect GPA through a variety

of channels. For example, students in substance-free housing may feel more pressure not

to drink. However, a side effect of this policy is that students who do not choose

substance-free housing will be concentrated together in “regular” residence halls. If the

only way in which substance-free housing affected GPA was through its influence on the

drinking background of roommates, eliminating the substance-free housing option and

randomizing these students in with the general population would lower the GPA of

students who chose substance-free housing by 0.06 points. However, it would raise

aggregate GPA among other students by 0.1 points for each student moved out of

substance-free housing. Thus, overall, eliminating substance-free housing would raise

overall GPA by 0.04 points per student currently in substance-free housing. (Universities,

may, of course, be pursuing objectives other than maximizing average GPA).

          Of course, substance-free housing could potentially affect GPA in ways other than

by influencing roommate assignment, but we find no evidence for any positive impacts.

Since substance-free housing is not assigned randomly, it is difficult to isolate treatment

effects, but OLS estimates suggest that substance-free housing is negatively associated

with GPA among women, and insignificantly positively associated with GPA among men

if one does not condition on how substance-free housing affects roommate assignment

(Table 12, Columns 1,2,5, and 6). Conditioning on roommate assignment, the positive


matching and hence moving from random matching to negative assortative matching does not break up many
roommate pairs in which both members are frequent drinkers. In a student population with more frequent drinkers
(such as the one perhaps present at a less academically competitive university), random matching would create more
pairs of frequent drinkers and the benefits of negative assortative matching would be greater. National figures are not
available on our composite drinking variable, which includes drinking of both beer and wine/liquor, but in this
university 56% of students drink beer frequently or occasionally prior to coming to college compared to a national



                                                           33
effect on males basically disappears, and the negative effect on women remains but is

slightly weaker (Table 12, columns 3 and 7). There is little evidence that male students

who live in substance-free residence halls are less susceptible to roommates’ high school

drinking, but some evidence this may be the case for females (Table 12, Columns 4 and

8). It may seem surprising that some students who reported drinking frequently during

high school chose substance-free housing, but the choice of substance-free housing does

not necessarily indicate that the student does not plan to drink since some parents may

insist that their children choose substance-free housing.




7 – Conclusions

         Evidence from a large state university in which some students are assigned

roommates randomly using a lottery suggests that males’ GPA is reduced by more than a

quarter point by having a roommate who drank prior to college. This effect is equivalent

to almost half a standard deviation of a student's GPA (for the lottery sample) and slightly

larger than the effect of a 1/2 point increase in a student's own high school GPA. The

roommate drinking effects are larger for students in the lowest quantiles of the college

GPA distribution and for those students who reported drinking frequently in high school.

The effects seem to persist over time. Male students whose roommates were frequent

drinkers in high school have GPAs 0.18 points lower in their first year and 0.43 points

lower in their second year, although the difference in these coefficients is not statistically

significant. We find no significant effect for females.




average of 53%, and 64% of students drink wine or liquor frequently prior to coming to college compared to a national
average of 57%.

                                                         34
       The results are more consistent with the hypothesis that roommates influence each

other’s preferences than with the hypothesis that roommates who drink are disruptive,

altering students' choice sets. First, counter to a simple disruption model, students who

themselves drank frequently in high school are particularly susceptible to roommates who

drank. Also counter to the disruption model, the roommate effect is concentrated in the

bottom quantiles of the GPA distribution. Third, the effects of initial roommate

assignment persist during the second year although only 17% of students lived with their

first-year roommate after the first year.

       It is natural to ask whether some of these results can be generalized more broadly

to other settings, such as secondary schools. On the one hand, college students are older

and hence may be less subject to peer influences. But on the other hand, college students

generally live away from home and hence may be more subject to peer influences.

Overall, it seems difficult to predict whether peer effects would be larger or smaller

among younger students.

       We find that peer effects are related to roommate behavior (drinking) but not to

socio-economic background or academic ability. In this context, this seems to suggest

that attempts to improve outcomes for at-risk students should perhaps focus not so much

on peers' academic ability or socio-economic status, but on problem behavior. One

option some universities have adopted is removing students with problem behavior from

the environment, but given that our analysis suggests that segregating people who drink

together may be particularly problematic, this may be good for those who segregate

themselves, but it potentially worsens outcomes for society as a whole. Interventions

evidence would be needed to establish this.

    Note: The number of observations in the lottery and roommate request samples do not add up to the number
    of observations in the whole sample because many students did not meet the lottery deadline (and hence were
    assigned non-randomly) and did not choose a particular roommate.

* Based on a survey administered in the winter of 2002 to a sample of students who entered the university in 1998-
2000 and who were randomly assigned to their first year roommate(s).

** Only asked to students who had ever been involved in binge drinking.

Binge drinking is defined as the consumption of at least five drinks in a row for men or four drinks in a row for
women.

Number of Observations reported is based on first two items (“Drank alcohol in past 12 months” and “Involved in
binge drinking ever”). Number of observations for bottom two items were generally lower due to the fact that the
associated questions were asked only to those who reported binge drinking ever, and also due to item non-response
(which was never greater than 15%).
