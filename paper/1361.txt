          Social Security and Household Portfolio Allocation

                                 ABSTRACT


The entitlement to social security retirement benefits is a major component

of aggregate household wealth. This paper focuses on the impact of social

security annuities on household portfolio allocation, extending existing

optimizing models of portfolio allocation to explicitly consider the role of

social security. The model is implemented using cross—section data. The

partial equilibrium impacts of changes in social security benefits on portfolio

choice and composition are small but precisely measured. The general equilib-

 rium impacts on asset markets of a social security policy change (focusing on

links between social security and dynamic wealth accumulation and between social

security benefits and private pension benefits) are generally much larger.

             SOCIAL SECURITY AND HOUSEHOLD PORTFOLIO ALLOCATION



     The entitlement to social security retirement benefits is a major

component of aggregate household wealth in the U. S. This paper focuses on

the impact of "social security annuities" on household portfolio allocation

and exposes the ways in which optimizing agents deal with exogenous changes

in government retirement saving policies. Considering the effect of the

social security system on portfolio choice and composition is an important

step toward understanding the system's impact on savings.

     The entitlement to social security benefits In retirement is a type of

annuity. Taxes are collected during an individual's working life, and

benefits are paid in retirement until death. That this annuity scheme can

affect household non—pension saving has been the subject of much research

over the past decade. Through its characteristics as an asset, social

security can also affect the allocation of non—pension wealth.

     Most studies of the impacts of social security on individual wealth

accumulation have concentrated on the response of household consumption to

changes in social security that generate an increase in lifetime resources

(i.e., under the assumption that the present value of anticipated benefits

exceeds the present value of contributions).' Empirical tests of the

impact of social security on individual (or household) saving have been

undertaken by Feldstein [11,12], Kotlikoff [21], Leimer and Lesnoy [23],

Barro [2], Feldstein and Pellechio [13], Blinder, Grodon, and Wise [3],

King and Dicks—Mireaux [20], and Diamond and Hausman [6]. The time—series

evidence has been mixed and inconclusive. Microeconomic (cross—section)

evidence has generally supported the proposition that social security

reduces individual saving, though empirical estimates are again varied.

     Participation in the social security system is not a choice variable

for most individuals. In addition to the changes in the intertemporal

consumption decision induced by changes in manadatory social security

holdings, there is significant potential for a reallocation of non—pension

wealth. Two principal characteristics of the social security annuity

describe its influence on household portfolio allocation:

(1) nonmarketability of anticipated benefits2, and (ii) integration with

private pension benefits.3

     The paper extends and tests existing optimizing models of portfolio

allocation to explicitly consider the role of social security. Section I

contains the theoretical framework which serves as the basis for the

analysis. Using a cross—section of household data for the U. S., the

impact of the social security system on household portfolio allocation is

tested in Section II. Section III extends those results by considering the

general equilibrium impacts on asset markets of a social security policy

change, specifically focusing on links between social security and dynamic

wealth accumulation and between social security benefits and private

pension benefits. Section IV summarizes the main findings and implications

and points toward directions for future research.



I. SOCIAL SECURITY AND WEALTH ALLOCATION: AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

     To quantify and estimate the impact of social security on the

allocation of household wealth, we need a basic approach to modeling

portfolio allocation. Beginning with the methodology suggested by Merton

[25,26,281 and Samuelson [31] and elaborated in a different context by

Roley [30] and Friedman and Roley [15], relative asset shares in total

wealth will depend on relative rates of return according to the variance—
                                          —3—

covariance structure of asset returns.4 The analysis which follows has       its
origins in the work of Mayers [241 on the portfolio impacts of

nonmarketable assets and in the work of Friedman and Roley [15] on optimal

portfolio allocation. The basic modeling approaching of Friedman and Roley

is modified to explicitly consider social security.

     Abstracting from social security, the general problem of choosing

optimal portfolio selection arid composition rules can be derived from the

maximization of the present discounted value of utility derived from

consumption, subject to a wealth constraint. The utility function is

assumed to be strictly concave, and the assumption of constant relative

risk aversion is maintained throughout. Let



         C =      consumption
         W        total marketable wealth (exclusive of pension annuities)

    SSW           present value of anticipated social security benefits

     p            coefficient of constant relative risk aversion

    r = real           net return on the i' asset

              =   variance—covariance matrix of asset returns
     6 =          individual   discount rate

              =   share of W held in the th asset.
         :i




    Assume that there are no assets provided by the market with risk—free

real returns. An examination of real returns over the past decade reveals

that this assumption is not so strong as it seems. Even the research on

the hedging quality of short—term Treasury bills by Fama and Schwert [8]

and by Bodie [51 has shown only that bills are hedges against anticipated

inflation. Social security retirement annuities are also not riskiess.
                                          —4—

Prior to the formal indexation            benefits in 1972 and to some extent

today, there are lags in adjusting benefits for inflation. Second, shocks

to the economy which affect the growth rate of labor income can alter the

real return on social security. Finally, social security benefits may be

increased in discrete jumps, increasing the rate of return on taxes paid

for some cohorts.

     In the absence of a risk—free asset, following Merton [26,28], the

problem of choosing optimal portfolio selection and composition rules is

formulated in continuous time as



     max E[J et U[C(t)]dt + B(w(T),             T)],                            (1)




subject to the budget constraint that



     dW a'r W dt — Cdt +       a'W.                                             (2)




B(W(T),T) is a "bequest valuation function," which is assumed to be concave

in W(T). E denotes the expectation operator.

     To derive the optimality equations, the problem can be restated in

dynamic programming form as



     J(W(t),t) = max           E(t)[fTe5 U(C(s))ds + B(W(T),T)J,                (3)
                {C(s),ct(s)}          0


subject to the same constraints as before. In general, (3) can be

expressed as



     J(W(t0),t0) =      max      E(t)[J         eU[C(s)]ds +   J(W(t),t)].      (4)

                                              —5—

Letting t =   to + h and performing a Taylor expansion about W(t0) yields:



          J(W(t0), t0)              maxfCn}E(tO){e_6tU[C(t] + J(W(t0), t0)

          {C,ct}



we can formulate the maximization subject to the constraint that the asset

shares must sum to unity. That is,



          L =     0 + A(1 —        a'l),                                                       (8)




where X is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint. The

first—order conditions associated with (8) are



          L =       0 =   etU        (C(t)) —
                                                J,                                             (9a)



          L =       0 =   —A   +           + Jc2c'W2, and                                      (9b)

        The first condition is familiar; it equates the (discounted) marginal

utility of consumption with the marginal utility of wealth. Combining (9b)

and (9c) and using the fact that under the assumption of constant relative

risk aversion p =                           we obtain the vector of desired asset shares

     Given a mandatory nonmarketable position in social security annuities

of amount SSW, equation (10) is modified to


             *    1
                      [A](r —                     + B,                               (12)




where a caret indicates the inclusion of only the marketable (i.e., non-

social security) assets.                    is the vector of covariances of the returns

on the marketable assets with that of social security.

     The larger is the ratio of an individual's social security wealth to

his non—pension (marketable) wealth, the lower will his demand be for other

assets whose returns are positively correlated with that of social

security. Thinking of (rk —                     Ssk      as the "adjusted return" on asset
                                       —7—

k, the effect of a change in social security on adjusted returns and the

composition of non—pension wealth depends on:          (i) the individual's risk

aversion, (ii) mandatory social security holdings relative to non—pension

wealth, and (iii) the correlation of the expected return with that of

social security.

        The intuition here is clear. Given that participation in the social

security annuity system is involuntary and given that the entitlement to

benefits is not marketable, we can examine the effect of social security on

the allocation of fungibie wealth. Expressing required social security

holdings SSW as the sum of an optimal amount SSW (the individual's choice

in an unconstrained optimization) plus the excess of required over desired

social security, for any asset k,

where akJ are the elements in the kth row of [A] and bk is the kth element

of the vector B. The higher the desired level of social security wealth,

the lower will be the relative demand for asset k (as long as akSS > 0).

However, to the extent that there is too little (too much) SSW, the

relative demand for asset k is Increased (decreased) when akSS > 0.

     The next two sections focus on estimating the model of household

portfolio allocation in the presence of pensions and on combining the

results with information about the Impact of pensions on household saving

to simulate the general equilibrium impacts on portfolio allocation of a

change In social security benefits relative to non—pension wealth.

II.   ESTIMATING ThE IMPACT OF SOCIAL SECURITY ON HOUSEHOLD

      WEALTH ALLOCATION

      A. Background
      Much of the previous work on the effects of social security on saving

has used aggregate time—series data. "Representative transactor" models

are not likely to be good analytical tools for examining the portfolio

composition effects. The nonmarketability of anticipated social security

benefits makes "high—income" and "low—income" individuals quite

different. Because social security benefits are not proportional to pre—

retirement earnings, high—income individuals should have much lower

measures of SSW/W than low—income individuals. A macroeconomic—level
                               SSW
regression using an aggregate —i--    would obscure this difference. 6

      Hence, cross—section data are required to properly implement the

model. The household data used in this paper are excerpted from surveys

done in 1979 and 1980 under the auspices of the U. S. President's

Commission on Pension Policy. Those data represent one of the few attempts

since Federal Reserve Board's 1962 survey of consumers (described in

Projector and Weiss [29]) to devise an asset data base on the household

level. The bulk of the data base comes from two interviews, one year

apart. The Wave I interview was conducted in September 1979, and the Wave

II interview was conducted in September 1980. Only data from the first

wave are used in estimating the model.



B. The Model and     Estimation Results
      In   keeping with the derivation of the optimal portfolio allocation,

the basic model to be estimated is of the form:
                                   —9—

                      ssw ppw
            c.   f(T, —a—-, ——-                                         (14)


where j indexes assets; T is the unit's marginal tax rate; W, SSJ, and PPW

represent non—pension wealth and the present values of anticipated social

security and private pension benefits, respectively; and     is a vector of

other explanatory variables. The logistic transformation of (14) is

actually estimated, to reduce heteroscedasticity,7 i.e.,



     ' icz)          +     T +        +     (PPW) +                     (15)




The present values of anticipated social security benefits and private

pension benefits are entered separately In (15), so that they are not

constrained to have the same Impact on portfolio allocation.

     Values for r are obtained from the TAXSIM model of the National

Bureau of Economic Research, given data on earned income, income from

assets, and family characteristics.8 Non—pension wealth W represents the

net worth of the unit. The gross asset position Is obtained by summing the

values of the holdings of the individual assets (financial and

nonfinancial). Total liabilities include mortgage and consumer

indebtedness. Net worth is just the difference between gross wealth and

total liabilities. Details on the construction of household gross social

security wealth and private pension wealth variables can be found in the

Appendix.

     The elements of P,   the "other explanatory variables," can be divided
into two parts. The first category contains "portfolio scale" variables,

the ratio of net worth to permanent income and (the log of) permanent

income. Details on the construction of the permanent income variable can
                                — 10 —




be found in the Appendix. These wealth and income variables act as proxies

for effects of the size of the total portfolio on portfolio allocation

(such as transactions costs). In the second category are relevant

individual characteristics, such as self—employment status, labor force

status (whether the head of the household is employed), number of children

under eighteen years of age, whether the unit is a farm family, and age.9

There are three brackets for age — under forty (AGEI), between forty and

fifty—five (AGE2), and over fifty—five (AGE3).

     The following assets were considered: market value of the home, U. S.

savings bonds, deposits, non—pension annuities, bonds, equities, and

passenger cars." In addition, total liabilities (sum of mortgage and

consumer indebtedness) were analyzed in the same framework. The inclusion

of liabilities provides another test of the impact of the nonmarketability

cnstraints embodied in social security annuities.

     Since the model in (1.5) considers only those observations with positive

holdings of the asset, it will be necessary to correct for sample selection

bias. Using the procedure suggested by Heckman [18], a first—stage probit

model for the probability of owning a given asset was estimated for the

full sample. The probit model (for the discrete choice to hold each asset)

included as explanatory variables the ratios of non—pension wealth, private

pension wealth, and social security wealth to permanent income, (the log

of) permanent income, the marginal tax rate, and dummy variables for

whether the head of the unit is under age forty, for low current unit

earnings (less than $6000), and for whether the head of the household has

at least a high school education. The inverse of Mill's ratio (from the

estimated probit equations) was added as an additional regressor in (14) to

correct for sample selection bias)° Results of the first—stage probit
                                    — 11 —




models for positive asset holdings can be found in Table I. The number of

 observations in the sample with sufficient information to construct the

permanent income and pension wealth variables is 3084.

     From Table I, it is clear that the marginal tax rate plays an

important role in the discrete choice of which assets to hold. For

example, the influence of the marginal tax rate on the decision to buy a

house or to buy   shares   of stock Is particularly great. The evidence in

Table I makes apparent the need to consider the impact of taxation on

portfolio choice as well as on portfolio composition.

     For each asset, the probability of ownership rises with the ratio of

non—pension wealth to permanent income. It is not obvious a priori what

effects on the probability of holding the various assets we should expect

of the other two components of wealth. As anticipated social security and

private pension benefits are long—term illiquid assets, they might be

expected to lessen the chances of holding assets with similar

characteristics. However, not all illiquid assets may be perceived as part

of saving for retirement (e.g., cars), while liquid assets such as equities

might be. The ratios of the present values of private pension benefits and

social security benefits to permanent income generally exert a positive

impact on the holdings of the marketable assets. Those effects are

significant for savings bonds, equities, and passenger cars in the case of

private pensions, and for housing annuities, passenger cars, and

liabilities in the case of social security. Social security exerted a

positive influence in each of those cases except annuities.

     Permanent income has a significant positive effect on the discrete

choice to hold particular assets. Similarly, education exerts a positive

impact on asset holdings. Low age exhibits a negative effect except on

holdings of savings bonds. Low household earnings, ceteris paribus,

have negative influence.

     Table II contains the estimated coefficients for the basic asset

demand equations. The ratio of net worth (marketable wealth) to

permanent income exerts a depressing effect across the nnu of assets.

The coefficient on (the log of) permanent income is frequently not

significantly different from zero. In general, the relative share

demand for financial assets has a negative income elasticity and a

positive elasticity for nonfinancial assets.

     An increase in the marginal tax rate, ceteris paribus, raises

holdings of housing, equities, annuities, and debt relative to net

worth; negative effects occur for deposits, bonds, and vehicles. Only

the former category of estimated impacts is pronounced and statistically

significant, however. Feldstein's [10] finding that, under the special

features of the U.S. tax system, higher marginal tax rates raise the

relative demand for equities is borne Out. The results in Table III are

conditional on the household's holding the particular assets in

question. Insofar as changes in the marginal tax rate affect the

discrete choice of which assets to hold, the estimated coefficients in

Table II are underestimates of the impact of personal taxation on

portfolio composition.

     Coefficient estimates for variables representing individual

characteristics are statistically significant at the 95 percent

confidence level. Self—employed individuals and farmers, ceteris

paribus, hold less of their wealth in financial assets than do the rest

of the sample. Larger families hold more of their wealth in housing and

cars and are more highly levered. Relative shares of financial assets

increase with age (with the exception of U. S. savings bonds), while

relative positions in physical assets decline with age. Leverage also

declines with age.

    The estimated initial impact of the social security variable (ratio

of present value of anticipated benefits to net worth) on portfolio

composition can be found in the third row of Table II. All of the

coefficients are significantly different from zero at the 95—percent

confidence level, with negative effects noted for housing, equities, and

annuities. Those effects are intuitive, in the first two cases because

of the "inflation hedge" properties of the assets and in the last

because compulsory purchases of social security annuities are a
                                 — 16 —



substitute   for market—provided annuities. Positive effects are observed

for savings bonds, deposits, bonds, and vehicles; unlike indexed social

security benefits, bonds and deposits represent nominal claims. Also of

interest is the positive coefficient on SSW/W in the liabilities

regression, indicating that an increase in social security wealth

relative to marketable wealth increases leverage, a finding consistent

with agents' trying to "undo" the nonmarketability of anticipated future

social security benefits.

     Results for the "composition effect" of private pension wealth (the

PPW/W variable) are not conclusive, with statistically significant

coefficients only for passenger cars and for liabilities. Much of the

ambiguity probably stems from the fact that, unlike social security,

private pension participation is not truly exogenous to individual

decisions. Moreover, there is no information in the data on the

portfolio composition of pension assets; hence no test can be made of

whether households "internalize" the portfolios of their pension funds.

    Whether or not to use the same real discount rate for all

individuals in computing social security wealth or private pension

wealth is a difficult question. Older individuals may be more certain

of receiving anticipated pension benefits and may have a lower implicit

discount rate. To allow for differences in discount rates, the products

of the age brackets and the pension wealth variables were added to the

regression model in (14).

    Table III reports the regression results when the age—pension

interaction terms are included. This attempt to capture age—specific

characteristics of the pension wealth variables did not produce

significantly different results for the marginal tax rate, the scale

variables, the composition variables, or the individual

characteristics. In most cases, the coefficients of the interaction

terms were not significantly different from zero at the 95 percent

confidence level. A marked exception is total liabilities, where the

impact of social security wealth on leverage increases with age.'2

     To provide a meaningful interpretation of the point estimates of

the impact of social security on portfolio allocation, the implied asset

(share) demand elasticities with respect to changes in SSW/W are

presented in Table IV. While the original coefficient estimates are

precisely measured, the elasticities are small absolutely. However, the

general equilibrium impact on portfolio allocation of a legislated

change in social security wealth depends on the change in desired asset

shares, the response of the level of marketable wealth (saving effect),

and on any formal integration with private pension systems. Only the

first of those effects has been examined thus far.

III.    ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF A ChANGE IN SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS

       The estimation results in the previous section can be used to

identify the immediate impact on household portfolio allocation of a

change in social security benefits relative to earnings. Those measures

are necessary but not sufficient for an analysis of the effects on

wealth allocation of a change in social security wealth; changes in

social security will affect non—pension wealth accumulation and private

pension benefits.

       Consider first the wealth accumulation process. Suppose that

social security wealth and private pension wealth are among the

determinants of an investor's desired wealth; moreover, let them be

exogenous to that decision.'3 While individuals are assumed to take

private pension wealth as given, the integration of some pension plans

with the social security system means that social security wealth will

still influence private pension accumulation.

       Let the ratio of non—pension wealth to permanent income for

individual i in period t be determined according to:



                W   = a               —     SSW     —     PPW
                            + a
                                                        a(_—-)i,
                                  '

                                          a(_—-)i                    (16)



            *
where W, Y , D, SSW, and PPW denote wealth, permanent income, a vector

of individual characteristics, and the present values of social security

and private pension benefits, respectively. While the amount of "social

security saving" is fixed by law, pension saving is assumed adjust to

social security changes, so that



                    =   b   ÷ b'D.t —
                                          b(--)i.                    (17)
                                           — 21 —




Combining equations (16) and (17) yields


          = (a   —   ab)   +   (a'   —   ab')D.     — (a   —
                                                               ab)(.-)1.     (18)

       Suppose, for example, that Congress legislated a benefit increase

sufficient to raise SSWIY* by              percent. From equation (18), the offset

to non—pension wealth (assuming that permanent income is unchanged) is

just

                                              (a                    —
                                                                           ab5)

       increase in                       social security            social security

           SSW                           offset to wealth           offset to private

                                                                    pension wealth



Hence, ascertaining the general equilibrium impact on asset shares of a

change in social security wealth requires knowledge not only of the

parameters of the basic model, but also of the offset parameters a,
                                                                                    a,
and

       In another paper using the same data (Hubbard, 1983), I estimated

the offsets (evaluated at sample means) to non—pension net worth from an

extra dollar of social security wealth and from an extra dollar to

private pension wealth to be thirty—three cents and sixteen cents,

respectively.'5 Given the information available in the data set, it is

not possible to determine the reduction in private pension benefits

attendant to a permanent increase in social security benefits.

Calculations of the general equilibrium impact on portfolio composition

of a permanent change in social security benefits are performed under
                                — 22 —



three values for b5 — zero, thirty—three cents, and fifty cents. Table
V contains the analogues of the elasticities reported in Table IV after

adjustments in net worth and private pension benefits have taken place.

     Comparing the elasticity measures in Table V with those of Table

IV, the importance of considering the linkages among social security,

private pension, and fungible net worth is readily apparent. The

reductions in net worth and in private pension benefits from an increase

in social security benefits alter the ultimate impact of the pension

benefit change on portfolio composition. The general equilibrium

elasticities are larger than the original impact elasticities. Given

the small offset the net worth of private pension wealth, the results

are not highly sensitive to the choice of the (assumed) offset to

private pension benefits of a change in social security benefits.16

    The structure of and dynamics of the portfolio adjustment process

are also important. This paper has only looked at desired asset shares;

the empirical work has implicitly assumed individuals can and do

reshuffle their portfolios to quickly balance desired and actual wealth

allocation. Much of the recent work on portfolio adjustment processes

has focused on the allocation problem in the presence of changes in new

investable funds.17 To be appropriate for the problem at hand, such a

model must address the impact of changes in mandated asset holdings

(like social security wealth). Adding that dimension represents an

important extension of the analysis in the paper.18 At that stage, more

reasonable policy simulations could be designed to evaluate the dynamics

of the effects of shfits in the structure of the social security system

on household wealth accumulation and allocation.

IV.   CONCLUSIONS

      Concentrating on   social   security as an annuity, this paper

considers the impact of social security on asset markets, through its

effects on household wealth allocation. Existing optimizing models of

wealth allocation are extended to include the constraint of manadatory

participation in the social security system. Results for the impact of

social security on portfolio choice and composition depend on household

holdings of social security annuities relative to non—pension wealth and

on the correlations of the return on social security with those on

marketable assets.

      Section II tests the influence of social security wealth on

portfolio composition using the model outlined in the text and cross—

section data collected under the auspices of the U. S. President's

Commission on Pension Policy. Estimation of the model gives interesting

results for the effects of marginal tax rates and of social security

holdings. Effects of the marginal tax rate generally are particularly

strong for housing, equities, annuities, and total liabilities. Changes

in social security benefits exhibit significant partial equilibrium

impacts on portfolio composition. Negative effects are noted for

housing, equities, and annuities; positive effects are observed for

saving bonds, deposits, bonds, and vehicles. Also of interest is the

positive impact of social security on liabilities, indicating that a

permanent increase in social security benefits relative to non—pension

wealth increases leverage. The general equilibrium impact on portfolio

allocation of a legislated change in social security depends not only on

the change in desired asset shares, but also on the response of the

level of marketable wealth (saving effect) and on any formal integration

with private pension systems.

     The third section develops more fully those general equilibrium

qualifications to the regression results in section II by considering

the response of non—pension wealth accumulation to changes in pension

wealth. Specifically, a permanent increase in the present value of

anticipated social security benefits of $1.00 reduces non—pension wealth

by thirty—three cents. Using this estimate in conjunction with

assumptions about evidence on the impact of the social security system

on other forms of retirement saving, the results in section II are

augmented to evaluate the general equilibrium effects on portfolIo

allocation of changes in social security wealth. In many cases, those

effects are much large than the partial equilibrium effects.

     Two other extensions readily suggest themselves. What are the

dynamics of the accumulation and allocation of marketable wealth in

response to changes in pension wealth? Second, how will the impacts of

the social security system on our variables of interest circumscribe the

impacts of changes in policy guiding the use of individual retirement

saving plans? While the controversy over the implictions of the social

security system for household saving is still unresolved, it is also

important to examine the program's direct effects on asset markets.

That analysis may shed light on the problem of ascertaining household

valuations of social security and on the ways in which agents attempt to

"undo" constraints on thier asset—holding behavior.

     Bureau of Economic Research provided financial support for this
     work.

'In theory, the social security does not have to be unfair in order to
    reduce household saving. Abel [1] and Hubbard [19] emphasize the
    impact of social security on saving in the context of individual
    uncertainty over longevity and find that even a fair social security
    system can reduce household saving by more than the taxes paid.

2The effects of nonmarketable assets on portfolio structure have been
    examined by Mayers in the context of the standard Capital Asset
    Pricing Model of Sharpe [32] and Lintner [22]. Merton [27]
    concentrates directly ant he nonmarketability of human capital and
    shows that under certain conditions a tax and transfer system
    similar to the current social security system can mimic the optimal
    allocation path, reducing or eliminating the economic lneffciencies
    stemming from the nonmarketability of human capital.

3The benefits of many private pension plans are formally integrated with
    the social security system, reducing payments as social security
    benefits are augmented. Savings models (as in Feldstein [11, 12])
    or portfolio allocation models (as in Dicks—Mireaux and King [7])
    which include as explanatory variables both private pension and
    social security annuities should consider not only their offset to
    non—pension wealth, but also the offset to private pension saving
    attendant to increases in social security benefits.

4As noted in Merton [26] and in Friedman and Roley [15], those
    properties (linearity in expected returns and wealth homogeneity)
    can be derived from a general expected utility maximization in
    continuous time under the assumptions of (1) constant relative risk
    aversion and (ii) joint normally distributed expected asset
    returns. Empirical evidence in support of the first assumption can
    be found in Friend and Blume [16].

5The matrix A is symmetric with non—negative main diagonal elements.
    Moreover, the sum of the elements of each individual column of A is
    zero. For more details, see Roley [30] or Hubbard [19].

    similar point surfaces in deciding whether to aggregate human wealth
     and social security wealth. The lack of a proportional relationship
     between the two major nonmarketable assets suggests that they should
     be kept separate in any empirical analysis. Above a certain level
     of (permanent) wage income, increases in human wealth will not be
                                — 27 —




    followedby increases in social security wealth. Earlier tests of
   the influence on portfolio allocation of nonmarketable assets (such
   as those of Mayers [24] or Friend and Blume [16]) focused on human
   capital. Lumping social security wealth together with human wealth
   may be further questionable because their risk characteristics are
   not the same. At a minimum, cyclical fluctuations in real wages and
   the lack of complete price—level indexation of wages make human
   wealth riskier than social security. (There is also an age
   heterogeneity effect when considering social security because of the
   liability represented by future social security tax payments.)
   Friend and Blume [16, p. 914] made a similar point by concluding
   that if the return on social security were uncorrelated with the
   return on the portfolio of marketable risky assets then the
   inclusion of social security wealth in human wealth would decrease
   the value of a now more broadly defined "beta coefficient" of human
   wealth.

70f course, under this transformation, the adding—up requirements no
    longer hold.

8See Feenberg [9] for a description of the TAXSIM model. With only one
    cross—section of units, it is impossible to consider the impacts of
    variables which are the same across units (such as the return on a
    particular assets, the rate of inflation, etc.). Marginal tax rates
    do vary across units. Of course, the problem of endogeneity of the
    marginal tax rate with respect to portfolio composition still
    remains.

9lndividual characteristics can be important factors fri the
    determination of how wealth is allocated. Families with many
    children may have larger houses; self—employed individuals may have
    more of their wealth in business equity, etc.

'°Heckman's mothod [18] does not yield consistent standard errors, and,
    moreover, as Greene [17] points out, it is impossible to state
    whether the reported "conventional" standard error is a lower bound
    or an upper bound of the "true" standard error.

''The category "deposits" includes deposits with financial
    institutions. Unfortunately, "bonds' in the data set comprise both
    those whose interest payments are subject to taxation and those
    whose interest payments are not. "Equity" is the sum of direct
    holdings and mutual fund shares. All assets are at market value.
    Other asset categories like business equity, money market funds, and
    notes and mortgages held had too few observations to ascertain
    meaningful results.

      could reflect greater certainty over receipt of anticipated
   social security benefits. While it is illegal to borrow against
   social security benefits per Se, older individuals may take
   anticipated benefits into account borrowing against their other
   assets.

13Exogeneity is more obvious for social security wealth than for private
   pension wealth. Some individuals (certainly those with defined
   contribution plans) have control over their employee pension saving.

    were estimated from the ratios of the pension wealth variables to
    permanent income to the ratio of net worth to permanent income.

16A possible extension would be to obtain a more informed estimate based
    on an examination of a cross—section of private pension plans.

'7See, for example, the survey in Friedman [14] and his development of
    the "optimal marginal adjustment model," which distinguishes between
    the allocation of new investable funds and the reallocation of
    existing wealth.

18That extension was not pursued here because of the dubious quality of
    the second wave of data in the survey.

       Constructing a Proxy for Permanent Income

       The concept of permanent income (or normal annual earnings) is

important both for wealth accumulation (because of the age profile of

the ratio of net worth to permanent income implied by the life—cycle

model) and for portfolio allocation (because of its connection with the

normal level of transactions). Permanent income is not an observable

variable, so that some sort of estimation procedure is needed to obtain

a proxy based on (observable) current earnings.

       Let the model for determining permanent income be such that



(Al)        in (*) x i3 + S.

                                                      th
Where X1 is a vector of observable variables for the I   individual,

  is the associated parameter vector, and Si measures luck or skill,

where S1 has mean zero and variance o. In a given year, earnings

will differ from permanent income because of one's position in the age—

earnings profile and because of transitory earnings. Letting Z1 denote
                                th
earnings in period t by the i        individual,



(A2)       in (Z.) —   in (*) + f(A.) +


where A represents age and €ft represents the transitory portion of

earnings (with mean zero and variance o).          By assumption, S
and      are uncorreiated. The combination of (Al) and (A2) yields the

following earnings function:
                                           - A2



(A3)        in (Z.) X. + f(A.) + S. +



       An estimate of permanent income for each individual in the sampie

can be constructed from the estimate ,                  if   we can inpute a value of

S1. Given the residual from the earnings equation (S. +                            the

minimum—variance estimator S.(given S1 + €j)                     it   just:


                           2

(A4)           =                            (S. ÷
                       2           2




           From (Al), (A2), and (A4), the estimate of permanent income is


                                                         *
(A5)        in (y*) =                  + f(A. ) + s•
                   1           1           it       1




       Separate earnings equations were estimated f,r male heads of

households and for wives; households headed by a woman were deleted from

the sample. A significant portion of the individual (almost twenty—five

percent) had current earnings of less than $2500, probably in part

because of part—time work. The model is designed to predict earnings of

"full—time" employees, so the sample was truncated at earnings of

$2500. The resulting bias from selecting on the dependent variable was

corrected for using Heckman's (1979) two—stage procedure.**


*Because only a single cross section of data is used, it is not possible
to obtain estimates of o and o in addition to       .     is necessary        It
to assume a value for asAc + o)based on a study of longitudinal
earnings data. Following the survey of such studies in King and Dicks—
reaux (1982), I assumed that 0I (o + a) = 0.5.
  The drill is the same as in the asset demand case in the text. In the
first stage, a probit analysis of the full sample yields the parameters
of the probability that an individual will be in the truncated sample.
The second stage is to estimate the earnings function by ordinary least
squares with the addition of the universe of Mill's ratio (computed for
each observation in the truncated sample) as an explanatory variable.
                              -A3 -



     The probit model for men includes as explanatory variables youth,

old age, low education, marriage, part—time work, and unemployment. The

women's probit model was identical to that for men with addition of

number of children under two, the number of children between two and

five, and the number of children between five and twelve as explanatory

variables. Regressions included as independent variables occupational

dummies, a cubic polynomial in variables. Regressions included as

independent variables occupational dummies, a cubic polynomal in

variables. Regressions included as independent variables occupational

dummies, a cubic polynomial in age, race (white versus nonwhite),

education levels, self—employment status, martial status, and the

inverse of the Mill's ratio from the probit analysis.

     Details of the maximum—likelihood estimates of the probit model for

earnings of less than $2500 or of the second stage estimates of the

earnings equation are available on request. Total household permanent

income is the same as the estimates for husbands and for wives.



     Computation of the Pension Wealth Variables

     Gross social security wealth is computed according to the following

procedures. The Social Security Administration (SSA) was able to match

5516 repondents with social security records. On the basis of an

assumption of two percent future growth of real wages and given the law

in 1979, statisticians of the SSA calculated the projected Primary

Insurance Amount (PIA) for age 65 for the non—retired. For those

retired, the actual PIA was directly available. In computing the

present values, a real discount rate of three percent was used, with

average inflation projected to be four percent. Standard mortality
                              - A4


assumptions were used in the present value calculation. The household's

social security wealth is the sum of the husband's and the wife's social

security wealth. Results were not very sensitive to changes in

assumptions.

     Present values were also computed for private pension benefits.

Attempts were made to calculate the present value of pension benefits

for all respondents who currently receive a pension, who currently

participate in a plan, or who are terminated with a vested benefit.

When information was available, the present value of all pension

benefits accrued to date was calculated from the respondent's

questionnaire, the EBS—1 forms, and the employer questionnaire. In the

calculations used in the paper, a real discount rate of three percent

was used in conjunction with a four percent inflation rate. Again,

standard mortality assumptions were used.
