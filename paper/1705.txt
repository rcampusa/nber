     This paper presents a new set of empirical regularities on the link
between interest rates, money supply announcements and monetary base
anno*mcements. Among the main findings reported are: (i) unexpected
increases in the announced monetary base have a significantly positive
effect on interest rates during the period from October 1979 to October
1982; (ii) although unexpected money supply and monetary base announcements
have the seine impact on interest rates, they have different implications for
the future behavior of the money supply and monetary base; (iii) the
significant response of longer-term interest rates to unexpected monetary
announcements is reflecting a response of current and expected future short-
term rates -- i.e. term-structure premia are not altered by these
announcements.

I. Introduction



     Recent empirical research on the effects of weekly money supply

announcements has produced a number of interesting findings.1 Unexpected

increases in the announced money supply have a positive and statistically

significant impact on the interest rates of both short-term and long-term

assets. The magnitude and significance of these impacts show a marked

increase following the October 6, 1979 change in the Federal Reserve's

operating procedures. Expected increases in the announced money supply

generally have a negative effect on interest rates, but the statistical

significance of the effect depends on the time period being examined and on

the method of measuring expectations.

     Although these findings are informative, a number of important

questions remain unanswered. For example, are money supply announcements

affecting interest rates because of the information they convey about the

monetary base or about the money multiplier? Are there effects of the weekly

monetary base announcements on interest rates? Do interest rates respond to

the weekly announcements of money supply and monetary base revisions? What

are the predictive implications of monetary announcements for the expected

future behavior of the money supply and monetary base? Is the interest rate-

monetary announcement link altered at the time of the October 1982 shift in

Federal Reserve operating procedure? Are the effects of monetary

announcements on long-term interest rates capturing their effects on

expected future short-term interest rat;s or on term-structure premia?

     The main purpose of this paper is to provide answers to these

questions. In addition, the robustness of previously reported findings is

examined. Thus, the contribution is to present a new, expanded set of
                                                                                    2




empirical regularities which characterize the monetary announcement-interest

rate link. The key results reported in the paper are:

     (i) There is a significant positive link between monetary base

announcements and interest rates, a relation which previous researchers have

either ignored or failed to detect Allowing for this link does not alter

the strength of the relation between money supply announcements and interest

rates. The hypothesis that unexpected monetary base and money supply

announcements have the same impact on interest rates cannot be statistically

rejected at standard significance levels. Given the delays in announcing

monetary data, a money supply announcement provides new information about

only the money multiplier. Thus,    interest   rates significantly respond to new

information about both the monetary base and the money multiplier.

        (ii) Significant interest rate responses to monetary announcements

exist   only for announcements of preliminary    data. Announcements of money

supply and monetary base revisions do not have a significant impact on

interest    rates.
        (iii)   During the time period when announcements have their largest

impact on interest rates, both unexpected money supply and monetary base

announcements contain useful information for predicting future monetary

developments. An unexpected increase in the announced money supply can be

used to predict subsequent money supply contractions. These contractions

only partially offset the initial expansion, however, so that higher levels

of the money supply can be expected to prevail in periods after such an

announcement. Despite this information about subsequent money supplies,

unexpected money supply announcements generally have no predictive power for

future levels of the monetary base. An unexpected increase in the announced

monetary base signals different monetary developments than an unexpected
                                                                               3




increase in the announced money supply. It can be used to predict lower

money supplies in the future as well as subsequent changes in the monetary

base. An unexpected increase in the announced monetary base is followed by a

significant contraction of the base which only partially offsets the initial

change. The finding that unexpected money supply and monetary base

announcements have different predictive implications but have similar

effects on interest rates casts doubt on the proposition that the observed

monetary announcement-interest rate link can be fully accounted for in terms

of the new information they convey about future money supply and monetary

base behavior.

     (iv) Following the October 1982 shift in the Federal Reserve's

operating procedure there was a statistically significant change in the

monetary announcement-interest rate relation. The impact of monetary

announcements on interest rates is much smaller after the Federal Reserve

began to downplay its conmiittment to hitting a target growth rate of the Ml

money supply. There are also changes in the ability of unexpected

announcements to predict future monetary developments.

     (v) The rise in long-term interest rates following an unexpected

increase in the announced money supply and monetary base appears to result

only from the movement of current and expected future short-term interest

rates. That is, there is no evidence of a significant response of term-

structure premia to unexpected monetary announcements.

     (vi) Some previous empirical work on the link between monetary

announcements and interest rates in the pre-October 1979 period may be

misleading for two reasons. First, changes in interest rate volatility from

1977 to 1979 have the consequence that interest rate regressions estimated

over this period exhibit significant heteroskedasticity. Failure to take
                                                                               4



account of this can result in improper statistical inference. Second, and

more importantly, an examination of the role of influential data points

shows that before 1979 the statistically significant link between monetary

announcements and interest rate changes is attributable to a relatively few

data points.

     The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the data and

introduces notation. Section III presents results concerning the impact of

expected and unexpected money supply announcements on the interest rate for

three-month U.S. Treasury bills. Three sample periods are examined: pre-

October 1979, October 1979-October 1982, and post-October 1982. Section IV

assesses the stability of these results, both within arid across samples, as

well as the role of potentially influential observations. The interest rate

effects of monetary base announcements are analyzed in section V. This

section also examines whether interest rates respond to announced revisions

of previously reported money supply and monetary base data. Section VI

evaluates the predictive ability of unexpected monetary announcements for

the subsequent behavior of the money supply and the monetary base. The

effects of monetary announcements on longer-term interest rates are

investigated in section VII. This section also provides evidence on whether

the reaction of longer-term interest rates to the annnouncements reflects a

change in expected future short-term rates and/or a change in term-structure

premia. Section VIII contains concluding remarks.

II. Notation and Data Description



     Four sources of data are used in this paper. The weekly H.6 release of

the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is used for money

supply data. During the time period examined here, September 29, 1977 to

March 29, 1984, this release contains a preliminary announcement of the

average money supply over the week ending approximately nine days ago and

the announcement of a revised estimate of the average money supply over the

week ending approximately sixteen days ago. These variables are subscripted

by the week in which they become known. The preliminary money supply

announcement which is released in week t is denoted Mt and the revised

estimate which is released at this time is denoted MLRt.

     Up until January 31, 1980, the H.6 release was scheduled to be made

public every Thursday at 4:10 p.m. The regularly scheduled time was changed

to Friday at 4:10 p.m. beginning with the February 8, 1980 announcement.

Friday announcements remained the rule until February 10, 1984. Beginning

with the February 16, 1984 announcement the scheduled release time was

returned to Thursday at 4:10 p.m. Despite this schedule, actual

announcements are not always made at the regularly scheduled time due to

factors such as holidays and delays in gathering data. This fact has been

taken into account in the construction of the data set.

     The definition of money used in this paper is Ml from the beginning of

the sample until January 31, 1980 and from January 15, 1982 until the end of

the sample, but is Mi-B from February 8, 1980 until January 8, 1982. These

dates for switching the definition of money correspond to the dates at which

the definitions change in the published data. Until February 10, 1984 the

weekly money supply data are daily averages from Thursday to Wednesday,
                                                                               6




while beginning February 16, 1984 they are daily averages from Tuesday to

Monday.

     The weekly H.9 press release of the Board of Governors of the Federal

Reserve System contains monetary base data. This release is available only

from March 15, 1979 until February 10, 1984. Although, the regularly

scheduled time for the H.9 release is the same as for the H.6 release, there

are weeks when the two releases are not made on the same day. When examining

the interest rate effects of both money supply and monetary base

announcements, data for these weeks are not used in the analysis.

     The timing of the data in the H.9 release differs from the timing of

the data in the H.6 release; the preliminary announcement is for the average

monetary base during the week ending approximately two days ago and the

revised estimate is for the average monetary base during the week ending

approximately nine days ago. The preliminary monetary base announcement

which is released in week t is denoted    and the revised estimate which is

released in week t is denoted BLRt. The monetary base announcements are

always for a week ending Wednesday.

     The fact that monetary base announcements are made with a two day delay

and that money supply announcments are made with a nine day delay is

important for understanding what information is being revealed by a money

supply announcement. When an announcement is made in week t about the money

supply in week t-l, the monetary base for week t-l has already been

announced. Thus, the money supply announcement provides new information

about only the money multiplier.

     The monthly G.13 press release of the Board of Governors of the Federal

Reserve System provides interest rate data. The release contains daily

interest rates for U.S. Treasury bills of three-, six-, and twelve-month
                                                                                                7



maturity. The      rates are from dealer quotations in the secondary market, at

approximately 3:30 p.m.. Given this timing, the interest rates available for

the day    of   a money supply or monetary base armounceulent are rates before the

announcement.     For   week t,
                                  R3B     and R3A are the annualized interest rates on

three-month U.S. Treasury         bills   on the day   of   a money supply announcement
and   on   the first trading day after a money supply announcement,

respectively. A similar definition applies to R63I R6A, Rl23 and Rl2A --
interest    rates for six- and     twelve-month    U.S.     Treasury      bills.

      Money Market Services, a Belmont, California based corporation which

has   conducted   telephone surveys of approximately fifty government securities

dealers since late 1977, has kindly provided their weekly measure of money

supply announcement forecasts. Money Market Services conducts their surveys

every Tuesday, asking for an estimate of the money supply change that will

be announced later in the week. The data were made available beginning with

the announcement made on September 29, 1977 and ending with the announcement

made on March 29, 1984. The series used here,
                                                            XMESt,
                                                                     is   the median forecast

of all those surveyed.




III. The Money Supply Announcement-Interest Rate Relation



      This section presents results which extend the widely documented

relation between money supply announcements            and    interest rates through March

1984. In particular, the first three regressions presented in Table 1

relate the change in the interest rate on three-month U.S. Treasury bills
                                                                               8




(DR3 R3A R3B) to the unexpected and expected components of money supply

announcements. The weekly announcement of a change in the money supply has

been decomposed into expected and unexpected components (XMESt and

                              the Money Market Services survey measure of
XMUSt   M- MLRt XMES) using
expectations.2 The data have been divided into three samples with A.l

covering September 29, 1977 to October 4., 1979, 3.1 covering

October 11, 1979 to October 15, 1982, and C.l covering October 22, 1982 to

March 29, l984.

     The regression results show a positive and statistically significant

link between unexpected money supply announcements and interest rates in all

three periods examined.4 Further, the magnitude of the interest rate change

in response to news about the money supply varies considerably across

samples. In the pre-October 1979 period an unexpected increase of one

billion dollars in the announcid money supply raises the annualized interest

rate on three-month U.S. Treasury bills by less than two basis points. From

October 1979 to October 1982 the impact is over four times as large, nearly

nine basis points. From October 1982 to March 1984 the impact drops back to

just over three basis points. The substantial rise in the magnitude of the

impact that unexpected money supply announcements have on interest rates

after October 1979 is mostly reversed after October l982.

     Higher expected money announcements are associated with decreases in

interest rates in all samples. While expected money supply announcements do

not have significant explanatory power for interest rate changes pre-October

1979 or post-October 1982, they do have significant explanatory power from

October 1979 to October 1982.6 The existence of a predictable change in the

interest rate has often been interpreted as evidence against an efficient

bond market. However, this interpretation need not be correct. No violation

of bond market efficiency can be determined without explicitly considering
                                                                               9




the nature of the risk involved with basing portfolio decisions on expected

interest rate changes.

     Also of interest in the results of Table 1 are the standard errors of

the regressions, which are consistent with the well-known high level of

interest rate volatility for the period October 1979 to October 1982. During

this period, the standard deviation of the daily change in the interest rate

that cannot be explained by money supply announcements is over three times

larger than it is in the preceding and subsequent periods. Despite the high

standard error of the regression in the October 1979 to October 1982 period,

however, the adjusted R2 is approximately the same during the entire post-

October 1979 sample. Money supply announcements explain between 25% and 30%

of the one day movement in interest rates during this time.




IV. Stability and the Importance of Influential Observations



    The differences in the magnitude of the impact that money supply

announcements have on interest rates in different time periods appear

sufficiently large to justify the contention that the relation has not been

constant over time. Such differences may also lead one to question the

stability of the money supply announcement-interest rate link within each of

the sample periods in Table 1. This section demonstrates that the relation

is apparently stable within the October 1979 to October 1982 and post-

October 1982 samples but not within the pre-October 1979 sample. The

instability is linked to the role of a relatively few influential

observations and to significant heteroskedasticity. After accounting for the

instability in the pre-1979 sample, it is shown that the money supply
                                                                              10




announcement-interest rate relation is significantly different across the

pre-October 1979, October 1979 to October 1982 and post-October 1982

samples.

     The issue of within sample stability is addressed by the test

statistics found in the last two columns of Table 1. The number in

parentheses below a test statistics is its marginal significance level, so

that a value less than .05 indicates rejection of the null hypothesis at the

5% level. The last column provides the standard Chow test statistic for

testing coefficient stability within the sample.' The column entitled G-Q

TEST is a Goldfeld-Quandt test for heteroskedasticity, where the

observations are ordered chronologically.8 This test was used to uncover any

time trend behavior in the variance of the regression error.

     For the October 1979 to October 1982 and post-October 1982 samples,

neither the hypothesis of coefficent stability nor the hypothesis of

constant error variance can be rejected using standard significance levels.

In the pre-October 1979 sample, however, it is possible to reject both

hypotheses at the 5% significance level.

     Some insight into the nature of the instability of the money supply

announcement-interest rate relation in the pre-October 1979 period can be

obtained by examining the scatter plots displayed in Figures 1 and 2. Due

to the near orthogonality of XMUS   and XMES,   it is useful to examine

bivariate scatter plots of DR3 vs. XMIJS   (Figure   1) and DR3 vs. XMES

 (Figure 2). The primary points of interest in Figure 1 are the

observations for April 26, 1979 (denoted as point a) and for

November 9, 1978 (denoted as point b). These points appear to be

 influential in the sense that dropping them from the sample would noticeably

reduce the estimated coefficient on XMUS. Since both of these points fall in

the second half of the sample, it is not surprising that the Chow test

indicates coefficient instability)0 Figure 2 shows the observations for

April 26, 1979 and November 9, 1978 in the bivariate scatter plot of DR3 vs.

XMES.

        The effect of dropping the influential points mentioned above is shown

in the results for sample A.2 in Table 1 . The significant impact that

unexpected money supply announcements have on interest rate changes is lost

when the two influential points are omitted from the sample. The estimated

impact drops by over 50%, from 1.77 basis points to 0.80. Also of interest

in the results for sample A.2 is the fact that while dropping the

influential points is apparently sufficient to tabi1ize the estimated

coefficients, it is not sufficient to eliminate the heteroskedasticity of

the error term. A closer examination of the data indicated that the

heteroskedasticity was caused by an error variance which grows over the

sample. Dropping the observations before March 30, 1978, in addition to the

influential points, is sufficient to construct a pre-October 1979 sample

which has both constant coefficients and constant error variance) The

effect of dropping these observations is shown in the results for sample A.3

in Table 1. In this sample neither unexpected nor expected money supply

announcements have a significant impact on interest rate changes.

     Determining whether there was a significant link between money supply

announcements and interest rates during the pre-October 1979 period is

difficult in light of the results for samples A.2 and A.3. That is, the

observations for April 26, 1979 and November 9, 1978 are clearly

influential, but they cannot be considered "outliers" or "bad" observations

without additional information. Interestingly, Grossman (1981) and Roley

(1982,1983) report estimates of the impact of unexpected money supply
                                                                                    12




announcement on interest rates which are close to those reported in Table 1

for sample A.2, i.e. for the sample which drops influential observations.12

Since these authors measure interest rate changes over a one and a half hour

interval   on the   day of the announcement instead of the twenty four hour

interval   considered here, the influential points appear to be a reflection
of interest rate movements which are occurring during the day    following    the
announcement.   Presumably, this is a   reaction to events other than the money
supply   announcement and it seems appropriate to delete the influential

observations when measuring the impact of money supply announcements.

     Figures 3 through 6 contain the same type of information as Figures 1

and 2, but for different time periods. Figures 3 and 4 are for October 1979

through October 1982 while Figures 5 and 6 are for post-October 1982. The

scatter plots are informative, even though regression diagnostics indicate

no apparent instability during these latter time periods. Examination of

Figures 3 through 6 shows that, in contrast to the results for pre-October

1979, during the latter periods there is no obvious, small set of points

which underly the statistically significant relations reported in Table 1.

The relation between unexpected money supply announcements and interest

rates is seen in Figures 3 and 5 to be a result which appears characteristic

of the entire sample. Figure 4 illustrates a similar finding for the link

between expected money announcements and interest rates.

     The final issue addressed in this section is the stability of the money

supply announcement-interest rate link across the three stable periods

identified in the regressions of Table 1. The statistics presented at the

bottom of the table test the null hypothesis that the coefficients
                                                                      a1 and a2
are equal in the two, or three, samples indicated.13 They indicate that the

October 1979 to October 1982 period is significantly different from the

other periods examined.14 The joint hypothesis that after October 1982 the

coefficients a1 and     return to their pre-October 1979 values cannot be

rejected using a 5% significance level. Closer inspection of the individual

coefficients, however, indicates that there was a significant change in
                                                                          a1,
the only coefficient which is significantly different from zero in either

period. The Chow test for testing the equality of a1 in the pre.October 1979

and post-October 1982 periods is 5.66 (marginal significance level of .019).

     Combining the results of testing within-sample and across-sample

stability leads to the conclusion that from 1977 to 1984 the money supply

announcement-interest rate link is composed of three distinct relations. For

the pre-October 1979 period no statistically significant, stable relation

between money supply announcements and interest rates is apparent.15 For the

October 1979 to October 1982 period there is a significant, positive

association between unexpected money supply announcements and interest rate

changes and a significant negative relation between expected money supply

announcements and interest rate changes. For the post-October 1982 period,

the positive link between unexpected money supply announcements and interest

rate changes remains statistically significant but their impact diminishes.

There is no significant link between expected money supply announcements and

interest rates post-October 1982.




V. Interest Rates, Monetary Base Announcements, and Data Revisions



     The money supply is the product of the monetary base and the money

multiplier. As previously explained, given the delays in releasing monetary

data, money supply announcements convey new information about only the money
                                                                               14



multiplier. A natural question which arises from this observation is, do the

weekly monetary base announcements provide any additional information

relevant for interest rate determination? The evidence presented in this

section shows that unexpected monetary base announcements do have a

statistically significant impact on interest rates during the period from

October 1979 to October 1982. After October 1982, the effect of unexpected

monetary base announcements diminishes and becomes statistically

insignificant. Another question examined in this section is, do weekly

announcements of money supply and monetary base revisions affect interest

rates? It is shown that much previous research has constrained the interest

rate impact of revisions and preliminary data announcements to be equal.

While this constraint cannot be rejected, neither can the hypothesis that

revision announcements have no effect on interest rates.

      As mentioned in section II, weekly money supply announcements contain

two sources of information. There is an announced change in the money

supply, DM Mt Mi, and an announced revision of a previously reported

money supply, NRVt_             The impact that these two announcements have

on interest rates has been constrained in previous work. The most widely

used constraint is that the impact of DM is equal in magnitude to the

impact of MRVt, but is of the opposite sign. This constraint is used in

previous sections since the series which was decomposed into an expected and

unexpected component was XM1— DM V. Another constraint which has been

used is that MRV has no impact on interest rates, so that the series DMt is

decomposed into expected and unexpected components.

     Imposing constraints on the way interest rates react to the two

announcements is necessary if one wishes to measure expectations exclusively

by survey data because only one survey series is available. Nevertheless,
                                                                               15




the constraints which have been imposed do not necessarily hold for the data

being examined. A more general approach, one which would not impose these

constraints, is desirable.

     This more general approach is made operational in this section by

decomposing both DM and       into their expected and unexpected components

and relating interest rate changes to these four variables in an

unconstrained manner. The decompositions are done in two ways. First, both

DMt and MRV are decomposed into expected and unexpected components using

linear regressions. The regressors are a constant, the survey measure of

expectations, the most recent change in the money supply (DM1 M1

       revision in the money supply (MRVti Mt1 M2) change in the

monetary base t-l Bt-l B2), and revision in the monetary base

(BRV1 t-l B2) available before the announcement, the most recently
available weekly change in the interest rate on three-month U.S. Treasury

bills (DR3B R3B R3B1) and the spread between the interest rates on

three- and six-month U.S. Treasury bills prior to the announcement (SPR_

R6B R3B). Thus, the survey information is supplemented by information

from interest rates and past monetary announcements. The interest rate

variables DR3B and SPRt differ from the other regressors because they may

contain useful information which becomes available after the survey is

conducted butbefore the monetary announcements. The variables constructed

from these regressions are DMUR (unexpected DMt formed from regression),

DMER (expected DMt formed from regression), VURt, and MRVER.

     The second decomposition is based on the assumption that the survey
measure of expectations does not contain a forecast of the money supply

revision, i.e. it is measuring expectations of DMt, not XM. This

assumption, which will be shown to be consistent with   the   data, implies that
                                                                              16



the variables DMUR and DMER can be replaced by DMUSt (DMlTS DMt XMES,

unexpected DMt formed from the survey) and XMESt (expected DMt from the

survey).

     Before turning to the results which are based on these decompositions,

issues involved with determining the impact that monetary base announcements

may have on interest rates are considered. As described in section II, for

the majority of dates on which money supply announcements are made, monetary

base announcements are also made. These announcements are similar to the

money supply announcements in that they two contain two parts, an announced

                                              and an announced revision in the
change in the monetary base, DB -     Bt.i,
monetary base, BRVt._ BLR.. B1. With no survey measures of expectations

concerning the monetary base announcements, DB and BRVt have been

decomposed using the same regression techniques used to decompose DMt and

NRVt. The variables formed are D&JRt (unexpected changes in the announced

monetary base formed from regression), DBERt (expected changes in the

announced monetary base formed from regression), BRVURt and BRVERt.

     The regression equations used to form the decompositions of the money

supply and monetary base variables have been estimated separately for the

October 1979 to October 1982 and the post October 1982 periods. Given

limitations on data availability and the failure of the pre-October 1979

period to exhibit any significant relation between money supply

announcements and interest rates, that period is dropped from subsequent

analysis.

     Table 2 presents the results of estimating equations for DMt and MRVt.

For purposes of comparison, results are also presented for XMt. The results

for the XN and DMt regressions are very similar, indicating that the survey

series can be viewed as an equally good measure of the expected change in
                                                                              17




the announced money supply when that change does not include a revision as

when ft does. Although during the latter period lagged monetary base changes

do contain information which is useful for predicting announced money supply

changes that is not included in the survey forecast, the reported F-

statistics in the DM regressions show that the joint hypothesis that a1 — 1

and the remaining a 0 cannot be rejected at standard significance levels

in either time period. Survey responses thus appear to contain reasonably

accurate forecasts of money supply announcements.

     The information examined here has significant explanatory power for

announcements of money supply revisions during the period from October 1979

to October 1982.16 The F-statistic in the MRV regression shows that the

hypothesis that a — 0 (i—1,7) is rejected at the 5% significance level.

This implies that it is feasible to measure the separate impacts of the

expected and unexpected money supply revisions on interest rates. In the

post-October 1982 sample money supply revisions appear to be essentially

unpredictable, raising the possibility that the impact of expected revisions

is not identifiable from the data.

     The results presented in Table 3 indicate that, in both periods

examined, there is a predictable component to both the change in the

announced monetary base and the monetary base revision.

      The standard errors of the regressions presented in Tables 2 and 3 are

also of interest. Those in Table 2 indicate that unexpected money supply

changes and revisions have become less volatile post-October 1982. Those in

Table 3 do not show a similar finding for unexpected monetary base changes

and revisions. Unexpected changes in the announced money supply are always

more variable than unexpected changes in the announced base. For both money

supply and monetary base announcements, unexpected revisions are less
                                                                               18




variable than the unexpected changes but the difference is more pronunced

for the money supply.

     Table 4 contains the results of relating interest rate changes to the

expected and unexpected components of the four series DM,        DB.. and

BRVt. Several of the results are worthy of note.17 First, during the October

1979 to October 1982 period, when announcement effects are most pronounced,

unexpected. increases in the announced monetary base significantly raise

interest rates.18 Regardless of how money supply announcements are

decomposed into an expected and an unexpected component, an unexpected

increase in the announced monetary base of one billion dollars is estimated

to increase the annualized interest rate on a three month U.S. Treasury bill

by over thirteen and one half basis points. This estimated impact is greater

in magnitude than the estimated impact of a. similarly sized unexpected

increase in the announced money supply, though the difference is not
                                          19
statistically significant at the 5% level.     The strong impact that

unexpected monetary base announcements have on interest rates exists only in

the October 1979 to October 1982 period. There is no statistically

significant impact of monetary base announcements after October 1982.

     The estimated response of interest rates to unexpected changes in the

announced money supply is not sensitive to allowing for effects of monetary

base announcements, relaxing the constraint on the effects of money supply

revisions, or augmenting survey data with additional information to form a

regression-based measure of expected money supply announcements. An

unexpected one billion dollar increase in the announced money supply is

estimated to raise interest rates by between nine and one half and ten basis

points in the October 1979 to October 1982 period and by between three and
                                                                               19




one half and four basis points post-October 1982. These effects are always

statistically significant and are similar in magnitude to those in

Table 1.20

     Interest rates do not move significantly in response to announcements

of unexpected money supply and monetary base revisions. However, the

hypothesis that unexpected changes and revisions affect interest rates with

equal magnitude and in opposite directions cannot be rejected at standard

significance levels either.21 Either omitting announcements of revisions

from the analysis or constraining their impact to be the same as that of

announcements of preliminary monetary figures is compatible with the data.

     When announcements are decomposed into an expected and unexpected

component via regressions, no expected component of an announcement has a

significant impact on interest rates in any time period. In contrast, the

expected change in the announced money supply taken from the survey measure,

         does have a significant impact on interest rates during the October
XMESt,
1979 to October 1982 period. Thus, the modelling of expectations is

important for determining if the expected component of announcements

significantly affect interest rates but is not important for determining the

significance of any other variables.22




VI. The Predictive Ability of Unexpected Announcements for Future Money

     Supply and Monetary Base Changes



     As shown in previous sections, interest rates move significantly in

response to unanticipated money supply and monetary base announcements. In

attempting to account for this effect of money supply announcements, one
                                                                               20



popular hypothesis contends that an increase in the unexpected component of

the announced money supply raises expectations of money growth, thereby

raising expected inflation and nominal interest rates. A competing

hypothesis contends that an increase in the unexpected component of the

announced money supply lowers expectations of money growth, raises expected

future real interest rates, and thereby raises current real (and nominal)

interest rates. In what follows, these are referred to as the "money supply

expansion" and. "money supply contraction" hypotheses.23

     Both these hypotheses envision unexpected announcements as conveying

information about the future course of the money supply. In this section,

the ability of unexpected money supply and monetary base announcements to

predict subsequent changes in the money supply, as well as in the monetary

base, is empirically examined.

     It is shown that during the period from October 1979 to October 1982,

when monetary announcements had their largest impact on interest rates,

unexpected money supply announcements had different predictive implications

than did unexpected monetary base announcements. Unexpected increases in the

announced money supply signalled increased money growth, but unexpected

increases in the announced monetary base signalled decreased money growth.

Also, while unexpected increases in both the announced monetary base and

money supply are accompanied by higher base growth, this growth was larger

and more permanent following base announcements. Since unexpected changes in

the announced money supply and monetary base moved interest rates in the

same direction and by the same magnitude during this time period, these

findings cast doubt on the proposition that monetary announcements are

moving interest rates solely by providing information about the subsequent

behavior of the money supply or the monetary base. Changes in the predictive
                                                                                  21



ability of unexpected money supply and monetary base announcements in

October 1982 also appear problematical for this proposition.

     Given the delay in publishing monetary data, a one billion dollar

unexpected increase in the money supply announced in week t raises the

expected change in the money supply from week t-2 to t-l by one billion

dollars plus any change in the expected money supply revision to be

announced in week t+l that can be predicted by this announcement.24 To the

extent that the monetary base announcement made in week t helps predict this

revision, it contains additional information regarding the money supply

change during this period. Both announcements may help predict money supply

changes from week t1 to any time in the future.

     In order to examine these issues of prediction, the change in the money

supply over three different horizons and the relevant money supply revision

have been regressed on unexpected monetary announcements in week t. Table 5

reports the results from estimating these regressions. The dependent

variable MRV+i_ 2t÷l        is the money supply revision announced in week

t+l. DMFO.. t÷2                                and DMFl3_ MLR±i5 Mt measure
the sum of this revision and the change in the money supply (including

revision) from week t-1 to week t, week t-l to one month after the

announcement and week t-l to one quarter after the announcement,

respectively. The independent variables are the unexpected announcements

DMUS and DBURt. Similar results apply if DMUS is replaced by XMUS, DMtJRt

or URt.
     The evidence for the October 1979 to October 1982 sample is that a one

billion dollar surprise increase in the money supply announced in week t

predicts that the money supply change from week t-2 to week t will be higher

by 060 billion dollars (0.60 —   1.0   -
                                           0.40),   a statistically significant
                                                                              22




increase. This figure is the net result of the initial 1.0 billion dollar

increase from week t-2 to week t-l being revised to a 1.07 billion dollar

increase and followed by a reduction of 0.47 billion dollars in the money

supply from week t-l to t, a reduction which only partially offsets the

initial increase. The estimated a1 coefficients in the DMF4 and DMF13

regressions are not significantly different from zero but are significantly

different from minus one.25 Thus, for the one-month and one-quarter

horizons, one cannot reject the hypothesis that there is no offset of the

initial increase in the money supply but can reject the hypothesis that

there is a full offset of the initial increase. An unexpected increase in

the money supply announced in week t signals a permanently higher money

supply beginning with week t-1 and, accordingly, a higher growth rate from

week t-2 to all dates in the future.

     In contrast, during the October 1979 to October 1982 period an

unexpected increase in the monetary base announced in week t predicts a

lower money supply in the future and lower growth rates from week t-2

forward. A 1.0 billion dollar surprise increase in the monetary base

predicts a significant reduction of 1.12 billion dollars in the money supply

change from week t-2 to t, with reductions of 1.41 and 2.06 billion dollars

predicted for thehorizons of one month and one quarter. Despite the

significance of these reductions for the longer horizons, the t-statistics

in square brackets beneath the coefficients indicate that no significant

changes are predicted from week t to the future. The significant money

supply contraction that follows an increase in the unexpected monetary base

announcement occurs only from week t-l to week t.

     The results reported in Table 5 show that no major change is apparent

in the predictive ability of money supply announcements for money supply
                                                                              23




behavior after October 1982. The parameter estimates suggest that, as

before, unexpected increases in the announced money supply signal higher

money growth rates from week t-2 to the future. Given the imprecision of the

estimated parameters, however, the evidence is less conclusive. Neither the

hypothesis that there is no offset following an unexpected increase in the

announced money supply nor the hypothesis that such an increase is fully

offset can be rejected at the 5% signficance level for horizons beyond the

announcement date.

     For the post-October 1982 period, unexpected increases in monetary base

announcements predict a money supply reduction from week t-l to week t but

predict money supply expansion for the horizons of one month and one

quarter. These predicted expansions and the lack of any significant

predictive power are in sharp contrast to the results for the October 1979

to October 1982 period, when unexpected increases in the monetary base

significantly predict money supply reductions.

     Taken together, the findings reported in Tables 4 and 5 lead to mixed

conclusions about the empirical accuracy of the the hypotheses discussed in

the first paragraph of this section. The "money supply contraction"

hypothesis is supported by the significant predictive ability of unexpected

monetary base announcements for money supply changes and the significant

effect of these announcements on interest rates during the October 1979 to

October 1982 period. The changes to a lack of significant predictive ability

and the absence of a significant interest rate effect for monetary base

announcements in the post-October 1982 period is also consistent with the

hypothesis. However, the finding that unexpected increases in the announced

money supply both raise interest rates and signal higher money growth in all

periods contradicts the hypothesis. While this latter result does provide
                                                                               24



support for the "money supply expansion" hypothesis, the findings previously

discussed for monetary base announcements during the October 1979 to October

1982 period conflict with it. The "money supply expansion" hypothesis is

also in apparent conflict with the reduction in the impact of unexpected

money supply announcements on interest rates after October 1982 and the lack

of a noticeable change in the predictive ability of these announcements fur

subsequent money supply behavior.

     The failure of these hypotheses to fully account for the interest rate

response to unexpected money supply and monetary base announcements

indicates that the response is not attributable to only the arrival of new

information about the behavior of the money supply. Unexpected monetary

announcements must be conveying information about other variables relevant

for interest rate determination. The monetary base may be such a variable.

Accordingly, Table 6 provides evidence on the predictive ability of

unexpected monetary announcements for future monetary base changes. This

evidence also supplements the evidence in Table 5 by indicating how the

money supply changes predicted by unexpected monetary announcements occur,

i.e. whether through changes in the monetary base and/or the money

multiplier.

     A one billion dollar unexpected increase in the monetary base

announcement in week t raises the expected change in the base from week t-1

to t by one billion dollars plus any change it can predict for the revision

to be announced in week t÷l.26 Money supply announcements can help predict

changes in the monetary base from week t-l to week t only if they can

predict the base revision announced in week t+l. Both announcements may help

predict monetary base changes from week t to any time in the future.

          Table 6 contains the results of regressing the relevant monetary base

revision and subsequent base changes on unexpected monetary announcements.

DBF1 Rt+2 B, DBF4t= Mt+S

for      monetary base behavior are for the period October 1979 to October 1982,

when an increase in the unexpected money supply announcement in week t

predicts an increase in the monetary base change from week t to t÷l.

However, there is no significant prediction of a change in the base for

horizons of one month or one quarter and the size of the estimated a1

coefficient in the DBF4 regression (and the t-statistic appearing in square

brackets below it) suggests that this initial increase in the base is offset

within a month.

          As regards the predictive ability of unexpected monetary base

announcements, the evidence for the October 1979 to October 1982 sample is

that a 1.0 billion dollar surprise increase in the base announced in week t

predicts that the monetary base change from week t-l to t+l will be

statistically significantly higher by 0.31 billion dollars (0.31                             1.0 -

0.69).       The predicted reduction of 0.69 billion dollars, which only partially

offsets the initial increase, is composed of a -0.20 billion dollar monetary

base revision announced at time t+l and a -0.49 billion dollar change in the

base from week t to t+1. The predicted monetary base changes from week t-1

to one month and one quarter after the announcement are also higher, by 0.32

and 0.20 billion dollars respectively. The similarity between the magnitude
                                                                               26




of these changes and the change from week t-1 to t+1 suggests that no

important movements in the monetary base are predicted after week t+l. For

this sample, an unexpected increase in the monetary base announced in week t

signals a higher base during all weeks from t into the future and,

accordingly, a higher growth rate from week t-l to all dates in the future.

     For the period post-October 1982, an unexpected increase in the base

announced in week t is again followed by significant offsetting changes. The

hypothesis that these changes fully offset the increase cannot be rejected

at any of the horizons considered using a 5% significance level. However,

for the one month and three month horizons the point estimates indicate only

a partial offset. In summary, an unexpected increase in the announced

monetary base provides evidence of a statistically insignificant increase in

base growth from week t-l to the future.

     Taken together, does the evidence in Tables 4 and 6 suggest that the

informational content of unexpected monetary announcements for monetary base

changes is an important factor for explaining why these announcements affect

interest rates? For money supply announcements, the answer is quite clearly

no. These announcements generally have no predictive power for monetary base

changes, yet they do have a significant impact on interest rates. For

monetary base announcements the answer is less clear. During the October

1979 to October 1982 period, an unexpected increase in the announced

monetary base significantly raises interest rates and signals a permanently

higher level of the base, consistent with a "monetary base expansion"

hypothesis. After October 1982, the interest rate effect of unexpected

monetary base announcements diminishes and becomes insignificant while it is

unclear whether there is a reduction in the size of the monetary base change

predicted by these announcements.
                                                                               27




     Combining the results reported in Tables 5 and 6 provides evidence on

how the predictions of money supply changes contained in unexpected monetary

announcements are divided into predictions of subsequent changes in the

money multiplier and the monetary base. For both samples examined, an

unexpected increase in the money supply announcement made in week t predicts

a higher money supply for weeks t-l, t, t+4 and t+13, significantly so in

all but one case. Given that information about the monetary base in weeks

t-l and t is available in week t and that unexpected money supply

announcements have no significant predictive power for the monetary base

over the one month or one quarter horizons, the increase in the money supply

predicted for these weeks is due only to information about higher money

multipliers. Money supply announcements are not only providing new

information solely about previous money multipliers, but their predictions

of subsequent money supply changes are limited to predictions about

subsequent money multipliers.

     Unexpected monetary base announcements have significant predictive

power for subsequent money supply behavior only from October 1979 to October

1982. During this period an unexpected monetary base increase announced in

week t signals a lower money supply and a higher monetary base for weeks t,

t+4 and t+13. Thus, the decrease in the money supply predicted by these

announcements is reflecting predictions of changes both in the multiplier

and in the base, with the multiplier changes being more important.
                                                                              28




VII. The Impact of Monetary Announcements on Term-Structure Premia



     This section provides evidence that several of the new empirical

regularities reported in previous sections for the interest rate on three-

month U.S. Treasury bills also carry over to the longer-term interest rates

on six- and twelve-month U.S. Treasury bills. Since these longer-term

interest rates can be decomposed into a current short-term rate, expected

future short-term rates and term premia, it is useful to determine the

specific channel that gives rise to the interest rate effects of

unanticipated monetary announcements. The results of this section indicate

that both unexpected money supply and monetary base announcements are

affecting six- and twelve-month interest rates through their impact on

current and expected future three-month rates, with no impact on term

premia.

     The results presented in Tables 7 and 8, for six- and twelve-month

interest rates respectively, show many similarities to those presented in

Table 4 for the three-month interest rate. During the October 1979 to

October 1982 period, unexpected increases in both the announced money supply

and monetary base significantly raise these longer-term interest rates and

the hypothesis that the impact of an unexpected monetary base announcement

is equal to the impact of an unexpected money supply announcement of the

same magnitude cannot be rejected at standard significance levels.27 Post-

October 1982 only unexpected money supply announcements have a significant

effect. Expected announcements significantly affect six- and twelve-month

interest rates only if measured by the Money Market Services survey;

although in contrast to the results for three-month interest rates, these

effects are significant both before and after October 1982. Unexpected
                                                                               29




monetary revisions do not have a significant impact on interest rates in

either sample.

     Are the effects of unexpected monetary announcements on the longer-term

interest rates that are documented in Tables 7 and 8 capturing the effect of

these announcements on current short-term interest rates, on expected future

short-term interest rates and/or on term premia? Specifically, consider the

following equations which link the six-month interest rate to current and

expected future three-month interest rates and a term premium:

                     R6Bt =   .5*R3B + .5*btR3Bt+l3 + TP6Bt
                     R6A      .5*R3At + •5*a,tR3At+13 + TP6A
where R3B and R3A are the three-month interest rates before and after the

announcements in week t (similarly for R6Bt and R6A), b,tR3Bt+l3 is the

expectation of R3B÷13 before the announcement in week t, a,tR3At+13 is the

expectation of R3A+i3 after the announcement in week t, and TP6B and TP6A

are the term premia defined by the two equations. Subtracting the first

equation from the second yields

          DR6 = DTP6 + .5*DR3t + •S*(a,tR3At+13 -
                                                  b,tR3Bt+l3)
where DTP6 TP6A - TP6B. The corresponding equation for the change in
the twelve-month interest rate is

          DRl2= DTPl2-I .25*DR3t+ •25*(a,tR3At+i3 -    b,tR3Bt÷l3)
                 +• 25*(a, tR3A÷26   b, R3Bt÷26 + •25*(atR3At+39 b, R3B+39).
The arrival of new information contained in monetary announcements can

affect DR6 and DR12 through its effect on any or all of the variables on

the right-hand-side of the above equations.

    A test of the hypothesis that unexpected monetary announcements move

these longer-term interest rates solely by affecting the current three-month

rate, i.e. that they have no impact on term premia or on expected future
                                                                               30




three-month interest rates, can be conducted using results from regressions

of DR63. DR6 5*DR3 and DRl23 DRl2 . 25*DR3             on DMUSt and DBURt. A

finding of significant coefficients on these regressors indicates rejection

of the hypothesis. Table 9 reports the results of estimating these

regressions. During the period from October 1979 to October 1982, the

coefficients on DMUSt and DBURt in the DR6 .
                                               5*DR3t regression and the
coefficient on DMUS in the DRl2 .
                                     25*DR3t regression significantly differ
from zero at the 5% level. The coefficient on DMUSt is significant in both

regresssions after October 1982. Thus, the significant response of six- and

twelve month interest rates to unexpected monetary announcements is

reflecting a movement in expected future three-month rates and/or term-

structure premia.

     To examine whether movements in term-structure premia are significantly

responding to unexpected monetary announcements, the changes in the six- and

twelve month premia (DTP6 and DTP12) are postulated to be linear functions

of D1USt and DBURt. In addition, the terms a,tRSAt+j (j-=13,26 and 39) are

expressed as the sum of the actual value R3A       and a forecast error e.
                                            t+.]                    J,t
Substituting these specifications into the above equations for DR6 and

DRl2, and moving all observable variables with known coefficients to the

left-hand-side, yields

              PREMJt     a0 + ai*DMUS + a2*DBUR + eJ, J—6,12

where PREN6 =
                DR6      5*DR3 .5*R3Ati3, PREMl2 —    DRl2t   .25*DR3

.25*(R3At+13+ R3A÷26+ R3At+39), e6 .S*(e13 b,tR3Bt+l3) and
el2 = 25*(e         + e26 + e39 -
                                    b,t(R3Bt÷l3+ R3B+26+ R3B÷3g)).
    Under the assumption that expectations of future interest rates are

formed rationally, estimation of these equations by ordinary least squares

gives consistent estimates of the unknown parameters a1.28 A finding that
                                                                              31




the coefficients on DMIJSt or DBIJRt are significantly different from zero

indicates that term-structure premia are affected by unexpected monetary

announcements. If the effect of these announcements on the longer-term

interest rates is solely due to their impact on current and expected future

three-month interest rates, then (except for sampling error) these

coefficients will not be significantly different from zero.

     Table 10 provides estimates of the effects that unexpected monetary

announcements have on six- and twelve-month term-structure preniia.

Unexpected increases in the announced money supply are estimated to lower

both term premia in the October 1979 to October 1982 period but raise these

premia after October 1982. Unexpected increases in the announced monetary

base are estimated to increase both premia during the period from October

1979 to October 1982, the only period when these announcements have a

significant impact on interest rates. However, none of the coefficients

reported in Table 10 are significantly different from zero. Unexpected

monetary announcements appear to move six- and twelve interest rates because

of their impact on both current and three-month interest rates, but not

because of their impact on term-structure premia.




VIII. CONCLUDING REMARKS



     This paper contains the results from an econometric investigation of

the link between interest rates, money supply announcements and monetary

base announcements. A new set of empirical regularities regarding the

effects of these announcements on interest rates, their predictive ability

for the subsequent behavior of the money supply and monetary base, and their
                                                                              32




effects on term-structure premia has been presented. Since the main findings

have been summarized in the introductory section, we conclude by discussing

some of their implications for future research.

     It has been shown that interest rates respond significantly not only to

announcements of the Ml money supply, but also to the announcements of the

monetary base. Since the Federal Reserve releases weekly information on a

variety of other monetary aggregates, a more complete characterization of

the monetary announcements-interest rate link can be obtained by

investigating the response of interest rates to these other announcements.

For example, the diminished magnitude of the impact that Ml announcements

have after October 1982 makes it interesting to know if announcements

concerning M2 or M3 are of increased importance for interest rate

determination after this date. In addition, it would be useful to examine

the effects of individual components of the announced monetary aggregates on

interest rates, e.g. checkable deposits, currency, borrowed reserves, and

nonborrowed reserves.

     The methodology used in this paper to evaluate the ability of

alternative hypotheses to explain the link between monetary announcements

and interest rates is straightforward. It entails examining how the

information contained in the unexpected announcements can be used to predict

future values of critical variables. Since the evidence presented here casts

doubt on the proposition that unexpected monetary announcements are

affecting interest rates solely by providing information about the

subsequent behavior of the money supply or the monetary base, it would be

worthwhile to investigate whether these announcements contain information

concerning other variables relevant for interest rate determination.
                                                                              33




Possible candidates are future inflation, real interest rates and real

economic activity.

     In terms of future theoretical research, the empirical regularities

reported here place restrictions on the class of models that can be used to

explain the observed monetary announcements-interest rate link. The findings

that new information about both the money multiplier and the monetary base

have a significant impact on interest rates and that the magnitudes and

significance of these impacts are different when different operating

procedures are used by the Federal Reserve, are examples of phenomena that a

complete theoretical explanation must account for.

2. Admittedly, the correct procedure for this decomposition is not
    immediately obvious given the vagueness of the survey question and the
   fact that the money supply announcement contains two pieces of
    information,      and MLRt. The survey asks for the respondent's expected
   change in the money supply without specifying what base level should be
   used. That is, no mention is made of whether the respondent should
    forecast       M1 or Mt MLRt. If respondents are including a prediction
    of the monetary revision in their forecast of the change in the money
    supply, the correct decomposition is XMESt and (Mt MLRt) - XMESt. If
    respondents are not forecasting the revision, the correct decomposition

    is XMESt and (M M1) - XMES.         Both decompositions have been used in
    the past, but the majority of researchers assume that respondents are
    forecasting the revision. Accordingly, in this section the unexpected
    change in the announced money supply is defined to be
                   MLR) - XMES.   An analysis of whether revisions in the
   money supply are predictable and are included in respondents forecasts
    is taken up section V.
3. Time periods A.l and B.l have been estimated separately since previous
    research has shown that the October 1979 change in monetary policy, away
    from interest rate targeting and towards monetary aggregates targeting,
   has affected the money supply announcement-interest rate relation. We
    subdivide the post-October 1979 period because of another change in
   monetary policy in October 1982, when the Federal Reserve returned, at
    least partially, to interest rate targeting.
4. Because some of the money supply announcements are on Thursdays and
    others are on Fridays, DR3 measures an interest rate change which is
    sometimes from Thursday to Friday and sometimes from Friday to Monday.
    This, along with the fact that announcements do not always take place on
   the scheduled day, led us to test for a day-of-the-week effect in our
   sample. There was no evidence of such an effect.
5. These results are in conformity with those reported in studies using
   similar specifications. For example Roley and Troll (1983) report the
   impact of a one billion dollar surprise in the announced money supply on
   the interest rate of a three-month U.S. Treasury bill to be 1.58 basis
   points in the pre-October 1979 period and 10.38 basis points in the
   October 1979 to October 1982 period. Shiller, Campbell and
   Schoenholtz (1983) estimate the impact to be 9.88 in the period from
   February 1980 to February 1983. Studies which measure the unexpected
   money supply announcement in percentage rather than absolute changes are
   also similar in that they indicate a positive, statistically significant
   impact both pre-October 1979 and from October 1979 to October 1982, with
   the magnitude of the impact being noticeably larger in the latter
   period. See for example Cornell (1985), Falk and Orazem (1985),
   and Judd (1984). Judd (1984) and Loeys (1985) present evidence that the
   impact diminshes after October 1982. Work by Grossman (1981) and
   Roley (1982,1983) on the pre-October 1979 and October 1979 to October
   1982 periods differs from this study and the studies mentioned above
   because they measure the change in interest rates over an hour and a
   half interval rather than a one day interval. In terms of the sign and
   significance of the estimated relations, their results match those of
   Table 1.
6. These results are also in general agreement with those reported in other
   studies. Direct comparison of point estimates is not possible since
   studies which measure money supply announcements as absolute changes,
   such as Roley and Troll (1983) and Shiller, Campbell and
   Schoenholtz (1983), do not report an estimate of the impact of the
   expected component of the announcement. However, studies which measure
   money supply announcements in percentage terms, such as Cornell (1985)
   and Falk and Orazem (1985), report the impact of the expected component
   of the money supply announcement on the interest rate for a three-month
   U.S. Treasury bill to be negative both pre-October 1979 and from
   October 1979 to October 1982, but to be statistically insignificant in
   the earlier period. For the latter period the results of Falk and
    Orazem (1985) indicate that the impact is statistically significant
   while those of Cornell (1985) indicate insignificance. Studies which
   measure interest rate changes over an hour and a half horizon also
    report results which are similar to those in Table 1. That is, Grossman
    (1981) and Roley (1982,1983) find that pre-October 1979 expected money
    supply announcements have a negative but insignificant impact on
    interest rates, and Roley (1982,1983) finds that from February 1980 to
   October 1982 this impact is negative and significant.

    also     computed. These tests lead to the same conclusions as those
    reported in Table 1. In all tests, the coefficients that are not being
    tested for stability are left unconstrained.
8. The Goldfeld-Quandt test for heteroskedasticity is described in
    Johnston (1972), pages 218-19. The test involves ordering the
    observations in a manner which, a priori, should lead to increasing
    variance. Several observations are dropped from the middle of the
    sample, a separate regression is fit to the first and last sets of
    observations and the ratio of the two sums of squared residuals is
    formed. Under the null hypothesis of no heteroskedasticity, the
    asymptotic distribution of this statistic is the F-distribution with
    n1- k and n2- k degrees of freedom, where n1 and n2 are the number of
    observations in the first and last samples and k is the number of
    explanatory variables. The test statistics reported in Table 1 use the
    first and last 39 observations from sample A.l, the first and last 58
    from sample B.l, the first and last 28 from sample C.l, the first and
    last 38 from sample A.2, and the first and last 31 from sample A.3.
9. If XMLJS and XMES are orthogonal (uncorrelated), the OLS regression
    coefficients on these variables can be obtained in the bivariate
    regressions of DR3 on a constant and XMUS and DR3 on a constant and
   XMES.
10. Testing for the stability of the coefficients a1 and a2 separately
    confirms the fact that the Chow test reported in Table 1 is reflecting
   primarily instability in a1. The F-test for testing stability of a1 is
    7.35 (marginal significance level equal to .008) and for testing the
    stability of a2 is 0.44 (marginal significance level equal to .51).
11. The date of March 30, 1978 results from dropping the first one fourth of
    the pre-October 1979 sample. This date was arrived at as follows. The
    two regressions estimated for the construction of the G-Q test reported
    in Table 1 indicated that the variance of the regression error was
    larger in the latter part of the pre-October 1979 sample. Splitting
    these samples in half indicated no significant change in the size of the
    error variance in the second half but a significant change of the error
    variance in the first half. Next, we tested for a constant error
    variance in the last three-fourths of the pre-October 1979 sample and
    failed to reject this hypothesis.
12. For the pre-October 1979 period, Grossman (1981) estimates that a one
    billion dollar positive surprise in the money supply announcement raises
    the interest rate on a three-month U.S. Treasury bill by 0.83 points,
    while Roley (1982,1983) reports estimates from 0.65 to 0.78 basis
    points. In contrast to our finding in sample A.2, Grossman (1981) and
    Roley (1982,1983) find this effect to be statistically significantly
    different from zero. This difference is explainable by their use of a
    shorter interval for measuring the interest rate change, which results
    in more precise estimates. Roley (1983) also reports test statistics
    indicating a lack of coefficient instability and of heteroskedasticity
    in the pre-October 1979 sample.
13. So as not to constrain the variances of the regression errors to be
    equal across samples, the tests have been conducted using weighted least
    squares estimates. The weights are based on estimates of the regression
    error variances obtained from the estimated equations reported in
    Table 1.
14. Although it is generally recognized that October 1979 marks a change in
    the money supply announcement-interest rate link, with the exception of
    Roley (1983), previous work has not formally documented the significance
    of this change. Loeys (1985) tests for the significance of changes in
    the money supply announcement-interest rate relation but the results are
    hard to interpret for two reasons. First, apparently no adjustment is
    made for the heteroskedasticity across sample periods. Second, the
    breakpoints used in the Chow tests are selected so as to maximize the
    probability of finding a significant break. Quandt (1960) shows that
    this procedure is not asymptotically valid.
15. As described in footnote 12, the relatively small impact of unexpected
    announcements has been estimated to be statistically significant when
    interest rate changes are measured over a shorter time interval than the
    one day interval used here.
16. The issue of whether revisions of the originally published money supply
    data are predictable or not has also been addressed by Mankiw, Runkle
    and Shapiro (1984). Though their data and approach are different, they
    reach the same basic conclusion -    - at   the time of its release, the
    originally published estimate is not the optimal available predictor of
    the true money supply.
17. Given that for the post-October 1982 period the F-test reported in
    Table 2 does not reject the hypothesis that money supply revisions are
    unpredictable, the equations of Table 4 have also been estimated for
    this sample replacing MRVUR and NRVER. with MRV. None of the results
    reported below are affected by this change.
18. The standard errors of the estimated parameters reported in Table 4, and
    throughout the paper where appropriate, have been adjusted to reflect
    the use of a two-step procedure, i.e. first using a regression to form
    the expectations and then using these expectations as regressors. See
    Murphy and Topel (1985) and Pagan (1984).
19. For example, the Wald statistic for testing that DBIJR and DMUR have the
    same impact on interest rates is 0.55, which has a marginal significance
    level of .46.
20. Data availability has necessitated reducing the sample sizes used for
    Table 4 from those used for Table 1; for details, see the the appendix.
   When the equations of Table 1 are estimated for the smaller samples, the
    coefficients on XMUSt and XMESt are 9.24 and -6.76 for the period
    October 1979 to October 1982 (SER      35.13, 2= .25, and
    D.W. —   1.66),   and 3.36 and -1.16 for the post-October 1982 period
    (SER —   8.16, 2, .39, and D.W. — 1.93).
21. For example, the Wald statistic for testing that the coefficient on DMUR
    is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the coefficient on NRVIJR
    is .02 (marginal significance level of .89) in the earlier period and
    .46 (marginal significance level of .50) in the latter period. In these
    regressions the Wald statistic for testing that the coefficient on DBUR
    is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the coefficient on BRVUR
    is 3.13 (marginal significance level of .08) in the earlier period and
    1.99 (marginal significance level of .16) in the latter period.
22. This result conforms with Roley (1983) for the period February 1980 to
    October 1982 (the only period he examines), despite some differences in
    the construction of the augmented expectations.
23. These two hypotheses have also been referred to as the "expected
    inflation" and the "policy anticipations" hypotheses. Because these
    names are slightly misleading, in that both hypotheses implicitly
    incorporate some policy anticipations, we use different names. For a
    review of these, and other, hypotheses see Cornell(1983b).
24. DMUS should not alter expectations of money supply changes from week
    t-j to t-2 (j3,4,...) because the new information it contains is
    information about the money supply in week t-l. Expected money supply
    changes from week t-2 to t+h (h-l,0,l,...) are the only ones that can
    be affected.
25. Notice that the amount of serial correlation in the regression residuals
    increases as the forecasts become for longer horizons. This is to be
    expected since a longer horizon indicates overlapping forecasts, Depite
    this serial correlation, the standard errors which are typically
    reported for the estimated coefficients on the unexpected announcements
    are valid, i.e. they are consistent estimates. This follows from the
    fact that the unexpected announcements are serially uncorrelated.
26. DBUR should not alter expectations of monetary base changes from week
    t-j to t-l (j=2,3,...) because the new information it contains is
    information about the base in week t. Expected monetary base changes
    from week t-1 to t+h (h=0,1,. ..)   are   the only ones that can be affected.
27. For the six-month interest rate, the Wald statistic for testing that
    DEUR and DMUR have the same impact on interest rates is .40 (marginal
    significance level of .53). For the twelve-month interest rate the Wald
    statistic is .00.
28. Of primary concern here is a possible correlation between the regressors
    and the regression error. If expectations are formed rationally, the
    regressors DMUS and DBUR are errors from optimally formed forecasts
    and are thus uncorrelated with b,tR3Bt÷j (j13,26,39), information
available at the time the forecasts are made. The remaining components
of the regression error terms are uncorrelated with the regressors DMUS
and DBURt under the assumption of rational expectations because they are
the forecast errors        (j—13,26,39), forecast errors based on an
                      ej
information set that includes the regressors. The ability to obtain
consistent estimates via ordinary least squares explains why the terms

b tR3B÷.3 (j—13,26,39) are not treated in the same way as a,      3
i.e. are not expressed as the sum of the actual value and a forecast
error. Recall that the expectations b tR3B+ are made before the
announcements in week t and thus the forecast error associated with them
will not in general be uncorrelated with DMUSt and DBT.JRt. Accordingly,
ordinary least squares estimation gives inconsistent estimates if the
regression error contains these forecast errors.
                                  APPENDIX

     Description of Sample Periods for the Regressions in Tables 1 - 10



     The pre-October 1979 sample period A.l contains 106 observations,
covering September 29, 1977 to October 4, 1979. The pre-October 1979 sample
A.2 contains 104 observations, dropping the two influential observations
shown in Figure 1. Sample A.3 contains 78 observations, dropping the
influential observations and observations before March 30, 1978.
     The October 1979 to October 1982 sample period B.l has 156
observations, covering October 11, 1979 to October 15, 1982. Two of the 158
possible observations are dropped because of changes in the definition of
money used in the announcement. The October 1979 to October 1982 sample B.2
has 134 observations. The loss of 22 additional observations is due to one
of the following reasons: (i) a change in the definition of money, (ii) the
money supply and monetary base announcements were not released on the same
day, (iii) an apparent typographical error in the published value of revised
monetary base, (iv) no monetary base announcement was made, (v) monetary
base announcements contain benchmark revisions, (vi) variables are
calculated using only data which was released after the October 1979 shift
in Federal Reserve policy. The sample periods B.3 and B.4 contain 114 and
103 observations. This reduction is necessary because these samples are used
when the change in the money supply and monetary base over horizons as long
as one quarter are required. More observations are dropped for the sample
B.4 than for B.3 since the change in the base cannot span the weeks in which
a benchmark revision is announced. Sample B.5 has 99 observations, with 35
observations dropped from sample Z.2 because this sample is used when the
three-month interest rate nine months hence is required.
     The post-October 1982 sample period C.l contains 75 observations
covering October 22, 1982 to March 29, 1984. One of the 76 possible
observations has been dropped due to an apparent typographical error in the
announced money supply revision. Sample C.2 has 60 observations. The loss of
15 observations is due to one of the following reasons: (i) an apparent
typographical error in the published value of revised money supply, (ii) the
money supply and monetary base announcements were not released on the same
day, (iii) no monetary base announcement was made, (iv) monetary base
announcements contain benchmark revisions, (v) variables are calculated
using only data which was released after the October 1982 shift in Federal
Reserve policy. Samples C.3 and C.4 contain 51 and 33 observations, while
sample C.5 has 33 observations (though not the same 33 as sample C.4). The
reasons for dropping observations when going from sample C.2 to samples C.3,
C.4 and C.5 are the same as those for dropping observations when going from
sample B2 to samples B.3, 8.4 and B.5.

Notes -    1. DR3t is the change in the annualized interest rate on a three-
month U.S. Treasury bill from the close of the market on the day of a money
supply announcement in week t to the close on the next trading day. XMESt is
the expected change in the money supply announced in week t, measured as

                                (continued)


the median of the Money Market Services survey. XMtJS is the unexpected
change in the money supply announced in week t, measured as the preliminary
money supply announcement minus the contemporaneously-released announcement
of the revised money supply for the previous week minus XMESt. An
explanation of the observations used in the sample periods A.l, A.2, A.3,
B.l, and C.l appears in the appendix.
        2. All equations are estimated by ordinary least squares. Numbers in
parentheses below the estimated coefficients are standard errors, A '*'
denotes that the estimated coefficient is significantly different from zero
at the 5% level of significance. NOB denotes the number of observations in
the data set, SER the standard error of the regression,     the coefficient
of determination adjusted for degrees of freedom and DW the Durbin-atson
statistic. The column entitled G-Q TEST contains the Coldfeid-Quandt test
statistic for testing that the error term is homoskedastic and, in
parentheses, its marginal significance level. The column entitled CHOW TEST
contains the standard Chow test statistic for testing that the coefficients
a1 and a2 are the same in the first half of the sample as they are in the
second half and, in parentheses, its marginal significance level. A '*'   in
either of the last two columns indicates that the null hypothesis being
tested can be rejected using a 5% significance level.
        3. The test statistics at the bottom of the table test for stability
across the various samples by testing for equality of the coefficients
a1 and a2. The numbers in parentheses below the test statistics are marginal
significance levels. A '*' denotes that the null hypothesis of stability can
be rejected using a 5% significance level. The test statistics do not impose
the restriction that the variances of the regression error terms are equal
across samples.

the preliminary money supply announcement minus the preliminary money supply announcement from the
previous week. MRVt is the money supply revision announced in week t. XMESt is the expected change in
the money supply announced in week t as measured by the Money Market Services survey.
                                                                                         DMt_i, MRV1,
DBt1 and BRVt_i are the most recently reported change in the money supply, revision of the money
supply, change in the monetary base, and revision of the monetary base available before the money
supply announcement in week t. DR3Bt and SPRt are the most recent weekly change in the annualized
interest rate on three-month U.S. Treasury bills and the most recent spread between the annualized
interest rates on three- and six-month U.S. Treasury bills available :before the money supply
announcement in week t. An explanation of the observations used in sample periods B.2 and C.2 appears
in the appendix.
        2. All equations are estimated by ordinary least
                                                          squares. Numbers in parentheses below the
estimated coefficients are standard errors. A *1 denotes that the estimated coefficient is
significantly different from zero at the 5% level of significance.   S:ER denotes the standard error of
the regression and  2   the coefficient of determination adjusted for degrees of freedom. For
regressions where the the dependent variable is XM or DM, the column entitled F-TEST contains the
standard F-statistic for testing that     = 1 and the remaining
                                       a1                       a= 0. For regressions where the the
dependent variable  is MRV, the column entitled F-TEST contains the standard F-statistic for testing
that    = 0, i=l,...7. Numbers in parentheses below the F—statistics are marginal significance
     a
levels. A '*' in the last column indicates that the null hypothesis being tested can be
                                                                                          rejected
using a 5% significance level. For the October 1979 to October 1982 sample, the sample
autocorrelations of the regression residuals at lags one through four are -.06, -.01, .03 and .12 for
XM regression, -.05, —.03, .03 and .13 for the DM regression and .09, .02, —.02 and .05 for the NRV
regression. For the post-October 1982 sample, the corresponding numbers are .18, .02, -.09, and -.10
for the XM regression, .15, -.02, -.09 and -.13 for the DM regression and -.14, -.17, —.01 and -.02
for the NRV regression.
