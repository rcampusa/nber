                                            ABSTRACT

While much has been written about the potential benefits of mentoring in academia, very little research
documents its effectiveness. We present data from a randomized controlled trial of a mentoring program
for female economists organized by the Committee for the Status of Women in the Economics Profession
and sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the American Economics Association. To
our knowledge, this is the first randomized trial of a mentoring program in academia. We evaluate
the performance of three cohorts of participants and randomly-assigned controls from 2004, 2006,
and 2008. This paper presents an interim assessment of the program’s effects. Our results suggest
that mentoring works. After five years the 2004 treatment group averaged .4 more NSF or NIH grants
and 3 additional publications, and were 25 percentage points more likely to have a top-tier publication.
There are significant but smaller effects at three years post-treatment for the 2004 and 2006 cohorts
combined. While it is too early to assess the ultimate effects of mentoring on the academic careers
of program participants, the results suggest that this type of mentoring may be one way to help women
advance in the Economics profession and, by extension, in other male-dominated academic fields.

          Since its inception in 1971, the American Economic Association (AEA) Committee on

the Status of Women in the Economics Profession (CSWEP) has tracked the number of women

at various ranks in the profession. CSWEP’s statistics indicate a “leaky pipeline” from PhD

programs into tenured academic jobs. The significant under-representation of women in

economics at the tenured level prompted CSWEP to establish the CSWEP Mentoring Program

(CeMENT) with the support of the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) ADVANCE program

and the AEA. The program is aimed at assisting female junior faculty to prepare themselves for

the tenure hurdle.

          We are evaluating the success of the program using a randomized trial. Applicants were

randomly assigned to be treatments (mentees who attended the workshop) or controls who did

not participate. Our study will compare the academic performance (i.e., papers, grants) of these

two groups. To our knowledge, this randomized trial of a mentoring program is unique in

academia. 1

          There have now been three cohorts of program participants, in 2004, 2006, and 2008. A

fourth cohort will begin in January 2010 and another is planned for January 2012. This paper

thus presents an interim assessment. We find that CeMENT significantly increased publication

rates and successful grant applications. While it is too early to tell what the eventual effect on

tenure will be, the results suggest that this program may be a useful way to help women advance

in the economics profession.

I. Background



1
    An earlier, one-shot, CSWEP mentoring effort was offered and evaluated in 1998, but did not

use random assignment. See Robin Bartlett and Andrea Ziegert (2000).
          Using data from the 1973-2001 Survey of Doctoral Recipients, Donna K. Ginther and

Shulamit Kahn (2004) find gender differences in promotion to tenure in economics of 21

percentage points. A separate analysis of a sample of AEA members that controls for

publications and citations finds a 14 percentage point gender gap in the probability of promotion

to tenure. Moreover, they show that women are significantly less likely to be promoted in

economics than in political science, statistics, life science, physical science and engineering.

John M. McDowell, Larry D. Singell and Mark Slater (2006) suggest that one possible cause of

women’s failure to advance in economics may be a lack of research networks. As one indicator

of limited networks, they find that while co-authorship is common in economics, female

economists are less likely to coauthor than their male colleagues, even after controlling for

publication rates. Francine Blau, Marianne Ferber and Anne Winkler (2010) suggest a second

possible cause, a lack of role models and informal relationships between young academics and

those who are more senior.

II. The CeMENT Intervention

          The national CeMENT workshops were designed to expose participants to role models

(senior female economists), to transmit information about what it takes to get tenure, and to build

peer networks of female junior faculty working in similar research areas. Each workshop lasted

two days, and was held in conjunction with the American Economic Association annual

meetings. The workshops brought together junior and senior faculty mentors from various

institutions, arranged into small groups (4-5 participants and 1-2 mentors) based on research

interests. The workshops were widely advertised and aimed at faculty in research departments. 2

2
    CSWEP also ran “regional” workshops associated with the meetings of regional economics

associations. These workshops, organized by KimMarie McGoldrick were aimed at faculty in

                                                  2
       Each participant circulated a research paper or other related work (like a grant proposal)

before the workshop. During the workshop, the small groups met to discuss and provide

feedback on each participant's work (approximately one hour for each participant). In addition to

the small group meetings, plenary sessions were held consisting of panels of the senior mentors.

Topics included research and publishing, getting grants, professional exposure, teaching, the

tenure process and work-life balance. At the end of each workshop an exit survey was

distributed. On a scale of 1-7, where 1 is “not at all helpful” and 7 is “extremely helpful,” the

average rating of the workshop over all three years was 6.63. Anecdotal evidence based on

discussions with former participants suggests that many women stayed in touch with other

women whom they met through the program, and that these women became an important support

network.

       More than 80 people applied for each workshop. After eliminating incomplete or

inappropriate applications, applicants were divided into groups by research area. Applicants

were then randomly assigned to treatment or control status within each group. We selected more

treatments than controls in an effort to maximize access to the program. For example, in a group

of eight, we would select five to be treatments and three to be controls. Both controls and

participants were told that we had received more applicants than we could accommodate, and

that we had randomly selected participants from the pool of eligible applicants.

       This interim evaluation focuses on information that has been systematically coded from

vitae of participants and controls. These vitae were either obtained directly from the individual

or downloaded from the web. If no current vita was available (as of the follow-up date), we




teaching institutions, and were not evaluated using random assignment.

                                                 3
searched public data bases for published articles and federal grants in order to update these

outcomes. Most people who were missing recent vitas had left the tenure track.

    In order to be included in the pool eligible for random assignment, the applicant needed to have

a North American PhD or be employed at a North American research institution.

cohort 2 (the 2006 workshop) who were also significantly older. 92.4 percent of the treatments

and 97.8 percent of the controls planned to be in academia 10 years from the time of their initial

application. Most of the applicants were in academic jobs, and 75% were in PhD granting

institutions.

          Table 1 indicates that there are no significant differences in number of grants or total

number of publications before the workshops. However, we do find that treatments were

significantly more likely to hold a job at a top 10 department 4 and to have a publication in a top-

tier journal. 5 The estimates by cohort show that these differences arose in cohort 2, where, by

unfortunate chance, all of the applicants from top 10 departments were selected for the treatment.

Treatments in cohort 2 had more publications and were significantly more likely to have a

publication in a top-tier journal. We therefore present our results by cohort, as well as for the

pooled cohorts.

          Table 2 shows our main results. Each entry in the table is a coefficient from a separate

regression of an outcome (indicated by the column heading) on a constant and an indicator for

whether or not the woman was in the “treatment” group. The first four rows suggest that one

year after the treatment, the program had had little impact, as one would expect given delays in

    We defined department rank using Pantelis Kalaitzidakis, Theofanis P. Mamuneas, and

Thanasis Stengos (2003) because it included non-North American schools. The top 10

departments were Harvard University, University of Chicago, Massachusetts Institute of

Technology, Northwestern University, University of Pennsylvania, Yale University, Princeton

University, Stanford University, University of California at Berkeley, and New York University.

    We defined the top-tier journals as the American Economic Review, the Journal of Political

Economy, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, and Econometrica.

also more likely to have top-tier publications and more publications pre-treatment.

controls. There is also a positive effect on successful grants in the pooled cohorts.

       Finally, the last row shows the results after five years for Cohort 1. We see positive and

significant effects of the workshop on grants, top-tier publication and total publications. Those

in the treatment group had .4 more NSF or NIH grants on average. They had 3 additional

publications, and were 25 percentage points more likely to have a top tier publication. These

results are especially persuasive in that there were no significant pre-treatment differences in

outcomes for this cohort.

top-tier journals. Adding these controls reduces the estimated effects somewhat, and there are no

longer significant effects on grant activity, although all of the year 3 and year 5 estimates remain

positive. We still find, however, that at year 5, treatments are 20 percentage points more likely

to have a top-tier publication and have 2.7 more publications overall, compared to controls; at

year 3, the comparable figures are 9 percentage points and 1.6 publications.

       Table 4 asks whether changes in outcomes between the pre-intervention and a later date

are affected by the intervention. These models are equivalent to including person-specific fixed

effects (since the difference in intervention status between time t and time 0 is always 1 or 0).

smaller) effects on both

outcomes at year 3, and effects that are smaller still in year 1. It is conceivable that the

differences at year 3 and year 5 could reflect pre-existing differences in trajectories between

treatment and control members. However, the much smaller effects of the treatment on grants

and top-tier publications after one year provides some evidence that the treatments were not

simply on a better trajectory to start. Models excluding applicants with PhDs from top 10

departments, and models excluding applicants with first jobs at top 10 departments produce

similar results.

       IV. Conclusions

       We find that CeMENT increased top-tier publications, the total number of publications,

and the total number of successful federal grants in treated women relative to controls. The

effects are monotonic with respect to time from the intervention and robust to several

specification checks designed to control for possible pre-existing differences between treatments

and controls. These results are encouraging in that publications and grants are important

predictors of tenure at most research institutions, and suggest that the intervention had a positive

influence on academic productivity. Nonetheless, it is too early to say whether the intervention

will have a significant effect on either the probability that women stay in academia, or the

probability that they receive tenure.
