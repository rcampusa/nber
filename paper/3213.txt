LONGITUDINAL PATTERNS OF COMPLIANCE WITH OSHA HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS IN
                               THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR


                                  ABSTRACT
       Ve examine the impact of OSHA enforcement on company compliance with
  agency regulations in the manufacturing sector, with a unique plant-level
  dataset of inspection and compliance behavior during 1972-1983, the first
  twelve years of the agency operation. The analysis suggests that, for an
  individual inspected plant, the average effect of OSHA inspections during
  this period was to reduce expected citations by 3.0 or by .36 s.d. The
  total effect on expected citations of additional inspections can be
  decomposed into two parts; evaluated at the mean of the sample, 59 percent
  of the total change in citations occurred due to an increase in the
  compliance rate; 41 percent was due to a reduction in citations among
  continuing violators.
