JEL No. D01,I20

                                               ABSTRACT

This paper summarizes recent evidence on what achievement tests measure; how achievement tests
relate to other measures of "cognitive ability" like IQ and grades; the important skills that achievement
tests miss or mismeasure, and how much these skills matter in life.

Achievement tests miss, or perhaps more accurately, do not adequately capture, soft skills—personality
traits, goals, motivations, and preferences—that are valued in the labor market, in school, and in many
other domains. The larger message of this paper is that soft skills predict success in life, that they causally
produce that success, and that programs that enhance soft skills have an important place in an effective
portfolio of public policies.

1         Introduction

Contemporary society places great value on standardized achievement tests to sift and sort
people, to evaluate schools, and to assess the performance of nations. Admissions commit-
tees use tests like the SAT, the ACT, and the GRE (Graduate Record Examinations) to
screen applicants. In the United States, the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act stipulates
that government-run schools must administer standardized achievement tests in order to be
eligible for federal funding.1 The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)
evaluates student performance in math, science, and reading across countries. The results
attract media attention and influence policy. The year 2000 PISA test results caused Ger-
many to re-evaluate its educational system and introduce a variety of educational reforms
(Grek, 2009).
        Despite the widespread use of standardized achievement tests, the traits that they mea-
sure are not well-understood. This paper summarizes recent evidence on what achievement
tests capture; how achievement tests relate to other measures of “cognitive ability” like IQ
and grades; the important skills that achievement tests miss or mismeasure, and how much
these other skills matter in life.
        Achievement tests miss, or more accurately, do not adequately capture, soft skills—
personality traits, goals, motivations, and preferences that are valued in the labor market,
in school, and in many other domains. The larger message of this paper is that soft skills
predict success in life, that they produce that success, and that programs that enhance soft
skills have an important place in an effective portfolio of public policies.2
        Measurement of cognition and educational attainment has been refined during the past
century. Psychometricians have shown that cognitive ability has multiple facets.3 This

Statistics, various years; The Bowker Annual: Library and Book Trade Almanac, various years).

progress is not widely appreciated.         Many social scientists—even many psychologists—
continue to use IQ tests, standardized achievement tests, and grades interchangeably to
proxy “cognitive ability.”4 Even though scores on IQ tests, standardized achievement tests,
and grades are positively correlated with each other, the recent literature shows that they
measure different skills and depend on different facets of cognitive ability. Recent research
also shows that all three measures are associated with personality, but to different degrees
across various cognitive measures.
       Standardized achievement tests were designed to capture “general knowledge” produced
in schools and through life experiences. Such knowledge is thought to be relevant to success
inside and outside of the classroom. However, achievement tests are often validated using
other standardized achievement tests or other measures of cognitive ability—surely a circular
practice.
       A more relevant validity criterion is how well these tests predict meaningful outcomes,
such as educational attainment, labor market success, crime, and health. No single mea-
sure of cognitive ability predicts much of the variance in these outcomes, and measurement
error does not account for most of the remaining variance, leaving much room for other
determinants of success.5
       Success in life depends on personality traits that are not well captured by measures of cog-
nition. Conscientiousness, perseverance, sociability, and curiosity matter. While economists
have largely ignored these traits, personality psychologists have studied them over the last
century.6 They have constructed measures of them and provide evidence that these traits
predict meaningful life outcomes.
       Many scholars—inside and outside of psychology—have questioned the existence of sta-
ble personality traits, arguing that constraints and incentives in situations almost entirely
   4
     Many call this “IQ”, e.g., Flynn (2007), Nisbett (2009), and Nisbett et al. (2012).
   5
     On the magnitudes of measurement error on a variety of economic measures, see Bound et al. (2001).
These authors report that at most 15–30% of earnings variance is due to measurement error.
   6
     Some early studies in economics are Bowles and Gintis (1976), and Bowles et al. (2001). An important
study in sociology is Jencks (1979). Work in psychology going back to Terman et al. (1925) shows that
personality traits matter (see Murray, 1938; Terman et al., 1947; and the discussion in Gensowski, 2012).


                                                   3
determine behavior. These scholars claim that people are like chameleons—they adapt to
any situation.7 A substantial body of evidence shows that stable traits exist. People tend
to behave in the same fashion across a wide range of situations.8 Evidence from genetics
and neuroscience provides a biological basis for the existence of such traits, suggesting that
something tied to the person, not the just the situation, affects behavior.9
       Throughout this paper we use the term “personality traits” to describe the personal
attributes not thought to be captured by measures of abstract reasoning power. These at-
tributes go by many names in the literature, including soft skills, personality traits, noncogni-
tive skills, noncognitive abilities, character, and socioemotional skills. These different names
connote different properties. The term “traits” suggests a sense of permanence and possibly
also of heritability. The terms “skills” and “character” suggest that they can be learned. In
reality, the extent to which these personal attributes can change lies on a spectrum. Both
cognitive and personality traits can change and be changed over the life cycle but through dif-
ferent mechanisms and to different degrees at different ages. To avoid confusion, throughout
this paper we use the term “trait” to capture the set of personal attributes we study.10
       Psychological traits are not directly observed. There is no ruler for perseverance, no
caliper for intelligence. All cognitive and personality traits are measured using performance
on “tasks,” broadly defined. Different tasks require different traits in different combinations.
Some distinguish between measurements of traits and measurements of outcomes, but this
distinction is misleading. Both traits and outcomes are measured using performance on some
task or set of tasks.
       Psychologists sometimes claim to circumvent this measurement issue by creating tax-
onomies of traits and by applying intuitive names to responses on questionnaires. These

     See Epstein (1979) for an early paper showing that personality traits are stable across multiple situations.

     See Bouchard and Loehlin (2001) for estimates of the heritability of traits. See Canli (2006) and DeYoung
et al. (2010) for evidence that regions of the brain are associated with different traits.
  10
     Drawing on the literature in psychology, Borghans et al. (2008a) present one definition of cognitive traits.



                                                       4
questionnaires are not windows to the soul. They are still rooted in task performance or
behavior. Responding to a questionnaire is itself a task. Additionally, many of the question-
naires inquire directly about behavior, e.g., a measure of Agreeableness used in the German
Socioeconomic Panel asks the extent to which a respondent “is sometimes somewhat rude to
others.”11 How else can one answer that question but reflect on one’s behavior? IQ tests and
standardized achievement tests also measure performance on different “cognitively loaded”
tasks.
       Performance on most tasks depends on effort, personality traits, cognitive ability, and
incentives, although the importance of each differs by task. This dependence creates a
fundamental problem in measuring traits. Most studies in psychology devise a set of measures
to capture a trait but do not standardize for incentives in the situation in which the trait
is being measured or for other traits. Measured cognitive ability and measured personality
depend on a constellation of factors. The identification problem arising from the multiple
determinants of performance on tasks is empirically important, even for measures of cognitive
ability. Incentives can affect performance on IQ tests. Multiple traits affect performance on
cognitive tasks. For example, personality traits affect achievement test scores and grades.12
Caution is required in taking the measures developed by psychologists too literally.
       Nonetheless, measures of personality traits predict meaningful life outcomes. Conscien-
tiousness – the tendency to be organized, responsible, and hardworking—is the most widely
predictive of the commonly used personality measures. It predicts educational attainment,
health, and labor market outcomes as strongly as measures of cognitive ability.13
       Most studies in psychology only report correlations between measured traits and out-
comes without addressing whether the traits cause the outcomes and without controlling for
the other traits and incentives that determine performance on the tasks used to measure the
traits. While traits are relatively stable across situations, they are not set in stone. They

taxonomy. See Table 3 for a description of the Big Five.

change over the life cycle. On average, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness tend to grow
with age. Different facets of cognitive ability peak at different ages. Interventions, education,
and parenting can affect traits in lasting ways.
       This paper summarizes recent evidence that personality causally affects life outcomes.
We review some of the literature from psychology and economics and then focus on two
particularly compelling examples.14
       First, we show how an achievement test, the General Educational Development (GED)
test, fails to capture important traits that affect success in life. High school dropouts can
take the GED to certify to employers and post-secondary institutions that their skills are
equivalent to those of high school graduates who do not attend college. After accounting for
differences in pre-existing cognitive ability, GED recipients perform much worse in the labor
market than high school graduates and much more like other high school dropouts. GED
recipients lack important personality traits. (See Heckman et al., 2011a and Heckman et al.,
2012a.)
       Second, we show how an early childhood intervention, the Perry Preschool Program,
improved the lives of disadvantaged children, even though the program did not permanently
change the IQ of its participants. The program changed their personality traits in a lasting
way (see Heckman et al., 2012b). Other interventions and observational studies provide
supporting evidence that early-childhood investments improve outcomes through their effects
on personality.15
  14
    Borghans et al. (2008a) and Almlund et al. (2011) present extensive surveys of this literature.
  15
    The “Tools of the Mind ” intervention is designed to promote “executive functioning,” which has both
cognitive and personality components. Barnett et al. (2008, 2006); Bierman et al. (2010); Bodrova and Leong
(2001, 2007); Dee and West (2011); Diamond et al. (2007); Durlak et al. (2011); Lillard and Else-Quest (2006)
report success of this intervention. For a contrary view, see the study by Farran et al. (2011).

2        Defining and Measuring Personality Traits

2.1       History and Measurement of Cognitive Ability

Modern intelligence tests have been used for just over a century, beginning when a French
minister of public instruction wished to identify retarded pupils in need of specialized ed-
ucation programs. In response, Alfred Binet created the first IQ test.16 IQ scores were
interpreted as measuring a stable trait. The standardized achievement test was created in
the wake of the perceived success of IQ tests as an objective and cost-effective measure of
acquired skills. In contrast to IQ tests, standardized achievement tests were designed to
measure “general knowledge” that could be acquired in schools and through life experiences
and was widely applicable beyond the classroom to workplace and social functioning.17
       Achievement tests are typically validated on other achievement tests, IQ tests, and grades,
rather than on tasks or outcomes in the labor market and in social functioning. Table 1
shows correlations among scores on standardized achievement tests, IQ tests, and grades.
Standardized achievement tests are correlated with IQ tests, but the correlation depends on
the subject area of the standardized achievement test. Hartlage and Steele (1977) find that
the arithmetic portions of standardized achievement tests are the most highly correlated with
IQ. Grades and scores on IQ tests and standardized achievement tests are far from perfectly
correlated, suggesting that they measure different aspects of “cognitive functioning.”18
       Psychologists distinguish between fluid intelligence (the rate at which people learn) and
crystalized intelligence (acquired knowledge).19 Achievement tests are heavily weighted to-
  16
     In 1904, La Société Libre pour l’Etude Psychologique de l’Enfant appointed a commission to create a
mechanism for identifying these pupils in need of alternative education led by Binet. See Herrnstein and
Murray (1994) for an overview of Binet’s life and work.
  17
     See Lindquist (1951).
  18
     It is an irony of the testing literature that high school grades are more predictive of first year college
performance than SAT scores (Bowen et al., 2009). The SAT and related tests are thought to be more
objective measures of student quality than high school grades (Lemann, 1999).
  19
     See, e.g., Nisbett et al. (2012).

wards crystallized intelligence,20 whereas IQ tests like Raven’s progressive matrices (1962)
are heavily weighted toward fluid intelligence.21,22 Many psychologists do not recognize the
differences among these measures and interchangeably use IQ, achievement tests, and grades
to measure “cognitive ability” or “intelligence,” and this practice is also widespread in eco-
nomics.23


2.2       Defining and Measuring Psychological Traits

Validating one measure of cognitive ability using other measures of cognitive ability is circu-
lar. More relevant is how well these measures predict important life outcomes. Table 2 shows
the extent to which IQ, standardized achievement tests, and grades explain the variance of
outcomes at age 35 in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 (NLSY79) data. The
three groups of columns under each category show results for different sub-samples based on
the availability of the different cognitive measures. For each category, the first column shows
the explained variance using only the designated measure of cognitive ability. Achievement
tests and grades are more predictive than IQ. But none of these measures explains much of
the variation of any outcome, leaving considerable room for other determinants. As noted
in the introduction, it is unlikely that measurement error accounts for all of the remaining
variance.
       Personality is one missing ingredient. The second columns in each category preview our
later discussion of the explanatory power of personality. They show the variance explained
by measures of personality.24 In many cases, the variance explained by personality measures
rivals that explained by measures of cognitive ability. The relative importance of person-
  20
     See Roberts et al. (2000).
  21
     See Raven et al. (1988). The high correlation between intelligence and achievement tests is in part due
to the fact that both require cognitive ability and knowledge. Common developmental factors may affect
both of these traits. Fluid intelligence promotes the acquisition of crystallized intelligence.
  22
     Carroll (1994) and Ackerman and Heggestad (1997) discuss more disaggregated facets of cognitive ability.
  23
     See Flynn (2007) and Nisbett et al. (2012). For examples in economics, see Benjamin et al. (2006).
  24
     They include measures of adolescent risky behavior, self-esteem and locus of control (the extent to which
people feel they have control over their lives). For precise definitions of the measures used, see the notes to
Table 2.



                                                      9
ality depends on the outcome. The third column for each sub-sample shows the variance
explained when both the cognitive and personality measures are used as predictors. In many
cases, including the measures of personality in a regression with cognitive measures explains
additional variance. The correlations between the set of measures of personality and the
measures of cognition are positive, but not especially strong (see the bottom row of each
table). Each set of traits has an independent influence on the outcomes in the table.
       Even though economists have largely ignored personality traits, the pioneers of the orig-
inal IQ tests recognized their importance.25 Alfred Binet the creator of the first IQ test (the
Stanford-Binet test), noted that:

         “[Success in school] ...admits of other things than intelligence; to succeed in his
         studies, one must have qualities which depend on attention, will, and character;
         for example a certain docility, a regularity of habits, and especially continuity of
         effort. A child, even if intelligent, will learn little in class if he never listens, if
         he spends his time in playing tricks, in giggling, in playing truant.”

                                                                      -(Binet and Simon, 1916, p. 254)

       Since the middle of the 19th century, personality psychologists have studied these traits.
One leading personality psychologist defines personality traits in the following way:

         “Personality traits are the relatively enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and
         behaviors that reflect the tendency to respond in certain ways under certain cir-
         cumstances.”

                                                                                -(Roberts, 2009, p. 140)

Personality traits are manifested through thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and therefore,
must be inferred from measures of performance on “tasks,” broadly defined. Under this
  25
     Lewis Terman, who created the Stanford-Binet test, even collected data on personality traits of a high-
ability sample. In this sample, Conscientiousness is highly predictive of health and earnings (Savelyev, 2011;
Gensowski, 2012).

     Source: National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. Table Description: The table shows the adjusted R-squared from regressions of later-life outcomes on measures of
     personality and cognition. For each cognitive measure, the first column shows the explained variance using only the measures of cognitive ability, the second column shows the
     explained variance from using only the measure of personality (Personality), and the third column shows the explained variance from using both the measures of personality
     and cognition (Both). The last row shows the adjusted R-squared from a regression of each cognitive measure on the personality measures. Measures of Personality and
     Cognition: The measures of personality include minor illegal activity in 1979 (vandalism, shoplifting, petty theft, fraud and fencing), major illegal activity in 1979 (auto theft,
     breaking/entering private property, grand theft), participation in violent crime in 1979 (fighting, assault and aggravated assault), tried marijuana before age 15, daily smoking
     before age 15, regular drinking before age 15, and any intercourse before age 15. It also includes measures of self-esteem and locus of control. Self-esteem is measured using the
     ten-item Rosenberg scale administered in 1980. Locus of control is a measure of how much control an individual believes they have over their life and is measured using the 4-item
     Rotter scale. IQ and grades are from high school transcripts. IQ is pooled across several IQ tests using IQ percentiles. GPA is the individual’s core-subject GPA from 9th grade.
     The Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) was adjusted for schooling at the time of the test conditional on final schooling as described in Hansen et al. (2004). Outcomes:
     Due to the biennial nature of the survey after 1994, some respondents are not interviewed at age 35, for these individuals age 36 is used. Earnings includes zero-earners and
     excludes observations over $200,000 (2005 dollars). Hourly wage excludes observations less than $3 or over $200 (2005 dollars). Hours worked excludes observations less than
     80 or more than 4000. Jail by age 35 indicates whether the respondent had listed residing in a jail or prison at some point before age 35. Welfare at age 35 indicates whether
     the respondent received any positive amount of welfare at age 35. Married at age 35 indicates whether the responded was currently married. B.A. degree by age 35 indicates
     whether the respondent received a B.A. degree (or higher) by age 35. Depression in 1992 is based on the 7-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).
     Sample: The sample excludes the military over sample. The samples differ across the IQ, AFQT, and GPA due to missing measures across the samples.
definition, performance on IQ tests is a personality trait because it is an enduring pattern
of behavior (how one “behaves” or “performs” on an IQ test).26
       Personality psychologists primarily measure personality traits using self-reported surveys.
They have arrived at a relatively well-accepted taxonomy of traits called the “Big Five,”
which includes Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness,
and Neuroticism. Table 3 defines these traits and their multiple facets.27 Some argue that
the Big Five are the longitude and latitude of personality, by which all more narrowly defined
traits may be categorized (see Costa and McCrae, 1992a). While the Big Five measures are
now the most widely used, there are several other taxonomies, including the Big Three, the
MPQ, and the Big Nine. They are conceptually and empirically related to the Big Five.28
Other taxonomies, including psychopathology as measured by the DSM IV and measures
of temperament, have also been related to the Big Five.29 Almlund et al. (2011) show
that economic preference parameters are not all that closely related to psychological traits
and apparently represent different traits that, along with the psychological traits, govern
behavior.
       A deeper issue, as yet not systematically investigated in the literature in economics
or psychology, is whether the traits captured by the alternative measurement systems are
the manifestation of a deeper set of preferences or goals. Achieving certain goals requires
certain traits, e.g., a surgeon has to be careful and intelligent; a salesman has to be outgoing
and engaging and so forth, etc. Under this view, traits are developed through practice,
investment, and habituation. The deeper traits may be the preference parameters that
generate the manifest traits. The apparent stability of expressed traits across situations may
be a consequence of the stability of the goals and incentives to achieve these goals.30
  26
     Studies of test-retest reliability of IQ tests show that scores are highly correlated across repeated testing
occasions (see, e.g., Niolon, 2005).

     McAdams and Pals (2006) adds goals to the list of possible traits. Almlund et al. (2011) develop a model
in which preferences and traits determine the effort applied to tasks.

2.3       Identification Problems in Measuring Traits

Measuring traits is difficult, because, as suggested by Roberts’ definition of personality, all
psychological measurements are calibrated on measured behavior, and the behaviors used
to measure one trait can be influenced by incentives and other traits. To infer traits from
behaviors requires standardizing for all of the other contributing factors that produce the
observed behavior. The inability to parse and localize behaviors that depend on a single
trait or ability gives rise to a fundamental identification problem that is typically ignored in
empirical research investigating how psychological traits affect outcomes.31
       There are two primary issues. First, behavior depends on incentives created in situations.
Different incentives elicit different amounts of effort on the tasks used to measure traits.
Accurately measuring personality traits requires standardizing for the effort applied in any
task. Second, behavior in one task can depend on multiple traits. Not standardizing for
incentives and other traits can produce misleading estimates of any trait.
       These identification problems are empirically important when measuring any given trait.
For example, incentives partly determine scores on IQ tests, even though some have argued
that performance on IQ tests reflects maximal effort.32 A series of studies conducted over
the past 40 years shows that incentives, like money or candy, can increase IQ scores, partic-
ularly among low-IQ individuals. The Black-White gap in IQ can be completely eliminated
by incentivizing students with M&M candies.33 The incentives in one test do not affect
performance on future tests.
       The recent literature shows that personality traits are associated with standardized
achievement test scores, which many analysts use interchangeably with IQ scores.34 Figures
1 and 2 show how the variance in the scores on two achievement tests, the Armed Forces

      A leading psychometrician, Carroll (1993), does not accept the notion that IQ captures maximal effort.

Qualification Test (AFQT) and the closely related Differential Aptitudes Tests (DAT),35
are decomposed into IQ and personality measures. Personality traits explain a substantial
portion of the variances in both AFQT scores and DAT scores.36 The personality traits are
incrementally valid in that they explain the variance above and beyond the variance that IQ
explains in a regression. These findings caution the interpretation that standardized achieve-
ment tests only measure cognitive ability. They are bundled with personality traits. In data
from the Stella Maris secondary school in Maastricht, Holland, Openness to Experience is
strongly correlated with IQ.37
       Further complicating identification, not everyone responds to incentives in the same way.
Borghans et al. (2008b) show that adults spend substantially more time answering questions
on IQ tests when rewards are higher. Subjects high in Emotional Stability and Conscien-
tiousness are less affected by rewards. Similarly, Segal (2008) shows that introducing cash
incentives for performance on the coding speed test of the Armed Services Vocational Bat-
tery (ASVAB) increases performance substantially, particularly for men with lower levels of
Conscientiousness.


2.4       Are There Stable Personality Traits?

Many have questioned whether personality traits exist. The publication of Walter Mischel’s
1968 book, Personality and Assessment, gave rise to a heated “personality-situation” debate
within psychology, which pitted the social psychologists who favored situational factors as
explaining behavior against those who considered stable personality traits as more conse-
quential. Mischel argued that aspects of situations overshadow any effect of personality on
  35
     The correlation between DAT and AFQT scores in the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979
(NLSY79) is 0.76 to 0.80 (Borghans et al., 2011b). Friedman and Streicher (1985) estimate correlations
between 0.65 and 0.82 for in a sample of high school sophomores and juniors. Kettner (1976) estimates
correlations between DAT and the AFQT subtests of 0.76 to 0.89 in a sample of juniors and seniors.
  36
     The lower explained variance in the sample with DAT is likely a consequence of restriction on range.
The DAT data come from a single school, whereas the AFQT data come from a national sample.

behavior.38
       A large body of evidence reviewed in Almlund et al. (2011) shows that stable personality
traits exist and are predictive of many behaviors.39 An important paper by Epstein (1979)
presents compelling evidence that, averaging over tasks and situations at a point in time,
people act in a predictable fashion with a high level of reliability (R2 of 0.6-0.8) of average
behavior (“measured personality”) across situations. The incentives in any situation also
matter. Heritability studies show that measures of personality traits tend to be about 40%-
60% heritable, suggesting that something tied to the person, rather than the situation,
influences behavior (Bouchard and Loehlin, 2001).40 Evidence in neuroscience suggests that

expression of traits is related to regions of the brain (see Canli, 2006, and DeYoung et al.,
2010).


2.5         The Evolution of Personality Traits Over the Life Cycle

Even though personality traits are relatively stable across situations, they are not set in
stone. They change over the life cycle. Figure 3 shows that Conscientiousness tends to
increase monotonically over the life cycle. Other traits change in different ways over the life
cycle.41 Crystallized intelligence tends to increase monotonically for most of the life cycle,
whereas fluid intelligence tends to peak in early adulthood and then decline.42
     This evidence does not address whether these changes occur naturally (“ontogenic change”)
or whether they are due to changes in the environments commonly experienced over the life
they fail to take into account the effect of the environment on conditions in the maternal womb. See also
Rutter (2006) and an emerging literature on epigenetics.

cycle (“sociogenic change”). No evidence is available in the published literature on the dis-
tributions of these profiles over the life cycle. Almlund et al. (2011) review the evidence on
how parental investment and interventions promote changes in personality.

2.6       The Predictive Power of Personality

Table 2 shows that personality traits predict many later-life outcomes as strongly as measures
of cognitive ability. Conscientiousness – the tendency to be perseverant and hardworking
– stands out as the most predictive of the Big Five traits across many outcomes. Figure 4
presents for males correlations between the Big Five and educational attainment, adjusting
and not adjusting for fluid and crystalized intelligence. Conscientiousness predicts educa-
tional attainment more than either of the facets of intelligence.43 Similar patterns appear
for many other outcomes, including labor market performance, grades, and health.44
       A recurrent finding in the literature is that measured IQ is highly predictive of perfor-
  43
    Results are similar for women (see Almlund et al., 2011).
  44
    See Almlund et al. (2011), Borghans et al. (2008a), and Roberts et al. (2007) for comprehensive reviews
of the evidence.

mance on complex tasks and jobs (Gottfredson, 1997). The importance of IQ increases with
job complexity, defined as the information processing requirements of the job: cognitive skills
are more important for professors, scientists, and senior managers than for semi-skilled or
unskilled laborers (Schmidt and Hunter, 2004). In contrast, the importance of Conscien-
tiousness does not vary much with job complexity (Barrick and Mount, 1991), suggesting
that it pertains to a wider spectrum of jobs.
   The literature in economics establishes that the same bundle of traits has different pro-
ductivity in different tasks. People also differ in their endowments of traits. These two
features lead to sorting in the tasks people pursue in life and are a manifestation of the
general principle of comparative advantage in the labor market and in life. (See Almlund
et al., 2011; Borghans et al., 2008a; Cattan, 2012; Heckman et al., 2006a, 2011b.)
   Achievement test scores are crude, low-dimensional summaries of high-dimensional vec-
tors of traits that operate in conjunction with effort. It is unlikely that these summaries
capture the precise combinations of traits required for success in specific life tasks. The
thrust of recent research in personality and economics is to isolate the traits that determine
life outcomes and to understand how those diverse traits determine choices of tasks.
   Most of the evidence in personality psychology is correlational. The reported correla-
tions do not prove that personality traits cause higher educational attainment although it is
consistent with it. For example, the reported pattern in Figure 4 could arise if educational
attainment increased Conscientiousness. We next present causal evidence.

3        Causal Evidence

3.1        Problems with Establishing Causality

Most studies in personality psychology do not address the question of causality, i.e., whether
measured traits cause (rather than just predict) outcomes. Empirical associations are not
a reliable basis for policy analysis. In this section, we discuss difficulties in establishing
causality. We also summarize several studies that provide evidence that personality traits
cause outcomes.
       We introduce a simple framework to analyze the effect of traits on outcomes and how
traits evolve over time.45 Equation (1) shows how an outcome at age a, Ta , which is the
  45
       This framework draws on Almlund et al. (2011).


                                                               20
performance on a task, depends on cognition Ca , personality Pa , other acquired skills such
as education and job training Ka , and the effort allocated to the task eTa :




                    Ta          = φa (     Ca ,         Pa , Ka ,                  eTa ) a = 1, . . . , A.   (1)

                Outcome on a             Cognition   Personality     Other        Effort

                                                                      skills       task


Equation (2) shows how the effort allocated to task Ta depends on cognition Ca , personality
Pa , other acquired skills Ka , incentives RTa , and preferences Υa :


                                 eTa = ψTa (Ca , Pa , Ka ,           RTa ,          Υa        ).             (2)
                                                                     |{z}          |{z}
                                                                   Incentives   Preferences
                                                                   to perform
                                                                     on task


       The effort applied to a task is the outcome of a choice problem that depends on traits,
preferences, and incentives, much like a supply equation in the standard theory of consumer
choice. Preferences can be thought of as additional traits.46 Some psychological theories
posit that people have limited effort that they can divide among different tasks (See, e.g.,
Baumeister and Tierney, 2011).
       Equations (1) and (2) formalize the difficulty in establishing a causal relationship between
outcomes and traits. Multiple traits, effort, and acquired skills generate performance in a
given task. Many studies in psychology and economics do not control for these inputs and
equate measurement of a set of outcomes with the trait the analyst is trying to measure.47
This practice can lead to a substantial bias in inference about any particular trait.
       An additional point is that most studies assume a linear relationship between outcomes
and traits. This practice is particularly problematic for measuring personality traits, where
the effect of a trait on an outcome is not always linear or even monotonic. Too much of a
  46
     The empirical relationship between measured preference parameters and Big Five measures is weak (see
Almlund et al., 2011).
  47
     Selecting measures and verifying them is part of the sometimes mysterious and inherently subjective
process of “construct validity” in psychology. For a discussion, see Borghans et al. (2008a).

traits are associated with psychopathologies. High levels of Conscientiousness are associated
with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which hinders task performance (Samuel and Widiger,
2008). Nonlinearities can also arise when traits and incentives interact, as in the analyses
of Borghans et al. (2008b) and Segal (2008) who show that people with different personality
traits respond differently to incentives on tests.48
      The traits and other acquired skills evolve over time through investment and habituation.
Equation (3) shows that traits at age a + 1 are age-dependent functions of cognitive ability,
personality traits, other acquired skills, and investment Ia at age a. In this way, previous
levels of traits and acquired skill affect current levels of traits and acquired skill. Equation
(3) formalizes the notion that the traits and skills governing performance at a point in time
are themselves the outcome of investment and habituation:


            (Ca+1 , Pa+1 , Ka+1 ) = ηa (Ca , Pa , Ka ,             Ia ),       a = 1, . . . , A.   (3)

                                                                Investment
                                                                   and
                                                                experience


In conjunction with resource constraints, a “deeper” set of preference parameters at age a
may govern investment decisions and effort allocated to tasks.


3.2       Extreme Examples of Personality Change

Laboratory experiments and brain lesion studies provide some of the most compelling evi-
dence that personality traits can change and that the change affects behaviors. The most
famous example is that of Phineas Gage, a railway construction foreman whose head was
impaled by a metal spike. Miraculously he retained his problem solving abilities, but he
changed from being polite and dependable to being rude and unreliable. His personality
change caused him to lose his job and alienate family members (Damasio et al., 2005). Lab-
 48                                   ∂ 2 ψTa
      Formally, this occurs when     ∂Pa ∂RTa   6= 0.



                                                        22
oratory experiments show that expressed traits can be manipulated temporarily. Magnetic
disruption of the left lateral prefrontal cortex can increase experimentally elicited discount
rates (Figner et al., 2010) and nasal sprays of oxytocin increase trust (Kosfeld et al., 2005).


3.3    Evidence from the GED Testing Program

The GED is a standardized achievement test that serves as an alternative to a high school
diploma. High school dropouts can take the seven-and-a-half hour GED exam to certify
that they have the “general knowledge” of a high school graduate. The test is widely used.
The GED testing program currently produces 12% of high school certificates each year in
the United States. We draw on the analysis of Heckman et al. (2012a) and first present
results for males. The GED program provides insight into the effects of personality traits
on outcomes. GED recipients have the same cognitive ability as high school graduates, but
differ in their personality traits.
   Table 4 shows the correlations between GED test scores and other achievement test scores.
GED test scores are strongly correlated with scores on other standardized achievement tests.
The correlations range from 0.61 with the General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB) to 0.88
with the Iowa Test of Educational Development, the progenitor of the GED.

       GED recipients are smarter than other dropouts. Figure 5 shows the distributions of a fac-
tor extracted from the components of the ASVAB for male high school dropouts, GED recip-
ients, and high school graduates.49 The sample excludes people who attend post-secondary
education. The distribution of the scores of GED recipients is much more like that of high
school graduates than that of high school dropouts.
  49
       Similar results are found for females.

Source: Reproduced from Heckman et al. (2011b), which uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979
(NLSY79). Notes: The distributions above represent cognitive ability factors estimated using a subset of the Armed Services
Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) and educational attainment as laid out in Hansen et al. (2004). The sample is restricted
to the cross-sectional subsample for both males and females. Distributions show only those with no post-secondary educational
attainment. The cognitive ability factors are normalized by gender to be mean zero standard deviation one.



       If they have the same cognitive ability as high school graduates, then why do they drop
out of high school? Success in school requires other traits. On a variety of other dimensions,
GED recipients behave much more like other dropouts. Figure 6 shows measures of early
adolescent drug use, crime, sex, and violence extracted from three data sources.50 Male
high school graduates perform better on all measures than high school dropouts or GED
recipients. GED recipients are much more similar to dropouts, but in several cases are
statistically significantly more likely to engage in risky behaviors than other dropouts. On
no outcome measure in that figure are dropouts statistically significantly more likely to
engage in risky behaviors compared to GED recipients. Figure 7 summarizes these adolescent
behaviors using a single factor and shows that unlike the cognitive summary measures, the
distribution of the noncognitive (personality) summary measure of GED recipients is much
closer to that of dropouts than to that of high school graduates.

    The traits that cause GED recipients to drop out of high school manifest themselves
in many other life outcomes. One potential benefit of the GED certificate is that it opens
doors to post-secondary education. Figure 8 shows post-secondary educational attainment
for GED recipients and high school graduates. About 40% of GED recipients enroll in a 2-
or 4- year college. Nearly half drop out within the first year. Fewer than 5% earn a B.A.
degree and fewer than 10% earn an A.A. degree.

    GED recipients lack persistence in a variety of tasks in life. Figure 9 shows the survival
rates in employment, marriage, and in the condition of not having been incarcerated. GED
recipients tend to exit employment, become divorced, and enter jail at rates similar to those
of high school dropouts, while high school graduates are much more persistent.

cross sectional sample. Notes: The “Survival Rate in Marriage” is based on the first marriage spell that began after 1979. People
who were already married or divorced in 1979 were excluded from the sample, because the length of their spell is unknown.
The “Survival Rate in Employment” is based on all employment spells that began after 1979 and after the respondent was
16. People are excluded from the employment estimates if they have been to jail. The “Survival Rate in Non-Incarcerated
State” is based on the time until first incarceration starting at age 22 (the youngest age for which the jail status is available
for all respondents). Respondents who were already in jail at age 22 were excluded from the sample. Tests of Significance: The
estimates for GED recipients and high school graduates are statistically significantly different at the 5% level in all cases except
for the first year of the “Survival Rate in Employment” and the first year of the “Survival Rate in Marriage.” The estimates
for dropouts and high school graduates are statistically significantly different at the 5% level in all cases. The estimates for
dropouts and GED recipients are significantly different at the 5% level for years three through five of the “Survival Rate in
Employment.”

   Adjusting for their differences in cognitive ability, male GED recipients perform virtually
the same as high school dropouts in the labor market. Figure 10 shows the hourly wages
and annual earnings of male GED recipients and high school graduates compared to high
school dropouts for different age groups. The first set of bars shows the outcomes after
adjusting for age, race, year, and region of residence. The second set of bars shows the
effects after additionally adjusting for AFQT scores. The third set of bars shows the effects
after additionally adjusting for standard measures of family background. GED recipients
and high school graduates outperform dropouts in regressions that only adjust for age, race,
year, and region of residence. After adjusting for cognitive ability, GED recipients are
indistinguishable from dropouts, whereas high school graduates earn more and have higher
hourly wages. Controlling for family background characteristics does not change the story.

                                                                            31
       Most of the patterns found for women parallel those found for men. However, there
are some important differences.51 While female GED recipients share similar cognitive and
personality traits as male GED recipients, their outcomes differ. After accounting for differ-
ences in cognitive ability, female GED recipients do not earn higher hourly wages than other
dropouts, but unlike men they have higher annual earnings because they are more likely to
participate in the labor force.52


3.4       Evidence from The Perry Preschool Program and Other In-

          terventions

Evidence from the Perry Preschool Program shows how personality traits can be changed in
ways that produce beneficial lifetime outcomes. The Perry preschool Program enriched the
lives of three- and four-year-old low-income, Black children with initial IQs below 85 at age
3.53
       Participants were taught social skills in a “plan-do-review” sequence where students
planned a task, executed it, and then reviewed it with teachers and fellow students. They
learned to work with others when problems arose.54 In addition, home visits promoted
parent-child interactions. The program ended after two years of enrollment and both treat-
ments and controls entered the same school. The program was evaluated by the method of
random assignment.
       The program did not improve IQ scores in a lasting way. Figure 11 shows that, by age
ten, treatment and control groups had the same average IQ scores. Many critics of early
childhood programs seize on this finding and related evidence to dismiss the value of early
  51
     See Heckman et al. (2012a).
  52
     The increased labor supply response is largely due to female GED recipients who attain some post-
secondary education or who have dropped out of high school due to pregnancy. See Heckman et al. (2012a)
for a full discussion of the evidence on the performance of GED recipients.
  53
     We draw on the analysis of Heckman et al. (2012b).
  54
     Sylva (1997) describes the Perry program as a Vygotskian program fostering personality traits. Vygotsky
developed a psychology of child development in structured social settings that emphasized development of
social and personality skills. The Vygotskian approach strongly influences the Tools of the Mind program
(see Bodrova and Leong, 2001, 2007).

Notes: IQ measured on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale (Terman and Merrill, 1960). The test was administered at program
entry and at each of the ages indicated. Source: Cunha et al. (2006) and Heckman and Masterov (2007) based on data provided

       Nevertheless, the program improved outcomes for both boys and girls, resulting in a
statistically significant rate of return of around 6-10% per annum for both boys and girls
(see Heckman et al., 2010a,b). These returns are above the post-World War II, pre-2008
meltdown in stock market returns to equity estimated to be 5.8% per annum.55
       The Perry Preschool Program worked primarily through improving personality traits.
Participants had better direct measures of personal behavior (a weighted average of “ab-
sences and truancies,” “lying and cheating,” “stealing,” and “swears or uses obscene words”
measured by teachers in the elementary school years). Participants of both genders im-
proved their “externalizing behavior,” a psychological construct related to Agreeableness
and Conscientiousness. For girls, the program improved Openness to Experience (proxied
by academic motivation). The program also improved scores on the California Achievement
  55
       See DeLong and Magin (2009).



                                                            33
Test (CAT). This evidence is consistent with the evidence presented in the previous section
that shows that performance on achievement tests depends on personality traits.
       Other studies are broadly consistent with the evidence from the Perry Preschool study.
Analyses of data from Project STAR, a program that randomly assigned kindergartners and
teachers to classes of different sizes, yields results similar to the Perry Program. Using data
from Project STAR, Dee and West (2011) find that assignment to a small class is associated
with positive changes in personality. In a follow-up analysis, Chetty et al. (2011) examine
the Project STAR program and find that students placed in higher quality kindergarten
classes–as measured by their peer’s average performance on a Stanford Achievement Test–
had significantly higher earnings in early adulthood.
       The curriculum of Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (PATHS) teaches self-
control, emotional awareness, and social problem-solving skills and is aimed at elementary
school children (see Bierman et al., 2010). A recent random-assignment, longitudinal study
demonstrates that the PATHS curriculum reduces teacher and peer ratings of aggression,
improves teacher and peer ratings of prosocial behavior, and improves teacher ratings of
academic engagement.56 PATHS is an exemplar of school-based social and emotional learning
(SEL) programs. A recent meta-analysis shows that the program improved grades by 0.33
standard deviations and achievement test scores by 0.27 standard deviations (Durlak et al.,
2011).57
       Likewise, several random assignment evaluations of Tools of the Mind, a preschool and
early primary school curriculum targeting development of self-control, show that it improves
classroom behavior as well as executive function, defined as higher-level cognitive skills in-
cluding inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility (Barnett et al., 2008,
2006; Bodrova and Leong, 2001, 2007; Diamond et al., 2007; Lillard and Else-Quest, 2006).58
  56
      See Bierman et al. (2010).
  57
      Note, however, that the largest federal study to date on character education programs, including PATHS,
failed to find evidence for improvements in behavior or academic performance (see Social and Character
Development Research Consortium, 2010).
   58
      However, a more recent large-scale study (Farran et al., 2011) does not find any effect of the program
on self-regulation or literacy, language, and mathematics achievement.


                                                     34
Positive findings are reported for the Montessori preschool curriculum (Lillard and Else-
Quest, 2006). Unlike the Perry study, these studies do not have long-term followups.
       There is evidence that targeted intervention efforts can improve aspects of Conscien-
tiousness. In contrast to the multi-faceted curricula described above, studies targeting im-
provement in this trait are designed to isolate a particular mechanism producing behavioral
change. For instance, Rueda et al. (2005) designed a set of computer exercises to train
attention in children between four and six years of age. Children in the intervention group
improved in performance on computer tasks of attention relative to children who instead
watched interactive videos for a comparable amount of time. Similarly, Stevens et al. (2008)
designed a 6-week computerized intervention and showed that it can improve selective au-
ditory attention (i.e., the ability to attend to a target auditory signal in the face of an
irrelevant, distracting auditory signal). As is typical of much of the literature, all of these
programs have only short-term follow-ups.
       Several studies suggest that personality can be remediated in adolescence. Martins (2010)
analyzes data from EPSIS, a program developed to improve student achievement of 13-15
year-olds in Portugal by increasing motivation, self-esteem, and study skills. The program
consists of one-on-one meetings with a trained staff member or meetings in small groups. The
intervention was tailored to each participant’s individual skill deficit. Overall, the program
was successful and cost-effective, decreasing grade retention by 10 percentage points.
       Other life experiences, like employment, can improve personality. Gottschalk (2005)
analyzes evidence from a randomized control trial that working at a job can improve locus
of control, a trait related to Neuroticism that measures the extent to which individuals
believe that they have control over their lives through self-motivation or self-determination
as opposed to the extent that the environment controls their lives (Rotter, 1966).59 He uses
data from the Self-Sufficiency Project (SSP) in which some welfare recipients were randomly
offered substantial subsidies to work. The subsidy more than doubled the earnings of a
  59
    The relationship between locus of control and the Big Five trait of Neuroticism is discussed in Almlund
et al. (2011).


                                                    35
minimum wage worker. People in the experimental group worked about 30% more hours
than those in the control group. After 36 months, those who received the subsidy were more
likely to have an improved locus of control.


3.5       Additional Evidence

Studies that account for the endogeneity of investment and education provide further ev-
idence of the causal effect of education and cognitive and personality traits on outcomes.
Heckman et al. (2011b) estimate a sequential model of education to study the effects of
education on a variety of outcomes. Correcting for selection into education, they find that
early cognitive and personality traits affect schooling choices, labor market outcomes, adult
health, and social outcomes and that increasing education promotes beneficial labor market,
health, and social outcomes.
       Heckman et al. (2006b) estimate a version of Equation (3) to analyze the effects of
increases in education on measured cognition and personality measures.60 Controlling for
the problem of reverse causality that schooling may be caused by traits, they find that
schooling improves both personality and cognitive traits and that these traits, in turn, boost
outcomes.61
       Cunha et al. (2010) estimate a model of the technology of skill formation using longitudi-
nal data on the development of children with rich measures of parental investment and child
traits. They control for the endogeneity of investment using shocks to family income along
with other instruments. Their model is a version of Equation (3). Traits are self-productive
and exhibit dynamic complementarity – current values of traits affect the evolution of future
traits through direct and cross effects. A leading example of a cross effect is that more
motivated children are more likely to learn. They estimate parameters that summarize how
  60
      They estimate the effect of schooling on self-esteem and locus of control, personality traits related to
Neuroticism. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale attempts to assess the degree of approval or disapproval of
oneself (Rosenberg, 1965). The relationship between these measures and the Big Five traits of Neuroticism
is discussed in Almlund et al. (2011).
   61
      Both Heckman et al. (2011b) and Heckman et al. (2006b) use an identification strategy based on matching
on proxies for unobserved traits that corrects for measurement error and the endogeneity of schooling.

                                                     36
past personality traits affect future cognitive traits.
       They find that self-productivity becomes stronger as children become older, for both
cognitive and personality traits. The elasticity of substitution for cognitive inputs is smaller
later in life. This means that it is more difficult to compensate for the effects of adverse
environments on cognitive endowments at later ages than it is at earlier ages. This finding
is consistent with the high rank stability of cognition over ages past 10-12 reported in the
literature. It also helps to explain the evidence on the ineffectiveness of cognitive remediation
strategies for disadvantaged adolescents documented in Cunha et al. (2006); Knudsen et al.
(2006) and Cunha and Heckman (2007).
       Personality traits foster the development of cognition but not vice versa. It is equally
easy at all stages of the child’s life cycle to compensate for early disadvantage in endow-
ments using personality traits. (Elasticities of substitution for these traits are essentially the
same at different stages of the life cycle.) The most effective adolescent interventions target
personality traits.62



4        Summary

This paper reviews recent evidence on the importance of personality in economic and social
life. It shows that success in life depends on many traits, not just those measured by IQ,
grades, and standardized achievements tests. Personality traits predict and cause outcomes.
       All psychological traits are measured by performance on tasks. Psychological traits have
different productivities in different tasks. Performance on tasks depends on incentives and
multiple traits, giving rise to a fundamental identification problem when measuring any single
trait. This identification problem is empirically important even for measures of cognitive
traits.
       The importance of cognitive ability increases with the complexity of the task. Given their
  62
    Cunha et al. (2006) report that 16% of the variation in educational attainment is explained by adolescent
cognitive traits, 12% is due to adolescent personality (socioemotional traits), and 15% is due to measured
parental investments.

                                                     37
endowments of traits and the incentives they face, people sort into tasks in life in pursuit of
their comparative advantage.
      Traits are stable across situations, but their manifestation depends on incentives to apply
effort in the situations where they are measured and also depends on other traits and skills.
However, traits are not set in stone. They change over the life cycle and can be enhanced
by education, parenting, and environment to different degrees at different ages.
      Scores on achievement tests capture both cognitive and personality traits. Children who
are more academically motivated and more curious learn more and have higher test scores.
More motivated children also try harder on achievement tests.
      The evidence in this paper should give pause to analysts and policy makers who rely
solely on achievement tests to monitor school performance and school systems. Standardized
achievement tests do not adequately capture many skills that matter in life. GED recipients
perform about as well as high school graduates on achievement tests but perform much
worse in many aspects of life because they lack important personality traits. Categorizing
GED recipients as high school graduates misrepresents national statistics on educational
attainment.63 The Perry Preschool Program improved the lives of its participants without
increasing their IQ scores, demonstrating why it is problematic to focus curricula exclusively
on improving cognitive test scores.
      Monitoring school progress and creating programs to enhance skills requires a broader
framework of measurement. Interventions that promote beneficial changes in personality
have an important place in a portfolio of public policies to foster human development.
