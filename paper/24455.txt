                                         ABSTRACT

We study the economics of international joint ventures with administrative data for China
exploiting the change in foreign direct investment policy as China entered the WTO in the year
2002. Accounting for a quarter of all international joint ventures worldwide, we first show that
foreign investors choose Chinese partners that are relatively large, productive, and often
subsidized to set up their joint venture. Second, we document benefits from foreign technology in
terms of innovation and productivity that go far beyond the joint venture, not only to the Chinese
joint venture parent firm but also to entrepreneurs at firms upstream from and in the same
industry as the joint venture (backward and horizontal spillovers, respectively). As China has
dropped joint venture requirements and shifted towards wholly foreign-owned FDI as part of
becoming a member of the WTO, there have been two opposing effects. While joint venture
spillovers have increased, the shift towards wholly foreign-owned FDI has reduced spillovers
because we find larger industry spillovers from international joint ventures than from wholly
foreign-owned FDI. The results shed new light on the efficacy of FDI performance requirements
as well as on claims regarding international technology transfer that underpin the current China-
U.S. trade war.

1         Introduction

        Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a leading explanation for why outward oriented economies
perform better than inward oriented economies because foreign multinationals bring advanced
technological knowledge to firms in the local economy (Harrison and Rodríguez-Clare 2010, Keller
2010). For many years, host country governments have used performance requirements such as
the rule that a foreign multinational must partner with a domestic firm to form a joint venture
(JV) to increase technology transfer (UNCTAD 2003).1 Nowhere are such international JVs more
important than in China, where in the wake of the country’s opening to FDI in 1979 a flood
of foreign investment, just over 6,000 new international JVs amounting to USD 27.8 billion in
2015 alone, has entered one of the world’s largest economies (Investment Promotion Agency
2018). Upon joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) in late 2001, China has committed
to the world-wide trend of liberalizing its FDI regime by dropping the JV requirement for many
investments, although China’s FDI policy remains a major point of contention.2 Yet, despite the
prominence of international JVs in the global economy we still know quite little on how they form
and their impact on the domestic economy. Employing administrative data from 1998 to 2007 on
the universe of Chinese JVs matched to firm-level data, this paper examines JVs in comparison to
other forms of FDI exploiting the policy change of China’s WTO entry.
        Our analysis builds on a unique dataset by combining three sources. This is, first, the universe
of JVs together with both the foreign and the domestic firms that establish them from the Name
List of Foreign and Domestic Joint Ventures in China (Name List for short).3 Second, to assess
innovation performance we employ the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) database, which
gives detailed information on all patent applications and grants in China. The two datasets are
matched to the comparatively well-known firm panel from the National Bureau of Statistics (the
Annual Survey of Industrial Firms panel, or ASIF). Employing these sources of information we
    1
     Other goals of performance requirements include increasing domestic value added, export generation, and
linkage promotion (UNCTAD 2003, Chapter I).
   2
     For example, in 2018 U.S. government officials argued that U.S. firms are harmed by China’s ‘forced joint
ventures’ policy (USTR 2017). The issue has been central to the ongoing U.S.-China trade war.
   3
     The joint venture is a new, legally independent firm created through the partnership of the foreign investor and
a selected Chinese partner firm.

find that JVs are both the result of key internalized firm decisions and that JVs generate major
externalities for other firms.
       First, far from selecting their JV partners at random, foreign investors choose firms that are not
only relatively large and innovative but also benefit from public subsidies. In contrast, government
ownership is a deterrent to being chosen to partner in the formation of an international JV. The
primary determinants of foreign investors’ joint venture partner choice do not change as China
entered the WTO. Furthermore, joint ventures perform better than other firms in terms of size,
productivity, and innovation. This reflects to some extent the technology transferred from the
foreign investor.
       There is also strong technological learning outside of the JV. First, the Chinese firms that
foreign investors choose to be their JV partners positively impact productivity and patenting of
other firms. This effect, which is novel to the best of our knowledge, is consistent with technology
leakage from the JV to its Chinese parent firm. Second, joint ventures generate positive externalities
in terms of productivity and patenting to Chinese firms that operate in the same industry. In
addition, we find that firms selling to joint ventures benefit from technological externalities as well
(backward spillovers). Both joint ventures and regular FDI were important during our sample
period, and comparing the two we find that while either has generated positive learning effects in
China, the gains from joint ventures are larger than those from regular FDI.4 This is mostly due
to JVs having a stronger productivity impact on firms in the same industry than regular foreign
direct investment.
       This paper makes three contributions. First, we quantitatively examine the effects of JVs in
a major world market. While JV requirements have been employed widely, including in India,
Mexico, Turkey, Nigeria, and Malaysia, the evidence on JVs remains limited, mostly relying on
small samples such as UNCTAD’s (2003) impact assessment of JV requirements in India based only
on the investment of two Japanese motorcycle companies. While careful case studies can be useful,
such as a recent analysis of JVs in China’s automobile industry (Howell, 2018), generalizability
   4
    Non-JV FDI in China is typically referred to as Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises (WFOE) in China. In
addition to results on WFOEs we will report findings for majority-owned FDI, a category that is employed in other
countries such as the United States. WFOE or majority-owned FDI are also referred to as “FDI” for simplicity,
even though JVs are also a form of FDI.


                                                       2
remains an important issue, and by examining all JVs in China we put this concern to rest.
Furthermore, we advance the literature by analyzing JVs as binding JV requirements were lifted.
The choice, pattern, and impact of JVs will typically depend on whether JV requirements are
binding (UNCTAD 2003), which is why a comparison of minority- with majority-owned FDI in
a setting without ownership constraints (e.g., Blomström, Kokko, and Zejan 2000 for Sweden),
provides limited information. By examining JV partner choice and identifying JV effects through
China’s WTO commitments, an era when legal barriers to FDI dramatically changed, we are
able to shed important new light on the economics of international joint ventures.5 Our analysis
shows that while industry-specific changes in FDI policy mattered, the impact of China’s WTO
membership on reducing uncertainty regarding China’s future FDI policies played a key role (see
Handley and Limão 2015, Pierce and Schott 2016).
      Second, we compare technological learning externalities of international JVs ventures with those
of other forms of FDI. In addition to its multilateral obligations as a WTO member to drop JV
requirements, China has recently experienced bilateral pressure to liberalize its FDI regime, in
particular from the United States. There, government officials have argued that China’s JV policy
amounts to forced technology transfer if not outright theft of U.S. intellectual property. Central
to evaluating the impact of any changes in China’s FDI regime, whether in the past, present, or
future, is the ability to compare the technological externalities generated by international JVs and
other forms of FDI side by side. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis is the first to do so.
This yields evidence on the speed of China’s technological learning, at issue in recent U.S.-China
policy discussions, as well as on the consequences of scrapping FDI performance requirements more
generally.
      Third, our analysis sheds new light on foreign investment in China, which matters not least
because of the size of China’s economy. Some of the earliest empirical research examines productivity
spillovers from FDI in China’s electronics and textile industries (Hu and Jefferson 2002). Over
time the literature has evolved to employ longitudinal micro data and multiple economic outcomes,
though the evidence on FDI learning effects is mixed (e.g., Huang 2004, Wei and Liu 2006). Our

analysis complements Javorcik’s (2004) seminal paper on backward FDI spillovers by identifying
them through a policy change in a large economy.6 A related paper is Lu, Tao, and Zhu (2017)
who examine FDI effects in China also using the ASIF panel. Our analysis differs in that we
show results on international JVs as well, from which important differences arise. Another closely
related paper is Van Reenen and Yueh’s (2012) recent study of joint ventures in China. Relative to
their work we add the analysis of horizontal and vertical externalities, central to economic policy
questions, and we present a comparison of JVs to other forms of FDI.
        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give background on the
policy environment for FDI in China and how it changed as China became a member of the WTO.
We also describe our firm-level dataset. Section 3 sheds light on the main factors that determine
the choice of local partner from the point of view of foreign investors. The section also provides
evidence that foreign investors transfer their technology to the joint venture, and that some of
this leaks out to the Chinese parent of this joint venture. Section 4 covers several main results of
the paper by providing evidence on the strength of industry externalities due to joint ventures,
and comparing them with those generated by other forms of FDI. Section 5 provides a concluding
discussion and elucidates the policy implications of our findings.



2         Foreign Direct Investment and International Joint Ven-

          tures in China

2.1        Developments since 1979

        As part of a broad effort to enact economic reforms, China started to open to foreign investment
in 1979 with the “Law on Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures” (passed in July 1979), with further
implementation measures introduced and revised in the 1980s to early 1990s (see Lu, Tao, and
Zhu 2017). As seen from Figure 1, however, only by the early 1990s did FDI enter the country in
    6
     Alfaro-Urena, Manelici, and Vasquez (2019) have recently employed actual firm-to-firm data instead of input-
output tables to model firm linkages; they find even stronger evidence for important vertical linkages. Earlier work
in this dimension is Javorcik and Spatareanu (2009) who employ information on whether local firms sell to a foreign
multinational for a sample of Czech firms.



                                                         4
significant volumes. This was the consequence of reforms enacted by Deng Xiaoping following his
famed Southern Tour of 1992. This led to the gradual relaxation of rules on FDI, in particular in
the context of special economic zones which offered favorable regulatory environments to foreign
investment (OECD 2000). Even though the volume of FDI increased in the early 1990s, especially
with the spike around 1993 resulting from the establishment of several new special economic zones
to attract foreign investment, foreign investors in China were still regulated relatively heavily.7
       Similar to other countries (especially emerging countries), China’s policy towards inward FDI
has employed several types of instruments. One instrument determines which activities or sectors
are open to foreign investors at all. One can think of this as a policy operating at the extensive
margin. In particular, in 1995 China’s central government published the Catalogue for the Guidance
of Foreign Investment Industries, which has been revised multiple times since then. This catalogue
classifies activities (i.e., highly disaggregated industries) into one of four types, from least to most
restricted (encouraged, neutral, restricted, and prohibited). Restricted activities include endeavors
such as, for example, the production of various chemicals and pharmaceuticals, the manufacture
of certain electronics and machinery, such as cameras or car engines, and the operation of rail
and freight companies. An instrument of FDI policy central to our analysis is the joint venture
requirement: foreign investors operate in China by partnering up with a Chinese firm to form a
joint venture, and the transfer of advanced technology and management know-how to Chinese
partner firms was typically expected (Lu, Tao, and Zhu 2017).8 Other requirements for FDI in
China included domestic content requirements and export requirements. These are some of the
main reasons why observers typically described China’s level of integration in the world economy
by 2001 as shallow (Lardy 2001).
   7
     A sizable portion of the recorded FDI into China from Hong Kong actually initially originates from China—a
process known as “round-tripping,” wherein outward capital flows re-enter the Chinese market via Hong Kong for
the purpose of avoiding regulation, high taxes, trade barriers, and other administrative obstacles. Our dataset does
not allow us to discern the initial origin of capital that is being repatriated to China; rather, we only observe the
foreign origin of the FDI.
   8
     Most restricted activities have a JV requirement, however, there is no one-to-one mapping. Below we will exploit
the industry variation of the Catalogue in our analysis.




                                                         5
2.2       Changes in China’s FDI Regime with WTO Entry

       Major changes to China’s FDI policy were to take place as China became a member of
the World Trade Organization, which culminated China’s bid for GATT membership in 1986
and its application for WTO membership in 1995. In addition to tariff reductions and other
improvements of market access, as well as the enhanced protection of intellectual property rights,
WTO membership meant that China would commit to full compliance with the “Agreement on
Trade-Related Investment Measures” (TRIMs) and liberalize its FDI policies to be in compliance
with its WTO obligations. Figure 1 shows that after plateauing in the late 1990s, the volume of
FDI flows into China experienced a sustained increase to about 130 billion USD per year in 2014.
       In particular, WTO membership explicitly rules out that market access is given ‘quid pro quo’
in exchange for the transfer of technology. Furthermore, China dropped the JV requirement for a
large number of activities. Table A2 in the Appendix provides details at the two-digit industry
level. As Table 1 shows, the share of international JVs in total FDI fell from more than 60% in
1997 to about 20% by 2012, while the share of wholly-foreign-owned FDI increased from less than
20% to about three quarters over the same time period.9 Importantly, throughout our sample
period international JVs and wholly foreign-owned FDI both account for a large share of all FDI
in China. This is key for our analysis of international JV and standard FDI effects side-by-side.10
       Moreover, WTO entry led to changes in FDI policy that were plausibly exogenous because it
involved acceding to the commitments of a multilateral agreement with well over one hundred
signatory countries. China’s importance in global markets and its consequent ability to negotiate
specific conditions meant that it was uncertain whether other economic powers such as the
European Union and the United States would give their assent to China’s WTO membership.11
   9
      Equity joint ventures differ from contractual joint ventures in a number of ways. Unlike equity joint ventures,
contractual joint ventures need not be separate legal entities from their parents. Equity joint ventures require a
minimum share of foreign ownership to be classified as such, whereas contractual joint ventures require no such
provision. In contractual joint ventures, profits are shared between partners on a contractually-agreed upon basis (as
opposed to in proportion to each partner’s capital contribution). Further, in contractual joint ventures the degree of
foreign control embedded in the structure of the joint venture—management, voting, staffing rights, etc.—can be
negotiated over, and not necessarily allocated based on equity shares.
   10
      FDI has also increasingly been conducted via share companies with foreign investment, i.e. publicly traded
companies established in China by foreign companies, though the volume of FDI flows conducted via this mode is
still dwarfed by other types of FDI.
   11
      There are areas in which China did not fully implement its WTO commitments, such as intellectual property
rights and industrial policy (USTR 2018). At the same time, allegations are made regularly that countries are in

From an estimation point of view China’s earlier policy reversals with respect to GATT and WTO
membership as well as key votes in the United States and the European Union create uncertainty
about China’s WTO status which limit anticipation effects and mean that the policy change is
plausibly exogenous.

    We employ a difference-in-difference estimation strategy to focus on the change in firm outcome
yit , such as the patent count of firm i in year t, as a function of activities of international JVs as
violation of WTO rules, and the resolution of such violations is the very purpose of the WTO’s dispute settlement
mechanism.

China had become a member of the WTO in the year 2002. To examine the impact of some joint
venture variable Vit we estimate


                        yit = β1 Vit + β2 [Vit × W T Ot ] + X 0it γ + λi + µt + εit ,                 (1)


where the variable W T Ot is an indicator variable equal to one for years 2002 to 2007, and zero
otherwise, X it is a vector of firm characteristics, λi is a firm fixed effect, µt is a year fixed effect,
and εit is a mean-zero error term. We are especially interested in the parameter β2 , which reflects
the change in the relationship between yit and Vit in the post-WTO era. The parameter will capture
not only the dropping of JV requirements for particular activities but also the general effect of
China liberalizing its FDI regime as part of the country’s commitment to join the WTO. Moreover,
the estimate will pick up any reduction in uncertainty about China’s future FDI policies that may
have resulted from China’s entry into the multilateral agreement. Such policy uncertainty has
recently been emphasized as an important determinant of firm behavior by Handley and Limão
(2015) and Pierce and Schott (2016).
   One concern is that the W T Ot variable is a time dummy that switches on in the year 2002,
which means that other changes that took place in the year 2002 may be threats to identification.
Below we therefore include interactions of other variables with the W T Ot variable, including tariff
changes and privatizations.


2.3    Data and Sample

   Our dataset is constructed using three main sources. The Annual Survey of Industrial Firms
panel (ASIF) for 1998 to 2007, maintained by China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), covers
all state-owned and non-state-owned enterprises with annual sales of at least 5 million RMB in
China’s mining and logging, manufacturing, and utilities industries, and provides financial data
and other firm-specific information, including for each company its name, address, industry, age,
and ownership structure. Brandt, Van Biesebroeck, and Zhang (2014) show that the coverage of
ASIF is identical to the corresponding information in the Chinese Statistical Yearbook. The list of



                                                     8
newly established international JVs and the corresponding domestic parent firms, together with
the foreign firms that are partner to the joint ventures, draws on the Name List of Foreign and
Domestic Joint Ventures in China (Name List Database, for short). The Name List Database
is released by China’s Ministry of Commerce. It contains a multitude of details on each joint
venture, such as its name, address, industry code, year of establishment, contracted operation
duration, and importantly, the name of the Chinese partner firm that established the joint venture.
For the domestic partner firms, the Name List Database provides each firm’s industry code and
physical address in addition to the name of the firm. We also use information on the patent
applications associated with each firm, data which are obtained from China’s State Intellectual
Property Office (SIPO) patent database. The SIPO database provides complete information on
all patent applications and grants in China, including the application and publication number of
the patent, application and grant year, classification number, type of patent, and assignee of the
patent.
   These three databases are merged at the level of the firm-year observation to form the sample
for our empirical analysis. The match quality is important for our empirical findings. Fortunately,
according to the Company Law of the People’s Republic of China, a firm must have a unique
identifier, and this identifier must contain four elements in the order of administrative region (above
county level), the firm’s name, its industrial sector, and a legal entity identifier; for instance, a
particular firm’s identifier might be Chongqing (administrative region) Changan (name) Automobile
(industrial sector) Co., Ltd. (legal entity identifier). Firms in the same industrial sector cannot
use the same name. Moreover, firms have an exclusive right to their names on a regional basis.
Therefore, if the firm’s name, location, and industry code are entered the same in both the ASIF
and Name List databases, this information identifies the same entity. Because of this, we use
company name, location, and industry code to identify both the joint venture firms and the
domestic international JV partner firms in the ASIF database and the Name List Database year by
year. Then, we match the ASIF and SIPO data to incorporate information on each firm’s patenting
activities.
   We follow the strategies from the NBER Patent Data Project in our matching approach.



                                                  9
Specifically, we use firm name, location (at the municipal level), and the 2-digit Chinese Industrial
Classification (CIC) industry code to merge the datasets with each other. Our empirical results
are based on international JVs in China’s manufacturing industries observed between 1998 and
2007. Our study covers all domestic partner firms with annual sales of at least 5 million RMB in
operation at any point between 1998 and 2007 and the analysis relies on the representativeness of
the ASIF database. To assess this we have compared the data in the ASIF data for 2004 to the 2004
Chinese Economic Census—the earliest year in which the Economic Census was conducted—which
covers all firms in China. Based on the Census, the total sales in 2004 for all industrial firms
totaled 218 billion RMB, whereas the sales for all industrial firms in the ASIF data totaled 196
billion RMB. The enterprises covered by the ASIF thus account for almost all (more than 91%)
of the total sales of all industrial firms in China in 2004. This evidence is consistent with results
in Brandt, Van Biesebroeck, and Zhang (2014) and ensures the representativeness of our sample.
Appendix Table A1 shows the CIC industrial breakdown of the firms in the ASIF database as well
as domestic international JV partner firms.12
       The distribution of joint ventures across industries over the sample period is shown in Table
2. Joint ventures are more likely to be formed in labor-intensive manufacturing industries such
as textiles and apparel (CIC 17 and 18) or high-tech industries such as electrical, electronic, and
computer equipment manufacturing (CIC 39 and 40), with relatively fewer international JVs
formed in industries such as petroleum and metal processing (owing to activities in these industries
frequently being classified by Chinese authorities as prohibited or restricted).
       We eventually consider as part of our analysis the intersectoral linkages through which industry-
level spillovers might propagate. We measure these linkages using input-output tables for China’s
manufacturing sectors. As our sample spans the years 1998 to 2007, for each observation year we
employ the most contemporary version of the input-output table produced by China’s National
Bureau of Statistics, with revisions of these input-output tables existing for the years 1997, 2002,
2005, and 2007 (from China’s Department of National Economic Accounts (DNEA) 1999, 2005,
  12
    The ASIF data reports firms’ industries by CIC Rev. 1994 code from 1998 to 2002, and CIC Rev. 2002 for
observations from 2003 to 2007. CIC is itself based on the International Standard Industrial Classification of All
Economic Activities (ISIC) industrial classification.

2007, and 2009).
   The firms involved in the formation of international JVs also vary in where they tend to be
located. Figure 2 shows the geographical distribution of the partner firms at the provincial level.
Immediately apparent is that international JV partner firms tend to be more common in highly
developed coastal areas such as Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and Shandong, with
comparatively fewer partner firms located in the western, central, and northern areas of the country.
To account for the regional component of international JV formation, we control for geographical
characteristics in our empirical analysis.
   Details on the distribution of international JVs by Chinese province are given in Table 3.


2.4    Variable Definitions

   We focus on several firm attributes in our analysis—some directly available in the data and some
that we estimate. First, we consider revenue total factor productivity (TFP-R). Given that we do
not have information on physical productivity, a generic problem is that changing mark-ups as well
as the accuracy and timing of the application of price indices may affect our productivity results.
We measure total factor productivity with two approaches: TFP (OP) is estimated following the
methodology of Olley and Pakes (1996) and TFP (W) is estimated following Wooldridge (2009).
Both methods are well-established in the productivity literature, as both address simultaneity

exit probabilities, at the cost of making a number of specific assumptions. Appendix A gives an
overview of these methods, with more results given in Jiang, Keller, Qiu, and Ridley (2019).
   Next, we focus on both technological output and commercialized output. Patents is the count
of patent applications of all types submitted at China’s national patent office in a particular year,
which is used to measure total technological output. We typically employ Patents in logarithmic
form, and because of the lag time between R&D and patenting, we use the one-year lead on patents.
Since the logarithmic form will remove firms with zero patenting from the sample, we have also
estimated count data models (in levels) using quasi-maximum likelihood, finding that it leads
to similar results. The patent data are from SIPO, which compiles complete information for all
patents filed in China since 1996. New Product Ratio is a firm’s share of sales from new products
of its total sales in a given year. Finally, to measure export activity, Export Ratio is the ratio of a
firm’s export volume in a given year over its total sales.
   We also want to capture the domestic partners’ ownership structures, and any political connec-
tions. Foreign Share is the ratio of equity owned by foreigners over total equity, while Govt. Share
is the ratio of government-owned equity over total equity. In addition, we use Subsidy, a dummy
variable equal to one if the domestic firm receives any subsidies from the government in a given
year and zero otherwise, to account for a domestic firm’s political connections. Two additional
firm controls are included in our empirics, including Employment (the total number of employees
of the firm) and Age (the number of years a firm has been in operation). To ensure that results are
not driven by entry and exit into the sample, we focus on firms that have at least five observations
during our sample period. All of the variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles to
eliminate the influence of outliers.
   The summary statistics for the above variables are presented in Table 4 for our full sample
of Chinese firms, international JV firms, and domestic international JV partners. It is apparent
that there appear to be underlying pre-existing differences between international JV firms and
non-international JV firms. Domestic international JV partners are on average older, larger,
have smaller government ownership stakes, are more export-oriented, and patent more than non-

          with weights calculated based on the relative importance of industry k 6= j as a
          destination for intermediate inputs from industry j. "Forward" is a weighted average
          of the respective Horizontal measures in the industries upstream from industry j,

international JV partners; we will control for these underlying differences in firm attributes when
estimating the determinants of selection as well as the within-firm effects of international JV
formation.
   We further examine the characteristics of the industries in our sample over time with respect to
the prevalence of the different modes of FDI in Table 5. Horizontal gives the share of industry sales
respectively accounted for by international JVs, international JV partners, and wholly foreign-owned
(non-JV) firms. Backward is a share-weighted average of the Horizontal measure in industries
downstream from industry j (with the weights measuring the importance of destination industry
k 6= j as a recipient of intermediate inputs from j), while Forward is defined analogously to
Backward but as a measure of FDI penetration in industries upstream from j (these measures are
defined in more detail below).
   Clear from Table 5 is that the composition of the FDI entering China changed in the period
covering China’s WTO accession. The average share of industry sales accounted for by joint


                                                  16
ventures declined from 5.0 to 3.1 percent of average industry sales, and a similar decline is seen
for international JV partners, from 28.0 to 15.0 percent of average industry sales. In their place
wholly-foreign owned FDI has risen as the dominant mode of foreign investment, with the share of
industry-level sales by such firms growing unabated over the period spanning 1998 to 2007. Parallel
to the results on horizontal FDI penetration, the exposure of Chinese firms to FDI in industries
besides their own, as measured by the Backward and Forward measures, has evolved in a similar
fashion. In the wake of WTO accession, international JVs and international JV partners have on
average become relatively less important as both recipients and suppliers of intermediate inputs,
while the opposite is true for wholly-foreign owned FDI.



3     Choice of Partner and Technology Transfer

3.1    The Choice of Joint Venture Partners

    This section documents the main determinants of joint venture partner choice in China for
foreign investors. We specify a simple limited dependent variable model describing the selection of
some firm i as an international JV partner as a function of the firm’s characteristics in year t:


                                P T _Selectit = f (X 0it γ, ηj , νr , µt , εit ) ,                    (2)


where j and r, respectively, index an observation’s 2-digit industry and the province of China in
which the firm is headquartered. The dependent variable P T _Selectit is equal to one if Chinese
firm i is selected as an international JV partner in year t, and zero otherwise. X it is a vector of
firm-level attributes that might affect selection, such as the firm’s productivity, while ηj , νr , and µt
represent unobserved characteristics specific to, respectively, the firm’s industry, the region in which
it operates, and the observation year. Finally, εit is a mean-zero error term. To the extent that
firms with certain characteristics are significantly more (or less) likely to be selected, the choice of
JV partners is non-random. Furthermore, foreign investors will internalize the characteristics of
their Chinese partner firm in their optimal investment strategy.



                                                       17
       Shown in Table 6 are results from logistic regressions of this equation.13 The sample in this
estimation is comprised of domestic non-JV Chinese firms, excluding firms that are majority
foreign-owned. We include various covariates one by one in order to isolate their influence.
       Larger firms are more likely to be chosen as international JV partners (column 1), as are younger
firms (column 2). Selection as a partner in an international JV is more likely for Chinese firms
that are partly foreign-owned, while government ownership (i.e., state-owned enterprises) enters
with a negative coefficient (column 3). Firms that are subsidized are more likely to be chosen to
be a JV partner (column 4), as are firms that sell a large fraction of their output abroad (column
5). Foreigners interested in Chinese JV partners prefer profitable firms (column 6, with profits
measured in million RMB), though this effect becomes insignificant (and even negative) with the
inclusion of other controls. We also see that conditional on size, industry, and profitability, firms
that are more productive are significantly more likely to be picked as partners (column 7).
       We are also interested in the role of innovation for international JV partner choice in China; see
columns 8, 9, and 10 of Table 6. The first measure of innovation is the sum of all invention, design,
and utility model patent applications, cumulative over the three years preceding (and inclusive
of) the observation year; we see that a higher level of patenting activity raises the chance that a
Chinese firm is picked as a joint venture partner (column 8). Furthermore, we examine whether
product innovation matters for partner choice. The results show that firms with a relatively high
ratio of new products in their total sales are more likely to become partners in international JVs
(column 9). The new product ratio and patent measures capture different aspects of the innovation
activity of these firms, and both are associated with a higher probability of partner choice (see
column 10).
       It is worth asking whether the determinants of international JV partner choice have changed
with China’s entry into the WTO in late 2001. Exploring this issue, we have found no strong
evidence for it.
  13
       Employing probit regressions we find broadly similar results.

3.2       Joint Venture Performance in Comparison

       Success of the foreign investor in the Chinese market turns on a strong performance of the joint
venture firm. To ensure this the foreign investor will transfer advanced technological knowledge to
the joint venture as part of an optimal investment strategy. This technology transfer is central
to any benefits that FDI might have to firms in the host country economy. In the following we
provide evidence on technology transfer to the JV by comparing its performance with other firms
in the host country. We emphasize that these are simple comparisons that do not give the causal
effect of JV status.
       We estimate the following regression equation by OLS:


                 yijrt = α + β1 JV ijr + β2 [JVijr × W T Ot ] + X 0it γ + ηj + νr + µt + εijrt ,           (3)


where yijrt is an outcome of firm i (belonging to industry j and region r) in year t, and JVijr
is an indicator for whether the firm is a joint venture.14 The variable X it is a vector of firm
characteristics, and ηj , νr , and µt are industry, region, and year fixed effects, respectively. The
coefficient β1 gives the average difference in outcome y between joint ventures and other firms
in China holding constant industry, region, and time, as well as the characteristics in X it , while
coefficient β2 captures how this difference has changed as China entered the WTO. Table 7 shows
the results.
       We see that prior to 2002, joint ventures have a productivity advantage of more than 50%
compared to other Chinese firms in the same region and industry, irrespective of whether we employ
TFP based on Olley and Pakes (1996) or Wooldridge (2009); see columns 1 and 2. They have a
relatively higher share of new products in their total sales, their sales are about 60% higher, and
they export more (columns 4, 5, and 6, respectively). These results are consistent with substantial
foreign technology transfer to the joint ventures. Furthermore, it is easy to see that would this
technological knowledge become available to other local firms as an external effect this may have
quantitatively significant effects on the local economy.
  14
    Firms very rarely change the industry in which they operate, or the region in which they are located, so we
often simplify notation to firm and year subscripts, yit .

   Interestingly, we see that the productivity and share of new products premium of joint venture
firms is reduced in the post-2002 period. This may be due to a number of reasons. One is
that foreign investors transfer less technology to their joint venture in the WTO era, although
it is not clear why this would be optimal. Another possibility is that these results reflect that
by 2002, Chinese firms have to some extent caught up with foreign investors compared to the
pre-WTO period. This explanation is plausible not least because we cannot include firm fixed
effects in specification (3). Joint ventures are only observed once they are set up, i.e. JVi is not
separately identified from a firm fixed effect—and our results reflect to some extent changes in
the composition of the sample. In contrast, we find evidence for significantly higher rates of joint
ventures’ innovation rates, measured by patenting, after China entered the WTO (column 3).


                                                 21
       Recall that foreign investors choose their JV partner, and investors choose how much technology
to transfer to the joint venture. As a consequence, Table 7 does not give the impact of converting
a randomly selected Chinese firm into a joint venture. At the same time, the results of Table
7 are consistent with substantial technology transfer from the foreign investor to their Chinese
joint venture. This is important because it is the basis for our analysis of technological learning
externalities below.


3.3       The Impact on Chinese International JV Partners

       While foreign investors have an incentive to transfer technology to the joint venture, this
incentive does not exist to the same extent with regard to the Chinese partner firm. One reason
for this is that the Chinese partner firm might be a competitor of the foreign investor in other
markets. Thus, to the extent that the Chinese partner firm benefits from the advanced technology
of the foreign investor this could be an external effect that also exists for non-partner, non-joint
venture firms, or it may be a leakage effect from the joint venture to the Chinese partner firm. The
latter we refer to as intergenerational technology transfer.
       In the following analysis we shed light on this by studying the impact of joint venture partners
on other local firms. We have seen above that JV partners are not randomly selected—they tend to
be large, productive, and benefit from government subsidies. To sharpen identification, therefore,
we perform the following analysis on the sample of JV partner firms and firms that are not—but
which are very similar based on propensity score matching.15 We turn to industry externalities in
Section 4 below.
       The specification is given by


                     yit = α + β1 P T it + β2 [P Tit × W T Ot ] + X 0it γ + λi + µt + εit ,                     (4)


where yit is an outcome of firm i in year t, for example its total factor productivity, the indicator
variable P Tit is one if firm i is a Chinese joint venture partner firm in that year, and zero
  15
     We calculate each firm’s propensity score for being chosen as a JV partner based on the specification in column
4 of Table 6. Our results are robust to alternative specifications of the selection equation.



                                                        22
otherwise, W T Ot is equal to one in the year 2002 and later, zero otherwise; X it is a vector of firm
characteristics, λi is a firm- and µt a year fixed effect.16 The inclusion of firm fixed effects means
that parameters are identified solely from within-firm variation. In this equation, β1 estimates the
impact of Chinese JV partner status on outcome yit in the pre-2002 period, while β2 measures the
change of the impact of JV partner status on yit as China entered the WTO.
       Results are shown in Table 8. The parameter estimate of β1 in column 1 indicates that Chinese
JV partner firms have about 9% higher TFP levels than otherwise similar Chinese firms. There is
no significant difference in pre-2002 patenting and new product ratio between JV partner firms
and non-partner firms, but as shown in Table A3 in the Appendix, Chinese JV partner firms have
on average about 11% higher sales and their export ratio is typically close to one percentage point
higher. These results point to technology leakage from the JV to the Chinese JV partner firm.
       Turning to the post-2002 period, the coefficient β2 is negative in the TFP specification (column
1). While this is consistent with less technology leakage, another explanation is that by the year
2002, non-JV partner firms have become more comparable to JV partner firms. This is what one
would expect if, in addition to technology leakage from JVs to Chinese JV partner firms, there
are positive productivity externalities from international JVs (as we will show in Section 4). In
contrast to these productivity results, Chinese JV partner firms increase their patenting relative to
non-partner firms in the post-2002 era (column 2).
       One concern is that this analysis has not incorporated other changes in the post-2002 era that
might have affected firm performance. For example, it is generally believed that privatization,
by providing hard budget constraints, typically increases firm productivity. One way to examine
whether this played some role is to allow for a time-varying effect of the government ownership
share (Govt. Share). We now provide results from specifications in which each of our main control
variables (rows 3 to 7, Table 8) is interacted with the W T O indicator. Table 9 presents the results.

   This analysis yields a number of findings. In particular, the productivity premium of privately-
owned firms has increased with China’s entry into the WTO (see the negative coefficient on the
interaction with Govt. Share in column 1. At the same time, receiving subsidies has a larger
impact on firm productivity in the WTO era than before. Our main interest lies in the impact of
JV partner firm status, and as far as this is concerned our findings are largely unchanged once the
additional WTO interaction variables are included (compare Tables 8 and 9). In particular, Chinese

                                                 24
firms that become partner to an international JV formation benefit in terms of productivity, though
less so in the post-2002 era, and firms see increases in their patenting due to JV partner firms in
the post-2002 era.
       Overall, our findings of substantial intergenerational technology transfer from the foreign
investor to the Chinese JV partner firm by way of the joint venture are robust to incorporating
reforms and other changes that took place around the year 2002.



4        Industry Spillovers from Joint Venture Formation

4.1        Horizontal Spillovers

       Joint Venture Firms This section examines whether the activity of joint venture firms
generates positive technology externalities for other firms in the same industry in China. In the
literature, such spillovers are referred to as horizontal spillovers. The variable JVjtH captures
horizontal spillovers in the industry j to which firm i belongs, defined following the literature as

                                                         PNjt
                                                          i=1   JVi × Salesit
                                             JVjtH   =     PNjt                 .
                                                                i   Salesit

That is, the horizontal JV spillover variable is the fraction of sales that is accounted for by joint
ventures in a given industry and year. This reflects the hypothesis that the higher is the share
of joint ventures in an industry, the higher is the potential for positive learning externalities,
for example through informal meetings of employees at local restaurants, exchanges at industry
association conferences, and other channels. Our econometric specification is given in equation (5):

                                                     h                  i
                       yit = α + β1 JVjtH + β2 JVjtH × W T Ot + X 0it γ + λi + µt + εit .            (5)


Coefficient β1 estimates horizontal JV spillovers in the years 1998–2001, while β2 presents evidence
on the change in these spillovers in China’s WTO era.17 The vector X it includes our main firm
control variables (rows 3 to 7 in Table 7), plus the JV partner firm indicator, PT. In addition
  17
       Horizontal and vertical (see below) spillovers are defined at the two-digit industry level.


                                                            25
to positive learning effects, joint ventures may also negatively affect other firms if joint ventures
increase the degree of competition in the industry (Bloom, Schankerman, and Van Reenen 2013).
These effects do not constitute externalities because they do not lead to a divergence of private
from social net benefits. If we estimate coefficients β1 or (β1 + β2 ) to be positive, it means that
negative competition effects are outweighed by positive learning externalities from joint ventures.
Table 10 shows the results.
   The coefficients on JV H indicate that joint ventures generate positive technological learning
for other firms in the industry as evidenced by higher productivity (column 1). In contrast, the
negative coefficient in column 2 is consistent with joint ventures greatly increasing the degree
of competition for new patents. However, the externality on patenting flips to a positive point
estimate after 2002, while horizontal productivity spillovers are significantly increasing with China’s
WTO entry.
   Generally, there is evidence for positive patent and productivity spillovers from joint ventures.
In comparison, the impact of joint ventures on the new product share of firms in the same industry
is comparatively small (column 3). Also note that the Partner (P Tit ) coefficient in this larger
sample is about 20 percent higher than in the matched sample of Table 8; this provides support
that the matching mitigates selection bias.
   The finding that productivity and patenting spillovers have become stronger is important. Why
are learning externalities from joint ventures increasing as China drops JV requirements, liberalizes
its FDI and trade regimes, and improves the protection of intellectual property rights? First of
all, the size of JV learning externalities and the degree of formal IPR protection are not the flip
sides of the same coin. Technological learning externalities that arise when JV employees interact
with workers from other firms in the same industry at restaurants or conferences are not the
same as formal IPR violations that could be litigated at the WTO. A second reason for larger JV
spillovers in the WTO era is that China has become more important as a location of technological
excellence compared to the pre-WTO era. To the extent that knowledge diffusion is facilitated by
agglomeration this will increase the scope of learning externalities.
   Third, between 1998 and 2007 Chinese firms have come closer to the world technology frontier



                                                  26
(recall results in Tables 7 and 8), and this has increased what Cohen and Levinthal (1990) refer
to as the firms’ absorptive capacity: Chinese firms have become increasingly able to benefit from
technological developments occuring within their industries, implying that a given level of technology
transfer associated with international JVs will translate into larger spillovers. Finally, by becoming
a member of a multilateral trade and investment agreement China has shifted expectations about
its future policies, tilting them towards “rules” rather than “discretion.” Put differently, WTO
membership serves as a credible commitment which has increased the incentives for foreign investors
to bring their most advanced technology to China.
       We have also explored which sectors contribute most strongly to the increase in horizontal
international JV spillovers with China’s WTO entry. While the post-WTO coefficient across all
industries is about 1.8 (column 1), industries where horizontal JV spillovers are higher include the
Special Purpose Machinery industry (CIC 36) as well as the Electronic Equipment and Machinery
industry (CIC 39), with point estimates of about 2.0 to 2.2. The share of joint ventures in
Special Purpose Machinery is about four percent, quite close to the sample average (see Table 5).
Total factor productivity growth in the industry from 1998 to 2007 was about five percent, which
is somewhat higher than the average across industries (about four percent). In the Electronic
Equipment and Machinery industry (CIC 39), joint ventures account for about 7.5 percent of sales,
and the sector’s TFP growth between 1998 and 2007 was close to the overall average across all
industries.
       While the two industries are not unusual in terms of JV presence and productivity growth,
they both account for a high share of all R&D in China. The Special Purpose Machinery sector
ranks among the top 5 of all sectors in China.18 For example, Xuzhou Construction Machinery
Group Co., Ltd. owns more than 2,000 patents and is generally recognized as a very innovative
firm in the world of construction machinery. The firm has joint ventures with American Fortune
500 companies such as Caterpillar as well as other industry leaders such as Switzerland’s Liebherr
Group and Germany’s Krupp AG. The Electronic Equipment and Machinery industry is ranked
3rd across all industries in terms of R&D investments. The industry includes, for example, Gree
  18
       Sectors defined at the two-digit level. Data from the ASIF panel for the years 2005 to 2007.




                                                          27
Electric Appliances, Inc. of Zhuhai, which is a broad industrial group that has established 72
research institutions and 727 advanced laboratories. Gree Electric has an international JV with
the Japanese multinational Daikin Industries, Ltd. Due to their high R&D spending, firms in these
two sectors should be positioned to benefit disproportionately from foreign technology due to their
relatively high absorptive capacity, and as a consequence, spillovers from international JVs are
relatively high.
   Turning to the economic significance of our findings, a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation
gives the following results. The mean of the variable JVH is 5 percent in 1997–2001, falling to an
average of 4 percent during the post-2002 subsample. The coefficients in the TFP equation (column
1) for the first and the second subperiod are roughly 1.08 and 1.85, respectively. This means that
horizontal JV spillovers account for over 5 percent of the increase in the firms’ average productivity
between 1998 to 2007. Thus, horizontal joint venture spillovers explain a sizable fraction of TFP
growth.

Chinese Joint Venture Partner Firms We now examine horizontal industry spillovers from
Chinese partner firms. The measure for horizontal spillovers from partner firms, P T _JVitH , is
defined analogously to that from joint ventures as

                                                  PNjt
                                                   i=1   P Tit × Salesit
                                 P T _JVjtH   =      PNjt                  .
                                                         i=1   Salesit

This measure is high when Chinese partner firms to international JVs are important in the industry.
Table 11 shows the results.
   Productivity spillovers to firms in the same industry are positive (Table 11, column 1). Thus,
not only is there evidence for technology leakage from the joint venture to its Chinese parent firm
but the latter also generates positive productivity externalities for other local firms. At the same
time, they tend to be smaller than those from the joint ventures themselves, consistent with partial
technology leakage from the joint venture firms. Partner firms are also relatively established and
large (see Table 4) which could mean a smaller marginal impact of the international technology
transfer.



                                                   28
     Further, productivity and patent spillovers are increasing with China’s entry into the WTO
(as seen in the coefficient on P T _JV H × W T O in Table 11). While there are some differences in
relative magnitudes, generally there is a striking similarity in how the patterns with WTO entry
change for spillovers from joint ventures on one hand and for spillovers from Chinese partner firms
on the other. This indicates not only that both are driven by the same process but it also provides
evidence that intergenerational spillovers—technology transferred from joint venture to its Chinese
parent—are substantial.


4.2     Vertical Spillovers from International Joint Ventures

     In addition to spillovers in the same industry we ask whether joint ventures have generated
learning externalities for firms in other industries (vertical spillovers). In the absence of information
on explicit firm-to-firm links we follow the standard approach and model these links using input-
output tables. Backward joint venture spillovers (to firm i) in industry j in year t are defined
as
                                         JVjtB =          αkj JVktH ,
                                                   X

                                                   k6=j

where αkj is the share of (non-final) output of industry j that is sold as an input to industry
k (as given in the input-output tables published by China’s National Bureau of Statistics). For
a given joint venture presence, JVjtH , these backward spillovers will be high when an industry’s
sales are biased towards industries in which joint ventures are important. The hypothesis is that
supplying firms receive feedback from joint venture firms about performance standards, leading-edge
procedures, and other knowledge to improve their processes and products (Iacovone, Javorcik,
Keller, and Tybout 2015 present analogous evidence for suppliers selling to Walmart).
     Analogous to the destination of sales, we consider forward spillovers, where joint ventures are
the origin of inter-industry input flows:


                                         JVjtF =          θjk JVktH ,
                                                   X

                                                   k6=j


where θjk is the share of intermediate inputs of industry j that is bought from industry k. This


                                                    29
forward spillover variable is high if an industry’s inputs comes disproportionately from industries
in which joint ventures account for a large fraction of sales.
   The following analysis focuses on total factor productivity. We estimate versions of the following
equation:

               h              i     h               i      h               i
 yit = α + β2 JVjtH × W T Ot + β3 JVjtB × W T Ot + β4 JVjtF × W T Ot + X 0it γ + λi + µt + εit . (6)


Table 12 shows the results.
   The first column of Table 12 reports again the horizontal joint venture productivity spillover
results from Table 10, column 1 for comparison. Next, backward spillovers turn from marginally
negative to strongly positive in the WTO era (column 2). There is thus evidence that upon WTO
entry Chinese firms receive productivity spillovers if they sell to industries with a strong joint
venture presence. Including all three spillover variables simultaneously confirms that backward
spillovers from joint ventures have increased with WTO entry (column 4). Horizontal spillovers are
positive and sizable but there is less evidence that they have increased with WTO entry. Note
that the insignificant estimates on forward spillovers in column 3 turn significant when all spillover
variables are included simultaneously. This suggests that correlation between the regressors plays
a strong role for the results in column 4, and the specifications of columns 1 to 3 should be given
more weight.
   One might be concerned that the specifications underlying Table 12 do not allow for changes
in China’s economy with WTO entry other than the magnitudes of horizontal and vertical JV
spillovers. To address this point we generalize the specification to flexibly allow for changes related
to a firm’s size and age, whether a firm is a recipient of subsidies, and whether it is state- or
substantially foreign-owned as China entered the WTO. Table 13 shows the results.

   The results indicate that WTO entry meant an increase in the productivity premium for
relatively large and young firms. Government ownership is associated with lower productivity

once China entered the WTO, while at the same time the importance of government subsidies for
raising productivity increases. Including these additional interactions does not qualitatively change
the results on productivity spillovers from joint ventures. For example, the WTO interaction
coefficient for horizontal spillovers in Table 13 is 0.76 (column 1), which is similar to the value
of 0.71 without the additional WTO interactions (column 1, Table 12). This indicates that the
joint venture spillover results are not driven by factors correlated with any of the five additional
interactions shown in Table 13. We will return to this point in Subsection 4.4.
   Turning to vertical patent spillovers from joint ventures, Table 14 shows results for backward
and forward joint venture spillovers in columns 2 and 3 (column 1 repeats the horizontal patent
spillover results from Table 10, column 2). We estimate positive backward spillovers on patenting
after China has entered the WTO (column 2), whereas the evidence for forward patent spillovers is
mixed (column 3).

   To summarize, we find evidence that China’s entry into the WTO has not only led to higher
productivity and patenting spillovers to firms in the same industry, but also to Chinese firms that
are supplying international joint ventures. Furthermore, there is little evidence that our findings
are driven by other changes that occurred around the year 2002.
   We have also examined the evidence for vertical spillovers from Chinese partner firms analogously
to vertical spillovers from the joint ventures themselves, finding not only an increase in backward
but also in forward spillovers as China entered the WTO. This could be explained by the fact that
partner firms tend to be larger and more likely to produce intermediate goods than joint venture
firms (who mostly produce final goods destined for the Chinese market), and as a consequence
forward spillover effects of partner firms are relatively strong. These results are shown in the
Appendix, Table A4.

   The following section presents results on spillovers from FDI into China that does not involve
international joint ventures.


4.3    Externalities from non-Joint Venture FDI

   By removing the JV requirement, China’s entry into the WTO has increased the flow of wholly
foreign-owned FDI into China. This section examines industry spillovers arising from such foreign
direct investment analogous to our analysis of international JVs above.
   The horizontal FDI spillover variable in industry j and year t is defined analogously to the
horizontal joint venture spillovers:

                                              PNjt
                                     H         i=1   W F OEit × Salesit
                                 F DIjt   =          PNjt                 ,
                                                       i    Salesit

where W F OEit is an indicator variable which is equal to one if firm i in year t is wholly foreign-
owned and not a joint venture. For simplicity we will refer to this variable as the horizontal FDI
spillover variable, even though international JVs are also a form of FDI. Table 15 shows the results.

       The results indicate that in the pre-WTO era horizontal FDI has a positive effect on productivity.
This result parallels our findings for horizontal JV productivity spillovers.19 However, with China’s
entry into the WTO, horizontal FDI productivity spillovers decrease to virtually zero, in contrast
to horizontal JV productivity spillovers which increased during the WTO era. As a consequence,
there is more evidence for strong within-industry learning effects from joint ventures than for
wholly foreign-owned FDI, especially once China had become a member of the WTO. It is also
possible that joint ventures create less market share rivalry than wholly foreign-owned enterprises;
with the available information this is not possible to rule out, although it is arguably less likely
  19
    The coefficient is larger than for horizontal JV spillovers above, which is related to the lower level of wholly
foreign-owned FDI for most of the sample period (see Table 5). If we define the FDI spillover variable based on
majority ownership, as FDI is defined in many other countries, the coefficient is more similar in size to the horizontal
JV spillover coefficient; see Table A6 in the Appendix.


                                                          35
than learning effects from joint ventures being relatively high.
   We have also constructed backward and forward spillover variables for wholly foreign-owned
FDI that are analogous to our vertical joint venture spillover variables. As before, we now limit
our analysis to productivity as the outcome variable. The results show a positive coefficient for
backward wholly foreign-owned FDI productivity spillovers in the pre-2002 era, which turns positive
once China has entered the WTO (column 2). This parallels our finding for backward productivity
spillovers from joint ventures (see Table 12). Forward productivity spillovers from FDI are not
important (column 3), which also matches our findings for JV spillovers. Note that we find the
same qualitative results—of positive horizontal and backward spillovers in the post-2002 era—for
majority-foreign owned as opposed to wholly foreign-owned FDI; this is shown in Appendix Section
B.3.
   The following Table 16 shows results for FDI spillover effects on patenting. Horizontal learning
effects are positive in the 1998–2001 period, however they decline with China’s entry into the WTO
(column 1), as do horizontal productivity spillovers from FDI. The evidence on forward spillovers
is mixed and at best marginally significant (column 3), while there are positive backward spillovers
on patenting, however, in contrast to backward productivity spillovers they do not increase with
China’s entry into the WTO (column 2).

   To summarize, we find only limited evidence for forward spillovers for either JVs or FDI.
Furthermore, China’s entry into the WTO has led to an increase in backward spillovers on
productivity in the case of FDI and on both productivity and patenting in the case of joint ventures.
This indicates that joint ventures and FDI have similar inter-industry spillover effects. However,
horizontal JV spillovers on productivity and patenting increase with China’s entrance into the
WTO, in contrast to the case of FDI where they decrease.


4.4    Additional Analyses

   Shift from JV to FDI Recall that during our sample period the composition of foreign
investment into China shifts from JVs towards wholly foreign-owned FDI because China dropped
JV requirements in its bid for WTO membership. One might be concerned that this shift might


                                                  37
play a role for our results, in particular that horizontal JV productivity spillovers increase while
horizontal FDI productivity spillovers decrease with China’s WTO entry. The following results
consider separately spillovers in industries characterized by high versus low growth of JVs (and
FDI) to shed light on this.

   On the left of Table 17 are horizontal JV productivity spillover results for two sets of industries,
those with below and above median JV growth over the period 1998 to 2007. Notice that while the
increase in JV spillovers is larger in those industries experiencing a relatively large increase in JVs
(column 2), spillovers also increase with WTO entry in industries in which the importance of JVs
grew relatively little (column 1). Similarly, there is evidence for lower horizontal FDI spillovers
on productivity for both sectors in which FDI is fast- and slow-growing, although the evidence is


                                                   38
stronger for the former (column 4). Overall, the results in Table 17 indicate that our horizontal
productivity spillover results are not driven by the shift from JV to FDI over time.

Industry-Specific versus Aggregate Effects So far we have studied the impact of China’s
liberalization of foreign investment by exploiting the timing of entry into the WTO. In this section
we will employ detailed industry information on which sectors experienced the most comprehensive
liberalization, versus sectors that were less strongly liberalized. The information comes from
the foreign investment Catalogue discussed in Section 2 above. Specifically, we have created an
indicator variable which is equal to one if a (two-digit) industry is above median in terms of the
liberalization of activities (going from prohibited to restricted, or from restricted to encouraged,
etc) to foreign investors. The following includes this industry variable interacted with the WTO
indicator as additional regressor to our horizontal and backward JV spillover variable. Table 18
presents the results.

   Our baseline horizontal JV productivity spillover results (from Table 10) are repeated in column
1 for comparison. The industry liberalization measure enters with a negative coefficient, while its
interaction with the WTO indicator enters with a positive coefficient (column 2). This indicates
that firms in industries that saw relatively comprehensive liberalization between 1998 and 2002
gain disproportionately in terms of productivity. At the same time, the impact of including
these variables on our JV spillover results is limited, with the Horizontal JV × WTO interaction
coefficient now estimated at 0.65 compared to 0.71 before. We find qualitatively the same results
in the case of backward JV productivity spillovers; see column 3 versus column 4. We have also
explored whether post-WTO entry JV spillovers are different in those industries that experienced
more, versus less deregulation, finding no significant evidence for it. Overall, these results suggest


                                                 40
that the dynamics of technological learning externalities are more closely related to the aggregate
rather than industry-specific changes in the FDI regime.

Other Changes: Privatization and WTO Tariff Commitments We have shown above that
our findings on JV industry spillovers are not driven by changes correlated with our main control
variables (firm size, age, foreign- and state-ownership share, and subsidization). This section
extends this analysis by accounting for major changes in China in the early 2000s. Specifically we
consider variation at the industry level in the speed of privatization of state-owned enterprises as
well as the tariff changes that China committed to undertake as part of its WTO accession. Table
19 shows the results.
   Columns 2 and 3 augment the specification for horizontal JV spillovers with an indicator for
high rates of privatization and tariff changes, respectively. While there is little evidence that
privatizations are related to the size of JV spillovers (column 2), accounting for differences in
WTO-mandated tariff changes increases the size of post-2002 JV spillovers somewhat (column 3).
Furthermore, the analogous analysis on the right side of the table shows that our FDI spillover
results are little changed by accounting for industry variation in privatization and tariff changes.
Overall, we find no evidence that our results are strongly affected by other changes taking place in
China’s economy during the early 2000s.


4.5    Discussion

   This section places our findings in the context of the existing literature. We begin with FDI
spillovers, on which there is a large body of work, before comparing results for FDI with those for
joint ventures where the existing evidence is comparatively thin.
   Generally, few studies find evidence for substantial positive FDI technological learning effects (see
Harrison and Rodríguez-Clare 2010, Keller 2010). For example, the bulk of horizontal productivity
effect estimates in Javorcik’s (2004) study of FDI spillovers in Lithuania are close to zero. At the
same time, Keller and Yeaple (2009), using unusually detailed FDI data for the United States, find
positive and economically large horizontal FDI spillovers on productivity. In the present case the
evidence is mixed: horizontal productivity spillovers are statistically and economically significant


                                                  41
in China’s pre-WTO era, but they are virtually zero once China has entered the WTO (Table 15,
column 1). Our result that the liberalization of China’s FDI regime has led to lower horizontal
FDI spillovers is in line with Lu, Tao, and Zhu (2017) who find that FDI in an industry lowers the
TFP of Chinese firms in the same industry.
       We do not find evidence for positive learning effects from forward FDI linkages, which is in
line with much of the literature.20 Studies find much more evidence for positive backward FDI
spillovers, where local firms benefit from disproportionately selling to foreign-owned multinational
affiliates. Our result that backward FDI spillovers increase dramatically and become significant is
consistent with this (Table 15, column 2).
       Turning to technological learning spillovers from joint ventures, we find evidence for both
positive horizontal and backward productivity spillovers. Furthermore, China’s entry into the
WTO has increased patenting through horizontal and backward JV spillovers. Comparing these
results with FDI spillovers, the evidence in this paper suggests that on balance joint ventures
generate larger positive learning effects. We interpret the difference between horizontal international
JV and FDI spillovers as evidence that market share competition is stronger for FDI than for
international JVs.
       The overall technological learning benefits from foreign investment in China are thus influenced
by two opposing forces. On the one hand the shift from JVs to FDI has reduced technological
learning, given our finding of stronger learning externalities through JVs than through FDI. On the
other hand, technology spillovers from JVs, and to a lesser extent from FDI, increased as China
became a member of the WTO. The net effect depends strongly on the characteristics of particular
industries, but it is quite possible that the liberalization of foreign investment into China has
increased technological learning externalities to Chinese firms.
  20
    For example, Javorcik (2004) estimates significant positive forward FDI spillovers in less than ten percent of her
key specifications (Table 7).

5     Conclusions

    International JVs comprise a major channel for FDI, particularly for multinationals that
establish operations in China. The effects of international JV formation are multifaceted, and we
delineate our analysis in several ways. Importantly, our empirical approach allows us to distinguish
the Chinese firm forming the joint venture from the newly set-up joint venture firm itself in a
comprehensive dataset of Chinese firms. We have investigated the attributes of firms, be it market
share, stock of technology, or regulatory expertise, that are conducive to being picked as Chinese
partners to foreign investors seeking to enter the Chinese market. Generally, foreign investors seek
out profitable, large, and highly productive firms, as well as firms that demonstrate high rates of
export participation and patenting. Firms that receive government subsidies—implicitly, those
firms with well-developed political connections—also tend to be more likely to be chosen as joint
venture partners. While the existing literature has explored such issues in partner choice, the fact
that we approach the question with a novel dataset in an econometric framework deepens our
understanding of the empirical determinants of selection.
    We then explore the effects that materialize subsequent to the creation of the joint venture, not
only on the joint venture itself but also on the domestic partner and other Chinese firms. The
firms created by international JVs appear to benefit from their foreign parentage, as evidenced
by their strong performance along multiple dimensions, including in their sales, productivity, and
innovation activities. While this is strong evidence for international technology transfer it cannot
be taken as the joint venture treatment effect, both because methodologically we do not observe
the counterfactual (because the joint venture is not observed before its creation) and because
conceptually, the amount of technology transferred is endogenously chosen by the foreign investor.
Further, we find evidence for the existence of indirect technology transfer, a phenomenon that we
characterize as the intergenerational technology transfer effect, whereby the domestic partners of
joint ventures themselves perform better after the inception of the joint venture.
    Turning to industry externalities, we show that joint venture firms—beneficiaries of advanced
foreign technology and know-how—generate positive externalities to domestic firms that operate in
the same industry (horizontal spillovers). Moreover, we find that Chinese firms that disproportion-


                                                 43
ately sell to international JVs experience increases in their productivity and patenting (backward
spillovers). Foreign technology diffuses beyond the confines of the joint venture, and the resulting
spillovers from joint ventures we find to be larger than those arising from other forms of FDI. The
Chinese partner firms in international JVs likewise generate positive spillovers when they operate
in the same industry, though this effect is more muted than that arising from the joint venture
firms themselves (which accords with our finding of the intergenerational technology transfer effect
being smaller than the direct internal effect).
   Ultimately, international JVs occupy an important role in the arena of foreign investment. Based
on our findings, the unique nature of such arrangements between domestic firms and foreign partners
generates far-reaching impacts manifest themselves both for the firms within the arrangements,
and for firms outside the joint venture. The literature on multinationals has expended significant
effort in quantifying the effects of FDI; however, the specific role of joint ventures has remained
underexplored. At a broad level, our results serve to inform our understanding of effective foreign
investment policy.
   As China has liberalized its foreign investment environment, encouraging the establishment
of WFOEs and opening more sectors to foreign entry, the ensuing reduction in the utilization of
joint ventures promises to impact the way in which knowledge is transmitted between firms. While
channels for learning and technology transfer might arise from WFOEs (perhaps via labor turnover,
intermediate input sourcing, or broader learning effects), the fact that domestic firms play no
direct role in this type of investment shuts down the potential international technology transfer
effects revealed in joint venture firms and the intergenerational effects accruing to partner firms.
Additionally, WFOEs are likely to be better equipped to safeguard their intellectual property and
proprietary technologies from being disseminated to domestic firms, dampening the innovation
externalities that we find evidence for, while potentially sapping market share from domestic
competitors—in other words, the move away from international JVs might amplify the negatives
and attenuate the positives arising from foreign investment.
   At the same time, we have shown that by becoming a member of the WTO China has amplified
technological learning externalities not only from international joint ventures but also from certain



                                                  44
forms of wholly-foreign owned FDI. A liberalized FDI regime may generate stronger technological
learning than FDI performance requirements and mandated technology transfer if the technology
transfer response to a rules-based system with lower uncertainty regarding future policy is strong
enough.
   Future work might further investigate the effects of the various modes of foreign investment,
particularly in light of the explosion in the number of WFOEs in China in recent years.

TFP Estimation

   We employ information in the ASIF database to estimate the total factor productivity (TFP)
of a firm. Ackerberg, Benkard, Berry, and Pakes (2007) discuss some of the major challenges to
TFP estimation. Furthermore, it is well-known that different methods of estimating TFP can be
more or less affected by the specific characteristics of the data (Van Biesebroeck 2007). In this
analysis we restrict our attention to semi-parametric estimators using control functions. In the
area of productivity estimation the groundbreaking contribution is Olley and Pakes (1996) (OP for
short), from which a number of additional influential approaches have followed (including that of
Wooldridge 2009). The following description focuses on the method of Olley and Pakes (1996). For
more information the interested reader should consult the original papers. To ensure robustness,
we have employed ten different TFP estimators using a control function approach and information
from the ASIF database; these results are summarized in Jiang, Keller, Qiu, and Ridley (2019).
   In the presence of selection bias and simultaneity, OP estimation allows for endogeneity between
firms’ input choices and the unobserved productivity differences among firms. Such estimation also
considers the exit of firms from the market; hence, this method has several advantages over OLS.
The OP method is characterized by a Bellman equation and assumes that the firm constantly
maximizes the expected discounted value of future profits; thus, stay-or-quit and investment
decisions are formulated in each time period. In the OP approach one uses investment as a proxy
for unobservable productivity shocks. A semi-parametric method is applied to control for both the
simultaneity caused by these unobserved shocks and non-random sample selection induced by the
differing exit probabilities for small and large low-productivity firms.
   We assume that output is produced with capital (K ), labor (L), and materials (M ) using a
Cobb-Douglas production function:


                                     Yit = F (Lit , Kit , Mit , Ωit ) .


The term Ωit is an unobserved firm-specific productivity shifter that will serve as the control

                                                    50
variable. Alternatively, we consider value added, given by


                                         Yit = F (Lit , Kit , Ωit ) .


The following exposition focuses for brevity on the OP approach using value added as the measure
of output.
   Taking logs and adding an error term we obtain


                                  yit = β0 + β1 lit + β2 kit + ωit + εit ,


where yit is the log of value added for firm i in period t, lit is the log of labor input by firm i in
year t (measured by the number of employees), kit is the log of the capital input by firm i in year t,
ωit is the productivity known by a firm when it makes its liquidation and investment decisions,
and εit is the error term. Both ωit and εit are unobservable to the econometrician; nonetheless, ωit
affects a firm’s input decision as a state variable in the firm’s decision whereas εit does not.
   Employing OP we assume that expected productivity is a function of current productivity
and capital, that is, E [ωit+1 |ωit , kit ]. ωit is assumed to follow a first-order Markov process. Given
these modeling assumptions, OLS estimation is biased for two reasons: first, the capital input is
correlated with productivity. When the firm’s manager observes a positive productivity shock she
will increase investment. Second, there is survival bias, because larger firms are less likely to exit
the market than smaller firms.
   We conduct our estimation process in three steps. In step one, assuming that investment of
firm i at time t (Iit ) is strictly positive, the relationship between productivity and investment (as
well as capital) can be inverted to back out the unobserved term ωit :


                                   ωit = I −1 (Iit , Kit ) = h (Iit , Kit ) .


Using this result, the production function can be rewritten as


                                     yit = β1 lit + Φ (iit , kit ) + εit ,

                                                      51
where Φ (iit , kit ) = β0 + β2 kit + h (iit , kit ). We approximate Φ (·) with a second-order polynomial
series in investment and capital. The partially linear equation described above can be estimated
by OLS, and the estimation of β1 is consistent because Φ (iit , kit ) controls for the unobserved
productivity. In the second step, we control for survival bias using a limited-dependent variable
regression, which can be used to estimate the capital elasticity, β2 . The probability of survival in
period t depends on the productivity in period t − 1, which is in turn dependent on the capital
and investment in period t − 1. The predicted probability of survival is denoted by P̂it . In the
third and final step, we estimate β2 using the following equation:

                                                                          
                          yit − β̂1 lit = β2 kit + g Φ̂t−1 − β2 kit−1 , P̂it + εit ,


where g (·) is approximated by a second-order polynomial in Φ̂t−1 − β2 kit−1 and P̂it , and βˆ1 is the
consistent estimate of the labor elasticity from step one.
   The measure of output in the ASIF is deflated by the producer price index for manufactured
products. We employ standard assumptions and the perpetual inventory method (PIM) to construct
measures of firms’ capital stocks. Specifically, the effective capital stock in production is measured
as a weighted sum of previous fixed asset investments in constant price term:

                                                        ∞
                                                        X
                                           RCSt =             dτ It−τ ,
                                                        t=0



where RCSt is real capital stock in year t, dτ is the efficiency of a fixed asset in the τ th year, and
It−τ is the fixed asset investment flow τ years ago. With the additional assumption that dτ declines
geometrically, i.e. dτ = (1 − δ)τ , the PIM equation can be written as


                                  RCSt = RCSt−1 + It − δRCSt−1 .


   We recursively calculate fixed asset growth at the two-digit SIC code level as a recursive step
back to the year when a firm was established. Investment deflators are obtained from the China
Urban Life and Price Yearbook (2009) published by China’s National Bureau of Statistics. The



                                                     52
year 1978 is chosen as the starting point of the initial capital stock for series calculation, and we
follow Brandt, Van Biesebroeck, and Zhang (2012) and Hsieh and Klenow (2009) who apply 9% as
the depreciation rate to calculate the TFP of Chinese firms. The assumed depreciation rate is a
chain-linked price deflator calculated by Brandt, Rawski, and Sutton (2008) based on separate
price indices for equipment, machinery, and buildings/structures as well as the shares of these
items in fixed assets, as reported by the National Bureau of Statistics.
   Using this approach at the two-digit industry level, we find average labor shares in value added
ranging from 0.43 (CIC 25) to 0.78 (CIC 14), and capital shares in value added ranging from
0.27 (CIC 24) to 0.54 (CIC 15). The assumption of constant returns to scale can typically not
be rejected. Comparing TFP based on gross output with those based on value added we found
the former to yield more plausible firm-level estimates. This confirms similar findings based on
the ASIF by Orr, Trefler, and Yu (2018). Consequently, both the Olley and Pakes (1996) and
Wooldridge (2009) based TFP estimates employed in this paper are calculated based on gross
output.

   The following presents details on the change in FDI restrictiveness based on the number of
activities that are (i) Encouraged, (ii) Restricted, and (iii) Prohibited at the level of two-digit
industries, based on China’s Catalogue for Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries. We focus
on the change between 1998 and 2002 as opposed to a later year because the 2002 changes were
specified as conditions for China’s entry into the WTO, and as a consequence, they are more
plausibly exogenous.

2002 revisions. Mean Change calculates the average change in the number of activities that were liberalized from
one revision to another—either added to the list of Encouraged activities or removed from the list of Restricted or
Prohibited activities. High ∆ FDI Openness indicates an above-median industry with regard to its average change in
the number of liberalized activities.


    The last column of the table indicates which of the two-digit industries experienced a relatively
strong degree of FDI liberalization based on a count of individual activities.

B.2 Industry Spillovers from Chinese Partner Firms

   We have shown in the main text that firms that are selected to become the Chinese partner
to an international JV generate productivity spillovers to firms in the same industry (horizontal
spillovers), especially after China entered the WTO. Here we examine the evidence for backward and
forward spillovers generated by these Chinese partner firms. The variables are defined analogously
to the vertical joint venture spillover variables in the text as


                                   P T _JVjtB =           αkj P T _JVktH

for forward spillovers generated by Chinese partner firms.
   Table A4 provides evidence on spillovers by these firms on the productivity of other firms.

   Column 1 of Table A4 shows again the earlier results from above (Table 11, column 1). The
results indicate that backward productivity spillovers from Chinese partner firms have become
more strongly positive in the WTO era. This is interesting because many of these firms are
well-established and larger, as we have seen above, so the result indicates that the increase in
backward spillovers is not limited to relatively recently established joint ventures. Column 3 shows
that there are also sizable positive forward productivity spillovers from Chinese partner firms in
period following China’s WTO accession.
   Overall, while productivity spillovers from Chinese international JV partner firms are generally
lower than from the joint ventures themselves, just as with the latter we find evidence for a
significant increase in spillovers from Chinese partner firms to other Chinese firms as China entered
the WTO. One difference is that in the case of Chinese partner firms there is more evidence for


                                                   59
positive forward spillovers in the post-2002 era than for joint ventures.
   The next set of results examine industry externalities generated by Chinese JV partner firms
on the patenting of other firms; see Table A5.

   The results indicate that not only horizontal and backward patenting spillovers increased after
China’s entry into the WTO but there is also evidence for positive forward patent spillovers.
This mirrors the productivity spillover results above. The relatively strong evidence on forward
spillovers may be due to the fact that Chinese partner firms are relatively large and diversified, thus
increasing the likelihood that they provide improved intermediate inputs to other firms compared
to the joint ventures themselves.

B.3 Majority Foreign-Owned FDI Spillovers

   This section shows that if we define FDI spillovers based on majority foreign ownership (as
FDI is defined in some countries, such as the United States), instead of full foreign ownership as in
the text, the results are quite similar.
