               BUSINESS CYCLES AND THE EXCHANGE RATE SYSTEM:

   This paper investigates empirically the differences in time—series

behavior of key economic aggregates under alternative exchange rate systems.

We use a postwar sample of 49 countries to compare the behavior of output.

consumption, trade flows, government consumption spending, and real exchange

rates under alternative exchange rate systems (pegged, floating, and systens

such as the EMS). We then examine evidence from tvo particular episodes,

involving Canada and Ireland, of changes in the exchange rate system. Aside

from greater variability of real exchange rates under flexible than under

pegged nominal exchange rate systems, we find little evidence of systenatic

differences in the behavior of other macroeconomic aggregates or

international trade flows under alternative exchange rate systems. These

results are of interest because a large class of theoretical models implies

that the nominal exchange rate system has important effects on a number of

macroeconomic quantities.

   This paper investigates the manner in which the statistical character of

business cycles depends on a country1s choice of exchange rate system. We

have two objectives in this paper. First, we wish to determine how the

choice of exchange rate system affects the character of economic

fluctuations. Second, we seek to develop a set of facts about the character

of international business cycles that can help guide subsequent international

evidence on output, consumption, trade flows, and real exchage rates and we

compare the behavior of these series under the Bretton Woods pegged exchange

rate system with that under the (limited) floating rate system that has

prevailed since 1973. Then we examine particular episodes in which a country

changed its exchange rate system at a time other than 1971—73.

    The study of business cycles and their international transmission is one

of the oldest topics in economics; the first detailed statistical analyses of

business cycles were undertaken in the 1920s by the National Bureau of

Economic Research under the leadership of Wesley Clair Mitchell. Eschewing

traditional statistical methodology, Mitchell and his collaborators developed

new methods for summarizing business cycle phenomena. They found that the

empirical regularities of economic fluctuations lay not in the length of

cycle or its amplitude, but rather in the patterns of comovement and relative

amplitude of economic variables.

    Mitchell investigated the international correlation of business cycles in

his book Business Cycles: The Problem and Its Setting (1927).      Me concluded

that business cycles are positively correlated across countries and

especially countries with highly developed economies, and particularly those

with well developed financial markets. He also found that business cycles

were becoming more highly correlated across countries over time and he

attributed this result to the growth in international financial linkages.
 Jskar Morgenstern (1959) carried out detailed analyses       of   international

 business cycles, focusing specifically on financial markets, and raised the

 question of whether the international character and transmission of cycles

 depended on the exchange rate system. At that time, experiences with

 alternative exchange rate systems were considerably more limited than now,

 with data from the 1970s and 1980s available.

     More recently1 the neoclassical approach to studying business cycles was

 motivated   by the perspective that "business cycles are all alike" ,1 Lucas states
 that There    is. so far as I know,   no need to qualify these observations
 [about   cycles] by restricting them to particular countries or time periods:

 they appear to be regularities common to all decentralized market economies."2

 Explaining these patterns of co—movement and relative amplitude has become

 the chief aim of neoclassical business cycle theory. Neoclassical business

 cycle research has also sought to improve on the methods of Mitchell and his

 collaborators, by using formal statistical procedures, so that "results are

 replicatable and criticizable at a level at which Mitchell's are not." Lucas

 (1951, p.236, ff. 4). Development of statistical procedures and stylized

 facts has led naturally to efforts to develop quantitatively restricted

 models that can reproduce the observed covariation of economic aggregates.3

    In   this paper, we follow the original NEER strategy of describing the

character of cycles while abstaining from imposition of a specific

theoretical structure, but we employ modern time series methods.

Specifically, the paper asks whether, from a statistical point of view, it

makes sense to consider the fixed and flexible—rate systems as a single unit

when processing the data for comparison with theoretical models. Many

theories of the international transmission of shocks (real shocks or shocks

due to monetary policy) have the implication that the transmission process

depends critically on the exchange rate system in place. An empirical

implicat ion of these theories is that—holding constant the sources of

exogenous shocks and their stochastic processes—the variances and

covariances of economic aggregates will depend on the exchange rate system.

While some attention has been paid to the empirical relations between the

variability of real exchange rates and the exchange rate system,4 we know of

no systematic empirical studies of the relationship between the exchange rate

systen and other macroeconomic variables. This paper, and a related paper by

Baxter (1988) are intended to fill this gap.

    The paper proceeds as follows. Section II uses data from twenty—three

OECD countries and twenty—one non—OECD countries to exanine whether the

statistical behavior of economic aggregates differs systematically across

exchange rate systems. We ask, first, whether pre—1973

behavior—corresponding    roughly to a period of pegged exchange rates—differs
from post—1973 behavior—corresponding to a period of floating rates, albeit
with some government intervention. Second, we ask whether countries on fixed




 4See, for example, Stockman (1983) and Mussa (1987).
                                                                                  6




consumption and industrial production. Third, we examine the cross—regime

volatility of real exports, imports, and the real exchange rate. The sample

of countries includes the previously—analyzed OECD countries together with

about twenty additional countries, most of which are LDC's. Because the

post—1973 sample includes countries on both fixed and flexible rates, we can

potentially separate effects due to a nation's exchange rate system from a

"post—1973   effect" due to other changes in the   world economy.   Finally, we
turn   to the question of government behavior under alternative exchange rate

systems. We examine the variability and cross—country correlation of

government consuinpt ion expenditures.

    We consider three common detrending procedures, though we do not always

report results with all three procedures except where those results differ

substantially. The three procedures are (i) taking differences (growth

rates), (ii) removing deterministic linear trends, and (iii) using the

Hodrick—Frescott (1980) filter. Figure 1 plots the squared gain (transfer

function) for these filters against frequency. For time—series with positive

serial correlation (as in our data) most of the power is at the lowest

frequencies. The differencing filter permits the smallest proportion of low

frequency components to pass through, with the HP filter transferring more,

and the linear trend filter transferring the most. For highly autocorrelated

series the power is concentrated at the low frequencies where the

differencing filter and HP filter are wery similar, and results using that

filter are not reported here.



Industrial Production

    Table 1 and Figures 2 and 3 give the standard deviation of detrended

industrial production for fourteen OECD countries and the correlation of
                                                                             7




these countries' industrial production with that of the U.S. Two detrending

methods are used: a single linear trend and differencing. For the question

of whether volatility has changed, the two filters give the same answer:

volatility has generally increased. In the post—1973 period, about

three—quarters of the countries experienced an increase in the volatility of

industrial production. The increase was as likely to occur in previously

high volatility countries as in low volatility countries.

    Figures 4 and 5 plot the correlations of industrial production in each

country with that of the U.S., and yield somewhat different conclusions

depending on the detrending nethod. With a linear trend removed, at appears

that there is no significant change in the average correlation with the U.S.:

the countries plot about equally on either side of the 45 degree line.

    For the differenced data, however, there is a marked tendency for this

ccrrelation to fall in the post—1973 period; only Japan and Greece

experienced an increase in correlation with the U.S. (and the Japanese result

may be due to that country's recent lowering of barriers to trade.) thus it

appears that the general decrease in cross—country correlation in industrial

production has taken place in the relatively higher frequencies emphasized by

the differencing filter.7

    Figure 6 shows the average quarterly growth rates for the fixed and

flexible rate periods; this graph shows clearly the effect of the "slowdown"

of the 1970's and 1930's—every country's growth rate is lower in this

period.




    7lhis issue could be addressed directly by estimating the cross—country
correlations at distinct frequency bands, using techniques developed by Engle
(i974).
                                                                               10




    Finally, the average growth rates of consumption in the fixed and

flexible rate periods mirror the earlier results for industrial production:

there is a marked slowdown in the post—1973 period.

   Tables 3 and 4 show the cross—correlations of consumption with industrial

production for the single linear trend filter and the differencing filter.

As with the U.S. data, the zero—order correlation is higher for the

linearly—detrended data. However, the level of this correlation varies

widely among the eight countries in the sample: for the fixed rate system

and the linear trend filter this correlation ranges from a high of .989 for

Japan to a low of .348 for France. A similarly wide range is observed for

the differenced data. Comparing the fixed and flexible rate systems, a

general increase in correlatedness in the flexible rate period is observed

between consumption and industrial production for both detrending methods.

For linearly detrended data, six of the eight countries experienced increases

in correlatedness, while for the differenced data, seven of the eight

experienced increases- Further, in the case of the linearly detrended data,

the correlation between consumption and lagged output seems more persistent

in the flexible rate period: large correlation coefficients are found in

many countries   as far back as   seven lags (almost two years).

    These   results   reinforce the emerging picture of the post—1973 period as a

period in which cyclic movements are more country—specific than in the

previous, fixed—rate period. As mentioned earlier, this is surprising in

view of the world—wide oil shocks of the 1970's. It is also surprising since

the flexible—rate period has been characterized by dramatic increases in the

openness and liquidity of international financial markets. Yet the
                                                                              11




within—country correlation of consumption and output has actually risen

during this period for most of the countries examined.

    While differences in national policies may help explain the decline in

cross—country correlatedness in output, it does not explain the increase in

the correlation between cyclic movements in consumption and changes in

output. To the extent that cyclic movements in national output are temporary

and in particular because cross—country correlation of output has decreased

(so that the world interest rate should not be highly correlated with a

single country's output). one would expect a decreased correlation of

within—country consumption and output. Yet we find exactly the opposite.



ports. inports, and the real exchanre rate

    We turn next to analysis of exports, imports, and the real exchange rate.

The thanple of OECD countries is expanded to include about twenty other

countries, many of then LDC's. Table 5 catalogues exchange rate systems by

country and by year. Of the 49 countries in the post—1973 sample period, 14

were fixed to the dollar throughout, IT floated throughout, 7 are members of

the ENS, and 11 had some other arrangement or changed the exchange rate

system several times. Prior to 1973, all countries were on primarily fixed

rates (although two. Canada and Korea, floated for short periods in the

pre—1973 period).




9Scme countries which actively intervened in the market for their currency are
nonetheless included in the "floating rate" group. All countries manage
their exchange rates to some degree, so the division between "floating" and
"adjustable peg' is, to a large extent, arbitrary. We have chosen to
classify countries according to their stated policies, as reported to the
International Monetary Fund.
                                                                               14




fixed to the dollar until 1981, Somalia, fixed until the end of 1982, and

Mexico and Israel, which have floated with some intervention throughout).

    Thus for the CECD countries, there is some evidence that membership in

the ENS is associated with lower volatility of imports and exports. Of

course, whether this is due to the exchange rate system or other factors such

as EEC trade policy is an open question.

    For the non—DECO countries, there does not seen to be any strong

 oorrelation between the choice of post—1973 exchange rate system and the

volatility of imports and exports during that period. Countries choosing to

remain fixed to the dollar seem somewhat more likely to experience increased

trade volatility than countries choosing to allow their exchange rate to

 float, This is surprising since real exchange rates have become more

 volatile in the post—1973 period, and the real exchange rate volatility is

 commonly thought to be associated with floating rate systems. We therefore

 turn next to an investigation of real exchange rate volatility, and its

 relationship to the exchange rate system and volatility in real exports and

 imports.

     Table 9 displays F—statistics for the hypothesis of no significant change

 in the volatility of the real exchange rate between the f.ixed and flexible

 rate periods. A country's real exchange rate is calculated as P/eP* where P

 is the country's consumer price index, Pt is the CPI for the United States,

 and e is the country's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. Four countries

 experienced significant decreases in real exchange rate variability in the

 post—1973 period: India, Yugoslavia, and the Philippines, which were on

 floating exchange rates; and Liberia, which was fixed to the dollar,

     By contrast, thirty of the forty—four countries for which data are

:available experienced significant increases in real exchange rate variability
in the post—1973 period. Surprisingly, of the four OECD countries which

escaped an increase in real exchange rate variability, none is a member of

the ENS. Of the seven non—OECD countries with no significant change in real

exchange rate variability, four were on primarily fixed rates in the

post—1973 period (Ecuador, which floated only in 1983. El Salvador, Haiti,

and Honduras) and two were on floating rates (Israel and Tunisia).

    Table 10 contains t—tests for the hypothesis of no change in the growth

rate of the terms of trade pre—and pcst—1973   Only two countries show

significant changes, both decreases: El Salvador and Guatemala. Both

countries were fixed to the dollar for most of the post—1973 period.

    Thus, the post—1973 period is one characterized by general increases in

volatility of cour.tries'. real exchange rates; this corroborates findings by

Mussa (1986) and sany others. Countries on fixed rates (or cooperative

schemes like the EMS) appear as likely as those with pure floats or other,

intermediate regimes to experience these increases in volatility, though

Stockman (1973) provides evidence that the magnitude of the increase in

volatility is larger for floating rate countries. Of the thirty countries

with significant increases in real exchange rate variability, only ten had

increases in export and/or import volatility. Of the seven non—DECO

countries with no increase in real exchange rate variability, two had

significant increases in real trade volatility. Thus, about one—third of the

countries experienced significant increases in volatility of exports or

imports, but this proportion does not seem to be related either to the

exchange rate system or to an increase in real exchange rate variability.

    Tables 11 and 12 summarize our findings on the relationship between the

volatility of real trade activity, volatility of the real exchange rate, and

the exchange rate system. (These tables only include countries for which
data were available both for real trade activity and the real exchange rate.)

The most striking fact about these two tables is that changes in real trade

variability and real eichange rate variability appear to be independent of

each other. Further, changes in trade variability and real exchange rate

variability appear to be independent of the exchange rate system. The only

notable difference is that QECD members appear slightly less likely than

non—GECD members to have increases in real trade variability.



Government Consumption

    It is possible that the exchange rate system affects the response of

macroeconomic and international trade aggregates to external disturbances.

but that governnents altered their macroeconomic policies in just the right

way so as to eliminate the systematic differences in macroeconomic

performance, acroms exchange rate systems, that we have sought to uncover.

There have been clear differences in some government policies over the

periods we have associated with pegged and floating exchange rates. The

differences across exchange rate systems in the behavior of nominal variables

such as monetary aggregates and nominal price levels has been studied

elsewhere (see, e.g. Darby and Lothian, 1988). We examined the behavior of•

annual real government consumption (as reported by the OECD, and deflated by

consumer price indexes) for 22 of our countries, over the periods 1960—72 and

1973—85. Table 13 shows the standard deviations of the growth rates of real

government consuaptiom in the pegged exchange rate period (SDPEG), the

floating rate period (SDFLT), and the difference between these two (SDDIF).

In 16 of the 22 countries, the standard deviation fell in the floating rate

period. The average fall, excluding the two largest changes (France and
                                                                              17




Denmark), was 0067, which is a fall of about 1/4 from the mean under pegged

rates of .026.

   Table 14 reports, and Figure 7 graphs, a dramatic change across these

periods in the average correlation between the growth rate of real government

consumption in each country with the growth rates of real government

consumption in the other 22 countries. Growth rates in real government

consumption became much more highly correlated across countries in the

flexible exchange rate period. The average correlation in the pegged—rate

period was .04, while the average correlation in the floating rate period was

.30, and, except for Switzerland, each country showed a positive average

correlation (and the average correlation rose for every country except

Switzerland). Whether this change in the cross—country correlation of the

government consumption growth rates had little effect on the! macroeconomic

aggregates we have studied, or whether it had effects that helped offset the

effects of the change in exchange rate system, is an inportant question for

future research. Greater correlation across countries in government

consumption spending would seem unable to account, however, for our earlier

finding that business fluctuations seem to have become more nation—specific.

If anything, our results on government consumption magnify the problem.



III. Two Episodes of Chanze in the Exchange Rate System

    This section studies two episodes of change in the exchange rate system

that did not occur in the 1971—73 period. These two episodes are Ci) the

switch in the currency to which Ireland pegged its currency from the U.K.

before 1979, and Germany (via the ENS) after 1979, and (ii) the Canadian

float against the U.S. dollar from 1951—62, which began again in 1970.
Ire land

       Ireland pegged its currency to the British pound until        January   1979. when

it   joined   the joint float of continental currencies that became the European

Monetary System in March 1979.'° After January 1979, the Irish pound floated

with respect to the British pound but was effectively tied, within EMS

limits,    to the German mark. Figure 8 shows the nominal exchange rate between

Ireland and     Britain   from 196G through i988, and   the   real exchange rate

calculated as the exchange—rate—adjusted ratio of consumer price indexes in

the two countries. (Using alternative price indexes has virtually no impact

on the results.) The real and nominal exchange rates behave similarly.

especially after 1979. and the variability of the real exchange rate is much

greater when the two currencies float against each other. Figure 9 shows the

real   and nominal exchange rates between between Ireland and Germany. Again,
the real and nominal exchange rates tend to mirror each other, but the
relationship is less strong in the post—1979 period when Ireland was pegging
to Germany.
     Table 15 shows the standard deviation of the real exchange rate (in
levels)    of Ireland vs. the U.K. and vs. Germany. The post—1973 period as a

whole is characterized by much higher volatility of real exchange rate.

     The precise conclusions one draws about changes in real exchange rate

variability depend on the filter used. Because the proper siode]. for the real

exchange rate is subject to controversy, we report results for several

alternatives. Looking at levels of real exchange rates or using data with

linear trends removed, the standard deviation for Ireland vs. the U.K. is




    '°Mussa (1986) uses this episode as evidence on the relationship between
the exchange rate system and the variability of the real exchange rate.
                                                                               19




higher   than that for Ireland vs. Germany for   every time period. With the

difference filter, only during the period 1973—78 during which Ireland

floated against Germany is this reversed. With levels or a single time trend

removed, the standard deviation for the Irish—U.K. case did not rise much in

the 1973—78 period with a bilateral peg, though it rose more substantially if

the differencing filter or separate time trends are employed. For the

Ireland—U.K. case, the floating rate period of 1979—88 is characterized by

much greater volatility than during earlier periods. Using levels or data

filtered by a single time trend, the Irish—German real exchange rate actually

shows greater variability after 1979, when Ireland joined the EMS, than

during the floating rate period from 1973—78. This conclusion, though, is

reversed if the differencing filter is used-

    Figure 10 shows quarterly growth rates of the real exchange rates between

Ireland   and Germany (the solid line) and between Ireland and the U.K. (the
dashed line.) The growth rate of the real exchange rate of Ireland against

both countries is more volatile in the post—1973 period. Within the period

from 1973—1979, when Ireland was pegging to the U.K., the real exchange

grovth rate for Ireland vs. the U.K. is less volatile than that computed for

Ireland vs. Germany. In the post—1979 period, when Ireland was effectively

pegged to Germany, the ordering is reversed: the volatility of Ireland vs.

Germany is smaller than for Ireland vs. the U.K. Thus, volatility in the

real exchange rate is clearly linked to exchange rate regime.

    A natural next question is whether the increased volatility in the real

exchange rate is mirrored in other real quantities. Table 16 gives the

standard deviation of Ireland's real exports and imports for linearly

detrended and log—differencéd data. For the differenced data, the volatility
                                                                                20




of real imports and exports appears to be the same in all time periods       For

the linearly detrended data, the flexible—rate period is characterized by

increased volatility in both imports and exports, with the post—1979 period

being characterized by a large increase in volatility, especially in imports

This mirrors the post—1979 increase in volatility of the real exchange rates

discussed above     But when a single linear trend is removed, real exchange

rate volatility appears to increase post—1979 for Ireland against ilfl

Germany and the U.K.    .   These results casts doubt on the hypothesis that the

increases in real exchange rate volatility and trade volatility (in the

detrended    case) in the post—1979 period were a result of the switch in the
exchange    rate system. However, this conclusion (as discussed above) depends

critically on the filter used for the real exchange rate.

    Continuing with the line of investigation pursued in earlier sections, we

investigate the cross—country variation and correlatedness of industrial

production. Many theoretical models predict that the exchange rate system

affects the macroeconomic effects of various government policies. The

Mundell—Flening model, for example, predicts different effects of government

policies under pegged and floating exchange rate systems. Many of these

maodels can be formulated to predict that the exchange rate system between

two nations affects the relative behavior of real output in those nations,

unless government policies are altered in very special ways to precisely

offset   the effects of the change in the exchange rate system. We proceed now
to examine the relative behavior of real output in pairs of coutnries that
have changed exchange rate systems, to determine whether there is any
associated change in relative output growth rat!s. A finding that there was

no structural change in the process determining relative levels of real

output does not necessarily imply that the exchange rate system is irrelevant
for relative output, because it is possible that government policies were

adjusted precisely so as to offset the effects of the exchange rate system on

real output. Although a more complete model of the output effects of various

policies and a description of their changes when the exchange rate system

changes would be required to examine this issue, the data analysis we conduct

in this paper is of interest because it places restrictions on the effects of

the exchange rate system, the output effects of government policies, and the

changes in policies across exchange rate systems. Table 17 gives standard

deviations of industrial production and cross—country correlations by

subperiod, for linearly—detrended and log— differenced data. The standard

deviations of industrial production for the three countries seem roughly

equal and do not seem to vary over the three subperiods studied. This result

is independent of the detrending method. The correlation between the

industrial production measures for Ireland and Germany are higher than the

correlation between Ireland and the li-K. for every time period and for both

detrending methods. Further, when Ireland switched from pegging against the

U.K. to pegging against Germany, the correlation between Irish imdustrial

production and U.K. industrial production actually xs (more dramatically

for linearly detrended data), while the correlations between Ireland and

Germany remained essentially unchanged.

    To investigate this further, we examine the difference between the growth

rates of industrial production in Ireland and im Germany, demoted y(I,G). It

can be well represented by a second—order autoregressive process with

seasonal dummies over the initial period of pegged exchange rates, 19611

through 19721V,
         y(I,G,t) = —.05    —   .18 y(I,G,t—1) —.38 y(I.G,t2)              (1)

(where seasonal dummy variables were also included in the estimated

equation). This equation is stable over the 1961—72 period. The residuals

show no signs of autocorrelation; the chi—square statistic for testing the

hypothesis that the first four autocorrelation coefficients of the residuals

are zero is 4,14, which is well below the critical value of the chi—square

statistic with four degrees of freedom at the 10 percent level. Similarly,

the residuals show no signs of heteroscedasticity, and chi—square tests

indicate the absence of ARCH effects, for any number of lags in the ARCH

specification, at the 10 percent level. There is, however, indication that

the disturbances are not Gaussian because of excess kurtosis. The same

coefficient estimates, to two decimal places, are obtained if the difference

in growth rates of output is replaced with the difference in deviations of

the log of output from linear trends, because the two filters give measures

of relative output that have a simple correlation coefficient of .9999.

While linear detrending, rather than taking growth rates, affects the time

series properties of output in each country alone, relative output in the two

countries is virtually unaffected by which of these filters is employed.

    When the equation abowe is estimated over the longer period 19611 through

19781V, which includes both the initial pegged exchange rate period and the

period during which the Irish pound and British pound were pegged to each

other but were jointly floating against the Deutschmark, the results are

(also with seasonal dummies included)

and a chi—square test for the hypothesis that the six coefficients are

identical across the sample periods 19601—721V and i9731—TBIV yields a test

statistic of 6.17, which is well below the critical value of the chi—square

statistic with six degrees of freedom at the 10 percent level. Equation (2)

passes other specification tests as well: there is no indication of

heteroscedasticity, and a chi—square test based on the third and fourth

moments of the distribution of residuals yields a statistic of 3.30, which is

below the 10 percent critical value of the chi—square statistic with two

degrees of freedom. Tests for higher—order autocorrelation of residuals also

indicate absence of serial correlation in the residuals. In summary.

equation (2) gives a statistical representation of relative real output

growth rates (or deviations from trend) in Ireland and Germany that is stable

over the time period from 1960 to the end of 1978, wihch includes periods

with   both exchange rate systems.
    However, when the equation is estimated over the entire period
19601—851V, the estimated coefficients change substantially, and a    chi—square
test   for the hypothesis that the six coefficients are identical over the

periods 19601—781V and 19791—851V yields a statistic of 22.53, which is above

the critical value of the chi—square with six degrees of freedom even at the

 .001 level. There is, as a consequence, evidence of a structural shift in

the time series process describing relative output in Ireland and Germany

around the time when Ireland joined the ENS with     limited exchange rate
                                                                                24




flexibility against Germany. Whether this shift is an effect of the change

in exchange rate system, a cause of its change, or unconnected with the

exchange rate system cannot be determined from this work. However, we can

investigate issues of timing by studying when the break in the relative

output process occurred. For a given sample, consider a test of the

hypothesis that the next observation is generated by the sane process as the

preceeding observations, which is a Chow test with the second subperiod

consisting of a single observation. Consider a sequence of these test

statistics. Figure 11 shows a graph of this sequence, normalized so that the

5 percent critical value can be represented as a constant. The structural

breaks in the relative output process appear to ocour jgr the change in the

exchange rate system, and the change in the structure is dominated by

observations after 199411. Similarly, a sequence of Chow test statistics,

each for testing the hypothesis that all of the remaining observations

through 19861V are drawn from the same process that generated the previous

observations, reaches a peak in i98411. Consequently, although there is

evidence of a structural break in the process describing relative real output

in Ireland and Germany, the evidence suggests that this break occurred around

1984, and so was probably unconnected with the change in the exchange rate

system in the first quarter of 1979. This conclusion is also consistent with

the   evidence indicating the absence of a structural change in the process
around 1973,   when   the first change in the exchange rate system occurred.
      Now turn to the difference between quarterly growth rates of industrial

production in Ireland and Great Britain, denoted y(1,GB). The time series

representation of this series shows clear signs of structural change during

the period 19621—19851V. For the subperiod with pegged exchange rates before

i973, y(I,GB) can be well represented by the process

       There is substantial evidence of a break in the statistical process

describing the relative output growth rate in Ireland and Great Britain.

Figure 12 shows a plot of the log likelihood assuming that there is a single

break in the process, with models of the form (3a) prior to the break and

(3d)    after   the break. The figure provides some evidence that a break in the

process occurred about two years before the change in the exchange rate

systeio. The peak of the likelihood function occurs in the fourth quarter of

1976. A test of the hypothesis that a break occurred in 19761V yeilds an F

statistic of 2.931, which exceeds the critical value of the F distribution

with 6 and 90 degrees of freedom at the .02 level. Then the relative output

growth rate is described by the models

The estimated res2duals from equations (4a) and (4b)            show no signs   of

autocorrelation or heteroscedasticity, and the equations show no signs of

parameter instability when estimated recursively. One interpretation of

these results is that scme changes occurred around 1976 that altered the real

economic connections between Ireland and Britain, that these changes show up

as a break in the statistical process describing relative output growth in

the two countries, and that these changes contributed to the decision by

Ireland to abandon the pegged exchange rate with Great Britain.



    Canada

    The Canadian float from 1951 to 1962 provides another "experiment" with

floating exchange rates aside from the post—1973 float. Stockman (1983) and

Mussa (1986) have used this episode to help distinguish the changes in real

exchange rate variability that coincide with a change in the exchange rate

system from the effects of other disturbances around and after 1973. The

Canadian dollar resumed its float against the US dollar in the first quarter

of 1970. If models in which the exchange rate system plays an important role

are correct, we should expect to find changes in the behavior of trade and

macroeconomic variables in Canada at both of these dates. The change in the

Canadian trade balance (in Canadian dollars) is shown in Figure 13, and the
                                                                                  26




change   divided   by the level of Canadian exports is shown in Figure 14. There

is little evidence of changes in the variability of the trade balance at

times when the exchange rate system changed. While the periods prior to 1962

and   after   1970 may be characterized by a different variance of the change in

the trade balance, the relation is not monotonic. This is, tbere is no

evidence of similarity between the first and second floating—rate periods in

this series. There is little evidence to support the hypothesis that changes

over time in the variability of the trade balance are due to changes in the

exchange rate system.

      These two case studies reinforce the results from the earlier sections.

The volatility of the real exchange rate is higher under flexible rates than

under fixed rates, as the Irish case clearly shows. But the behavior of real

aggregates such as industrial production and trade flows do not appear to

change as a result of a change in the exchange rate system.



VI. Conclusions

      There is evidence that business cycles have become more nation—specific

and less worldwide since 1973. Real exchange rates have become more

volatile. Some other series, such as some trade series and industrial

production, have also become more volatile in the latter period, though the

magnitude of the increase is much smaller. Real government consumption

spending has become more highly correlated across countries. But —        aside
from real exchange rates —     there   is little indication that these changes are

related to the choice of exchange rate system. Evidence from the Irish and

Canadian episodes suggest little connection between the exchange rate system

and   changes in the stochastic properties of economic aggregates. A large
class of theoretical models implies that       the exchange rate system has
important effects on a number of macroeconomic quantities; however, we have

found little evidence of quantities for which the exchange rate system is an

important   determinant.
