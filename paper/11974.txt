                                              ABSTRACT

This paper examines how different asset allocation strategies over the course of a worker's career
affect the distribution of retirement wealth and the expected utility of wealth at retirement. It
considers both rules that allocate a constant portfolio fraction to various assets at all ages, as well
as "lifecycle" rules that vary the mix of portfolio assets as the worker ages. The analysis simulates
retirement wealth using asset returns that are drawn from the historical return distribution. The
results suggest that the distribution of retirement wealth associated with typical lifecycle investment
strategies is similar to that from age-invariant asset allocation strategies that set the equity share of
the portfolio equal to the average equity share in the lifecycle strategies. There is substantial variation
across workers with different characteristics in the expected utility from following different asset
allocation strategies. The expected utility associated with different 401(k) asset allocation strategies,
and the ranking of these strategies, is very sensitive to three parameters: the expected return on
corporate stock, the worker's relative risk aversion, and the amount of non-401(k) wealth that the
worker will have available at retirement. At modest levels of risk aversion, or in the presence of
substantial non-401(k) wealth at retirement, the historical pattern of stock and bond returns implies
that the expected utility of an all-stock investment allocation rule is greater than that from any of the
more conservative strategies. Higher risk aversion or lower expected returns on stocks raise the
expected utility of following lifecycle strategies or other strategies that reduce equity exposure
throughout the lifetime.

        The growing importance of defined contribution pension arrangements, such as 401(k) plans,

is shifting the responsibility for managing retirement assets from the professional money managers

who oversee defined benefit plan investments to individual participants in defined contribution plans.

Retirement savers face the challenge of deciding how to allocate their retirement portfolios across

broad asset classes and across many different financial products. Asset allocation decisions have

important consequences for retirement wealth accumulation. Some policy analysts have voiced

concerns that individual participants in defined contribution plans may not fully understand the risks

associated with various investment options, and that they may consequently be exposed to greater

risks of retirement income shortfall in defined contribution plans than in defined benefit plans.

        Quantifying the risk associated with defined contribution pension plans, and examining how

individual choices affect this risk, is an active topic of research. Samwick and Skinner (2004)

compare the risks associated with defined benefit and defined contribution plans for workers with a set

of stylized wage and employment trajectories. Many other studies have examined the risk of different

investment strategies in the context of lifetime saving programs that resemble defined contribution

plans. Campbell and Viceira (2002) and Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout (2005) explore the optimal

asset allocation between stocks and bonds for lifecycle savers. Shiller (2005) tabulates the distribution

of possible terminal wealth values when investors follow age-dependent asset allocation rules in a

saving program that he models on a defined contribution Social Security system. Poterba, Rauh,

Venti, and Wise (2005), hereafter PRVW (2005), examine how different portfolio allocation strategies

over the lifecycle affect retirement wealth.

        Previous findings about the level of retirement wealth associated with defined contribution

saving programs, and about the risk of such wealth, are very sensitive to assumptions about the

expected return on corporate stock. Stocks have offered substantially higher average returns than

bonds over the eighty year sample that is often used to calibrate the return distributions. PRVW

(2005) find that this has an important effect on the distribution of retirement wealth for alternative

asset allocation rules. Greater exposure to stocks leads to a higher average retirement account balance.
                                                     2

For a risk neutral retirement saver facing the historical return distribution, and choosing a fraction

between zero and one hundred percent of her portfolio to allocate to stocks, this suggests that

allocating the entire portfolio to stocks is optimal. As the risk aversion of a retirement saver increases,

the optimal share of the retirement portfolio that is held in stocks declines.

        Many commentators have raised questions about whether defined contribution plan

participants are informed enough to make decisions about asset allocation and other dimensions of

their retirement saving plan. Some plan sponsors have begun to offer participants investment options

that permit them to avoid investment decision-making. One such innovation in the financial services

marketplace is the “lifecycle fund” that automatically varies the share of the saver’s portfolio that is

held in stocks and in bonds as a function of the saver’s age or years until retirement. These funds are

one of the most rapidly growing financial products of the last decade. They offer investors the

opportunity to exploit time-varying investment rules, typically reducing equity exposure as retirement

approaches, without the need to make active investment management choices. In this paper, we

consider the effect of such lifecycle investment strategies on the distribution of retirement wealth.

        This paper extends previous research in two directions. First, we consider both the

distribution of retirement assets and the expected utility of reaching retirement with a given asset

stock. In contrast, a number of earlier studies focus only on the distribution of account balances,

which does not capture the potential cost of an investment strategy with a high mean retirement

balance but a small probability of a very poor outcome. We parameterize a utility-of-retirement

wealth function as a power function of retirement wealth, and recognize that wealth held outside the

saver’s defined contribution plan can have an important effect on utility at retirement. Second, we use

actual Social Security earnings histories to model household contribution flows to defined contribution

plans. Several earlier studies have used simple stochastic processes to model labor income flows, or

have assumed that labor income follows a stylized path over the lifecycle. Our results better capture

the wide degree of heterogeneity in household earnings experiences.

        The paper is divided into five sections. The first summarizes theoretical research on the

optimal pattern of age-related asset allocation. It then describes the lifecycle funds that have become

increasingly popular in the retirement plan market. Section two describes the algorithm that we use to

simulate the distribution of retirement plan assets under different asset allocation rules during the

accumulation period. This discussion draws heavily on PRVW (2005). Section three describes our

strategy for calibrating the simulation model, for selecting the sample of households for analysis, and

for assigning distributions of returns to each of the assets in our study. The fourth section presents the

various lifecycle asset allocation rules that we consider, including some that involve age-independent

asset allocation rules. It then reports our central findings about the distribution of retirement account

balances under these different rules as well as the expected lifetime utility at retirement under various

rules. There is a brief conclusion.



1. Optimal Age-Dependent Asset Allocation Rules and the Rise of Lifecycle Funds

        Financial economists have a long tradition of studying how a rational, risk-averse, long-lived

consumer would choose to allocate her portfolio between risky and riskless assets at different ages.

Samuelson (1969), one of the first formal analyses, challenges the conventional wisdom that an

investor with a long horizon should invest a larger fraction of her portfolio in risky assets because she

has an opportunity to average returns over a longer period. This result is related to the earlier, more

general observation by Samuelson (1963) that taking repeated identical uncorrelated risks augments

the risk of the final outcome, rather than reducing it. In the context of the lifecycle portfolio selection

problem, when returns on the risky asset are serially uncorrelated and there is no labor income, a

rational investor should hold the same fraction of her portfolio in risky assets at all ages. This

analytical result runs counter to the suggestion of many financial advisors, who suggest that investors

reduce their equity exposure as they approach retirement. Merton (1969) derives similar results in the

context of a lifetime dynamic optimization framework.
                                                    4

        Perhaps in part because this result is inconsistent with much financial practice, subsequent

research has tried to uncover reasons why an investor might choose to reduce her equity exposure as

she ages. Bodie, Merton, and Samuelson (1988) argue that younger investors have greater flexibility

in their subsequent labor supply decisions, and that they should consequently be more tolerant of risk.

They suggest that younger investors may rationally choose to hold a higher fraction of their portfolio

in stock than older investors. Gollier (2001) and Gollier and Zeckhauser (2002) derive the conditions

under which the option to rebalance a portfolio in the future affects portfolio choice. Their results

suggest that under specific assumptions about the structure of utility functions, the optimal portfolio

share devoted to equity will decline with age. Campbell et al. (2001), and Campbell and Viceira

(2002) develop numerical solutions to dynamic models which can be used to study optimal portfolio

structure over the lifecycle if shocks to labor income follow specific stochastic processes and investors

have power utility. Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout (2005) solve such a model in the presence of non-

tradable labor income and borrowing constraints. They find that a lifecycle investment strategy that

reduces the household’s equity exposure as it ages may be optimal depending on the shape of the labor

income profile.

        The empirical evidence on age-specific patterns in household asset allocation suggests at best

weak reductions in equity exposure as households age. Gomes and Michaelides (2005) survey recent

research on the correspondence between theoretical models of lifecycle asset allocation and empirical

evidence on actual investment patterns. Ameriks and Zeldes (2004) and Poterba and Samwick (2001)

present empirical evidence on how portfolio shares for stocks, bonds, and other assets vary over the

lifecycle. The general conclusion is that equity shares decline very little at older ages, although

Ameriks and Zeldes (2004) find some evidence that some households cash out their equity holdings

when they reach retirement or annuitize their accumulated holdings in defined contribution accounts.

        To cater to the perceived desire of investors to reduce their equity exposure as they age, and to

help investors overcome the problems of inertia in retirement asset allocation that are documented by

Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988), several financial institutions have created lifecycle funds. These
                                                    5

funds are usually designed for an investor with a target retirement date. Lifecycle funds were

available from Fidelity Investments as early as 1988, and there were at least 250 target-year lifecycle

funds in the mutual fund marketplace in 2005. Several major mutual fund families now offer a

sequence of different funds targeted to investors with different retirement dates. In some cases the

lifecycle fund is a “fund of funds” that invests in a mix of other mutual funds, while in other cases the

fund manager holds a specific pool of assets and alters the asset mix as the fund ages.

        Figure 1 shows the rapid growth in lifecycle fund assets during the last eleven years. The

figure indicates that lifecycle funds held $5.5 billion in March 2000, and that their assets had grown to

$47.1 billion by 2005. Many of these funds are offered in 401(k) plans. Marquez (2005) reports that

Hewitt Associates estimates that 38% of all 401(k) plans offer lifecycle funds. At a time when

Clements (2005) reports that the proliferation of investment options 401(k) plans has come under fire,

lifecycle funds offer a way to combine both stock and fixed income options into a single fund, and to

offer investors a time-varying asset allocation mix. Lifecycle funds are sometimes suggested as a

natural choice for the default investment option in automatic enrollment 401(k) programs.

        The lifecycle funds offered at different fund families follow different age-phased asset

allocation rules. Table 1 reports summary information on the lifecycle funds offered at leading mutual

fund companies, which we define as the set of mutual fund companies tracked by Morningstar. The

table shows the average mix of stocks and bonds currently held by funds targeting different retirement

years. None of the funds publish the specific asset allocation rule that they will follow going forward

as retirement dates draw nearer, but many fund prospectuses indicate the mix of various asset

categories that will be held for an investor at specific ages. We have interpolated between ages, when

necessary, to estimate the asset mix at a standardized set of ages.

        The table also shows the net asset holdings and weighted average expense ratios of funds with

different retirement years. The expenses paid by investors in these funds, which typically range

between 60 and 80 basis points per year, are substantially larger than what could be paid if an investor

selected mutual funds from a company offering no-load index funds with low expense ratios and then
                                                    6

rebalanced among them over time. For example, equity index funds, government bond index funds

and money market mutual funds can be obtained from Fidelity or Vanguard with no load fees and

expense ratios of 10 to 20 basis points. However, if investors find it difficult to conduct such

rebalancing on their own, or suffer from psychological biases that would lead them to neglect planned

rebalancing, they might be willing to pay the additional expenses associated with target-year lifecycle

funds in which the rebalancing happens automatically. A careful analysis of the expenses associated

with lifecycle funds and of the services provided by these funds lies beyond the current study.



2. Modeling Retirement Wealth Accumulation in Self-Directed Retirement Plans

        To analyze the distribution of 401(k) wealth at retirement that is induced by different asset

allocation strategies, we need to model the path of plan contributions over an individual’s working life

and to combine these contributions with information on the potential returns to holding 401(k) assets

in different investment vehicles. Rather than using information on household earnings patterns to

estimate a stochastic model for the earnings process, and then using that model to simulate earnings

paths for our analysis, we draw actual lifetime earnings histories from a large sample of households

and carry out simulations by combining the contribution paths for various earnings histories with

simulated patterns of asset returns. We focus our analysis on married couples because they are

financially more homogeneous than non-married individuals, some of whom never married and others

of whom have lost a spouse. About seventy percent of the individuals reaching retirement age are in

married couples.

        We assume that nine percent of the household’s earnings are contributed to a defined

contribution plan each year. We further assume that the couple begins to participate in a 401(k) plan

when the husband is 28, and that they contribute in every year in which the household has Social

Security earnings until the husband is 63. Households do not make contributions when they are

unemployed or when both members of the couple are retired or otherwise not in the labor force. We
                                                        7

assume that both members of the household retire when the husband is 63 if they have not done so

already, and that they do not contribute to a retirement plan after that age.

        To formalize our calculations, we denote a household by subscript i, and denote their 401(k)

contribution at age a by Ci(a) = .09*Ei(a) for Ei(a) the household’s Social Security covered earnings at

age a. The restriction to covered earnings is an important limitation that we discuss further below.

We express this contribution in year 2000 dollars. To find the 401(k) balance for the couple at age 63

(a = 63), we need to cumulate contributions over the course of the working life, with appropriate

allowance for asset returns. Let Ri(a) denote the return earned on 401(k) assets that were held at the

beginning of the year when the husband in couple i attained age a . The value of the couple’s 401(k)

assets when the husband is 63 is then given by:

                                          35      t
(1)                           Wi (63) =
                                          t =0
                                                 ∏ [1 + R (63 − j )] C (63 − t )
                                                 j =0
                                                            i          i




Ri(a) depends on the year-specific returns on stocks and bonds, and on the mix of stocks and bonds

that the household owned when the husband was a years old. If the couple holds an all-stock portfolio,

then Ri(a) = Rstock(a). If the couple holds all bonds, Ri(a) = Rbond(a). A mixture of the two is of course

possible. If the couple invests in a lifecycle mutual fund, the asset return at age a will be Rlifecycle(a),

which corresponds to the return on the mix of bonds and stocks that will be held by the lifecycle fund

on behalf of an investor of age a.

        We use simulation methods to estimate the distribution of Wi(63), averaged over the

households in our sample, for various asset allocation strategies. By comparing the distributions of

retirement plan assets under each of these strategies, we can learn how these strategies affect

retirement resources. The distribution of outcomes is of substantial interest, but it does not capture the

household’s valuation of different levels of retirement resources. In particular, while it can provide

information on the potential frequency of low wealth outcomes, it does not provide a metric for

comparing these outcomes with more favorable retirement wealth values.
                                                                   8

        To allow for differential valuation of wealth in different states of nature, we evaluate the

wealth in the 401(k) account using a utility-of-terminal wealth approach. We assume that all

households have identical preferences over wealth at retirement. We drop the household subscript i,

and assume that the utility of wealth is described by a constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility

function

                                                                       W 1−α
(2)                                                 U (W ) =
                                                                       1−α

where α is the household’s coefficient of relative risk aversion. The utility of household wealth at

retirement is likely to depend on both 401(k) and non-401(k) wealth, so we modify (2) to recognize

this wealth:


                                                                (W                 + Wnon −401( k ) )
                                                                                                    1−α
                                                                        401( k )
(3)                         U (W401( k ) , Wnon − 401( k )   )=
                                                                                    1−α



Since the effect of a change in 401(k) wealth on household utility is sensitive to the household’s other

wealth holdings, we consider other assets on the household balance sheet in our empirical analysis.

        For a given household, each return history, denoted by h, generates a level of 401(k) wealth at

age 63, W401(k),h, and a corresponding utility level, U h , where


                                                (W                                     )
                                                                                        1−α
                                                     401( k ), h   + Wnon − 401( k )
(4)                                     Uh    =
                                                                   1−α



We evaluate the expected utility of each portfolio strategy by the probability-weighted average of the

utility outcomes associated with that strategy. These utility levels can be compared directly for a

given degree of risk tolerance, and they can be translated into certainty equivalent wealth levels (Z) by

asking what certain wealth level would provide a utility level equal to the expected utility of the
                                                        9

retirement wealth distribution. The certainty equivalent of an all-equity portfolio, for example,

denoted by the subscript SP500, is given by:

                                                                 1
(5)                            Z SP 500 = [ EU SP 500 (1 − α ) ]1−α − Wnon −401( k )



When a household has non-401(k) wealth, the certainty equivalent of the 401(k) wealth is the amount

of 401(k) wealth that is needed, in addition to the non-401(k) wealth, to achieve a given utility level.

We treat non-401(k) wealth as nonstochastic throughout our analysis.

        Our approach to computing DC plan balances at retirement resembles a strategy developed in

Samwick and Skinner (2004). Part of their empirical analysis considers the pension benefits that a

sample of workers would earn under several stylized defined benefit and defined contribution plans. It

considers the benefits experience of a sample of actual workers, with actual earnings histories, under

each plan. It does not, however, explore the sensitivity of retirement wealth to alternative investment

strategies.

        Our approach exploits the rich cross-sectional variation in household earnings trajectories.

We use a large sample of Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) households to compute contribution

paths for a 401(k) plan, and we then randomly assign return histories to these contribution paths. The

result is a distribution of retirement balances for each household in the HRS sample. We combine the

wealth outcomes by aggregating households into three broad educational categories to report our

findings, but each entry in the table below represents an average over the outcomes for many

individuals. Our strategy can be thought of as drawing an HRS household at age 27 and giving it two

independent draws: first a wage trajectory, which could be the actual wage trajectory for any of our

sample households who have a particular education level, and then a lifetime vector of asset returns,

which could be any of 200,000 draws. The return trajectory will determine the household’s retirement

wealth, conditional on the contribution flow.

        One of the most important shortcomings of our analysis is our restriction to top-coded Social

Security earnings records, rather than actual earnings histories. The real value of the taxable

maximum earnings level for Social Security has varied over time, and so has the dispersion of

earnings, so the fraction of earnings that are not captured on Social Security records varies from year

to year. Higher income workers have a higher likelihood of contributing to 401(k) plans, and they

tend to contribute a higher share of earnings when they contribute, so the top-coding constraint is

likely to bias our findings toward understating defined contribution plan accumulations. This is likely

to be a particularly important concern when we present results for college-educated households, whose

members’ earnings are more likely to exceed the Social Security maximum than are the earnings from

households with lower levels of education. There are several potential strategies for addressing top-

coding problems such as those in the Social Security earnings records, and we hope to pursue them in

future research.



3. Calibration of 401(k) Wealth Simulations

        We select a subsample of married HRS households for analysis, construct their earnings

trajectories, and measure their non-401(k) wealth at retirement. We then simulate retirement wealth

based on these households’ Social Security earnings records. Our sample of households is larger than

that in PRVW (2005). We include all HRS couples headed by men aged 63-72 in 2000 for which

Social Security earnings histories are available. Table 2 shows the effects of conditioning the sample

on married couples in this age range. There are 3,833 HRS households with Social Security earnings

histories. The restriction to couples eliminates approximately 44 percent of that sample, and the age

restriction removes an additional 19 percent, leaving a sample of 1,400 households. The age

restriction removes couples with heads between the ages of 59 and 62. Including this group would

involve forecasting earnings beyond the time period of the data.

        Our data restrictions make our sub-sample different from the HRS universe. This can be seen

by comparing household earnings trajectories for the full HRS sample and our subsample, which we
                                                   11

do in Figures 2 through 4. Figure 2 shows earnings histories for all of the households in the HRS with

earnings records. Figure 3 shows earnings histories for couples in which the husband is aged 59-72,

which represents essentially all couples in the HRS. Figure 3 shows earnings histories for our primary

sample of 1,400 married households headed by men aged 63-72. In each figure, the sample is divided

by educational attainment of the husband. Husbands are generally the primary earners in HRS

households.

        Two findings emerge from these figures. First, since we are focusing on couples, the total

level of household earnings is higher than in the broad HRS universe for all educational levels.

Second, the premium for the primary earner’s education is smaller at all age ranges, but particularly in

the early part of the earners’ lifetime, in our sample relative to the entire HRS population. This

reduction in the education premium is primarily a function of our restriction to couples. Since the

education levels of members of a married couple are not perfectly correlated, by focusing on couples

we pool, to some extent, individuals with different levels of educational attainment.

        We consider our sample households as reaching retirement age when the husband is 63 or 64

years old, and we need to determine non-401(k) wealth at this age. Our procedure for doing this varies

according to the household’s age. First, we consider wealth measurement for the nearly three-quarters

of the sample with a household head who was either 63 or 64 in 1996, 1998 or 2000. For these

households, a breakdown of non-pension wealth is available on a consistent basis in HRS waves 3, 4,

and 5. We scale all household non-401(k) asset values to the 2000 base year, so that for each

household we have an estimate of what their non-401(k) wealth would have been had they turned age

63-64 in the year 2000. We implement this scaling by replacing the nominal returns on asset holdings

for the two years prior to the year in which the head of household was 63 or 64, i.e. 1994-1995 for the

1996 households and 1996-1997 for the 1998 households, with nominal returns on assets in 1998 and

1999. We focus on returns in three broad categories of non-annuitized wealth: financial wealth,

housing equity, and other wealth. Returns on housing equity are approximated by the growth rate of

the Commerce Department’s constant quality house price index. Financial wealth, both within and
                                                    12

outside of retirement accounts, is assumed to grow at a composite rate based on the national average

allocation of tax-deferred financial assets between stocks, bonds, and deposits, as reported in the 2001

Survey of Consumer Finances. Other household wealth, which consists largely of jewelry and

vehicles, is assumed to grow with the overall price level, as measured by the CPI.

        Second, we consider wealth measurement for the one-quarter of the sample that reached the

ages of 63 or 64 prior to 1996. We do not use the earlier waves of the HRS because the wealth

questionnaire for waves 1 and 2 was different from that for later waves. Wealth values for these HRS

households are imputed for each asset class based on the median measured asset growth for

households between the ages of 63 and 65, or 63 and 67, in the same educational category in later

waves of the HRS.

        To estimate defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution (DC) pension wealth for HRS

households we use HRS pension wealth imputations, version 1.0, March 2005. This new research

component of the HRS allows for more precise estimation of pension wealth than was previously

possible, since it estimates imputed defined contribution wealth at all ages. For defined benefit wealth

at age 63-64 we use the imputed present discounted value of pension wealth assuming retirement at

age 62 and gross up by one year at the intermediate-scenario Social Security Administration rate of

3%. For Social Security wealth (SSW) we follow the procedure from PRVW (2005), using cohort

mortality tables and the Social Security Administration’s intermediate-cost scenario discount rates to

calculate the present discounted value of the current or projected Social Security benefits when the

husband is age 63-64. We normalize the value of the wife’s Social Security to be the value when the

husband is aged 63-64, assuming that Social Security payments start for the wife at age 62 if they have

not started already. The present value of Social Security is determined as a joint survivor annuity.

        Table 3 presents summary statistics on our estimates of household balance sheets normalized

to age 63-64. We report seven categories of wealth: the present discounted value (PDV) of Social

Security payments, the PDV of defined benefit pensions, the PDV of other annuities, the current value

of retirement accounts, the value of all other financial wealth net of debt, housing equity net of debt,
                                                   13

and all other wealth. The top panel in Table 3 shows medians while the bottom panel shows means.

The restriction to couples clearly raises the mean and median of the distribution. The restriction to

households in the age range 63-72, with full earnings histories to age 63, lowers the wealth distribution

somewhat by removing a group that has not yet begun to spend down their assets. The final sample of

couples aged 63-72 has median wealth of $536,800 and mean wealth of $783,400. The median high-

school educated household has 44 percent more total wealth than the median household with less than

a high-school education, and the median college educated household has 61 percent more total wealth

than the median high-school educated household. The differences in means are even more dramatic.

        Table 3 also shows the distribution of several wealth aggregates. One such aggregate is

annuitized wealth, which is defined as the sum of the present discounted values of Social Security,

defined benefit pensions, and other annuities. We also present the sum of annuitized wealth and all

other financial wealth, as well as aggregates reflecting all wealth and all wealth excluding retirement

account assets. When we calibrate our simulations with households’ non-401(k) wealth, we focus on

two wealth components: annuitized wealth and all wealth excluding retirement account assets. We do

not include retirement account assets in the calibration of non-401(k) wealth, since these emerge from

our simulation. By using the observed values of these wealth components from the HRS, and treating

them as non-random when we evaluate the expected utility of 401(k) retirement balances, we are

implicitly assuming that changes in 401(k) wealth values do not affect other components of wealth.

We hope to eventually extend our analysis to allow for correlation between the returns on assets in

401(k) accounts and the returns on other household assets.

        Table 4 disaggregates the household balance sheet aggregates by education level. The table

underscores the substantial differences across households both within education categories and across

such categories. The difference at most percentiles between the wealth of a household that did not

complete high school and one that completed college is a factor of two. These differences are of the

same magnitude as the differences between the 20th and 60th percentiles of the distribution for a given

education level. The 80th percentile of the distribution for all three education levels that we consider
                                                    14

has wealth holdings that are at close to three times as great as those of households in the 20th percentile

for the same education level.

        One difficult problem in constructing the non-401(k) wealth measure that enters equation (5)

concerns the role of housing equity. Venti and Wise (2001) and other studies suggest that retired

households do not typically draw down their housing wealth to finance non-housing consumption.

This implies that we should consider only financial resources as a source of wealth to support

retirement spending, a strategy that could be justified by assuming that the utility from housing

consumption is additively separable from all other consumption in the household’s utility function,

and that owner occupied housing generates only housing consumption. The difficulty with this

approach is that it is possible that households view their housing equity as a reserve asset that can be

tapped to support other consumption in the event of financial difficulty. In this case, housing equity

should be combined with financial assets in calculating the household’s assets outside defined

contribution plans. To allow for this possibility, we present results in which we consider housing as

well as other financial assets as the household’s non-401(k) wealth at retirement. We treat the non-

401(k) components of the household balance sheet at retirement as non-stochastic, and use whatever

value we calculate for the household in all of the simulations with various 401(k) balances.

        We assume that the three primary assets that households may hold in their 401(k) accounts are

corporate stock, nominal long-term government bonds, and inflation-indexed long-term bonds (TIPS).

Calibrating the returns on these investment alternatives is a critical step in our simulation algorithm.

We assume that 401(k) investors hold corporate stocks through portfolios of large capitalization U.S.

stocks. We do not address the possibility of poorly diversified portfolios, for example with

concentrated holdings in a single stock, as described in Munnell and Sunden (2004) and Poterba

(2003). We assume that the distribution of returns on each of these asset classes is given by Ibbotson

Associates’ (2003) empirical distribution of returns during the 1926 to 2002 period. Large

capitalization U.S. equities have an annual average real return of 9.0 percent and a standard deviation
                                                    15

of 20.7 percent, whereas long-term U.S. government bonds have an annual average real return of 3.2

percent and a standard deviation of 10.0 percent.

        We assume that TIPS offer a certain real return of 2 percent per year, approximately the

current TIPS yield. Index bonds deliver a net-of-inflation certain return only if the investor holds the

bonds to maturity, and selling the bonds before maturity exposes the investors to asset price risk. We

nevertheless treat these bonds as riskless long-term investment vehicles. In our simulations, when we

draw returns from the stock and bond return distributions for a given iteration, we draw returns for the

same year from both distributions. This preserves the historical contemporary correlation structure

between stock and bond returns in our simulations.

        Several analysts suggest that recent historical equity returns may correspond to a particularly

favorable time period, and that these returns should not be extrapolated to the future. The academic

literature on the equity premium puzzle, summarized for example in Mehra and Prescott (2002), raises

the possibility that ex post returns exceeded ex ante expected returns over this period. To allow for

such a possibility, we perform some simulations in which the distribution of returns from which we

draw is the actual distribution except that equity returns are reduced by 300 basis points in each year.

Comparing these simulations with those in our baseline indicate the sensitivity of our findings to the

future pattern of equity returns.

        For each iteration of our simulation algorithm, we draw a sequence of 35 real stock and bond

returns from the empirical return distribution. The draws are done with replacement and we assume

that there is no serial correlation in returns. We then use this return sequence to calculate the real

value of each household’s retirement account balance at age 63 under the different asset allocation

strategies. For each of the 1,400 households in our sample, we simulate their 401(k) balance at age 63

200,000 times. We then summarize these 200,000 outcomes either with a distribution of wealth values

at retirement, or by calculating the expected utility associated with this distribution of outcomes. We

found in PRVW (2005) that roughly this number of iterations was needed to obtain robust findings,

particularly at lower percentiles of the retirement wealth distribution.

4. Discussion of Results

        We simulate nine different asset allocation strategies for the household’s 401(k) account. The

first three involve investing in only one asset: (i) a portfolio that is fully invested in TIPS; (ii) a

portfolio that is fully invested in long-term government bonds, and (iii) a portfolio that is fully

invested in corporate stock. The next two portfolios are “heuristic portfolios” that use simple rules for

lifecycle asset allocation. Portfolio (iv) holds (110 – age of household head) percent of the portfolio in

stock, with the remaining balance in TIPS. Portfolio (v) is similar to (iv) except that nominal

government bonds replace TIPS for the component of the portfolio that is not held in equity. Both of

these portfolios are rebalanced at the end of each period. The next two are lifecycle portfolios

consisting of stocks and TIPS, and stocks and government bonds, respectively. The equity weight for

each of these funds is computed based on the average of the age-specific allocations in the lifecycle

funds at Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, TIAA-CREF, Principal, Barclays, and Wells Fargo. The

lifecycle funds from these fund families are weighted equally in this calculation, and the resulting

equity allocation is similar to that in Table 1. Portfolio (vi) invests the lifecycle fund average in

equities and the balance in TIPS, while fund (vii) holds equities and nominal government bonds in the

lifecycle mix. The next strategy that we consider, portfolio (viii), holds an age-independent mix of

stocks and nominal government bonds. The equity share for this fund is 53 percent, which is the

lifetime weighted average stock allocation in the lifecycle funds, where the weight assigned to the

equity allocation in each year equals the household’s 401(k) wealth at the beginning of that year,

divided by the sum of beginning-of-year 401(k) wealth in all years.

        The final investment strategy we consider, strategy (ix), is the “No Lose” strategy that

Feldstein (2005) proposes in his analysis of individual account Social Security reforms. At each age,

we calculate the share of the household’s 401(k) contribution that would have to be invested in TIPS

to guarantee at least the contributed amount in nominal terms at retirement age. The required TIPS

investment is (1+RTIPS)–(63-a), where 63-a is the number of years to retirement. This strategy is
                                                    17

fundamentally different from the other lifecycle strategies because it does not involve portfolio

rebalancing at each age. Instead, the equity share of the portfolio depends on the historical pattern of

TIPS yields, which in turn determine the amount available for stock investment in past years, and on

the historical returns on equity assets.

4.1 The Distribution of Retirement Wealth

        Table 5 shows the distribution of 401(k) balances in thousands of year 2000 dollars averaged

across the 1400 households in our sample. There are two vertical panels in the table. In the left-most

panel, the simulations use the historical distribution of returns. The panel on the right reduces equity

returns by 300 basis points. Households are stratified by education group within each panel. The

table reports the mean wealth at retirement for each strategy, as well as four points in the distribution

of returns. Since our interest is the comparison of wealth outcomes across different strategies, most

of our discussion below focuses on a single education group, namely households headed by someone

with a high school degree but not a college degree. The relative ranking of different strategies is

similar for other education groups.

        The first row of Table 5 provides a point of reference for all of the subsequent calculations. It

shows the certain wealth at retirement associated with strategy (i), holding only TIPS. For those with

a high school degree and/or some college, this leads to a retirement balance of $162,600. The next

panels show the results from strategy (ii), holding on nominal government bonds, and strategy (iii),

holding only corporate stocks. Both of these strategies, as well as all of the subsequent strategies that

we consider, involve risk so we report information on the distribution of outcomes.

        The second panel shows that holding only government bonds leads to a higher average

retirement wealth, $192,700, than holding TIPS. The average wealth at retirement is nearly twenty

percent greater than the value with TIPS, but the median wealth of $175,000 is less than ten percent

above the TIPS outcome. Moreover, there are many outcomes with retirement wealth values below

the TIPS case. The tenth percentile outcome is $106,300, and the first percentile is $36,300.
                                                    18

        When the 401(k) is invested in corporate stock, the average retirement balance is much higher

than that with either TIPS or nominal government bonds: $812,000. This value is roughly four times

greater than the outcome with nominal government bonds. Because the mean return on stocks is so

much higher than that on either nominal or inflation-indexed bonds, even the low outcomes are often

above the mean outcomes with bonds. The 10th percentile retirement wealth value with the all-stocks

portfolio exceeds the average outcome with a nominal government bond portfolio. The first percentile

outcome, however, $12,800, is below the correspondingly low outcomes for the nominal bonds

strategy.

        The next two portfolios we consider, (iv) and (v), are “heuristic” lifecycle investment

strategies with a mix of stocks and TIPS, or stocks and long-term nominal government bonds. In both

cases the average value of retirement wealth falls between the value with an all-stock investment and

that with an all-bond portfolio. When the nominal government bond share of the portfolio is (Age +

10) percent, the average value of retirement wealth using historical equity returns is $303,600 for a

household with a high school education. The proportional dispersion in the retirement wealth value is

smaller than that for an all equity portfolio, and greater than that for the bond portfolio. The difference

between the 90th percentile and the 10th percentile retirement wealth value with an all-stock strategy is

1.88 times the mean value, and the corresponding measure for the all-bond portfolio is 1.01. With the

nominal bond-stock heuristic lifecycle portfolio, the 90-10 spread is 1.16 times the mean outcome.

The results for the heuristic portfolio that includes stocks and TIPS are broadly similar, although the

ratio of the 90-10 spread to the mean retirement wealth in this case is 0.90. The first percentile

outcomes with the two heuristic lifecycle portfolios are $54,300 and $38,000 respectively. Both are

larger than first percentile outcomes with either the all-stock or all-bond portfolios.

        The next two portfolios that we consider, (vi) and (vii), are the lifecycle portfolios that

correspond to the average of the portfolios from various mutual fund complexes. While the age-

specific equity allocation is somewhat different from the foregoing heuristic portfolios, the distribution

of 401(k) wealth at retirement is similar. In particular, the mean value of retirement wealth is
                                                     19

$405,300 when we combine TIPS and stocks, and $438,200 when we combine nominal long-term

government bonds and stocks. The difference is due to TIPS offering a lower real yield than the

historical average real return on nominal bonds during our sample period. The first percentile

outcome when we combine TIPS with stocks is higher than that for either of the heuristic strategies,

reflecting greater weight on the bond investment in this case than for those strategies.

        The next portfolio strategy, (viii), is the age-invariant strategy that holds an equity share equal

to the weighted average equity share in the lifecycle funds across the whole life cycle. That share is

53 percent. One of the issues that our simulations can address is how the risk and retirement wealth of

this strategy compare with the corresponding measures from the lifecycle portfolios. The mean wealth

from this age-invariant allocation is very similar to that from the lifecycle portfolios: $404,900. The

risk as measured by the 90-10 spread relative to the mean is also very similar. The very low

realizations from the lifecycle strategies are somewhat higher than the very low realizations from the

fixed allocation, with first percentile outcomes of $35,900 for strategy (viii) compared with $64,300

and $48,800 for the two lifecycle strategies. Through most of the distribution, however, it seems that

the two strategies yield similar results.

        The similarity of the retirement wealth distributions from the lifecycle portfolios, and from

strategies that allocate a constant portfolio share to equities, is one of the central findings of our

analysis. This result calls for further work to evaluate the extent to which lifecycle strategies offer

unique opportunities for risk reduction relative to simpler strategies that allocate a constant fraction of

portfolio assets to equities at all ages.

        The last strategy we consider is the Feldstein (2005) “no lose” plan. This strategy offers a

mean return that is broadly similar to the mean returns on the lifecycle strategies. The mean

retirement wealth for a high school educated household is $420,300, which is between the mean

wealth values with a lifecycle fund that holds TIPS and one that holds nominal government bonds.

The important difference between this strategy and the lifecycle strategies and the all-stocks and all-

nominal bonds strategies is found in the lower tail of the wealth outcomes. Because the “no lose”
                                                   20

strategy holds TIPS, the first percentile wealth value is $113,800, compared with values between

$38,000 and $64,300 in the actual and heuristic lifecycle strategies.

        The assumption that the equity return is drawn from its historical distribution is important for

the absolute level of retirement wealth under most of the strategies that we consider, and also for the

magnitude of the differences across strategies. The fourth, fifth, and sixth columns in Table 5 present

results assuming that equity returns are reduced by 300 basis points. The all-stock strategy is the one

that is most affected by this change. The average wealth at retirement for this strategy falls from

$812,000 to $404,800. The tenth percentile wealth value drops from $179,900 to $94,300 in this case,

and the first percentile value drops to $7,300 from $12,800. This very low outcome emphasizes the

risk associated with holding stocks: a very small chance of a very poor outcome. The average

retirement wealth values for the various heuristic and empirical lifecycle funds decline when we

reduce the value of the mean equity return. The mean wealth value for the “no lose” strategy falls

relative to the lifecycle strategies, because the no-lose strategy has relatively more equity exposure

than any of the lifecycle plans.

        The distribution of retirement balances shown in Table 5 is conceptually similar to the

distribution reported in Shiller’s (2005) analysis of personal accounts Social Security reform, although

there are differences in the simulation procedure that affect the results. The most important difference

is that Shiller (2005) uses data on stock and bond returns from a longer time period than we consider.

This means he assumes a distribution of equity returns with a lower mean value than the one that we

consider. Our results when the average return on stocks is set at 300 basis points below the historical

mean in our sample are closer to those in Shiller (2005) than our results that assume that returns are

drawn from the actual return distribution for 1926-2002.

4.2 Expected Utility of Retirement Wealth

        Results like those in Table 5 do not provide any information on the household utility

associated with a particular retirement wealth outcome. To address this issue, we now evaluate the
                                                     21

expected utility associated with various wealth outcomes from our simulation runs, using the

procedure described in (5) above.

        Table 6 shows the expected utility generated by the distribution of retirement resources for

each portfolio strategy using a certainty equivalent wealth measure to value the potential outcomes of

the different portfolio strategies. In this table we assume that the 401(k) balance is the household’s

only wealth. The values in the first horizontal panel in Table 6 are based on linear utility ( =0) and

thus are the expected values of each investment choice. These results are identical to the average

household retirement wealth calculations in Table 5, since a risk-neutral household cares only about

the expected value of retirement wealth. In this case the higher mean wealth of the all-stock strategy

implies that it is the most preferred investment strategy. This is true both with the actual historical

distribution of stock returns and with the distribution that reduces the mean return by 300 basis points.

It is also true for all education groups.

        The next horizontal panel in Table 6 presents results for households whose utility of

retirement wealth is logarithmic. This level of risk aversion reduces the certainty equivalent value of

the all-stock portfolio strategy relative to other strategies, but this strategy continues to generate the

highest expected utility for all education groups. This outcome obtains when the expected stock return

is set equal to its historical average, and when it is reduced by 300 basis points. The empirical

lifecycle fund that combines stocks with nominal government bonds generates the highest expected

utility among the four lifecycle fund strategies, and the two empirical lifecycle strategies, (vi) and

(vii), yield expected utilities substantially greater than either of the heuristic lifecycle funds. The

expected utility of the fixed proportions strategy continues to be close to the expected utility of the two

empirical lifecycle strategies, although it now falls below both of the lifecycle strategies. This result is

sensitive to the assumed rate of return on stocks; the fixed proportion strategy (viii) dominates the two

empirical lifecycle strategies when equity returns are reduced by 300 basis points.

        The third and fourth horizontal panels in Table 6 consider households with relative risk

aversion coefficients of two and four, respectively. As risk aversion rises the lifecycle portfolios
                                                     22

become more attractive relative to the all-stocks portfolio, and the “no lose” portfolio also becomes

more attractive. This is illustrated most clearly by considering the bottom panel in Table 6. The high

volatility of stock returns, and the associated risk of a low retirement wealth outcome, reduces

expected utility in this case relative to the earlier, less risk-averse cases. The certainty equivalent of

the all-stock strategy is now $181,500, which is still greater than the all-bond base ($140,500) but the

disparity is far smaller than at lower risk aversion values. The various lifecycle allocation strategies

dominate the all-stock strategy with a relative risk aversion of four. The certainty equivalent of the

four heuristic and empirical lifecycle strategies now range from $215,500 to $256,900. The empirical

lifecycle strategies generate higher expected utility than either of the heuristic strategies, and they also

generate higher expected utility than the strategy that holds the lifetime average equity share that

corresponds to these strategies, but does so at all ages. With relative risk aversion of four, the “no

lose” plan also generates a higher expected utility than the all-stock strategy.

        Three additional features of the results with a relative risk aversion of four warrant comment.

First, when the average return on stocks is reduced by 300 basis points, the certainty equivalent of the

all-stock strategy declines sharply, while the corresponding values for the lifecycle funds and the no-

lose strategy do not decline as much. Feldstein’s (2005) “no lose” strategy is the preferred strategy in

this setting, with the empirical lifecycle strategy blending stocks and TIPS taking the second rank.

        Second, the “no lose” strategy becomes more attractive as the level of risk aversion increases.

With a risk aversion of two, the “no-lose” plan yields an expected utility that falls below either of the

empirical lifecycle allocation strategies, either with historical equity returns or with reduced average

returns. In the case with relative risk aversion of four, the certainty equivalent of the “no lose” plan is

roughly equal to the nominal bonds and stocks lifecycle strategy, and somewhat below that of the

stocks-TIPS lifecycle strategy, when equity returns have their historical values. When equity returns

are reduced by 300 basis points, the certainty equivalent of the no-lose plan exceeds that of either of

the lifecycle strategies.

        Third, the expected utility associated with either heuristic lifecycle funds or empirical lifecycle

funds rises relative to the expected utility of an all-stock investment strategy as risk aversion increases.

For a relative risk aversion of one, the certainty equivalent of an empirical lifecycle strategy that holds

stocks and government bonds is roughly two-thirds of the certainty equivalent of an all-stock strategy,

and it is roughly twice the certainty equivalent of an all-bond strategy. For a relative risk aversion of

four, however, the empirical lifecycle strategy’s certainty equivalent is about one third greater than

that of an all-stock portfolio, and sixty percent greater than an all-bond portfolio. These findings

suggest that the relative attraction of lifecycle funds and other asset allocation strategies is likely to be

highly dependent upon household circumstances.

        Table 6 considers the certainty equivalent of different investment strategies when retirement

wealth from a 401(k) plan is the only source of utility at retirement. By assuming that the household is

solely dependent on 401(k) wealth, these calculations exaggerate the level of retirement income risk

faced by the household. Holding constant the household’s relative risk coefficient, when the

household has other sources of wealth, it will behave as though it was less risk averse.

        Tables 7 and 8 present results with two alternative assumptions about non-401(k) wealth at

retirement. The results in Table 7 set non-401(k) wealth equal to other financial wealth in the HRS,

while those in Table 8 set non-401(k) wealth equal to all other wealth, adding together both financial

wealth and housing wealth. The households in both cases are less averse to holding high fractions of

their wealth in stocks. For a relative risk aversion of two, for example, the certainty equivalent value

of contributing to a 401(k) that is invested in the empirical lifecycle fund with stocks and TIPS is

$320,400 when households have no wealth at retirement other than their retirement wealth. This value

can be found in Table 6. When other financial wealth is combined with retirement account wealth in

determining the utility of retirement wealth, the certainty equivalent of the same strategy rises to

$353,000. With housing equity added to the total, the certainty equivalent rises to $366,100. In each

case these values represent the certainty equivalent of just the 401(k) account balance. This is the

amount in addition to other wealth that would be needed to generate the expected utility associated
                                                     24

with the uncertain retirement wealth distribution. The average value of retirement wealth associated

with this strategy is $405,300, so the reduction in certainty equivalent value associated with the risk of

unfavorable outcomes is smaller as non-401(k) wealth rises.

        Allowing for non-retirement account wealth raises the attraction of stocks relative to other

financial investments. In both Tables 7 and 8, for all the risk aversion parameters that we consider, the

expected utility of holding an all-stock portfolio is greater than that from holding any of the other

portfolios that we consider. These results underscore the importance of recognizing and calibrating

non-401(k) wealth as part of the valuation process.



5. Conclusions

        This paper presents evidence on the distribution of balances in 401(k)-type retirement saving

accounts under various assumptions about the asset allocation strategies that investors choose. In

addition to a range of age-invariant strategies, such as an all-bond and an all-stock strategy, we

consider several different “lifecycle funds” that automatically alter the investor’s mix of assets as he or

she ages. These funds offer investors a higher portfolio allocation to stocks at the beginning of a

working career than as they approach retirement. We also consider a “no lose” allocation strategy for

retirement saving, in which households purchase enough riskless bonds at each age to ensure that they

will have no less than their nominal contribution when they reach retirement age, and then invest the

balance in corporate stock. This strategy combines a riskless floor for retirement income with some

upside investment potential.

        Our results suggest several conclusions about the effect of investment strategy on retirement

wealth. First, the distribution of retirement wealth associated with typical lifecycle investment

strategies is similar to that from age-invariant asset allocation strategies that set the equity share of the

portfolio equal to the average equity share in the lifecycle strategies. Second, the expected utility

associated with different 401(k) asset allocation strategies, and the ranking of these strategies, is very

sensitive to three parameters: the expected return on corporate stock, the relative risk aversion of the
                                                    25

investing household, and the amount of non-401(k) wealth that the household will have available at

retirement. At modest levels of risk aversion, or when the household has access to substantial non-

401(k) wealth at retirement, the historical pattern of stock and bond returns implies that the expected

utility of an all-stock investment allocation rule is greater than that from any of the more conservative

strategies. When we reduce the expected return on stocks by 300 basis points relative to historical

values, however, other strategies dominate the all-equity allocation for investors with high levels of

relative risk aversion. The “no lose” plan yields an expected utility of wealth at retirement that is

comparable to several of the lifecycle plans, but both the expected value of wealth and the expected

utility level are slightly lower than the values associated with the lifecycle strategies that we consider.

        Our analysis of lifecycle funds suggests a number of issues that may warrant future research.

First, it is possible that lifecycle funds should be different for single individuals and for married

couples. The focus in these funds so far has been on accumulating wealth for retirement, and the

conceptual justification for age-phased equity exposure would be age-related variation in household

risk aversion. Single individuals may have fewer opportunities to respond to an adverse economic

shock than married couples, so their tolerance of equity market risk in their retirement accounts may

be different from that for married couples.

        Second, we have focused on only a limited set of outcome measures associated with different

asset allocation strategies. While we consider various percentiles of the retirement wealth distribution,

as well as the mean value of wealth at retirement, and the expected utility associated with this wealth

value, other metrics may also deserve consideration. One possibility is the risk of shortfall associated

with one strategy relative to another. The Feldstein (2005) “no lose” strategy eliminates the shortfall

risk associated with a defined contribution investment strategy relative to investing all contributions to

a defined contribution plan in a zero-yield cash account. Shortfall risk measures could be computed

for a range of other strategies.

        Third, our analysis has not reduced participant returns in 401(k) plans for the expense ratios

associated with asset management. Actual returns are reduced by these fees, and a potentially
                                                    26

important issue in the comparison of lifecycle funds and other investment vehicles is the differential in

fees across these investment options. We are currently exploring the effect of introducing investment

management fees to a simulation algorithm like that developed here.

        Finally, our analysis has considered several stylized lifecycle funds, but it has not tried to

determine the optimal age-related allocation between stocks and bonds for households like the ones we

examine. Several previous studies, including Campbell and Viceira (2002), Campbell, Cocco, Gomes,

and Maenhout (2001), and Cocco, Gomes and Maenhout (2005), have evaluated optimal lifecycle

portfolios under stylized assumptions about labor market risk and the distribution of financial market

returns. It would be useful to compare the expected utility from the optimal lifecycle fund with the

expected utility either from existing lifecycle funds or from age-invariant asset allocation rules.

Funds used in this analysis consist of all mutual funds categorized by Morningstar as retirement or lifecycle
funds which also have a target-year rebalancing feature. Net assets for these funds as of 3/31/2005 were
collected from fund reports and from Morningstar.com. The number of funds differs from the number of fund
families for a given retirement year because funds have multiple classes of shares and “number of funds” counts
each share class as a separate fund. The weighted average expense ratio is the average expense ratio including
sub-fund expenses weighted by fund net asset value. Asset allocations are also averaged with fund net asset
value weighting. One fund family also offers funds with retirement years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2045, and
2050. The information on these funds is not used in constructing this table.

Source: Authors’ tabulations based on the 2000 HRS. All entries are normalized to calendar year 2000. To
estimate DB and DC pension wealth for HRS households we use the pension wealth imputations from the HRS
(March 2005 version). Other financial wealth includes stocks, equity mutual funds, bonds, fixed income mutual
funds, checking and saving accounts, money market mutual funds and certificates of deposit held outside of
retirement accounts. Social security wealth is calculated as in PRVW (2005).
