Physician Practice Style and Patient Health Outcomes: The Case of Heart Attacks

                                               ABSTRACT

When a patient arrives at the Emergency Room with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the provider
on duty must quickly decide how aggressively the patient should be treated. Using Florida data on
all such patients from 1992-2014, we decompose practice style into two components: The provider’s
probability of conducting invasive procedures on the average patient (which we characterize as aggressiveness),
and the responsiveness of the choice of procedure to the patient’s characteristics. We show that within
hospitals and years, patients with more aggressive providers have consistently higher costs and better
outcomes. Since all patients benefit from higher utilization of invasive procedures, targeting procedure
use to the most appropriate patients benefits these patients at the expense of the less appropriate patients.
We also find that the most aggressive and responsive physicians are young, male, and trained in top
20 schools.

One of the most controversial issues in medicine is whether providers should be evaluated in

terms of their adherence to simple metrics. Such metrics have become increasingly popular as a

way to improve the quality of health care. For example, under the Affordable Care Act,

Accountable Care Organizations are judged on the basis of criteria including: The fraction of

patients who receive influenza immunization, tobacco screening, and other forms of screening,

as well as whether patients with coronary artery disease are taking appropriate medications, and

other such metrics.

       In addition, it is thought that better metrics could help to control costs. Findings from the

Dartmouth medical atlas project show that in high spending regions of the country, patients

receive consistently more treatment. For example, Sutherland, Fischer, and Skinner (2009)

found that “discretionary decisions by providers seem to account for most of the regional

variation in spending,” and that outcomes were not better in high spending areas of the country.

The strong implication is that costs could be reduced without sacrificing outcomes by reigning in

the discretion of medical providers (Garber and Skinner, 2008).

       However, providers often argue that decisions about treatment should be tailored to the

needs of individual patients, and that this type of sensitivity to patient characteristics cannot be

captured through adherence to simple rules. In a recent New York Times editorial cardiologist

Sandeep Jauhar argued that “… guidelines and checklists are unpopular among most American

providers. Instead of being allowed to deliver “patient-centered” care, many providers feel they

are being co-opted by regulations… Guidelines are supposed to assist and advise. But all too

often, recommended care in certain situations becomes mandated care in all situations.” (New

York Times, Dec. 11, 2014). Moreover, the use of guidelines raises significant issues about how

meaningful protocols are to be established.

                                                           In this paper, we decompose provider practice style into two dimensions, whether

providers are more or less aggressive in their use of invasive treatments (a mean effect) and

whether there are differences in the extent to which providers tailor their treatment decisions to

the characteristics of individual patients (a slope effect). We then ask whether these differences

matter for costs and health outcomes. Specifically, we use a rich data set of Florida patients

arriving at the Emergency Room (ER) with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), i.e. heart attack,

between 1992 and the second quarter of 2014. When such a patient arrives at the ER, the

clinicians on duty must quickly decide on a course of action, so that there is less than usual scope

for selecting a provider.1 We focus on within hospital-year variation in provider behavior and

the sample is limited to hospitals that have experience performing invasive cardiac procedures to

ensure that there is in fact a viable choice to be made.

                                                           Using a rich set of observable patient characteristics including the age, sex, detailed

diagnosis code, previous history of AMI, and comorbidities of the patient, we show that there is

substantial variation across providers in the extent to which observable patient characteristics

affect choice of procedure. Some providers are much less likely to use invasive procedures on

the oldest and sickest patients, while others appear to pay little attention to these factors.

Perhaps surprisingly in light of concerns about over-treatment and excessive spending, we find

that providers who treat everyone aggressively have the best outcomes. In contrast, teams that

follow the prevailing norms in teaching hospitals where providers are less likely to perform

        	  When such a patient arrives at the ER, clinicians must quickly decide on a course of
action. For example, if a patient was to be treated with drugs (e.g. thrombolysis) the goal would
be a door-to-drug time within minutes, while if they were treated with angioplasty, the goal
would be a “door-to-balloon” time within 90 minutes (Zafari and Yang, 2014).
	  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3	  
	  
invasive procedures on the “least appropriate” patients, reduce costs but achieve poorer health

outcomes for these patients.

       We also ask how the aggressiveness and responsiveness of the providers’ decision-

making varies with their characteristics. We find that the most aggressive and responsive

providers are young, male, and graduated from top-20 medical schools. In addition, Spanish

speaking providers tend to be more aggressive but less responsive to patient condition.

       Overall, our results suggest that it is possible to identify important elements of provider

practice style using routinely collected administrative data and to relate practice style to patient

outcomes. In turn, it may be possible to use this knowledge to refine treatment protocols in order

to cost-effectively improve patient outcomes.

       The rest of the paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 presents background information.

Section 3 covers data and methods. Results are presented in Section 4, and section 5 concludes.



2. Background

       Tsai et al. (2010) ask whether the treatment of AMI is consistent with guidelines from the

American Council of Cardiology, and concluded that compliance is “low to moderate”

suggesting that there is a great deal of room for improvement. The literature offers many

possible reasons for “mistakes” in the choice of procedure to be systematically biased in favor of

aggressive and expensive treatment (Chandra et al., 2012). One common explanation for faulty

decision making is “defensive medicine,” the idea that providers perform unnecessary

procedures in order to protect themselves from lawsuits. However, the extent to which defensive

medicine drives practice style remains controversial. For example, Baicker et al. (2007) argue




                                                  4	  
	  
that there is little connection between malpractice liability costs and provider treatment of

Medicare patients.

       There is also a substantial literature arguing that providers are swayed by financial

incentives (e.g. Gruber, Kim, Mayzlin, 1999; Gruber and Owings, 1996), and especially by fee-

for-service reimbursement models that can incentivize providers to increase the number of

services rendered (McClellan, 2011).

       A third possibility is that providers are influenced by the decisions of those around them.

Chandra and Staiger (2007) study the choice of surgery vs. medical management of cardiac

patients. Knowledge spillovers are the main theoretical driver of regional variation in procedure

use in their model. Providers in areas that specialize in surgery are assumed to become better at

surgery and worse at medical management, and vice-versa. Their model raises the possibility of

mismatch between patients and providers. All patients in high surgery areas will be more likely

to have surgery, even if medical management would be more appropriate for some of them. An

implication of their model is that patients who are good candidates for medical management will

fare more poorly with high surgery providers than they would have with less aggressive

providers.

       What matters in our application is not only whether providers have high or low average

levels of invasive procedures, but also the extent to which they tailor their decisions to the

characteristics of the individual patient, a factor that has not been considered earlier. Note, that

since we are looking at variation in procedure use within hospital-years, our work is

complementary to the Chandra and Staiger research that looks at variation in mean procedure

rates across regions.




                                                  5	  
	  
           Doyle et al. (2010) suggest that variations in practice style may arise because some

providers may just be more competent than others. They study a setting in which patients

arriving at a large medical center are randomly assigned to one of two medical groups. One of

the groups is affiliated with a prestigious medical school while the other is not. They find that

providers from the better medical school systematically conduct fewer tests and have lower costs

even though both groups have similar patient outcomes. We will build on this work by

examining the relationship between a provider’s practice style and whether they attended a top

20 medical school (using the U.S. News and World Reports rankings).

           Patient preferences are often cited as a fifth potential reason for medically unnecessary

procedure use. In an innovative study using vignettes from patient and provider surveys, Cutler

et al. (2013) assess the hypothesis that regional variations in procedure use are driven by

differences in patient demand across areas. They conclude that patient demand is a relatively

unimportant determinant of regional variations and that instead the main driver is provider

beliefs about appropriate treatment that are often unsupported by clinical evidence.

           Finkelstein et al. (2014) address the same question using longitudinal Medicare claims

data that allow them to track the same patients as they move through different health care

markets. They suggest that about half of the observed variation in procedure use is due to supply-

side factors, while half is due to patient-level, or demand-side. However, they conclude that

much of the variation in patient demand is driven by exogenous patient health, and so does not

simply reflect patient tastes for procedures. These findings agree with those of Cutler et al.

(2013) in suggesting that patient preferences play a relatively small role in explaining variations

in care.

                                                           Because we are studying heart attack patients who were admitted through the ER, it is

unlikely that patient demand is the main driver of either provider or procedure choice. We do

not find any evidence of sorting on provider aggressiveness. We do find, however, evidence of a

small amount of sorting within hospitals, which indicates that patients who are not good

candidates for invasive procedures are more likely to be treated by more responsive

cardiologists. In practical terms, this means that patients who are older and sicker tend to be

matched with providers who are less likely to perform invasive surgery on them. As we will

show, these patients subsequently end up with worse health outcomes. However, this is unlikely

to be a quality of provider effect because the same teams are more likely to perform invasive

procedures on highly appropriate patients, and achieve better than average outcomes for these

patients. In order to deal with the possibility of patient selection, we control for patient

appropriateness in all our models.



3. Data and Methods

Our analysis starts with hospital discharge data for all heart attack patients in Florida from 1992-

2014.2 Because we wish to focus on cases where there is actually a choice of procedures, we

further restrict the sample to hospital-quarter-day of week combinations with non-zero invasive

procedures and drop any hospital that did not have more than 35 invasive procedures per year.

We also drop patients with diagnosis codes for which over 90% of patients received an invasive

procedure or less than 10% of patients received an invasive procedure.

                                                           It is unfortunately impossible to know exactly who the decision maker is from the

hospital record, so we assume that cardiologist had the most say. We focus on hospitals where

     The hospitalization data come from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (FL
AHCA).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    7	  
	  
more than 50% of AMI patients had cardiologists listed on their hospital records, suggesting that

these hospitals had cardiologists available for consultation. We also drop hospital-quarter-

weekdays when there was apparently no cardiologist on call (because no patient appears with a

cardiologist on the record). Within this sample, the share of patients with a cardiologist listed on

their hospital records is 69%.3 If there is a cardiologist listed on the record, then we assume that

she made the decision about procedure choice.

                                                                     If no cardiologist is listed on the record, then we use the cardiologist who treated the

greatest number of patients in that hospital-quarter-weekday cell. The cardiologist with the

highest patient volume had the most tenure 83% of the time (where tenure is measured as the

cumulative number of year-quarter-weekdays the physician had worked at that hospital up to the

point that the patient arrived). Choosing the cardiologist with the highest patient volume also

yields the same result as choosing the one with the most years of experience since residency 73%

of the time. In what follows we will explore the relationship between our measures of practice

style and physician characteristics in the sample with information about the cardiologist, and in

the sample where we have imputed that information in order to judge the extent to which

imputation error is likely to affect the estimated relationship between provider characteristics and

practice style.

                                                           We focus on patients who were admitted through the ER (rather than AMI patients who

arrive as referrals from other physicians or as transfers from other hospitals) since there is likely

to be less capacity for physician selection in these cases. Finally, we restrict the sample to

cardiologists who treated at least five AMI patients per three-year period, since it will be difficult

to determine anything about the practice styles of physicians who see very few patients.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    8	  
	  
Appendix Table 2 shows the distribution of patients per cardiologist before and after this

restriction is imposed.

                                                           Table 1 shows that these restrictions reduce the sample from 1,039,072 to 658,553

patients who were treated by 2,929 cardiologists. These restrictions also reduce the number of

hospitals from 244 to 149, meaning that we are focusing only on hospitals that had the capability

to perform invasive procedures. Of the patients in our sample, 59% have an invasive procedure,

which is defined as receiving either cardiac catheterization or angioplasty.4

                                                           These data have information about all patient hospitalizations over the time period,

including patient characteristics, admission sources, procedures, length-of-stays, charges,

discharge outcomes, and physician license numbers which can be matched to Florida’s physician

license database to obtain additional information about the cardiologists in our sample. The

available patient characteristics include gender, age, race, ethnicity, insurance, and up to ten

ICD-9 diagnostic codes for each patient.

                                                           From the hospital discharge data we create several additional variables. First, we use the

diagnosis codes to define patient comorbidities. Following the literature (e.g. Card et al., 2009)

we pay special attention to the serious comorbidities included in the Charlson index (Charlson et

al. 1987), which include cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, congestive heart failure, peripheral

vascular disease, dementia, cerebral vascular disease, coronary obstructive pulmonary disease,

lupus, ulcers, liver disease, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, and HIV. Patients with these

conditions are likely to be poorer candidates for invasive procedures than healthier patients.

                                                           We measure health outcomes using information about the patient’s disposition at the time

of discharge. Many heart attack patients die in the hospital, which is obviously an extremely

       	  Invasive procedures are defined by the following ICD-9 codes: 00.66, 36.0, 37.22, and 37.23.	  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    9	  
	  
negative outcome. Patients may also be discharged to home, to another hospital, or to another

facility such as a skilled nursing facility or hospice. By focusing on being discharged home, we

are implicitly assuming that this reflects a better health outcome than, for example, being

transferred to a skilled nursing facility.

                                                           Additionally, we know whether the patient developed a hospital-acquired condition

(HAC). HACs are defined by the Department of Health and Human Services and include

infections like septicemia, clostridium difficile, pneumonia due to staphylococcus, catheter-

associated urinary tract infection, vascular catheter infection, and surgical site infections

following surgery.5 While current guidelines view HACs as avoidable and seek to eliminate

them, it is undoubtedly the case that invasive procedures and longer hospital stays expose

patients to greater risks of infection under current conditions. Thus, HACs can be viewed as one

of the more serious potential costs of unnecessary surgical procedures.

                                                           One drawback to our visit-level hospital discharge data is that the data do not contain

patient identifiers. Therefore, we can only measure health outcomes that occur on the index visit.

We cannot measure health outcomes that occur outside of the hospital, in another hospital, or at

the time of a follow-up visit. Ideally, a state agency or hospital administration that did have

access to longitudinal data would probably wish to include these outcomes in the analysis. We

do however know whether the patient had a previous AMI episode as this is recorded in the

discharge data.

          Other types of HACs include foreign body retained after surgery, air embolism, pressure ulcer
stages III and IV, falls and trauma, manifestations of poor glycemic control, deep vein thrombosis and
pulmonary embolism following orthopedic procedures, and lactogenic pneumothorax with venous
catheterization. The HHS definitions come from a Fact Sheet report titled, “Hospital Acquired Infections
(HAC) in Acute Inpatient Prospective Payment (IPPS) Hospitals,” which was published in October 2012.
To the HHS list we add septicemia, clostridium difficile, and pneumonia due to staphylococcus, three
common infections that can be deadly and that plague patients in hospital environments.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    10	  
	  
                                                           Our second set of outcomes includes hospital costs and length-of-stay. The hospital

discharge data contain hospital charges, which must be converted into hospital costs since

hospitals generally only recover a fraction of the list price of a service. To convert charges to

costs, we multiply the hospital charge by the hospital’s cost-to-charge ratio (CCR) in the given

year.6 Costs are further standardized to real 2009 dollars. We also separate hospital costs into

categories such as pharmacy costs, laboratory costs, radiology costs, costs for medical devices,

cardiology, operation rooms, and all other costs.

                                                           One drawback to using hospital discharge data is that the hospital costs are not the total

costs for the patient’s full episode of care. The hospital costs do not include physician fees or the

costs of treating the patient at another facility. Since 7% of our sample gets transferred to another

hospital, and all of our patients receive treatment from at least one physician on the initial visit,

the differences between the hospital costs and the total costs for the episode of care are likely to

be non-negligible. We use the length of stay and the hospital costs to index the amount of

medical resources that were used to treat the patients.

                                                           To learn more about the characteristics of the cardiologists in our data, we match their

medical license numbers to the Florida medical license database.7 We construct variables for

cardiologist characteristics that include their experience, gender, whether they attended medical

school in the United States, whether their medical school is ranked among the top-20 according

to U.S. New and World Report research rankings8, and whether they speak Spanish. One

potential contribution of this analysis is to show which, if any, observable characteristics are

correlated with practice style. It is of course possible that the decision is actually made by a

team of physicians including the ER doctor (who is not observed in our sample of admitted

patients) and to the extent that this is the case, the influence of any individual characteristics are

likely to be diluted.



3.1 Identifying Good Candidates for Invasive Procedures

                                                           The first step in our analysis is to identify patients who appear, given their observable

characteristics, to be good candidates for invasive procedures. We do this using a standard

simple “machine learning” algorithm, which involves estimating a logit model for the use of the

invasive cardiac procedure on all of the observable patient characteristics.9 Specifically, for each

year of data we estimate the following model for visit i in quarter t:

                                                           (1)   Pr(Invasiveit	  =	  1)	  =	  F	  (θit,diag	  +	  ΓXit	  +	  δit,com	  +	  λt	  +	  εct,)	  

       Where F( ) is the logit function, Pr(Invasiveit = 1) is the probability that the patient on visit i in

quarter t receives an invasive procedure, θit,diag is a vector of 30 diagnosis codes for different

types of acute myocardial infarction, Xit is the patient’s gender and a vector of age dummies (50-

54,…65-69, 70, 71…89, 90+), δi it,com is a vector of 14 comorbidities plus whether there was a

previous AMI,10 and                                                                                                                                                                    t        is a vector of quarter fixed effects.

                                                           We estimate (1) using only patients in hospitals that have accredited teaching programs,

which implicitly assumes that these hospitals define the standard of care in each year and try to

follow the currently accepted best practices. We define teaching programs based on the

Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)’s list

(see: https://apps.acgme.org/ads/Public/Programs/Search) and use the 20 Florida hospitals with

accredited internal medicine teaching programs. This includes institutions with national prestige

such as the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic, which have hospitals in Florida.	  

       Note that if we construct an alternative patient appropriateness index using data from all

hospitals, the correlation between this alternative index and the one that we use here is above 0.9.

What this implies is that if called on to rank patients from least appropriate to most appropriate

for surgery, most practitioners would rank them in the same way (even though they might well

choose different cutoffs for deciding who would receive surgery).

       We estimate the model year by year because if, for example, surgery becomes generally

safer over time, then it may make sense to use aggressive procedures on more marginal patients

over time. Thus, the standard of care is allowed to evolve over time; in fact we show that there

is a general trend towards using more invasive procedures in older, sicker patients.

       These estimates are shown for different years in Appendix Table 1. The estimates

suggest that the weights that providers place on several important determinants of

appropriateness for invasive procedures have evolved over time. For example, at the beginning

of the sample invasive procedures were less likely to be performed on patients with dementia,

but this is no longer the case. Providers have also become more likely to perform invasive

procedures on patients with hypertension and on patients who are in their 80s, and less likely to

perform these procedures on women. These trends show the importance of considering a

provider’s decision in the context of accepted practice for the time.

       We use the estimated parameters from equation (1) to construct an index that ranks

patients by their likelihood of receiving an invasive procedure. This index is a continuous



                                                 13	  
	  
variable, which, in principle, can vary from negative infinity to positive infinity. Given this

index, we can divide patients into terciles according to their appropriateness for invasive

procedures. Tables 2, 3, and 4 show means for all patients, those in the lowest tercile of

appropriateness for invasive procedures (low), and those in the highest tercile of appropriateness

for invasive procedures (high).

       Table 2 shows the mean characteristics of the patients themselves. We can see that

patients who are good candidates for invasive procedures are less likely to be female, they are

younger (and therefore less likely to have Medicare coverage and more likely to have private

health insurance coverage), and they are less likely to have several other serious comorbid

conditions including congestive heart failure or kidney disease.

       Table 3 shows what happened to these patients. Overall, 60% have an invasive

procedure, but as one might expect, this fraction rises to 86% among the high appropriateness

patients and is only 28% among the least appropriate patients. The high appropriateness patients

have lengths of stay that are a third shorter than the low appropriateness patients; however, their

costs are 21% higher. In general outcomes appear somewhat better for this group in that they are

much less likely to have hospital acquired conditions, more than almost twice as likely to be

discharged home, and are only a quarter as likely to die in the hospital. This may however

reflect their underlying relative youth and health status rather than their treatment.

       Table 4 shows the characteristics of the cardiologists assigned to these patients. The unit

of observation is still the patient. The table shows that there is little difference between

cardiologists serving “high” and “low” appropriateness patients in terms of the types of provider

characteristics that we can observe. They are similar in terms of experience, type of medical

school attended, gender, and whether they speak Spanish.

3.2 Measuring Practice Style

        The next step in our analysis involves the estimation of provider-specific regressions

which show how the cardiologist’s decision to use invasive cardiac procedures varies with the

index we constructed above, which summarizes all of the information that we observe about the

patient’s characteristics and medical condition. The intercept in these regressions tell us whether

the medical team in question is more or less likely to use invasive procedures relative to the

state-wide standard defined in equation (1). This is the element of practice style that has been

considered in Chandra and Staiger (2007), Epstein, Ketchum, and Nicholson (2010), and Epstein

and Nicholson (2009). The innovation here is to also consider, given that mean level of

procedure use, how likely the provider is to take the patient’s characteristics into account when

making a decision, and to target invasive procedures to those patients who appear to be the best

candidates for them.

        Given our long time period, we do not assume that a provider’s behavior is constant over

time. Instead we allow it to evolve with provider experience, measured as the number of years

since the cardiologist assigned to the patient completed his or her residency. We create 3-year

experience level bins, where k =1 if the cardiologist has less than 3 years of experience, k=2

indicates 3-6 years of experience, and so on, up to more than 30 years of experience (k=11).

Specifically, we estimate a logit model for each provider j in experience level k,

       Pr(Invasiveijk = 1) = F(αjk + βjk*Patient_Indexi + εijk)    for each j*k=1,…, JK (2)

where again, F( ) indicates the logit function. Here αjk captures cardiologist j’s propensity to

perform an invasive treatment on the median patient given experience level k, and βjk captures

the relative weight that cardiologist j places on the index summarizing the patient i’s


                                                  15	  
	  
appropriateness for invasive treatment. Because we estimate separate equations for the same

cardiologist at different levels of experience, αjk and βjk vary within cardiologists over time. This

variation allows us to test whether cardiologistss are more or less likely to consider observable

patient characteristics as they gain experience. In what follows we will refer to these two

dimensions of provider behavior as aggressiveness and responsiveness.

	     Theoretically the parameters αjk and βjk can take values from negative infinity to positive

infinity, but there are some special cases that illustrate the intuition behind our model. When

βjk=0, providers ignore patient characteristics and have the same probability of performing an

invasive treatment on all patients. One way to characterize this behavior is that the provider has

a particular preference for invasive procedures that is independent of patient characteristics.

When αjk=0, the provider’s behavior depends only on the patient’s appropriateness for invasive

procedures. If in addition βjk=1, then providers behave in exactly the way predicted by our

equation (1) model. The coefficient αjk can also be characterized as the probability that a

provider will perform an invasive procedure on a patient with an index of patient appropriateness

equal to zero, that is, on a patient of median appropriateness.

       We are not the first to try to measure provider practice style. However, practice style is

usually modeled as a provider-specific fixed effect. Instead, we allow there to be two

dimensions to practice style. Moreover, we allow practice style to evolve over time. We will

show that this richer model is useful in conceptualizing practice style.

       Table 5a shows the distribution of the estimated parameters α and β in our sample. This

table does not take the precision of the coefficient estimates into account. Therefore, Table 5b

divides the data into cells according to whether the provider’s behavior shows a statistically

significant departure from the norm. That is, we ask whether α is significantly different from

                                                 16	  
	  
zero, and whether β is significantly different than one. Since providers with few patients will

have imprecisely estimated coefficients, this procedure takes into account the fact that it is

difficult to judge practice style in a small practice. However, only 2.9% of patients see

cardiologists in the bottom quartile of the distribution of 3-year practice size indicating (not

surprisingly) that cardiologists with few patients account for few patients in our sample.

       The largest cell in Table 5b is the middle cell where α=0 and β=1. These are providers

whose behavior is consistent with the state-wide norm established by the accredited teaching

hospitals for that year. However, Table 5b shows that 13.8% of patients have a provider who is

less responsive to patient characteristics than the norm (i.e. β<1) while very few (2.0%) have a

provider that is more responsive to patient characteristics than the norm (i.e. have β>1). Turning

to aggressiveness, 17.6% of patients have a provider who is less aggressive than the norm

established in the teaching hospitals (i.e. α<0) while 21.9% of patients have a provider who is

significantly more aggressive than that norm (i.e. α>0). Note that these determinations take the

provider-specific sample size into account as providers with few patients have coefficients that

are estimated with larger standard errors.

       We can now return to the question of whether patients whose medical conditions make

them good candidates for invasive procedures go to providers with systematically different

practice styles than patients who are poor candidates for such surgery. Table 5c shows the

results of taking the estimated α’s and β’s and regressing them on hospital*year effects as well

as the patient’s gender, age, comorbidities, and an indicator equal to one if the patient had a




                                                 17	  
	  
previous AMI.11 We do this separately for the low and high terciles of patient appropriateness

for procedures.


                                                           We do not find any evidence of matching in the high appropriateness patients. Nor is

there any evidence of matching on provider aggressiveness in either group of patients. The only

significant matching effect we find is among low appropriateness patients, where a one standard

deviation increase in appropriateness is associated with a 5.4% decline in the probability of

having a low-beta provider. That is, within this group of generally less appropriate patients,

patients who are better candidates for invasive procedures are less likely to have unresponsive

providers. Hence, to the extent that there is a bias induced by matching, these estimates suggest

that within the low-appropriateness group, those patients who are better candidates for invasive

procedures will have more responsive providers, which suggests that they may have better

outcomes.


                                                           Given this evidence of a small amount of matching in one group of patients, we include

the continuous index of appropriateness in all of the models of outcomes and costs discussed

below. Thus, we will be examining AMI patients admitted from the ER in the same hospital and

year with the same measured appropriateness for invasive procedures but who, nevertheless, are

treated by providers with different levels of responsiveness and aggressiveness.




3.3. Models of Costs, Patient Outcomes, and Correlates of Provider Practice Style

                                                           Given the data we have constructed, we can now ask how the variations in provider

treatment style affect costs and patient outcomes, and also what characteristics of providers are

         As discussed above, we cannot follow patients over time, but the diagnosis for each AMI patient
indicates whether there has been a previous AMI.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    18	  
	  
associated with differences in practice style. We have defined a standard of care using data from

teaching hospitals. This standard of care has two dimensions which can be thought of as the

average level of use of invasive procedures (α) and the extent to which the provider responds to

the observable condition of the patient (given largely by their exact diagnoses, age, and

comorbidities) when deciding whether to perform an invasive procedure (β). If the standard is

useful then we will find that patients of providers who deviate from the standard will have poorer

outcomes.

       In order to measure the effect of provider characteristics on outcomes, we estimate

models of the form:

        Yijkht = φ1*LowResponsivenessijkt + φ2*LowAggressivenessijkt +φ3*HighAggressivenessijkt


                          + ΠZi + ΩXi + ρAppropriatenessi + δht + ε jkt,
                                                                     ι     (3)


where LowResponsiveness corresponds to an estimated provider β that is significantly less than

one; LowAggressiveness corresponds to an estimated provider α that is significantly less than

zero, and HighAggressiveness corresponds to an estimated provider α that is significantly greater

than zero. For the time being, we ignore the possibility that β is significantly greater than one

since it is so rare in our data. However, in Appendix Table 4 (discussed further below) we

present models that also include an indicator for this possibility. These measures are specific to

patient i of provider j with experience level k in hospital h in year-quarter t.

       The outcomes vector Yijkht includes health outcomes, total hospital costs, itemized costs,

length-of-stay, and the probability of receiving an invasive procedure. Health outcomes include

the probability of developing a hospital-acquired condition (HAC), the probability of being

discharged home (Home), and the probability of dying in the hospital (Died). The subscript h


                                                  19	  
	  
indicates that outcomes may also vary at the hospital level. The cost variables are in logs, the

length of stay variable is in levels, and the invasive procedure variable is binary.

       The vector Zi includes other observable characteristics of providers, including experience,

gender, whether they attended medical school in the US or abroad, and whether they attended

top-20 medical schools. The vector Xi includes gender, age, whether there was a previous heart

attack, and the patient’s comorbidities. As discussed above, we also include a measure of each

patient’s appropriateness for invasive procedures, Appropriatenessi. We estimate alternative

models adding in patient race, ethnicity, and type of health insurance, which may have

independent effects on treatment choices and on outcomes. We control for hospital*year fixed

effects (δht ) in order to be sure that we are capturing provider-level differences as well as to

capture things like technological improvements that may improve survival over time.

       Finally, we examine the way that the estimated parameters of provider practice style vary

with provider characteristics, and with their experience. In order to conduct this examination we

estimate:

                             𝛼 jkt = φ1*𝛼 jkt-1 + ΠZit + δht + εjkt,   (4a)


                             𝛽 jkt = φ2*𝛽 jkt-1 + ΠZit + δht + εjkt.   (4b)


where the estimated parameters at time t depend on provider characteristics including

experience, lagged values of the dependent variables to capture persistence, hospital*year fixed

effects and the patient level variables included in the other regression models.



4. Estimation Results

       Table 6 shows the estimated coefficients on the practice style measures included in

equation (3). As discussed above, these models control for measured patient appropriateness in

                                                     20	  
	  
addition to diagnoses and other patient characteristics. For the sake of brevity these coefficients

are not shown, but they generally have the expected sign; that is, older, sicker patients tend to

have worse health outcomes other things being equal. With regard to the aggressiveness of the

providers, Table 6 suggests that all patients do better with more aggressive physicians and worse

with less aggressive providers. As discussed above, these models control for measured patient

appropriateness for invasive procedures, which is of course an important determinant of

outcomes. Patients with aggressive physicians are more likely to be discharged home, less likely

to get hospital acquired infections, and less likely to die in the hospital and the advantages are

actually greater among the “low appropriateness” patients who on average, have only a 28%

probability of receiving invasive procedures. Among these patients, having an aggressive

provider is associated with a 2 pp reduction in the probability of dying in hospital, on a baseline

of 17%. This result suggests that aggressive procedures may actually be under rather than over-

utilized, and that in particular, that some of the older, sicker patients who tend to be deemed

inappropriate for aggressive procedures would benefit from them.

       Turning to the measure of responsiveness, Table 6 suggests that among the patients who

are highly appropriate for procedures and conditional on the aggressiveness of the providers,

providers who are not responsive to observable patient characteristics (here patient diagnosis,

previous AMI, age, and comorbidities) tend to have worse patient outcomes. Among these high

appropriateness patients, low provider responsiveness predicts more hospital-acquired

conditions, a higher probability of dying in the hospital, and a lower probability of being

discharged home.

       Among low appropriateness patients, however, low provider responsiveness predicts

better outcomes. Recall that in our framework, being more responsive means that a provider



                                                 21	  
	  
with a given rate of doing invasive procedures is more likely to allocate procedures to the high

appropriateness patients. So we can think of an increase in responsiveness in these models as a

reallocation of a given number of procedures away from low appropriateness towards high

appropriateness patients. If in fact, all patients would benefit from procedures, then this means

that responsiveness will benefit high appropriateness patients and harm low appropriateness

patients, just as we see here.

       Although we did detect some evidence of patient selection in the low appropriateness

patients, it seems unlikely that the findings in Table 6 could be driven by selection. As we

showed in Table 5c, among low appropriateness patients, those who are better candidates for

invasive procedures (i.e. younger and less sick) tend to have more responsive physicians, which

would tend to bias estimates towards finding favorable effects of responsiveness.

       The cost data in Table 7 are consistent with this interpretation. Not surprisingly, for all

patients, high aggressiveness is associated with higher costs, a higher probability of invasive

procedures, and a longer length of stay, and vice versa. Among high appropriateness patients,

having a low responsiveness provider is associated with lower probabilities of receiving invasive

procedures and correspondingly lower costs. Among low appropriateness patients, we see the

reverse pattern with low responsiveness providers being more likely to do invasive procedures,

which in turn generate higher costs and longer lengths of stay.

       Table 8 shows that the same patterns that apply to total costs are reflected in virtually

every category of costs. More aggressive providers have higher costs, especially for operating

room and cardiology, while less aggressive providers have lower costs. Since low

responsiveness is associated with more invasive procedures in low appropriateness patients, and

with fewer invasive procedures in high appropriateness patients, costs show patterns consistent



                                                22	  
	  
with this behavior. As discussed above, we only observe hospital costs. In most cases, there will

also be additional costs associated with both the treating providers and anesthetists. Since these

costs are likely to rise with invasive procedures, the comparisons above are likely to understate

the extent to which additional procedures drive up costs.

       Since our cost data is incomplete, we hesitate to use our estimates to calculate a cost per

life saved from doing invasive procedures (versus not doing these invasive procedures). We can

however examine the percent change in probability of death that accompanies a percent change

in cost. Under the assumption that unobserved costs are proportional to hospital costs, this may

be a valid comparison. What we find is that for the high appropriateness patients, a 7% decrease

in costs is associated with a 23% increase in the probability of death, for an elasticity of -3.3.

For the low appropriateness patients, a 5% increase in costs is associated with a 6.5% reduction

in the probability of death, for an elasticity of -1.3. Thus, while it is more cost effective to

allocate invasive procedures to highly appropriate patients than to less appropriate patients, there

may still be considerable potential gains to changing practice style in a way that increases the use

of invasive procedures among the less appropriate patients.



4.1 Correlates of Practice Style

       Table 9 shows how the two dimensions of practice style that we have identified

(responsiveness and aggressiveness) vary with other provider characteristics. Because we allow

practice style to evolve over time, we can also ask how it varies with experience (measured as

years since residency). The first and fourth columns show models without lagged practice style

measures while the remaining columns do control for lagged practice style. The estimates on the

lags suggest that practice style (and especially aggressiveness) is quite persistent over time,



                                                  23	  
	  
although it does evolve, a result that is consistent with Epstein and Nicholson’s (2009) work on

obstetricians. This is an interesting observation given past work asking whether providers are

“punished” for aggressive practice styles (Dranove et al., 2011).

       Conditional on lagged practice style, more experienced providers are actually less

responsive and less aggressive than newer graduates: We find that providers with 6-9 years of

experience are more responsive than the omitted category (those with 3-6 years). After that

slight peak, responsiveness is relatively flat until about 20 years of experience, after which it

declines over time. Aggressiveness declines more continuously with experience. We also find

that U.S. trained providers tend to be less responsive and more aggressive except for those

trained at top 20 medical schools. Those trained at top schools are both more responsive and

more aggressive than other U.S. trained physicians. Female providers have higher

responsiveness, and lower aggressiveness, while the reverse is true for Spanish-speaking

providers.

       As discussed above, there are two key limitations of our data that could be expected to

affect the estimates in Table 9. First, we do not actually observe the decision maker, but assume

that it is the cardiologist. Suppose, for example, that it was the ER doctor who generally decided

on the procedure and then called in the cardiologist. In this case, one would not expect the

measured characteristics of the cardiologist to have much effect on procedure choice, unless

these characteristics were correlated with those of the actual decision maker. Hence, the fact that

we see very systematic relationships between the cardiologist’s characteristics and practice style

indicates that at the very least, the identity of the cardiologist is a reasonable proxy for the

provider or team of providers that is actually making the decision.




                                                  24	  
	  
       A second limitation is that we do not actually know the cardiologist for a significant

fraction of our sample but we impute it using the busiest (and generally most senior) cardiologist

on duty. Table 10 shows the results of estimating models similar to those of columns (3) and (6)

of Table 9 for the subsample in which we know the cardiologist, and the subsample where the

cardiologist is imputed. If each cardiologist was a completely autonomous decision maker, then

we might expect to see a relationship between cardiologist characteristics in the cardiologist-

known sample, but not in the cardiologist-imputed sample. On the other hand, if it is in fact the

most active cardiologist on duty who sets the tone for the unit, then one might actually see a

stronger relationship between provider characteristics and practice style in the cardiologist-

imputed sample.

       Table 10 shows that in fact the qualitative relationships between provider characteristics

and practice style are quite similar in the two sub-samples: Aggressiveness and responsiveness

are both lower for more experienced physicians, especially for those with more than 20 years of

experience. We find a weaker effect of attending a U.S. medical school in the cardiologist-

imputed sample, but the impact of attending a top 20 medical school is greater. The impact of

gender is also greater in the cardiology-imputed sample and the impact of Spanish language is

similar. Overall, the R-squared is higher in the imputed-cardiologist sample, though since these

are non-overlapping samples we hesitate to make too much of this result and conclude that the

relationship between provider characteristics and practice style is fairly similar in the two sub-

samples.



4.2 Robustness




                                                 25	  
	  
        Appendix Table 3 shows estimates of a model that controls for combinations of

aggressiveness and responsiveness. Table 5b suggested that very few patients saw providers

with an estimated β significantly greater than one. Moreover, relatively few patients had

providers with β significantly less than one and α significantly greater than one. Therefore we

collapse this latter category together with β less than one and α equal to zero and consider only

four alternatives to the baseline case in which β=1 and α=0. These alternatives are: α<0 and

β>=1, α>0 and β>=1, α<0 and β<1, and α>=0 and β<1.

        Appendix Table 3 shows that given typical responsiveness, more aggressive providers

have better patient outcomes in both groups of patients. The next two rows show that low

responsiveness in the provider is associated with worse patient outcomes in patients who are

highly appropriate for invasive procedures. In patients who have low appropriateness for

invasive procedures, responsiveness has no effect if the physician is less aggressive than average

– in these physicians who perform small numbers of procedures, there may not be much scope

for reallocating procedures away from the low appropriateness patients. However, if the

physician is typically aggressive, then low responsiveness is harmful to the low appropriateness

patients, as in Table 6.

        Appendix Table 4 shows models similar to those in Table 6 except that they also include

the patients’ race, ethnicity, and type of insurance. These are variables that might be predictive

of patient outcomes, and might also be correlated with the type of treatment they receive.

However, including these variables has virtually no effect on the estimated coefficients of

practice style.



5. Conclusions


                                                26	  
	  
In this paper we contribute to the growing literature on provider practice style by developing a

framework that considers not only the provider’s overall propensity to perform an invasive

procedure, but also the way that the provider chooses to allocate procedures across patients. To

do so, we use the behavior of providers in accredited teaching hospitals to predict

which heart attack patients arriving in any ER are more or less appropriate candidates for

invasive procedures. This prediction is made using the patient’s diagnosis, demographic

characteristics, previous AMI history, and co-morbidities. Given these predictions we can

identify providers who are consistently more or less aggressive than the average, or whose

behavior in terms of matching patients to procedures (which we call responsiveness) deviates

significantly from the norm defined in the teaching hospitals.

       Our results suggest that all patient types benefit from aggressive treatment of heart

attacks using invasive procedures. Thus, being assigned a provider who is careful to allocate a

given number of invasive procedures to the most appropriate patients is good for these highly

appropriate patients, but bad for the lower appropriateness patients who are consequently less

likely to obtain these procedures. These results may be surprising given the extensive public

discussion of the possible overuse of aggressive, invasive procedures in patients who may not

need them. In our data, attempts to target procedures to the patients who are most likely to

benefit look less like reducing unnecessary procedure use, and more like rationing of a procedure

that is highly beneficial to most patients.

       It is worth reiterating that our models focus on differences in treatment patterns between

cardiologists working in the same hospital and year. We also restrict our attention to hospitals

that frequently perform invasive cardiac procedures. Hence, the differences in outcomes that we




                                                27	  
	  
find are not likely to be a function of the many possible differences between hospitals or even

within hospitals across years.12

                                                           These results extend the literature on provider practice style, showing that systematic

differences can be identified using simple machine learning protocols applied to routine hospital

discharge data. In addition, we show that these dimensions of practice style can be predicted

using observable provider characteristics. Both aggressiveness and responsiveness are persistent

over time, although providers tend to become both less responsive and less aggressive with

experience. We also show that U.S. trained cardiologists tend to be both less responsive and

more aggressive than those trained abroad. Providers from top 20 medical schools are an

exception in that they are both more responsive and much more aggressive than other physicians.

Lastly female cardiologists are significantly more responsive and less aggressive than their male

counterparts, while the reverse is true among Spanish-speaking physicians in Florida.

                                                           Our results suggest that simple machine learning algorithms can indeed be used to

characterize practice style and identify those styles associated with the best patient outcomes. In

principal, this information could in turn be used to evaluate and improve protocols affecting

patient treatment. In our example, reallocating procedures away from less appropriate towards

more appropriate patients hurts the former and helps the latter. This implies that invasive cardiac

procedures are underutilized and that more intensive use of these procedures would likely be

associated with better health outcomes in both types of patients.

         	  Factors that could explain differences between hospitals or within hospitals over time include,
for example, differences in the patient pool, capacity constraints, hospital-level protocols allocating
procedures to patients, or differences in the quality of nursing care.

Notes: These models are estimated using only patients in programs accredited to teach
internal medicine. These are coefficients from the logit model (not marginal effects).
Diagnoses codes 410.00, 410.20, 410.30, 410.32, 410.40, 410.50 and 410.60 were collinear with
the other variables included in the model and hence dropped from the regressions.
