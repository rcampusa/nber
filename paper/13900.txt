                                             ABSTRACT

This paper proposes a new test of the Protection for Sale (PFS) model by Grossman and Helpman
(1994). Unlike existing methods in the literature, our approach does not require any data on political
organizations. We formally show that the PFS model predicts that the quantile regression of the protection
measure on the inverse import penetration ratio divided by the import demand elasticity, should yield
a positive coefficient for quantiles close to one. We test this prediction using the data from Gawande
and Bandyopadhyay (2000). The results do not provide any evidence favoring the PFS model.

1    Introduction

There has been much interest in the political economy aspects of trade policy recently. In

part, this has been triggered by the easy to use theoretical framework in the Grossman and

Helpman (1994) "Protection for Sale" model (hereafter the PFS model). Empirical studies,

such as Goldberg and Maggi (1999) and Gawande and Bandyopadhyay (2000), have shown that

as predicted by the PFS framework, protection is positively related to the import penetration

ratio for politically unorganized industries, but negatively for politically organized ones.

    Thus, a key explanatory variable in estimating the PFS model is a dummy variable indi-

cating whether the industry is politically organized. We argue that this variable is hard to

construct in a satisfactory manner and how, because of this, existing tests of the PFS model

may be compromised. We then propose and implement a new test that does not require such

classi…cations to be made. Nor does it require data on contributions made to political parties,

data which is available for the US but is not usually available for other countries, which limit

the applicability of existing tests.

    Our approach exploits the following prediction of the PFS model: politically organized indus-

tries should have higher protection than unorganized ones given the inverse import penetration

ratio and other control variables. This suggests that industries with higher protection are more

likely to be politically organized, and thus for these industries, we should expect a positive re-

lationship between the inverse import penetration ratio and the protection measure. Thus, in a

quantile regression, we should see this relationship hold for the higher quantiles. We …nd that,

contrary to much of the literature, our new test does not provide empirical support for the PFS

model.

    What is the problem in classifying industries as organized or not? Past studies using US data

have encountered the following problem: while only politically organized industries are assumed



                                                 2
to make campaign contributions in the PFS model, the data indicate that all industries make

Political Action Committees’(PAC) contributions. Thus, if one follows the assumptions in the

PFS model that organized industries lobby while unorganized ones do not, all industries should

be classi…ed as politically organized. But in this case, the PFS model predicts the equilibrium

level of protection will be lower than when only industries with contributions above a positive

level are taken as organized. In fact, in the small country case, if all industries are taken to

be organized, and all agents own some of at most one factor, the equilibrium tari¤ equals the

optimal one, namely zero.

       To overcome this problem, past studies have used some simple rules for classi…cation. Gold-

berg and Maggi (1999) classi…ed an industry as politically organized if its PAC contribution

is greater than a pre-speci…ed threshold level. Gawande and Bandyopadhyay (2000) used a

regression-based procedure. Their procedure is based on the idea that if industries are politi-

cally organized, then industries with higher import penetration ratios are likely to make higher

campaign contributions.1

       Several questions naturally arise about these classi…cation rules. First, are their rules con-

sistent with the PFS model? Second, do their rules correctly distinguish between politically

organized and unorganized industries? And if there are classi…cation errors, would that lead to

bias in the parameter estimates of the PFS model?

       In this paper, we argue against their classi…cation rules. We formally derive the equilibrium

relationship between campaign contributions and the inverse import penetration ratio. We
   1
       More recently, a second generation of empirical studies has taken a di¤erent approach to reconciling theory

and the data. For example, Ederington and Minier (2005) extend the PFS model by hypothesizing that industries

can lobby for both trade and domestic policies. In their model, it is possible that some industries are politically

unorganized for trade policies and yet make contributions for domestic policies. Matschke (2006) takes a similar

approach. Since the models by Ederington and Minier (2005) and by Matschke (2006) are more comprehensive

than the PFS model, the authors impose additional assumptions to make the models tractable for estimation.



                                                         3
then use the theoretical result to provide a simple numerical example of the PFS model where

the level of the industry’s contribution varies greatly depending on its import penetration.

Speci…cally, politically organized industries may make very small contributions if their import

penetration is high. This implies that using a particular threshold of campaign contribution

as a device to distinguish between politically organized and unorganized industries as is done

in Goldberg and Maggi (1999) results in mis-classi…cation and is inconsistent with the PFS

model. Furthermore, in our numerical example, import penetration and equilibrium campaign

contributions are negatively correlated. This is exactly the opposite of the relationship that is

assumed by Gawande and Bandyopadhyay (2000) and most papers using their data; when the

import penetration and the PAC contributions per value added are positively correlated, they

classify industries as politically organized. We argue that if we were to reclassify the politically

organized industries, then their parameter estimates no longer support the PFS hypothesis.

   We also argue that due to classi…cation error, the estimation strategies used in Goldberg

and Maggi (1999) and Gawande and Bandyopadhyay (2000) cannot provide consistent estimates.

Estimation of the PFS model involves regressing a trade protection measure on the inverse import

penetration ratio and its interaction term with the political organization dummy. The inverse

import penetration ratio should be treated as an endogenous regressor, as has been discussed

in the literature (e.g., Tre‡er, 1993). Potential mis-classi…cation of industries makes it even

more challenging to estimate the PFS model, since the political organization dummy would also

be econometrically endogenous in the presence of classi…cation error. As Goldberg and Maggi

(1999) and Gawande and Bandyopadhyay (2000) were both fully aware of these problems, they

used an IV strategy which, at a …rst glance, appears to provide consistent estimates. This paper

shows that if the PFS model is true, then the existence of the classi…cation error results in the

disturbance term in the estimating equation being a function of the inverse import penetration

ratio. It is therefore impossible to …nd an instrument that is correlated with the inverse import


                                                 4
penetration ratio and uncorrelated with the disturbance term as needed.

   In sum, we argue that if we are to structurally estimate the PFS model using the data used

by Goldberg and Maggi (1999) and Gawande and Bandyopadhyay (2000), we should not use

an arbitrary classi…cation scheme along with the campaign contributions to generate political

organization dummies. The structural estimation and testing of the PFS model would require

treatment of the political organization dummies to be fully consistent with the prediction of the

PFS model. To our knowledge, this has not been done in the literature.

   Given the shortcomings of the classi…cation rules used in the literature, an approach, such

as ours, that does not require such a classi…cation to be made has obvious advantages. Since, as

we show below, our approach relies on the relationship between observables (i.e., the protection

measure, import penetration, and import demand elasticity) implied by the PFS model, it is

entirely consistent with the PFS framework. Moreover, since our estimating equation does not

require classi…cation of industries into organized and unorganized ones our approach is free from

the risk of mis-classi…cation. Furthermore, our approach expands the realm of testing the PFS

model, as it is applicable for many countries where contribution data are unavailable.

   We use quantile regression (Koenker and Bassett, 1978) and more recent work on instru-

mental variable (IV) quantile regression (Chernozhukov and Hansen, 2004a; 2004b; 2006) to

empirically test the predictions of the PFS model in a quantile IV famework using the same

data as Gawande and Bandyopadhyay (2000). We …nd that the estimated relationship is nega-

tive instead of positive, and insigni…cant, casting serious doubt on the validity of the PFS model.

We then discuss several possible explanations for the results.

   The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the PFS model

and past empirical studies. Section 3 details our approach to testing the PFS model. Section

4 brie‡y describes the data used in this study. Section 5 presents the estimation results. In

Section 6, we further discuss our results. Section 7 concludes.

2.1        The PFS Model

The exposition in this section relies heavily on Grossman and Helpman (1994). There is a

continuum of individuals, each of in…nitesimal size. Each individual has preferences that are

linear in the consumption of the numeraire good and are additively separable across all goods.

As a result, there are no income e¤ects and no cross price e¤ects in demand which comes from

equating marginal utility to own price. On the production side, there is perfect competition in a

speci…c factor setting: each good is produced by a factor speci…c to the industry, ki in industry i,

and a mobile factor, labor, L. Thus, each speci…c factor is the residual claimant in its industry.

Some industries are organized, and being organized or not is exogenous to the model. Tari¤

revenue is redistributed to all agents in a lump sum manner. Owners of the speci…c factors in

organized industries make up the lobby group which can make contributions to the government

to in‡uence policy if it raises their total welfare. Government cares about both the contributions

made to it and social welfare and puts a relative weight of              on social welfare, W (p) where p is

the domestic price and equals the tari¤ vector plus the world price p .2

        The timing of the game is as follows: …rst, lobbies simultaneously bid contribution functions

that specify the contributions made contingent on the trade policy adopted (which determines

domestic prices). The government then chooses what to do to maximize its own objective

function. In this way, the government is the common agent all principals (organized lobbies)

are trying to in‡uence. Such games are known to have a continuum of equilibria. By restricting

agents to bids that are “truthful” so that their bids have the same curvature as their welfare, a

unique equilibrium can be obtained.3 The equilibrium outcome in this unique equilibrium is as if

        For a detailed discussion of this concept, see Bernheim and Whinston (1986). The working paper version of

this paper provides a new elementary proof of their result.

welfare of organized industries. In other words, equilibrium tari¤s can be found by maximizing

where J0 is the set of politically organized industries.

      In their model, the welfare of the lobby group in industry j is

where      j (pj )   is producer surplus in industry j; lj is labor income of the owners of the speci…c

factors employed in industry j, wage is unity, Nj =N =                              j   is the fraction of agents who own the

speci…c factor j, while T (p) + S(p) is the sum of tari¤ revenue and consumer surplus in the

economy. Maximizing G(p) gives, after some manipulation4 :


                                 xj (pj )(Ij         L)   + (pj        pj )m0j (pj )( +        L)   = 0,                     (1)


where Ij is unity if j is organized and zero otherwise,                             L    (assuming that each individual owns

at most one speci…c factor) corresponds to the fraction of the population that owns the speci…c

capital of organized industries, zj = xj (pj )=mj (pj ) where xj (pj ) and mj (pj ) denote the supply

and imports of industry j; while ej =                     m0j (pj )pj =mj (pj ). Rewriting equation (1) using the fact

that (pj      pj ) = tj pj where tj is the tari¤ rate gives:

                                                 tj               Ij        L       zj
                                                      =                                    .

This is the basis of the key estimating equation, which we call the protection equation:

                                                   tj     zj     zj

related to it.


2.2       A Problem in Estimation — the Classi…cation of Industries

To make equation (2) estimable, an error term is added in a linear fashion:

                                           tj     zj     zj
                                                =    + Ij +            j.                                        (3)
                                         1 + tj   ej     ej

The error term,       j,   is interpreted as the composite of variables potentially a¤ecting protection

that may have been left out and the measurement error of the dependent variable. To allow for

the fact that a signi…cant fraction of industries have zero protection in the data, equation (3)

can be modi…ed as follows:

                                     tj                 zj     zj
                                          = M ax           + Ij +        j; 0   .                                (4)
                                   1 + tj               ej     ej

To test the key prediction (i.e.,          < 0,      > 0 and       +     > 0), equations (3) and (4) have

been estimated in a number of previous studies (e.g., Goldberg and Maggi, 1999; Gawande and

Bandyopadhyay, 2000; McCalman, 2004).5

       Although data on the measure of trade protection, the import penetration ratio, and the

import-demand elasticities are often available, it is harder to de…ne whether an industry is polit-

ically organized or not. To deal with this problem, Goldberg and Maggi (1999) (GM from here

on) used data on campaign contributions at the three-digit SIC industry level. An industry is

categorized to be politically organized if the campaign contribution exceeds a speci…ed threshold
   5
       Goldberg and Maggi (1999) and others note that    < 0,   > 0, and    +       > 0 are only necessary conditions

for the validity of the PFS speci…cation. However, the literature appears to take the right sign of the coe¢ cients

of the protection equation as strong empirical support of the PFS paradigm. Recently, Imai et al. (2008) criticize

this by pointing out that even when estimating the PFS equation on an arti…cial data simulated from a simple

non-optimizing model without a PFS element, one obtains parameter estimates consistent with the PFS model.

This suggests that to truly test the PFS model, other implications of the model need to be considered.


                                                        8
level. Gawande and Bandyopadhyay (2000) (GB from here on) used a di¤erent procedure for

classi…cation. They run a regression where the dependent variable is the log of the corporate

PAC spending per contributing …rm relative to value added and the regressors include the inter-

action of the import penetration from …ve countries into the sub-industry and the two-digit SIC

dummies. Industries are classi…ed as politically organized if any of the coe¢ cients on its …ve

interaction terms are found to be positive. This procedure is based on the idea that in organized

industries, an increase in contributions would likely occur when import penetration increased.

       Both these procedures are questionable.6 Below we o¤er a formal argument that claims:

(1) in estimating the protection equation, mis-classi…cation of industries results in inconsistent

parameter estimates; (2) both of the above classi…cation approaches are inconsistent with the

PFS model and result in mis-classi…cation of industries.

       Notice that the classi…cation error results in the error term in the estimating equation (3)

being      j   +   j zj =ej   where   j   is the classi…cation error. Since the error term is a function of

zj =ej , any variable correlated with the inverse import penetration ratio cannot be used as an

instrument, which makes the instrumenting of the term zj =ej impossible. For the same reason,

instruments for political organization should not be correlated with zj =ej , but GM and GB use

the same instruments used for zj =ej , which have to be correlated with zj =ej , as instruments for

the political organization dummy as well.

       Next, we discuss the second claim. Given the model and the menu auction equilibrium of the

PFS model, it is easy to verify that the equilibrium campaign contribution schedule should be

such that government welfare in equilibrium should equal the maximized value of the government

objective function when industry i is not making any contributions at all. Thus, the equilibrium

       In addition to the arguments below, assuming that all contributions are directed towards in‡uencing trade

policies may be inappropriate. Also, ignoring other variables that potentially in‡uence political clout, such as

industry size and electoral districts where the industry is concentrated, is also a potential problem.

                                                                                j J0 ;j6=i

equilibrium contributions are essentially the di¤erence in the value of the function Hi (p) : RN

! R between p(i) and pE .

       Let p(t) be a path from pE to p(i) as t goes from zero to unity. Since the line integral is

path independent, we can choose this path as desired. In particular, we can choose it so that
                                                                              h          i
p(t) = pE + t p(i) pE so that p(t = 0) = pE , p(t = 1) = p(i), and Dp(t) = p(i) pE .

       Hence,

Thus, depending on         i,   ,       L,   xj (:), and zj =ej , Bi (pE ) can be small even for politically organized

industries.9 Hence, classifying political organization based on a uniform threshold, as done in

GM and others, leads to classi…cation error.

       We provide a simple example, where we assume there are 400 industries (N = 400), of which

200 are politically organized (Np = 200). We set pi = 2:0,                                        = 50:0,                L     = 0:508,       i   =     L =N ,


and xi = 10000. We also set zi =ei = i=1000 for industries i = 1; :::; Np which are politically

organized and zNp +i =eNp +i = i=1000 for industries Np +i = Np +1; :::; N which are not politically

organized.

       In Figure 1, we present the equilibrium campaign contributions for politically organized

industries.10 Notice that the campaign contributions vary from 0 to 40, depending on the
   9
       Below we present a simple example of such a case.
  10
       We did not plot the campaigin contributions of politically unorganized industries becase they obviously are

zero.


                                                                        11
value of z=e. This illustrates the possibility that the GM classi…cation based on a threshold of

campaign contribution may mis-classify industries with low campaign contribution and low z=e

as politically unorganized.

   Figure 1 also shows that the campaign contribution increases with z=e for the politically

organized industries. In other words, for politically organized industries, the campaign con-

tributions are negatively correlated with the import penetration. This is the opposite of the

relationship used by GB to classify political organization. Our example therefore suggests that

the correct organized industries may be the ones which GB classi…ed as unorganized and vice

versa, i.e., I = 1     IGB where IGB is the politically organization dummy by GB. This has an

important implication for the interpretation of parameter estimates of equation (3) obtained by

GB: although their estimates seem consistent with the PFS predictions (i.e.,                      GB   < 0,   GB   > 0,

and   GB   +   GB   > 0), they are not, given the correct political organization dummy. This can

be easily seen by noticing that when I = 1                    IGB is the political organization dummy, the

protection equation should be

                              tj                        zj                        zj
                                   =(   GB   +   GB )           GB   (1   IGB )      + "j .
                            1 + tj                      ej                        ej

This implies b =       GB   +   GB   > 0, b =       GB       < 0, and b + b =          GB     < 0, which is clearly

inconsistent with the PFS framework.

   The positive relationship between campaign contributions and z=e in the simulated model

is in line with the PFS model; it predicts that for politically organized industries, protection is

positively related to z=e and hence campaign contributions and z=e are likely to be positively

related as long as greater campaign contributions tend to result in higher protection. We now

check the relationship in the data. Figure 2 shows the scatterplot where the x-axis is log(z=e)

and y-axis is the log of per value added campaign contributions. This data is exactly what

was used in GB. Figure 3 depicts the scatterplot where the x-axis is log(z=e) and the y-axis is


                                                         12
the log of campaign contributions, using the data by Facchini et al. (2006) who reconstructed

the Goldberg and Maggi (1999) dataset.11 We use logs to minimize the e¤ect of outliers. In

both …gures, we can see that the relationship between the two is negative. It is needless to

say that these results by no means statistically reject the PFS framework. A more rigorous

estimation and testing exercise of the PFS model using campaign contribution data is left for

future research.



3         A Proposed Approach

3.1         Quantile Regression

In this section, we detail our approach to testing the PFS model. The advantage of our approach

is that it allows us to test the PFS model without an arbitrary classi…cation of the political

organization. The approach relies heavily on the relationship between observables implied by

the PFS model.

         Equation (4) and the restrictions on the coe¢ cients have at least two implications. First,

as has been discussed in the literature, z=e has a negative e¤ect on the level of protection for

politically unorganized industries while it has a positive e¤ect for politically organized ones.

Second, given z=e, politically organized industries have higher protection. These implications

lead to the following claim: given z=e, high-protection industries are more likely to be politically

organized and thus the e¤ect of an increase in z=e on protection tends to be that of politically

organized industries.

         The logic of this argument is illustrated in Figure 4 where the distribution of t= (1 + t) is

plotted for given z=e. The variation of t= (1 + t) given z=e occurs for two reasons. First, because

some industries are organized while others are not and these two behave di¤erently, and second,
    11
         This had to be done as the data of GM has not been made available to other researchers.




                                                          13
because of the error term. As a result, the distribution of t= (1 + t) comes from a mixture of two

distributions, namely those for the politically organized industries and those for the unorganized.

These two distributions for some given values of z=e are plotted in Figure 4. The two dashed

lines give the conditional expectations of t= (1 + t) for the organized and unorganized industries

as a function of z=e. In line with the PFS model, the two lines start at the same vertical intercept

point and the line for the organized industries is increasing while the other is decreasing in z=e.

For each z=e, if we look at the industries with high t= (1 + t), they tend to be the politically

organized ones. Thus, at high quantiles, the relationship between t= (1 + t) and z=e should be

that for organized industries, i.e., should be increasing as depicted by the solid line labelled the

90th quantile in Figure 4.

   The relevant proposition (Proposition 1) and proof can be found in Appendix 1. The propo-

sition essentially states that in the quantile regression of t=(1 + t) on z=e, the coe¢ cient on z=e

should be close to   + > 0 at the quantiles close to     = 1. To empirically examine this, we use

quantile regression (Koenker and Bassett, 1978) and estimate the following equation:


                                QT ( jZ) =    ( )+     ( ) Z=10000,                             (7)


where    denotes quantile, T = t=(1 + t), Z = z=e, and QT ( jZ) is the conditional -th quantile

function of T . If the PFS model is correct, it is expected that   ( ) converges to ( + ) > 0 as

  approaches its highest level of unity from below.

   In the quantile regression, Z is assumed to be an exogenous variable. However, Z is likely to

be endogenous as discussed in the literature and hence the parameter estimates of the quantile

regression are likely to be inconsistent. It is therefore important to allow for the potential

endogeneity of Z. We formally show that even in the presence of this endogeneity, the main

prediction of the PFS model in terms of our quantile approach does not change. The relevant

proposition (proposition 2), an analogue of proposition 1, is presented in Appendix 1. To test


                                                14
the prediction in the presence of possible endogeneity of Z, we estimate the following equation

by using IV quantile regression (Chernozhukov and Hansen, 2004a; 2004b; 2006):


                             P (T       ( )+    ( ) Z=10000jW ) = ,                             (8)


where W is a set of instrumental variables.

   Importantly, nowhere in equations (7) and (8) is the political organization dummy present;

these equations involve only variables that are readily available. This way our approach does

not require classi…cation of industries in any manner and as a result, we can avoid any biases

due to mis-classi…cation.

   An issue that we need to deal with is the endogeneity of political organization. We do so …rst

by controlling for capital-labor ratio. This is essentially equivalent to allowing the capital-labor

ratio to be a determining factor for the probability of political organization. This speci…cation

is motivated by Mitra (1999) who provides a theory of endogenous lobby formation. His model

predicts that among others, industries with higher levels of capital stock are more likely to be

politically organized.

   But even after controlling for the capital-labor ratio, there still could remain a correlation

between the error term of the equation determining the political organization and the error term

of equation (4). Since our method is not subject to classi…cation error, one of the main sources

of correlation between the error terms in the two equations in GM and other studies, we are

less subject to this criticism. In those studies, classi…cation error enters both the disturbance

term of the equation determining the political organization and the disturbance term of the

protection equation. Thus, classi…cation error would necessarily result in correlation between

the disturbance terms. Moreover, as long as the error term of the equation determining political

organization and that of the protection equation is positively correlated, or as long as the

negative correlation is not too strong, our quantile IV procedure will still be consistent. This


                                                15
is because only when the negative correlation in the errors is very strong (large positive shocks

in protection are correlated with shocks that make an industry unorganized) could the most

protected industries have industries that are not organized. We believe this scenario to be

unlikely.



4         A Brief Description of the Data

We use part of the data used in Gawande and Bandyopadhyay (2000).12 The data consist of

242 four-digit SIC industries in the United States. In the dataset, the extent of protection, t;

is measured by the nontari¤ barrier (NTB) coverage ratio. This is standard procedure in the

literature (e.g., Goldberg and Maggi, 1999; Mitra et al., 2002). z is measured as the inverse

of the ratio of consumption to total imports scaled by 10; 000. e is derived from Shiells et al.

(1986) and corrected for measurement error by GB. A brief description of the variables used

in the current study is provided in Table 1. See GB for more details along with the sample

statistics of the variables. Of particular note about the data is that 114 of 242 industries (47%)

have zero protection. This suggests the potential importance of dealing with the corner solution

outcome of T .

  ( ) > 0. Moreover, the point estimates indicate that contrary to the PFS prediction, the                   ( )

are all negative at high quantiles and decrease as             goes from 0:4 to 0:9, and some of them are

statistically signi…cant at the 5 percent level.

       Note that     and      are estimated to be zero at the 0:1-0:4 quantiles. This suggests that the

corner solution (T = 0) greatly a¤ects the estimates at lower quantiles. From this evidence, it is

conjectured that the existence of corners also a¤ects the estimates at the mean. Thus, …ndings

based on the linear model (i.e., equation (3)) in GB, Bombardini (2005), and others are likely to

be subject to bias due to the corner solution problem. In contrast, our method does not su¤er

from the problem, since the focus is mainly on the higher quantiles where the e¤ect of corner

solution is minimal. In addition, our method has a distinct advantage over the other estimation

strategy in the literature. To address the corner solution problem, several studies (e.g., Goldberg

and Maggi, 1999; Facchini et al., 2006) estimate a system of equations: equation (4) as well as

an import penetration equation and an equation for political organization. While dealing with

the existence of corners, this strategy requires the joint normality assumption on the error terms

which potentially a¤ects the estimation results. In contrast, our results are not driven by the

parametric assumption on the error term; it is not required by the quantile regression.14

       One might wish to control for various factors as well. Following GB, we control for tari¤ of in-

termediate goods (IN T ERM T AR) and NTB coverage of intermediate goods (IN T ERM N T B).

As column (2) of Table 2 shows, our main …ndings do not change;                    ( ) still decreases (for the

most part) from zero to a negative value with the increase in                  , contrary to what the PFS

model predicts.         and     are found to be zero at the 0:1 and 0:2 quantiles, again suggesting the

importance of corner solution.
  14
       Of course, these advantages come with a cost. That is, the quantile approach does not allow us to estimate

the structural parameters      and   separately.

5.2      IV Quantile Regression Results

Table 3 presents the estimation results of equation (8). Our choice of instruments is guided

by GB where they used 34 distinct instruments, their quadratic terms, and some of the two-

term cross products. We use a subset of their instruments (17 instruments) indicated in Table 1.

These are also used in Bombardini (2005) as the basic instruments.15 First, we use two sets of in-

struments. Instrument set 1 consists of the 17 instruments, their squared terms, IN T ERM T AR

and IN T ERM N T B and their squared terms. Instrument set 2 includes instrument set 1 and

their interaction terms. The IV quantile results for the instrument set 1 are reported in column

(1) of Table 3. As in the quantile regression, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that (0:9) = 0

in favor of the one-sided alternative. The point estimates are not favorable for the PFS model,

either; even after correcting for the endogeneity of Z, the estimate of             at the highest quantile

is not positive as required by the PFS model. The results remain virtually the same when we

use the instrument set 2 as IV’s, as column (2) indicates.

      The estimation results where the capital labor ratio is controlled for are presented in columns

(3) and (4) of Table 3.        ( )0 s are again estimated to be zero at        = 0:1 regardless of whether

we use instrument set 1 or 2. At high quantiles,            ( )0 s are estimated to be negative for most

of ’s . Although the point estimate of          (0:9) is positive when we use instrument set 2, the null

hypothesis cannot be rejected in favor of the one-sided alternative.

      Although we use a subset of GB’s instruments, our results may be driven by too many

instruments. Thus, we further estimate equation (8) using only one of the following instruments

at a time: SCIEN T IST S, M AN AGERS, and CROSSELI and using all of them (see Table

1 for their de…nitions). These instruments are found to be strongly correlated with Z in GB.

The results are presented in columns (5) - (12) of Table 3. The results suggest that having many

instruments a¤ects the estimates of         ( ). Speci…cally, the absolute magnitude of the coe¢ cients

      We are grateful to Matilde Bombardini for providing us with the program for her PFS estimation.

now become far larger than that obtained with the larger number of instruments. Nonetheless,

our main …ndings appear to be robust; regardless of which instrument we use and whether we

control for capital-labor ratio, the null hypothesis at the highest quantile cannot be rejected.

Moreover, the point estimates of             ( ) are negative at high quantiles, in fact, they are zero at low

quantiles and negative at any other quantiles, which is inconsistent with the PFS’s prediction.



6         Discussion

There are several possible explanations for our results. The …rst possibility is heteroskedasticity.

If the error term has higher variance when the industry is politically unorganized, i.e.,


                                                "j = wj + (1       Ij )   j;                                       (9)


then politically unorganized industries would have error terms with much higher variance.16 As

a result, they would be the ones that dominate in high quantiles as well as in low quantiles,

whereas the politically organized industries would be found mostly around the median. Hence,

at high quantiles, the negative quantile regression coe¢ cients correspond to , which is negative,

and not          +      > 0. This may explain the presence of negative slope coe¢ cients in the higher
    16
         If equation (9) is indeed the error structure, then the PFS equation is modi…ed to be:

                                           tj       zj   zj
                                                =      +    Ij + & j (1   Ij ) + wj :
                                         1 + tj     ej   ej

Importantly, the modi…ed equation has an additional term 1           Ij with a random coe¢ cient & j . That is, we need

an error term with a richer stochastic structure to make the model consistent to the data. However, the more we

rely on the complexity of the stochastic structure of the error term instead of the model to …t the data, the less

attractive becomes the treatment of the error term as an "add on" to the structural model. And if we decide not

to arbitrarily add an error term to the reduced form of the deterministic model, the original lobbying model needs

to be substantially modi…ed to explicitly include stochastic shocks so that the reduced form of the stochastic

model results to the modi…ed equation above. Then, it would be unclear whether …ndings in past studies (i.e.,

 < 0,        > 0, and    +   > 0) can be interpreted as being in support of the PFS paradigm.

quantiles. The possibility cannot be completely ruled out. However, given that almost all

industries have positive campaign contributions and both GM and GB report that more than

half of the industries are politically organized, it is reasonable to think that a signi…cant fraction

of the industries are likely to be politically organized. In that case, it is surprising to …nd that

the slope coe¢ cients of the quantile regressions are negative at almost all quantiles except for

the zeros at low quantiles, which comes from the corners.

    Second, the small sample may make it di¢ cult for our approach to provide evidence favoring

the PFS model. This problem can be overcome by using more disaggregated data, although

such an exercise is beyond the scope of the current paper.

    Third, note that if the political organization were correctly assigned in GB, as argued above,

then our results are not inconsistent with those of GB. Recall that in our simple example where

we computed the relationship between the equilibrium campaign contribution and z=e for polit-

ically organized industries, it was positive instead of negative. If the positive relationship holds

in reality, we argued that the industries that were originally classi…ed as politically organized

should be classi…ed as unorganized and vice versa, so that the true results of the GB protection

equation estimation should be b > 0, b < 0 and b + b < 0, which is indeed consistent with our

quantile regression and quantile IV results.



7    Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed and implemented a new test of the PFS model that does not require

data on political organizations. The …ndings so far are not supportive of the PFS model. Clearly,

more work is needed on this. One fruitful research avenue might be to look at countries other

than the United States using our approach as it does not require data on political organization.

Another research avenue is to use more disaggregated data so that our approach can provide



                                                 20
statistically more clear-cut evidence. Finally, other predictions of the PFS model such as those

on equilibrium contribution levels predicted by the PFS model relative to actual contributions

need to be tested.

Appendix 1: Quantile Regression

Proposition 1 (Quantile Regression) Assume that (1) Zj is bounded below by a positive

number, i.e. there exists Z > 0 such that Zj                                         Z, (2)                j   has a smooth density function which

has support that is bounded from above and below, (3)                                                  j       is independent of both Zj and and Ij ,

and (4)      > 0. Then, for            su¢ ciently close to 1,                                   quantile conditional on Zj can be expressed

as

1, we have     0   close enough to 1 such that

                                           1       0                             1           0                              1

Substituting equations (13), (14), and (15) into (12), we obtain


                                                                                 1     0

                                     = P (Ij = 0) +                    P (Ij = 0) = .


Therefore, for     su¢ ciently close to 1,


                                                              1    0

   We make two remarks on the assumptions. First, we assume that                                j   has bounded support

(assumption 2). This assumption is reasonable since the protection measure is usually derived

from the NTB coverage ratio (e.g., Goldberg and Maggi, 1999; Gawande and Bandyopadhyay,

2000) and therefore it is clearly bounded above and below. Second, we assume that                                  j   is

independent of both Zj and and Ij (assumption 3). This is rather a strong assumption and will

be relaxed next. In particular, we allow Zj to be correlated with                          j.


   Assume the model is as follows:


                                    Tj   =        Zj +    j   if Ij = 0

                                    Tj   = ( + ) Zj +                  j   if Ij = 1


where

                                             Zj = g (Wj ; vj ) .


Wj is an instrument vector and vj is a random variable independent of Wj . We will show that

 ( ) ! ( + ) > 0 as         % 1.



                                                         26
   Let us de…ne uj as follows:


                                j   = E [ j jvj ] + uj ; uj               j    E [ j jvj ] ,


where uj is assumed to be i.i.d. distributed. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that both uj

and E [ j jvj ] are uniformly bounded, hence so is                  j.   Furthermore,

Then, for Ij = 0 the model satis…es the assumptions A1-A5 of Chernozhukov and Hansen (2006).

Similarly for Ij = 1. Therefore, from Theorem 1 of Chernozhukov and Hansen (2006), it follows

that

and

Proposition 2 (Quantile IV) Assume that Zj is bounded below by a positive number, i.e.

there exists Z > 0 such that Zj          Z. Then, for               su¢ ciently close to 1,

From the de…nition of               0,   for           % 1,          0   % 1 as well. Because                    is uniformly bounded, for

su¢ ciently close to 1, we have                    0   close enough to 1 such that

It follows that for           su¢ ciently close to 1,

     Note: This table provides the estimation results of equation (8). Standard errors are in parentheses. When we use all three instruments (i.e., SCIEN T IST S,

     M AN AGERS, and CROSSELI), standard errors are calculated by 200 bootstrap resampling. GB Controls and K=L indicate whether IN T ERM T AR

     and IN T ERM N T B are controlled for and whether (K=L)i , (i =1,2,3,4) are controlled for, respectively. Instruments indicate which variables are used as

     instrumental variables. For the de…nition of these variables, see Table 1.
