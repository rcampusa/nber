We derive a new formula for the optimal uniform tariff in a small-country, heterogeneous-firm
model with roundabout production and a nontraded good. Tariffs are applied on imported
intermediate inputs. First-best policy requires that markups on domestic intermediate inputs are
offset by subsidies. In a second-best setting where such subsidies are not used, the double-
marginalization of domestic markups creates a strong incentive to lower the optimal tariff on
imported inputs. In a 186-country quantitative model, the median optimal tariff is 10%, and
negative for five countries, as compared to 27% in manufacturing from the one-sector, optimal
tariff formula without roundabout production.

1   Introduction

The use of tariffs to protect traded goods such as manufactures has a long history. In his famous

Report on Manufactures, Alexander Hamilton argues for moderate tariffs combined with direct sub-

sidies to promote manufacturing. Opposition to the proposed subsidies came from Thomas Jeffer-

son and James Madison, who favored even higher tariffs, and Madison's administration produced

the first protectionist tariff in the United States (Irwin, 2004). The administration of President Don-

ald Trump enacted tariffs, often at 25%, to protect several manufacturing industries and against a

broad range of products from China. Significantly, the Chinese products were initially selected to

minimize the direct impact on consumer prices, leaving American businesses facing the brunt of

tariffs on their imported inputs (Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy and Khandelwal, 2020).

    Does modern trade theory offer any new answer to this old question of whether to protect the

traded sector? To answer this, we investigate a small-country model with two sectors ­ one traded

and the other nontraded ­ and with heterogeneous firms, monopolistic competition and CES pref-

erences (as in Melitz, 2003). We adopt a Pareto distribution for productivity (as in Chaney, 2008)

and also roundabout production (as in Caliendo and Parro, 2015). The differentiated intermediate

inputs in each sector are bundled into a finished good that is sold to home consumers and firms

in that sector, but not traded, while the differentiated inputs are traded in one sector. A tariff is

applied to imports of these differentiated intermediate inputs.

    Demidova and Rodr´
                     iguez-Clare (2009) obtain a formula for the optimal uniform tariff in a

small country with one sector and no roundabout production, which we denote by topt . Because

there is no roundabout production, we can think of this tariff as applying to imported final dif-

ferentiated goods. They argue that this single tariff instrument obtains the first-best by offsetting

two distortions: the need to correct for the markup on domestic final goods (by applying a tariff

equal to that markup) and the externality present because imported varieties bring surplus that

is not taken into account in domestic spending (by slightly lowering the tariff). When there is

roundabout production, topt does not correct for the double-marginalization that occurs when the

markup on domestic differentiated inputs is passed-through to the price of the bundled finished

good, which is further used as an input to the production of other differentiated inputs. In a



                                                  2
closed economy, we show that this double-marginalization is corrected by applying a subsidy on

the bundled finished good. When this subsidy is not used, however, then a second-best policy

available in an open economy is to lower the import tariff below topt , thereby lowering the price of

the bundled finished good. Our main result is to show that the optimal second-best tariff on intermediate

inputs is below topt , provided that a certain (small) amount of roundabout production is present.

   We obtain the optimal uniform, second-best tariff as a fixed-point of a formula that has two

new terms: a M term that reflects the relative monopoly distortion between the traded and non-

traded sectors; and a R term that reflects roundabout production in the traded sector, which ampli-

fies the monopoly distortion there. In a 186-country, 15-sector quantitative version of the model,

the optimal uniform tariff has a median value of only 10% (or 7.5% for countries with above-

median shares of manufacturing production), as compared to topt of 27.3% in a one-sector model

with manufacturing parameters, and is negative for five countries: Bhutan, Myanmar, New Cale-

donia, Hong Kong, and Spain.

   Costinot, Rodr´
                 iguez-Clare and Werning (2020) analyze optimal tariffs on final differentiated

goods with very general tastes and technologies, and they show that optimal tariffs can be lowered

(and even made negative) by having multiple sectors, a non-Pareto distribution for productivity,

or linear foreign preferences. They are the first to extend the analysis to nonuniform tariffs, and

they find that the importing country should use an import subsidy on the least efficient foreign

exporters. Haaland and Venables (2016) demonstrated a potential second-best role for reduced

trade taxes to offset a monopoly distortion, building on earlier work by Flam and Helpman (1987).

Lashkaripour and Lugovsky (2020) analyze optimal uniform first-best tariffs with multiple sectors

and input-output linkages, but when considering second-best tariffs, they do not incorporate these

linkages. As far as we are aware, then, the literature has not addressed the realistic case that

we examine here: second-best tariffs in the presence of roundabout production and a nontraded

sector. That is the critical gap we aim to fill, by providing a formula for the second-best tariff in

this setting and by characterizing the generality of low optimal tariffs on intermediate inputs.

2    Two-Sector Economy with Roundabout Production

We analyze a two-sector Melitz (2003)-Chaney (2008) model with roundabout production, similar

to Arkolakis, Costinot, and Rodr´
                                iguez-Clare (2012, section IV) and Costinot and Rodr´
                                                                                    iguez-Clare

(2014). We summarize key equations here and Appendix A contains the full model. There are two

countries, k = i, j, and two sectors s = 1, 2, where sector 1 is traded and sector 2 is nontraded.

County i is a small open economy, and the foreign country j = i is the rest of the world. In the

foreign country, for simplicity we assume a single traded sector, s = 1.

    In both sectors, firms produce differentiated inputs under monopolistic competition, which

are costlessly bundled into a finished good in CES fashion, with elasticity s > 1. The finished good

is non-traded, and it is sold to domestic consumers as final goods and also to domestic firms as

intermediate inputs, used to produce differentiated inputs (e.g. firms produce machinery parts

using machines). In sector 1, the traded differentiated inputs are subject to iceberg costs and the

imported varieties are subject to a tariff, where one plus the ad valorem tariff for country i imports

from j is denoted by t ji1 ; for simplicity, there is no foreign tariff.

    The finished output in each sector has quantity Qis , price index Pis , and value Yis  Pis Qis .

With roundabout production, the marginal cost of producing a differentiated input for a firm with

productivity s = 1 in sector s is
                                                          1-is
                                              xis  wi is Pis     ,                                 (1)

where 0 < is  1 is the labor share. We refer to (1) as the input cost index.
                                                            e to receive a productivity draw from
    A mass of firms Nis incur fixed labor costs of entry f is

a Pareto distribution, Gs ( s ) = 1 - - s
                                      s , with s  1 and s > s - 1. As is familiar from the

Melitz-Chaney model, firms choose to produce the differentiated input for the domestic market

or to export if their productivities exceed some cutoff levels, and in each case, the firms then incur

additional fixed labor costs.

    Consumers have Cobb-Douglas preferences over final goods in the two sectors:


                                                       i 1-  i
                                               Ui = Ci1 Ci2 ,                                      (2)




                                                      4
where i > 0 is the expenditure share on the traded sector 1. Consumer income Ii includes labor

income (the only factor of production) wi Li , plus rebated tariff and tax revenue Bi , while free entry

ensures that expected firm profits equal zero.

   Domestic consumer demand for finished goods equals i Ii in sector 1 and (1 - i ) Ii in sector

2. Let ijs denote the expenditure share of differentiated inputs that country j purchases from

country i, so iis = 1 -  jis is the domestic expenditure share with  ji2  0 and ii2  1 in

the nontraded sector 2. Then the total production cost of all differentiated inputs in sector 1 in
               1 -1
country i is   1      k=i, j ik1 Yk1 ; namely, the domestic sales and exports of differentiated inputs in
sector 1, adjusted by markups. Given the share (1 - is ) of costs in (1) going to the finished good,

the demand for that good in sector 1 comes from domestic consumers and from domestic firms

producing those differentiated inputs for sale in both countries:

                                                                                                     s - 1
           Yi1 = i (wi Li + Bi ) + ~ i1 iis Yi1 + ij1 Yj1 , with ~ is  (1 - is )                                 < 1,   (3)
                                                                                                      s

while in the nontraded sector 2 this equation is simply Yi2 = (1 - i )(wi Li + Bi ) + ~ i2 Yi2 . The

parameter ~ is eliminates markups from the value of intermediate inputs before computing the

cost share, (1 - is ), devoted to the finished good as an input.

   The expenditure shares and the cutoff productivities are determined in equilibrium (see Ap-

pendix A), and we normalize the foreign wage at unity. The term ij1 Yj1 appearing in (3) is the

value of country i exports of the differentiated inputs. Under balanced trade, this must equal the

net-of-tariff value of imports. Letting t ji1 denote one plus the ad valorem import tariff used by
                                ji1
country i, then ij1 Yj1 =      t ji1 Yi1 .   Entry is proportional to the demand for those inputs for home
                                                                        ji1
sale, ii1 Yi1 , plus the demand for exports, ij1 Yj1 =                 t ji1 Yi1 .   Solving for Yi1 from (3) we find that

entry is
                           i (1 - 1)                     Li                                           ji1
                  Ni1 =                                                , with i1             ii1 +           .          (4)
                            f ie1 1 1         1-  i
                                                      + ( i - ~ i1 )                                 t ji1
                                               i1

   Since iis +  jis = 1, then i1 = 1 in free trade (with t ji1 = 1) and autarky (t ji1  + so

ii1 = 1 and  ji1 = 0). It follows that Ni1 is equal at these two points. But for 1 < t ji1 < +

then i1 < 1, so that i1 is a -shaped function of the tariff. We show (see Appendix A.2) that

i1 achieves its minimum at the same tariff at which tariff revenue Bi /wi is maximized. It follows

                                                                5
from (4) that entry is a -shaped function of the tariff, just like i1 , unless there is no nontraded

sector and i = 1, in which case entry is constant. The intuition for this result is Lerner symmetry

(Costinot and Werning, 2019), whereby the import tariff acts like an export tax, and starting from

free trade the tariff depresses entry into the traded sector. Entry into the nontraded sector is

                                          (1 - i )(2 - 1)                Bi
                                 Ni2 =                            Li +        ,                     (5)

which is a -shaped function of the tariff because revenue Bi /wi has that pattern.



3   Optimal Consumer and Producer Taxes in a Closed Economy

We first discuss the distortions arising in a closed economy from having monopolistic production

of the differentiated inputs, where both sectors s = 1, 2 are nontraded. The markup on the differ-

entiated inputs is fully passed-through to the price of the bundled, finished good. That distortion

then operates on two margins: consumer purchases of finished goods; and firm purchases of fin-

ished goods as inputs, where the higher price on the finished good is further passed-through to

raise the price of intermediate inputs, creating a double-marginalization of the markup on inter-

mediate inputs. Rather than correcting the monopoly distortion at its source (i.e. in the price of

differentiated inputs), it will be instructive to correct it by using tax/subsidies on purchases of the

finished goods on these two margins. So we consider both consumer and producer tax/subsidies
                                                                                        c and t ,    p
on purchases of the finished goods, where one plus the ad valorem rates are denoted by tis     is

respectively.

    We consider two solutions to the closed-economy problem (see Appendix B): first, choosing

both the consumer and producer tax/subsidies optimally; and second, using only the consumer
                             p
tax/subsidy while setting tis  1. When both instruments are used, we obtain the solution


                      p      s - 1                    tic1        1 - 1           2 - 1

                              s                       tic2         1               2

                                     p
The optimal producer subsidies tis < 1 exactly counteract the markups on differentiated inputs




                                                       6
which would otherwise be fully passed-through to finished goods prices.1 With these subsidies,

firms pay prices for finished goods that reflect their marginal costs. In addition, optimal consump-

tion tax/subsidies are needed so that, in relative terms, these prices offset the markups implicit in

finished goods' prices faced by consumers.

      In contrast to this first-best case, consider the second-best policy that involves consumption

tax/subsidies only. Because of double-marginalization of the markups charged on differentiated

outputs, the sector s elasticity s effectively becomes ~ is  1 + is (s - 1), and the markup is
    ~ is
(~ is -1) .   The solution for the optimal consumption tax/subsidies is


                             tic1     ~ i1 - 1
                                                      ~ i2 - 1
                                                      
                                  =                                  for ~ is  1 + is (s - 1).                      (7)
                             tic2        ~ i1
                                                         ~ i2
                                                         

To interpret (7), the sector with the lowest effective elasticity must have the lowest tax (i.e. greatest

subsidy) to offset the effective monopoly distortion, which is inversely measured by is (s - 1).

Even if the elasticities s   > 1 are identical then the sector with the strongest roundabout

production (lowest is ) must be subsidized in consumption, because it has the highest effective

markup due to double-marginalization. The intuition from the second-best case will be useful as

we examine tariffs on trade, as we turn to next.

no roundabout production, so we should think of the imports as final differentiated goods. They

identify two distortions arising from monopolistic competition. The first is the markup charged

on the domestic differentiated varieties which can be corrected by subsidizing domestic buyers of

those inputs, where one minus the ad valorem subsidy is the inverse of the markup:


                                                                      i - 1

                                                                        i
    1 The     need for such subsidies in a dynamic monopolistic competition model was noted by Judd (1997, 2002).



                                                                 7
Alternatively, the markup on domestic varieties can be offset by using a tariff on imported varieties

equal to the markup, t1  1/1 , which is the optimal tariff with homogeneous firms (Gros, 1987).

    With heterogeneous firms, however, Demidova and Rodr´
                                                        iguez-Clare (2009) find that there is

a second distortion: each new foreign variety brings surplus, which domestic buyers do not take

account of in their spending. One way to correct this externality is to use an import subsidy, and

they find that one minus the optimal ad valorem subsidy is

where the inequality follows from 1 > 1 - 1. Furthermore, they argue that that an equivalent
                  , t is to multiply the tariff t = 1/  by the import subsidy in (9), and then
policy to using tii 1 ji1                        1     1

both distortions are corrected by a single instrument, which is the optimal tariff:2

                                                                     1

                                                                 ( 1 - 1 )

    If we add a second sector or roundabout production, however, then the equivalence of using
             , t < 1 and the optimal tariff topt > 1 no longer holds. To see this, suppose that
the policy tii 1 ji1

we "scale-up" tii 1 ji1            1                      ii1 = 1 and t , and then use a sub-

sidy of 1 on the finished good to offset this scaling-up. With a single sector and no roundabout

production, this subsidy does not make any difference because consumers cannot substitute away

from the finished good and firms do not purchase it. But once we add multiple sectors and/or

roundabout production, then substitution by consumers and firms means that the subsidy of i

is needed to avoid double-marginalization, as we found in the closed economy. Analogously, for

an open economy with multiple sectors and input-output linkages, Lashkaripour and Lugovsky

(2020) argue that such subsidies must be applied in the first-best; in that case, the first-best tariffs

for a small country are the same with and without input-output linkages.3 Our interest is in the

who show that the optimal tariff in a large country is higher.
   3 See their section 4(ii) and especially footnote 23, which explains that for a small open economy the equations for

the first-best taxes and tariffs are identical with and without input-output linkages. These authors consider a wide
class of models introduced by Kucheryavyy, Lyn and Rodr´      iguez-Clare (2016), which includes the Melitz-Pareto case.
Depending on the model being considered, the first-best tariff formula is not necessarily the same as topt , but in all cases
the first-best tariff does not depend on input-output linkages for a small country. When considering the second-best

second-best tariff obtained in the absence of such subsidies, as we turn to next.


4.2     Second-best Tariff

We now add the nontraded sector 2, and we suppose that the only policy instrument available is
                                                                                                                        p
a uniform import tariff (or subsidy). Because we are no longer using the instruments tii1 , ti1 or tic1 ,

for convenience we drop subscripts from the import tariff t ji1 and simply denote it by ti with an

optimal second-best value ti . The fact that a subsidy on the finished good is not used creates a

robust reason for lowering the optimal tariff below topt . A slight reduction of the tariff below its

first-best value ordinarily causes only a second-order loss in welfare, but it now brings a first-order

gain in welfare because it lowers the price of the finished good purchased by firms.

      Entry provides a second possible reason to have ti < topt . As we showed in section 2, starting

from free trade a tariff in sector 1 leads firms to exit that sector and move into sector 2. That will

lead to a welfare loss if the monopoly distortion is greater in the traded sector. Let D (ti ) denote

the marginal welfare impact of firms entering the traded sector ­ holding the cutoff productivities

constant ­ relative to the share of spending on that sector (i ).4 We find that

                                                ~ i1
                                                            ~ i2
                                                                   i1 (1 -   ~ i1 )
                               D ( ti ) =             -                             - Ed                                    (11)
                                            (~ i1 - 1) ( ~ i2 - 1) 1 -  ~ i1 i1

where Ed > 0 and all such script-variables depend on sector 1 parameters and ii1 (and therefore
                                                                             ~ i1
depend on the tariff). The first term appearing in (11),                 (~ i1 -1) ,   is the effective markup in sector
                                                                                                 i1 (1-   ~ i1 )
1, and the second term is the effective markup in sector 2 multiplied by                        1-   ~ i1 i1       (which is  1

for ti  1) that reflects tariff revenue. The third term -Ed < 0 appears because the tariff is an

inefficient instrument to influence entry, so it has a deadweight loss.

      We see from (11) that D (ti ) > 0 so that entry into the traded sector leads to a welfare gain ­

and exit leads to a welfare loss ­when that effective markup there is sufficiently above the effective

markup in the nontraded sector. For the 186 country quantitative model used in the next section,

we find that ~ i1 in manufacturing (one of the industries in the traded sector) and ~ i2 in the non-

traded sector (services) both have median values of about two. It follows that D (ti ) < 0 at the
tariffs without such subsidies, however, they do not incorporate input-output linkages.
   4 See Appendix C.1 for the total change in utility from selection and entry (i.e. the term D ( t )).
                                                                                                   i

median , so it is inefficient to lower the tariff to promote entry into manufacturing. But for about

10% of countries we find that D (ti ) > 0 when comparing manufacturing with services, which

creates an argument for encouraging entry into manufacturing by lowering the tariff.

   In our theoretical work, we want to allow the effective distortion in the traded sector to be

greater or less than that in the nontraded sector. We will impose an upper-bound on the inverse

distortion of the traded sector as compared to the nontraded sector:

                                        (~ i1 - 1)     (~ - 1)
                                                   <  i i2     ,                                 (12)
                                            ~ i1
                                                          ~ i2

where the parameter i  1 will be specified in Theorem 1 below. Our aim is to choose i high

enough to include a wide range of effective distortions in (12).

   We can now state a general formula for the optimal second-best tariff ti , as compared to topt

(see Appendix C). Specifically, ti is obtained as a fixed point of the equation

                                                           1 - ( 1 - i 1 ) R ( t i )
                        ti = topt F (ti ), with F (ti )                              ,           (13)
                                                           1 + (1 -  i ) M ( t i )

where M (ti ) captures the impact of the higher monopoly distortion in the traded versus the non-

traded sectors, and is defined by

                                         ( t i - 1)      D ( ti )
                 M ( ti )  M × Em -                 1             with M > 0, Em > 0,            (14)
                                               ti        A ( ti )

where A(ti ) is defined by


                             A ( ti )  i - ~ i1 + (1 - i )E a with E a > 0,                      (15)


while R(ti ) reflects the impact of roundabout production and is defined by

                                       1 - 1 (1 - ii1 )
                      R ( ti ) = R ×                    - 1 1          with R > 0.               (16)
                                            i1

   To explain these terms more carefully, recall that the distortion term D (ti ) measures the marginal

welfare impact of firms moving from the nontraded to the traded sector, and notice that it en-


                                                    10
ters (1 - i ) M(ti ), which appears in the denominator of (13), reflecting the impact of the relative

monopoly distortion on the optimal tariff. When i = 1 so there is only the traded sector, then

this term vanishes, because there is no impact of the relative distortion between traded and non-

traded goods. But there is still roundabout production in traded goods alone, and the impact of

that roundabout production on the optimal tariff is captured by the term R(ti ), appearing in the

numerator of (13).

   More specifically, when i = 1 and i1 = 1 in (13), then we are back in the one-sector, no-

roundabout model and that formula immediately gives ti = topt . Outside of that special case,

there will be a lower optimal tariff, ti < topt , whenever (1 - i ) M(ti )  0 and (1 - i1 ) R(ti )  0

with one of these inequalities holding strictly. For example, suppose that i = 1 so there is only

a traded sector, but i1 < 1 so there is some roundabout production. Then we can show that

R(ti ) > 0 at the fixed point of (13), so that roundabout production lowers the optimal tariff.

   Next, suppose we add the nontraded sector so that i < 1, in which case the denominator of

F (ti ) equaling [1 + (1 - i ) M(ti )] comes into play. If the relative distortion in the traded sector is

positive, D (ti ) > 0, then provided that the other terms in (14) are positive we will have M(ti ) > 0,

so the denominator further reduces the optimal tariff. One of those other terms is A(ti ). Recall that

we initially defined D (ti ) as the marginal impact of entry into sector 1 relative to the size of that

sector (i ), and we loosely interpret A(ti ) as the effective size of sector 1. As a regularity condition

we need to impose A(ti ) > 0, which is guaranteed by the sufficient conditions specified in the

following result (proved in Appendix D).

Theorem 1.

(a) Pure roundabout: If i = 1 and i1 < 1, then R(ti ) > 0 and the optimal tariff is ti < topt .

(b) No roundabout: If i1 = i2 = 1 then (i) D (ti ) > 0 and the optimal tariff is ti < topt when

                                                 1 (1 - 1 )

   Part (a) has already been discussed, and shows that roundabout production in a one-sector

model always lowers the optimal tariff. This result is the simplest demonstration that the tariff ti

on intermediate inputs is less than the tariff topt on final goods.

   Part (b) deals with the opposite case where there is no roundabout production, so the imports

are differentiated final goods. In that case, A(ti ) > 0 is guaranteed. Condition (17) used in part

(b)(i) ensures that the relative distortion in the traded sector sufficiently exceeds that in the non-

traded sector so that D (ti ) > 0 for ti  [1, topt ]. In that case, the relative monopoly distortion is the

only factor operating to reduce the optimal tariff and we find that ti < topt because D (ti ) > 0 and

the denominator of F (ti ) exceeds unity. On the other hand, if the traded sector is less distorted

than the nontraded sector, with 1  2 , then we have the reverse outcome with D (ti ) < 0 and

ti > topt . So the tariff on final goods can be greater or less than that found in a one-sector model,

depending on the relative monopoly distortion across sectors.

   In part (c) we allow for two sectors and roundabout production, and now we need A(ti ) > 0.


                                                                            12
To ensure A(ti ) > 0 for ti > ti , where ti < 1 is an import subsidy specified in the proof, we require

the sufficient conditions (18) and (19): the former is a lower-bound on i1 and the latter is a lower-

bound on i (but also depending on i1 ). To illustrate these two lower-bound constraints, we rely

on parameter values that we adopt in our quantitative model of the next section. There we use

the EORA dataset that has input-output matrices for 186 countries in 2010 and 15 sectors (Lenzen,

Moran, Kanemoto and Geschke, 2013).5 The traded sectors include Manufacturing, Agriculture

and Mining (including petroleum extraction), while all Service industries are treated as nontraded.

We adopt parameters values for each of these sectors, and these are 1 = 4.4 and 1 = 5.1 for

Manufacturing which are used for illustrative purposes in Figure 1. The dots in Figure 1 are the

values of i and i1 when aggregating within all three traded sectors. We see that the two lower-

bounds constraints (18) and (19) are satisfied for all countries so that the regularity condition

A(ti ) > 0 holds.

    Now we check whether ti < topt holds in part (c), which allows for the nontraded sector and

roundabout production in both sectors. We already know from part (b) ­ where we excluded

roundabout production ­ that it is possible to find the reverse outcome ti > topt if the traded

sector is less distorted than the nontraded sector (1  2 ). We would like to know, however,

if a small amount of roundabout production is enough to overwhelm that relative distortion, so

that ti < topt due to R(ti ) > 0 regardless of the sign of D (ti ). Part (c) answers that question in

the affirmative. The needed amount of roundabout production is shown by the constraint (20),

which is an upper-bound on i1 as graphed in Figure 1 and is very weak: all countries in our

sample satisfy this constraint, with Kuwait (KWT) near the borderline of (20) due to high i1 (little

roundabout production) in petroleum extraction and thus in overall traded production.

    To ensure that ti < topt in part (c), we also need to put a constraint on the relative distortion

across sectors, as was indicated by (12) with i  1. The needed value of i is indicated by (21),

which has a large median value of 9.1 in our sample of 186 countries. The line for which i = 1 is

shown in Figure 1 with the thin solid region i  1 illustrated by that line and the region above

it: for parameters in this region, we have i < 1 and we can only find ti < topt if the traded

sector is more distorted than the nontraded sector (~ i1 < ~ i2 in (12)). Conversely, if the traded

sector is less distorted in effective terms (~1  ~ i2 ), then we find that ti > topt . So just as (b)(ii)

of Theorem 1 illustrates that a high optimal tariff can arise in the case of a final good not used in

production, the thin solid region i  1 shows that a high optimal tariff can arise even when there

is a small amount of roundabout production in the tradable sector, provided that this sector is

less distorted. As just noted, Kuwait (KWT) has little roundabout production and it is near to this

thin solid region at the top of Figure 1. Even though this country meets the sufficient conditions

to have ti < topt in our two-sector model ­ since it lies just within the lightly shaded region of

Figure 16 ­ in the multisector quantitative model analyzed in the next section we will find that

Kuwait and other OPEC countries have high optimal tariffs, ti > topt . So the result that a certain

(small) amount of roundabout production is needed to ensure a low optimal tariff, as established

by Theorem 1(c), will carry over to the quantitative model.

     We conclude this section by noting that the optimal tariff can be negative. In our working

paper (CFRT, 2020), we examine the conditions to ensure that the optimal tariff is negative, and

we find that it occurs for two types of countries: a Highly Linked Economy that has high roundabout

production (low i1 ) and is very open (low ii1 ); and a Remote Economy, with a small traded sector

and with ii1  1, so that the economy is nearly closed to trade due to high iceberg costs, as may

occur for very distant countries. We find examples of both types in our quantitative analysis that

is discussed next.



5     Second-best Uniform Tariffs in a General, Calibrated Model

The quantitative model from our working paper (CFRT, 2020) uses the EORA dataset. Table 1 con-

tains the model elasticities and summary statistics, after grouping the 15 sectors into four broader

sectors. The estimates of s and s for goods are from Caliendo and Parro (2015), and satisfy the

relationship s / (s - 1) = 1.5. Gervais and Jensen (2019) find that services have elasticities of sub-

stitution about one-quarter smaller than for manufacturing. We follow them, by setting s = 2.8

for services and, given s / (s - 1) = 1.5, setting s = 2.7. We therefore have s for traded goods

exceeding s for services, generating higher markups in the nontraded sector.7

     We slightly generalize the Melitz-Chaney model by allowing for nested CES with the upper-

level elasticity of substitution s , between the aggregates of home and foreign varieties, differing

from the lower-level elasticity s , across different foreign (or home) varieties. Setting s = s /1.25

best reproduces global trade growth between 1990 and 2010. With this structure we obtain the

one-sector, no-roundabout, small-country formula for the optimal tariff from Costinot, Rodr´

    We measure is from our theoretical model by treating "labor" in that model as an aggregate

factor that includes both labor and capital services. Accordingly, Table 1 reports the shares of in-

dustry revenue from EORA that go to value-added, is , which for Manufacturing varies across

countries from 24% at the 10th percentile to 38% at the 90th. Also reported is the effective elastic-

ity ~ is  1 + is (s - 1) in each sector. We find that the median effective elasticity in Manufactur-

ing (1.96) is only slightly lower than the median effective elasticity in Services (2.01), with much

heterogeneity across countries, and both of these broad sectors are more distorted than the two

primary sectors, Agriculture and Mining.

    The optimal tariffs in the quantitative model are computed numerically. Specifically, we start

at a world free trade equilibrium, calculated using 2010 input-output tables, and use a grid search

over positive and negative tariffs for each country. We evaluate the welfare effects from imposing

unilateral uniform tariffs across sectors of between -20% to +40% in increments mostly of 2.5% one

country at a time and summarize results in Figure 2.

    Five countries have negative optimal tariffs in 2010: Bhutan; Myanmar; New Caledonia; Hong

Kong; and Spain. Bhutan, Myanmar and New Caledonia seem to fit our description of remote

economies, while Hong Kong and Spain are highly-linked economies. Our median 2010 optimal

tariff is 10%. For comparison we also plot optimal uniform tariffs using the one-sector formula

from (22). Using our parameters for each sector yields optimal tariffs of 16.0% for Agriculture;

10.6% for Mining; and 27.3% for Manufacturing. We plot two horizontal lines for the optimal

tariffs topt in Manufacturing and in Mining (which includes petroleum extraction).

   Our median optimal tariff ti of 10% is less than two-fifths of topt in (22) which is 27.3% for

Manufacturing parameters (the dominant sector in trade). There is much variation across coun-

tries. Economies with at least the median proportion of Manufacturing production tend to have

lower optimal tariffs, with a median of 7.5%, or just over one-quarter of topt from equation (22) for

that sector. In contrast, the 13 countries where Mining (including petroleum extraction) accounts

for at least 10% of production ­ including many OPEC countries ­ have a median optimal tariff of

20%, which greatly exceeds topt in (22) of 10.6% for that sector. Even though a resource sector like

Mining was not introduced into our two-sector theoretical model, the possibility of high optimal

tariffs in oil-rich countries was suggested by our discussion of Kuwait in the previous section,

which has a low amount of roundabout production. Our finding of high optimal tariffs for oil

exporters is also supported by the high elasticity s for Mining in Table 2, implying low markups

so that resources should be shifted to other sectors, and by large oil exporters exploiting the terms

of trade. But these countries are the exceptions that prove the rule: for countries that specialize in

Manufacturing, the numerical optimal tariffs are considerably lower than topt in nearly all cases.

6   Conclusions

We began by asking whether modern trade theory has anything new to say about arguments for

protecting the traded sector. We did not mention a line of recent literature that to some extent

argues in favor of such protection. Specifically, this is the firm-delocation literature that combines a

monopolistically competitive traded sector with a competitive traded outside good (see e.g. Melitz

and Ottaviano, 2008, section 4; Bagwell and Lee, 2020). The traded numeraire good pins down

relative wages between countries, so the country applying tariffs is "small" in the sense that its

wages do not respond to its tariff. In this literature, encouraging entry into traded goods requires

positive import tariffs. Essentially, the ability to attract firms into the home country takes the

place of a conventional terms-of-trade motive for tariffs, so that the optimal tariff is positive even

though wages are fixed. Of course, with multiple countries pursuing this motive for protection,

there is ample scope for trade agreements to reduce the deadweight losses due to the tariffs (Ossa,

2011; Bagwell and Staiger, 2015).

    The major differences between this class of models and our own are: (i) roundabout produc-

tion, so that tariffs are applied on imported intermediate inputs rather than final goods; and (ii)

the nontraded service sector, which does not fix relative wages between countries. Lerner sym-

metry holds in the traded sector, so that import tariffs are equivalent to export taxes and inhibit

entry into that sector. That logic does not apply when the numeraire good is traded, which gives

firm-delocation models a very different flavor: they act like partial equilibrium models because

wages are fixed, and perhaps are most appropriate to narrowly targeted tariffs, whereas our re-

sults depend on Lerner symmetry, which is a general equilibrium result and depends on having

broad tariffs applied to the traded sector. Determining the most appropriate range of applications

for each class of models is one important area for further research.

A     Two-Sector Small Open Economy Model
We focus on a small open economy model, with two sectors s = 1, 2 and roundabout production in both
sectors. County i is the small home economy and the foreign country j = i is the rest of the world. In
the foreign country, for simplicity we assume a single traded sector denoted by s = 1 with no roundabout
production and no import tariff.

A.1    Description of Economy

The structure of the country i economy is illustrated in Figure A1. Firms in sector 1 of country i can source
differentiated inputs from countries k = i, j for i = j, and the CES production functions over the differenti-
ated inputs purchased from each country k and in total are

using the Pareto distribution G1 ( ) = 1 - -1 with   1. Notice that the entry of firms Nk1 appearing in
(23) and (24) can be converted into the mass of varieties by multiplying and dividing by [1 - G1 (          ki1 )], in
which case the unconditional densities g1 ( ) become conditional densities g1 ( )/[1 - G1 (     ki1  )] . In  sector
2 we use the analogous definitions of Qii2 , Pii2 , and Nii2 .
    The total value of production of the finished good in country i and sector s is Yis = Pis Qis , and the CES
demand for intermediates of variety  sold from country k = i, j to i is given by
                                                                                  -s

In sector 2, however, the intermediates used in country i are purchased only from country i. A firm in
i supplying differentiated inputs has the marginal costs xis / , with the costs of input bundle supply xis
                                                                                                        e . In
given by (1). We assume that fixed costs of the firm require only labor and are denoted by f iks and f is
country j, we ignore roundabout production and there is only sector 1, so that x j1  w j and the fixed labor
costs are f jk1 and f je1 .
    The profits in country k = i, j from supplying differentiated inputs to country k = i, j are

Substituting these expressions back into profits, we can readily solve for the cutoff productivity k ks at
which profits are zero:

We can multiply this by (32) to obtain a preliminary expression for the value of production of the finished
goods in country i and sector s, Yis  Pis Qis :

To simplify this expression, we can use (30) twice to obtain

    The value of finished output in each sector, Yks , is sold to consumers and also back to domestic firms.
That finished output is costlessly bundled from home and (for sector 1) imported differentiated inputs. Let
k k1 denote the share of country k total expenditure in sector 1 on intermediate goods from country k .
Using conditions (28)­(33) we can obtain the following expressions for the expenditure shares for inputs
sold by country k = i to country k = i, j:

   The model is closed by making use of the market clearing condition described in the main text in (3),
which in sector 2 is simply Yi2 = (1 - i )(wi Li + Bi ) +         ~ i2 Yi2 , together with trade balances. Duty-free
imports in sector 1 of country i are Eji1 = ( ji1 Yi1 )/t ji1 while exports are Eij1 = ij1 Yj1 , so that trade balance
requires
                                                 ji1 Yi1
                                                           = ij1 Yj1 .                                             (39)
                                                   t ji1
Note that using (36) and (38), then trade balance (39) implies
                                                    - 1                    - 1
                                                   ij 1 Ni1 wi f ij1 = ji1     Nj1 w j f ji1 .                                               (40)

Again using (36) and (38) with home sales Eii1 = ii1 Yi1 and exports Eij1 = ij1 Yj1 , we obtain an expression
for total sales of intermediate inputs in sector 1 by country i:

                                                                                                     1 1 wi f ik1
                                                                     
                                                                                - 1
                                            Eii1 + Eij1 =                     ik1         Ni1                              .
                                                                    k =i, j
                                                                                                     1 + 1 - 1

This equation is simplified by making use of free entry in country i. Expected profits must equal the fixed
costs of entry, so that for a country i firm:
                                                              

                                                                    ik1 ( ) g1 ( )d  = wi f ie1 .                                            (41)
                                                       k =i, j 
                                                              ik1


To evaluate this integral we follow the approach of Melitz and Redding (2014), who note that CES de-
mand implies that ik1 ( ) + wi f ik1 = ik1 ( ik )+w f             1 -1 . It follows from (27) that  (  ) =
                                                1     i ik1 (  / ik1 )                             ik1
            - 1
 ( / ik1 ) 1 - 1 wi f ik1 , and so the above entry condition becomes:
          

                                                                                                                  s -1
                                                                                                           
                                   
                              J1 ( ik 1 ) f ik1   =   f ie1   with                   
                                                                               Js (  ) 
                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                           - 1 gs (  ) d .

Completing the integral above using the Pareto distribution, we arrive at

                                                          1 - 1

                                                                                          ik1        f ik1 = f ie1 ,                         (42)

from which we can obtain an equation governing the mass of entrants Nis , namely

                                                                                                       1 1
                                                  Ni1 = Eii1 + Eij1                       wi f ie1                     .                     (43)
                                                                                                       1 - 1




                                                                                 A4
    In sector 2 the mass of entrants is governed by the same equation but without Eij2 appearing

                                                                                   1 2
                                                   Ni2 = Eii2           wi f ie2              .                                                (44)
                                                                                   2 - 1

The free entry condition for sector 2 is defined analogously to (41) but summing over country k = i only,
obtaining a condition that determines ii2 :

                                                                   2 - 1            -2
                                          J2 ( ii 2 ) f ii2 =                       ii 2 f ii2 = f ie2 .                                       (45)
                                                                 2 - 2 + 1

A.2      Output, Entry and i1
As explained in the main text, the term ij1 Yj1 appearing in (3) is the value of country i exports of the
differentiated inputs. Under balanced trade, this must equal the net-of-tariff value of imports. Letting t ji1
                                                                                                                     ji1
denote one plus the ad valorem import tariff used by country i, then ij1 Yj1 =                                      t ji1 Yi1 .   Tariff revenue is
       t ji1 -1
Bi =      t ji1  ji1 Yi1 .   We re-express tariff revenue as

                                                                                                   ji1
                                         Bi = (1 - i1 ) Yi1 with i1                     ii1 +              ,                                   (46)
                                                                                                  t ji1

and using these terms in (3), we can solve for real output Yi1 /wi as

                                     Yi1     i Ii                        Yi1           i Li
                                         =                      =            =                         .                                       (47)
                                     wi    1-~ i1 i1                     wi    1 - i + ( i - ~ i1 ) i1

    Since iis +  jis = 1, then i1 = 1 in free trade (with t ji1 = 1) and autarky (t ji1  + so ii1 = 1 and
 ji1 = 0). It follows that Yi1 /wi is equal at these two points. But for 1 < t ji1 < + then i1 < 1, so that
i1 is a -shaped function of the tariff. We show below that i1 achieves its minimum at the same tariff at
which tariff revenue Bi /wi is maximized. Then we see from the the denominator of the second expression
in (47) that real output can be either a -shaped or -shaped function of the tariff depending on whether
i > ( < )  ~ i1 . This ambiguity does not extend, however, to the entry of firms producing differentiated
inputs in sector 1. Using entry from (43) and noting that home sales are Eii1 = ii1 Yi1 and exports are
Eij1 = ij1 Yj1 , we solve for entry into sector 1 as shown in (4), which is a -shaped function of the tariff
provided that i < 1.
    For sector 2, the market clearing condition is Yi2 = (1 - i )(wi Li + Bi ) +  ~ i2 Yi2 , which directly leads to

                                                                        1 - i
                                                                Yi2 =           I.                                                             (48)
                                                                        1-  ~ i2 i

Then making use of (44) with (48) we immediately obtain (5) in the main text.
   It remains to be shown that tariff revenue Bi has its maximum at the same tariff at which i1 has its
minimum, as asserted in the main text. This follows directly from (46) and (47), from which we obtain

                                                          i wi L i (1 -  i 1 )                              i wi L i
                         Bi = Yi1 (1 - i1 ) =                                         =                                           .            (49)
                                                   1-~ i1 - ( i -     ~ i1 )(1 - i1 )              1- ~ i1
                                                                                                               - ( i - ~ i1 )
                                                                                                  (1-  i 1 )

It follows that Bi is monotonically decreasing in i1 , so their critical points are at the same maximum-
revenue tariff.




                                                                        A5
A.3    Domestic Production Share and T (t ji1 )
We now introduce the share of production (value-added) devoted to differentiated intermediate inputs that
are sold domestically in country i, which will be used many times in our derivations. The expenditure
share on imported intermediate inputs is  ji1 in (37), so  ji1 Yi1 measures the value of imports inclusive of
tariffs (and iceberg costs). We can instead evaluate imports at the net-of-tariff prices by dividing by t ji1
obtaining  ji1 Yi1 /t ji1 = (1 - ii1 )Yi1 /t ji1 , which equals exports and can be summed with ii1 Yi1 to obtain
the total value of production. It follows that the share of production sold to domestic firms ­ or the domestic
production share ­ is
                                                    ii1              t ji1 ii1
                                     ~ ii1 
                                                               =                     .                      (50)
                                                      (1-ii1 )   1 + ii1 (t ji1 - 1)
                                                + ii1        t ji1

We now claim that this share can be measured by
                                                                      - 1 f
                                                                     ii
                                              ~ ii1 =                   1   ii1
                                                                                       .                             (51)
                                                         - 1 f +   - 1 f
                                                        ii 1  ii1 ij1    ij1

To show this, we first rewrite the domestic expenditure share ii1 using (34), (36) for k = i, (38) and trade
balance (40) as
                                                     ii  - 1 f
                                                          1    ii1
                                     ii1 =      - 1
                                                                               .                         (52)
                                             
                                            ii1     f ii1 + ij1 -1 f ij1 t ji1
                                                            

For the above two equations we obtain the relationship

                                                           (1 - ii1 )  ~ ii1
                                                                       
                                                 t ji1 =                         ,                                   (53)
                                                              ii1     1-   ~ ii1

and as a result
                                                                      ii1 - ~ ii1
                                                  1 - t ji1 =                      .                                 (54)
                                                                     ii1 1 - ~ ii1

From these two equations we can readily confirm the second equality in (50), which shows that it is equiv-
alent to (51), so that is a correct formula for the domestic production share.
    We can use this production share to define a simple function of the tariff T (t ji1 ) given by

                                        T (t ji1 )  1 - ~ i1 + t ji1 - 1          1-~ ii1 .                          (55)

Notice that T (t ji1 ) = 1 -    ~ i1 in free trade (with t ji1 = 1) and autarky (t ji1  + so ii1 = 1 and  ji1 = 0),
but T (t ji1 ) > 1 -  ~ i1 for 1 < t ji1 =< +. It follows that T (t ji1 ) is a -shaped function of the tariff between
these two points, which is the same shape as tariff revenue Bi . In fact, T (t ji1 ) and Bi have their critical points
at the same tariff, as we show just below.
     In the main text we use i1 to characterize entry into sector 1, but throughout the rest of the Appendix
we mainly find it convenient to instead use the function T (t ji1 ). These two concepts are inversely related,
which can be seen by using (53) and (54) to obtain

                                     ~ ii1 (1 - ii1 )
                           t ji1 =
                                     
                                                        = [(t ji1 - 1)(1 - ~ ii1 ) + 1] (1 - ii1 ) .
                                     ii1 (1 -   ~ ii1 )                                 (1 - ~ ii1 )

Using this expression and T (t ji1 ) from (55), with  ji1 = 1 - ii1 we can solve for

                                      ji1       (t ji1 - 1)[( T (t ji1 ) +   ~ i1 ) - 1]              1
                   i1  ii1 +               = 1-                                          =                       .   (56)
                                     t ji1           (t ji1 - 1)( T (t ji1 ) +  ~ i1 )     ( T (t ji1 ) + ~ i1 )



                                                                     A6
                                                                                                                     T (t ji1 )-(1-   ~ i1 )
We see that i1 and T (t ji1 ) are inversely related, as asserted. Since 1 - i1 =                                        T (t ji1 )+~ i1
                                                                                                                                               from the above
equation, we can substitute this into (49) to obtain

                                       i wi Li [ T (t ji1 ) - (1 - ~ i1 )]                 i wi L i
                      Bi =                                                      =                  1-  ~ i1
                                                                                                                                        .                (57)
                             [ T (t ji1 ) - (1 -    ~ i1 )](1 - i ) + 1 -  ~ i1   1 -  i + [ T ( t ) - (1 - ~  ji1              i1 )]


We see that Bi is monotonically increasing in T (t ji1 ), so they have their critical points at the same maximum-
revenue tariff. Note that if we take i = 1 so we are in a one-sector model, then Bi and T (t ji1 ) are especially
simple affine transformations of each other, given by

                                                                            T (t ji1 )

                                                                            1 - i 1

Also using (42) and (45), entry into sectors 1 and 2 becomes

     To characterize the labor allocation across sectors, we need to use entry. We have already solved for Y1i
and Y2i in (47) and (48). Use these results in (43) and (44) and recall that home sales are Eii1 = ii1 Yi1 and
Eii2 = Yi2 while exports are Eij1 = ij1 Yj1 =  ji1 Yi1 /t ji1 . Substituting the resulting expressions into (62),
labor allocation across sectors can be written as

    The tariff formula (53) derived earlier can be used to simplify this expression for labor allocation. Using
(53) in (63), we obtain

                                                                                1+(t ji1 -1)ii1
                                                             (1 - ~ i1 )               t ji1
                                 Li1            i
                                       =
                                 Li2         (1 -  i )                      1+(t ji1 -1)ii1
                                                              1-~ i1               t ji1

                                                i     (1 - ~ i1 ) 1 -  ~ ii1 t ji1 +  ~ ii1 -1
                                       =                                                       .
                                             (1 -  i ) 1 - ~ i1 1 -  ~ ii1 t ji1 +  ~ ii1 -1

Then we can also express the labor allocation as a fraction of total labor supply:

                   Li1 + Li2           Li2                     1-~ ii1                ~

                                                                                              ~ i 1 + 1-  (1 -  ~ i1 )
                                                                                                            i

                                                      1
                                     Li1             1-  i (  i -    ~ i1 ) +  ~ i1
                                            =                                              .                                             (65)
                                  Li1 + Li2   1-~ ii1 t ji1 +   ~ ii1 + 1 (i -      ~ i1 )
                                                                           1-               i



A.5    Income and Intermediate Demand
The tariff formula (53) can also be used to derive an alternative expression for income Ii , which depends on

tariff revenue given by Bi = t ji1 - 1         t ji1 Yi1 .   From trade balance we have                 t ji1    = ij1 Yj1 , and using (36)
and (60) we obtain

Then income Ii = wi Li + Bi equals

Using T (t ji1 )  1 - ~ i1 + t ji1 - 1   1-~ ii1 from (55), we then obtain

    Next, we derive the expression for the value of the finished goods used as an intermediate input in
sector 1:
                                                                                             
                                                                                              
                                                               xi1 qii1 ( )                         xi1 ij1 qij1 ( )
       Intermediate demand = Ni1 (1 - i1 )                                  g ( ) d  +                               g ( ) d  ,
                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                            
                                                        ii                                   ij
                                                           1                                    1


and using the expression for profits:

                                xi1 ij1 qij1 ( )
                                                 = (1 - 1) ij1 ( ) + (1 - 1) wi f ij1 ,
                                        

we then obtain
                                                                                    
             Intermediate demand = Ni1 (1 - i1 ) (1 - 1) k=i, j                          (ik1 ( ) + wi f ik1 ) g ( ) d .
                                                                                  ik 1


Using the free entry condition (41), we have

                                                                            - 1          - 1
              Intermediate demand = Ni1 (1 - i1 ) (1 - 1) wi f ie1 + f ii1 ii 1 + f ij1 ij 1 .

Using labor market clearing (58), the intermediate demand is then given by

                                                                          (1 - i1 ) (1 - 1)
                                 Intermediate demand = wi Li1                               .
                                                                          (1 + i1 (1 - 1))

It follows that the total demand for finished goods in sector 1 is

                                                                   (1 - i1 ) (1 - 1)
                                         Yi1 = i Ii + wi Li1                         .
                                                                   (1 + i1 (1 - 1))

After combining these expressions with (34) and (40), Ii is given in terms of sector 1 variables by

                   wi L i1 (1 - 1)                 -1    1              -1             - 1
            Ii =                                K1 1                ii1       f ii1 + ij 1 f ij1 t ji1 - (1 - i1 ) .              (67)
                    i (1 + i1 (1 - 1))                   1 f ie1

                                                                                                                             (2 -1)
For sector 2, there are no exports so that dividing the numerator and denominator of the ratio                             1+i2 (2 -1)



                                                                   A9
                  2
by 2 to obtain   1- ~ i2 ,   then income can also be written in terms of sector 2 variables as

                                   wi L i2 2              2 -1   2 -2                                            wi L i2
                            Ii =                         K2                  f ii2 - (1 - i2 )             =              ,             (68)
                                   1 - i 1 - ~ i2                2 f ie2 ii2                                    (1 -  i )

         2 -1     2 -1       -2
because K2        2 f ie2    ii 2 f ii2 = 1 from (31) and (45).


A.6    Equilibrium Conditions
We use the definition of small open economy following Demidova and Rodr´     iguez-Clare (2013), where we
impose a fixed demand curve for country i exports to country j. In particular the wages, prices, entry,
and expenditure at county j are not affected by changes in the trade policy of i. Formally, the equilibrium
conditions of the small open economy are the following.

B     Closed Economy Model
In the closed-economy model we allow for multiple sectors s = 1, ..., S, where we use is > 0 to denote
the consumption share in each sector with with S    s=1 is = 1. We now introduce producer and consumer
               c and t p on purchases of the finished good. The producer tax/subsidy means that the input

where Pis denotes the price of the finished good before the application of any tax/subsidies.
    Without loss of generality, we assume that the government budget is balanced so that Bi = 0. In the
market clearing condition (3), there is no trade so that iis = 1 and ijs = 0, and the consumer and firm pur-

   We solve the problem (76) subject to (70) twice: in the first-best by choosing the optimal consumer and
producer tax/subsidies; and in the second-best by choosing tis     c while setting t p  1. The solutions are
                                                                                    is
shown in (6) and (7), respectively, for the case of just two sectors.


C    Fixed-point Formula for the Second-Best Tariff
We now assume that no consumer or producer tax/subsidies apply to purchases of the finished good in
either sector, and the only policy instrument used is the tariff t ji1 on imports of the differentiated inputs in
sector 1. For convenience we drop subscripts from the import tariff t ji1 and simply denote it by ti . In this
Appendix we perform the comparative statics with respect to a change in the tariff to obtain the fixed-point
formula for the optimal tariff (13), and in Appendix D we develop the proof of Theorem 1.
    We first derive an expression for the price index that is going to be used in order to express welfare as

where the equality is obtained by using the following expression

   Now the strategy is to obtain expressions for    , and 
                                                 ^ ii        . First, totally differentiate the free entry
                                                          ^ ij
                                                      1        1
condition (43) and use (51) to obtain

                                                                          1- ~ ii1
                                                                                         
                                                          ^ ii 1 =-        ~
                                                                                       ^ ij 1.                                            (80)
                                                                           ii1

Then we totally differentiate the price index (78) to obtain

                            1              1                         1-   ~ ii1         1          (1 - ii1 )

                                  N   ^i +                                                    +1 - 1                             ^ ij
                                                                                                                                   
                       i1 (1 - 1 ) i1      i 1                        ~ ii1
                                                                                     (1 - 1 ) ii1   (1 - 1 )                          1

                            1                 ^i .
                   +               (1 - ii1 ) t                                                                                           (81)
                       i1 (1 - 1 )

Next, totally differentiate the expression for ij in (30) and recall that country i is a small open economy
                                                  1
so that the country j price index, value of output and input-cost index are fixed. It follows that    is given
                                                                                                   ^ ij 1
by
                                               1                            ^i1 .
                                   ^ ij
                                        1 -  - 1 + i 1 w  ^ i = ( 1 - i 1 ) P                              (82)
                                             1



                                                                         A14
   Now combine (81) and (82) to obtain
                            
                          ^ ij

From trade balance (40), we have

From the equality for ^ji1 and

Combining (80) and (82), ^ji1 is given by

Then from (82) we have

Using (83) and multiplying both sides by (1 - i1 ) we have

   Combining this expression with (85) and using 1                                           1 ,     we finally obtain

second term of welfare in (94), we have

This initial definition D (ti ) can be re-expressed using the function T (ti ) in (55) to obtain the alternative

We see that the total change in utility in (101) is written as the sum of two terms: the first given by i E       
                                                                                                                ^ ij 1
reflects selection and includes all the changes in cutoff productivities; and second i D (ti ) N^ i1 reflects entry.
                ^ i / i   
                        ^ ij
At the optimum, U            1 = 0, which implies from (97) that

Now we find the common denominator for the second terms on the left-hand side using (90):

Then the first-order condition becomes

where

The first-order condition can then be written succinctly using topt =                              1

where we define the terms M(ti ) and R(ti ) as in the following subsections. Dividing through by [1 +
(1 - i ) M(ti )], we obtain the fixed-point formula (13).

and we define E a  [(1 -     ~ ii1 )ti (1 - E4 ) + ~ ii1 ] to obtain expression (15) in the main text.
      These expressions give us the definition of M (ti ) used in (14) in the main text. To establish the sign of
E a , we use E4 from (92) to note that

Therefore, 1 - E4 > 1 -       (1-ii1 )

The term R(ti ) appearing in (106) is a transformation of R

where the equality follows using T (ti ) from (55) in (105). We rewrite this as

Then expression (16) in the main text follows by using use (56) to rewrite T (ti ) +                         i1 .



D      Proof of Theorem 1
While a fixed point to (13) exists under general conditions,10 to establish the properties of this fixed point
we rely on a slightly different form of the equation. Taking the difference between the numerator of F (ti )
times topt and the denominator times ti , we obtain

                               H (ti )  topt [1 - (1 - i1 ) R(ti )] - ti [1 + (1 - i ) M (ti )] .                         (112)

The function H (ti ) is a continuous function of the tariff provided that A(ti ) > 0 in the interval of tariffs we
are interested in, so that M (ti ) does not have any discontinuities. Our general approach in the next result is
to find high and low tariffs at which the sign of H (ti ) switches, and then we apply the intermediate value
theorem to obtain a point where H (ti     ) = 0, which by construction is a fixed-point of (13).
     In order to apply the intermediate value theorem, we need to consider values of ti below unity, meaning
an import subsidy, so the revenue cost of the subsidy needs to be deducted from labor income wi Li to obtain
net income Ii . With enough roundabout production, it seems possible that at a very low tariff ­ meaning a
very high import subsidy ­ the revenue-cost of the subsidy could exhaust the labor income of the economy,
so that net income Ii = wi Li - Bi is zero. In that case, the there is no consumption by consumers in country
  10 Let W (ti ) denote utility Ui as a function of the tariff. Provided that W (ti ) is continuous and differentiable, then it
will reach some maximum over the (compact) range of all possible tariffs and subsidies, and ti         at that maximum will
satisfy the first-order condition (13).


                                                                A21
i (though the labor endowment Li is still provided), which is run like an overseas factory solely for the
benefit of foreign consumers. We need to check whether this extreme case can occur, and if it does, we
denote that minimal tariff (maximum import subsidy) by tmin
                                                        i    0. We give a more formal definition with:

Definition 2. tmin
               i    arg maxti 0 { T (ti )| T (ti ) = 0}, with min                               min .
                                                              ii1 denoting the value of ii1 at ti

     To explain this definition, notice that using Bi from the main text in (57) that we can solve for income Ii
as
                                                                                      T ( ti )
                                     Ii = wi Li + Bi = wi Li                                                  .                       (113)
                                                                    T ( t i ) +  i ( T ( t i ) - (1 - ~ i1 ))
We see that Ii = 0  T (ti ) = 0. We do not rule out in Definition 2 the possibility that there might be
multiple tariffs at which T (ti ) = 0, in which case tmin
                                                      i   is chosen as the maximum of these.11 To solve for
tmin
 i   , we use the market clearing condition (3) together with trade balance (39) to get

                                                                                      ji1
                                                  Yi1 = i Ii + ~ i1 ii1 Yi1 +             Y .
                                                                                     ti i1

If we set Ii = 0 and use ii1 + ij1 = 1, then we solve for

                                                             1 - min            ~ i1 (1 - min
                                                                                            ii1 )
                                    1=~ i1 min
                                           ii1 + ~ i1             ii1
                                                                      = t min
                                                                          i   =                   .                                   (114)
                                                               tmin
                                                                i               ( 1 -  ~    min )
                                                                                         i1 ii1

We see that tmin
             i    = 0 for i1 = 1 because then    ~ i1 = (1 - i1 )1 = 0. More generally for 0  i1  1 we have
0     ~ i1  1 , and it follows from (114) that 0  tmin  i     ~ i1 . Because we solved for tmin
                                                                                             i   from the market
clearing condition when Ii = 0, it follows from (113) that T (ti    min ) = 0. Negative income is not possible, so

at higher tariffs we have Ii > 0 and then T (ti ) > 0 from (113).

Remark 2. We henceforth restrict our attention to tariffs in the range ti  tmin
                                                                            i   , where T min  T (tmin
                                                                                                   i   ) = 0 and
T (ti ) > 0  ti > tmin
                   i   .

    Before proceeding with the proof of Theorem 1, we make use of the T (ti ) function to slightly transform
the terms used within D (ti ) and M (ti ), as defined in Appendix C.1 and C.2. We first transform the elasticity
E3 appearing in (90) using T (ti ) in (55) to obtain

                                                          T ( ti ) +   ~ i1       1
                                                 E3 =                       +                 > 0,
                                                              T ( ti )        i1 (1 - 1)

and so
                                                            1                                         T ( ti )
                                E3 T ( t i ) =   1+                     T+~ i 1 = (1 - ~ i1 )                  +~ i1 .
                                                        i1 (1 - 1)                                    i 1  1
                                                                        1+i1 (1 -1)        1-  ~ i1
Using the above equation with (99), and noting that                      i1 (1 -1)
                                                                                       =   i 1  1 ,   we obtain

                            1-   ~ i1            1 + i2 (2 - 1)                              ~ i1
                                                                                             
      D ( ti ) T ( ti ) =             T ( ti ) -                i 1  1 - T ( t i ) + i 1  1                         (1 - ii1 ) E4 .   (115)
                             i 1  1                i2 (2 - 1)                               1-  ~ i1

Also, note that (109) can be rewritten using T (ti ) from (55) as

                               A ( ti ) = i - ~ i1 + (1 -  i )       T ( ti ) + ~ i1 - ~ ii1 (1 - E4 ) + ~ ii1 .                      (116)

We now prove Theorem 1 by a series of Definitions, Lemmas and Remarks.
  11 If   T (ti ) is increasing in ti then tmin will be unique, and conditions to ensure that are provided in Lemma 7.
                                            i




                                                                     A22
    From (111) we have R(ti ) = R × [(1 - 1 (1 - ii1 )) ( T (ti ) +     ~ i1 ) - 1 1 ] , where R > 0. It appears that
the term [(1 - 1 (1 - ii1 )) ( T (ti ) + ~ i1 ) - 1 1 ] can be zero, particularly as T (ti ) is low, so that R(ti ) = 0.
For the proof of parts (a) and (c) in Theorem 1, we will make extensive use of this low tariff, which is defined
more formally as follows:
Definition 3. Define tiR0  arg maxt tmin { R(ti )| R(ti ) = 0} and denote T R0  T (tiR0 ), where it is understood
                                              i     i
                                R0
                              ~ ii
that   T R0   uses the shares            R0                          R0
                                   1 and ii1 which are evaluated at ti .

    This definition allows for the possibility that there could be multiple tariffs at which R(ti ) = 0, in which
case tiR0 is chosen as the maximum of these points.
Lemma 3. The tariff tiR0 is given by
                                                                     R0
                                                              1 1 - ii

                                                                         R 0
                                                                             -       R0
                                                                                          ,                                 (117)
                                                    1-~ ii1 1 - 1 1 - ii1      1-  ~ ii 1


with tmin
      i   < tiR0 < 1 and R(ti ) > 0 for ti > tiR0 .
Proof: Because R > 0 in (16), then R(ti ) = 0 implies [(1 - 1 (1 - ii1 )) ( T (ti ) + ~ i1 ) - 1 1 ] = 0. This
condition is rewritten as

                                     1 1                                 1
                       T R0 =             R0
                                               -~ i1 =                        R0
                                                                                   - ( 1 - i 1 )                   1 > 0,   (118)
                                1 - 1 1 - ii 1                      1 - 1 1 - ii 1

because the first ratio on the right is greater than 1 and so it exceeds (1 - i1 ) . It follows from Remark 2
that tiR0 > tmin
             i   , and from Definition 3 that R(ti ) > 0 for ti > tiR0 .
    Using (55) we can solve for tiR0 to obtain obtain (117), which can also be written as

                                                                                  R0

PROOF OF PART (a)
    We assume that i = 1, and then H (ti ) from (112) becomes H (ti ) = topt - ti - topt (1 - i1 ) R(ti ). With
R(tiR0 ) = 0 for tiR0 < 1, we obtain H (tiR0 ) = topt - tiR0 > 0. Checking the sign of R(topt ), because T (topt ) >
                                                                                     opt
1-   ~ i1 it readily follows from (16) that R(topt ) > 0. In that case we obtain H (ti ) = -topt (1 - i1 ) R(topt ) <
0 for i1 < 1. Using the continuity of R(ti ) and therefore of H (ti ), it follows from the intermediate value
theorem that there exists a tariff ti  with t R0 < t < topt at which H ( t ) = 0. By construction, this tariff is a

the proof of parts (b) and (c) in Theorem 1, we will make extensive use of the first of these points, where
D (ti ) = 0, which is defined more formally as follows:

       Once again, we allow for multiple solutions for the tariff where D (ti ) = 0, and in this case we choose

Notice that the final term on the right is increasing in ti , so it takes its highest value over ti  [tmin

condition (17) holds.

   Notice that when i1 = 1 and E4 =        then A(ti ) in (109) becomes

which is bounded away from zero so that M (ti ) is continuous. Then because Em -                                     ti 1 > 0 for ti 
                                                                                                                opt
[1, topt ] from Lemma 4, it follows that M(ti ) > 0 in that interval, and in particular                     M (ti ) > 0. From (112)
with i1 = 1 it follows that H (topt ) = -topt (1 - i ) M(topt ) < 0.
     Now we make use of tiD0 which for i1 = 1 is solved by setting (120) equal to zero, giving

it   follows immediately that tiD0 < 1.
       We have already shown H (topt ) =     -topt (1 - i ) M(topt ) < 0. Since tiD0 < 1 then M(tiD0 ) = 0 and so
H (tiD0 ) =  topt  - tiD0   1 + (1 - i ) M(tiD0 )= topt - tiD0 > 0. Using the continuity of M(ti ) and therefore
of H (ti ), it follows from the intermediate value theorem that there exists a tariff ti  with t D0 < t < topt at
                                                                                                i      i
which H (ti    ) = 0. By construction, this tariff is a fixed point of (13). QED

    Under 1  2 , we have D (ti ) < 0 from (120). Using Lemma 4 it follows that M(ti ) < 0, and
therefore from H (ti ) in (112), with i1 = 1, we have H (topt ) = -topt (1 - i ) M(topt ) > 0.
                                                                           ( t -1)
    Now we check a higher tariff ti > topt from Lemma 4 at which Em - i t 1 =0 and therefore M (ti ) = 0.

From H (ti ) in (112), with i1 = 1, we have H (ti ) = topt - ti [1 + (1 - i ) M (ti )] = topt - ti < 0. Using
from the continuity of M(ti ) and therefore of H (ti ), it follows from the intermediate value theorem that

fixed point of (13). QED

PROOF OF PART (c)
  We first establish conditions to ensure that A(ti ) > 0, starting with the region ti  topt .

Lemma 5. (1 - E4 )topt  1 when condition (18) holds, where E4 can be evaluated at any tariff. It follows that
A(ti ) > i (1 - 1 ) + i1 1 > 0 for all ti  topt .
                                                       1         1 ( 1 - 1 )
Proof: We want to ensure that (1 - E4 )               topt
                                                             =       1       .   Use (92) to obtain

                                                     1 1+i1 (1 -1)
                                                    1       1 i1                      1 ( 1 - 1 )
                                       1-                                                         .
                                            1       1 1 - i 1 1
                                                +   1 i1 1 (1 - ii1 )
                                                                                          1
                                            1

Then we take ii1 = 1 to get a sufficient condition

                         1 1 + i1 (1 - 1)  (  - 1 )                       1 - i 1
                    1-                     1 1       1 (1 - 1 ) (1 - 1 )          .                                            (123)
                         1     1 i1          1       1                      i 1


                                                                      A25
which is equivalent to (18) in the main text. Now the magnitude of A(ti ) is established from

                          A ( ti )    = i - ~ i1 + (1 -  i )       1-   ~ ii1 ti (1 - E4 ) + ~ ii1
                                          i -  ~ i1 + (1 -  i ) 1 -     ~ ii1 topt (1 - E4 ) +   ~ ii1
                                           i - ( 1 - i 1 )  1 + ( 1 -  i ) 1 -     ~ ii1 1 + ~ ii1
                                      >  i ( 1 -  1 ) + i 1  1 ,

where the first inequality follows from ti  topt , the second from (1 - E4 )topt  1 , and the final inequality
from [(1 -  ~ ii1 )1 + ~ ii1 ] > 1 . QED

    Next, we define the tariff tiA0 at which A(ti ) becomes zero, if it exists:

Definition 5. a) Define

                                          arg maxti tmin { A(ti ) = 0}        if this value exists,
                            tiA0                     i
                                                     tmin
                                                       i                           otherwise,

                                                         A0
                                                       ~ ii
and denote T A0  T (tiA0 ) and likewise for the shares            A0                            A0
                                                            1 and ii1 , which are evaluated at ti .

    In this definition we are looking for tariffs at which A(ti ) = 0, but there will be no such tariffs if
A(ti ) > 0 for all ti  tmin
                         i   . In that case, tiA0 = tmin
                                                     i   < 1. On the other hand, if there are multiple tariffs at
                         A 0
which A(ti ) = 0, then ti is the maximum of these. From Lemma 5 which relies on condition (18) we know
that tiA0 < topt . In Lemma 8 below, we will further show that condition (19) ensures that tiA0 < tiR0 , and we
know that tiR0 < 1 from Lemma 3, so tiA0 < 1.

Remark 6. The tariff tiA0 is the import subsidy referred to as ti in the statement of Theorem 1(c).

Lemma 7. For ti  (tmin
                   i   , 1), T (ti ) is monotonically increasing in ti provided that A(ti ) > 0.

Proof: From (54) combined with (55), T (ti ) is given by

                                                              ~ ii1
                                                              
                                                        T=          -~ i1 ,                                 (124)
                                                              ii1

which we differentiate to obtain,
                                                          ~ ii1
                                                          
                                                  dT =          ^
                                                                ~ ii1 - 
                                                                        ^ ii1 .
                                                          ii1
    Totally differentiate (53), we can show that

                                          ^ ii1 = (1 - ii1 ) 
                                                             ^
                                                             ~ ii1 - 1 - ~ ii1 t
                                                                               ^i .                         (125)
                                                   1-  ~ ii1

Then combining with (96), we obtain

                                     ^ ii1 - ~ ii1 = 1 
                                             ^             ~ - ii1                     ^
                                     
                                                     ~ ii1 ii1
                                                                   ^ ij 1 - (1 - ii1 ) ti .
                                                     

It follows that,
                                              1 ~                   ~

because  ~ ii1 < ii1 for ti < 1, we have established the monotonicity of T (ti ).

Lemma 8. A(ti ) > 0 for ti  [tiR0 , topt ] provided that (18) and (19) hold.

Proof:
    There are two cases to consider. The first case is where tiA0 = timin so that A ( t ) > 0 for all t > tmin . In
                                                                                        i              i   i
that case, the lemma holds trivially.
    The second case is where tiA0 > timin . Then according to (109), A ( t A0 ) = 0 at the tariff

Drop the share on the left and we get the sufficient condition

If ~ i1 < i , this restriction is satisfied. However, for  ~ i1 > i , then we need E4 sufficiently small so that the
above condition holds.
      From Lemma 5 we know that (1 - E4 )topt < 1 and it follows that E4 < 1. Then the sufficient condition
for (129) is

If i    ~ i1 then this condition is automatically satisfied, since then the right-hand side is less than or equal
to zero, while the left-hand side is positive. For i <                      R0 = 1 to get the sufficient condition
                                                         ~ i1 , we can take ii 1

We can substitute for E4 and the sufficient condition becomes
                                                       1       1 1 - i 1

A sufficient condition for this inequality is obtained by taking ii1 = 1 on the left, so

                         1        1 1 - i 1                                              1         1 1 - i 1

We therefore obtain (19) as the sufficient condition for tiA0 < tiR0 , which ensures the A(ti ) > 0 for ti

Proof: We define T opt  T (topt ) and D opt  D (topt ). It follows from substituting the expenditure share (36)
for k = i into the production share (50) and then into T (ti ) in (55) that

                                                                      topt - 1 (1 - ii1 )
                                           T opt = 1 - ~ i1 +                             .                                                   (132)
                                                                      1 + (topt - 1)ii1

It follows from (115) that

                   1-   ~ i1                           1 + i2 (2 - 1)                    ~ i1
                                                                                         
   D opt T opt =                   T opt (1 - (1 - ii1 ) E4 ) -        i 1  1 - i 1  1           (1 - ii1 ) E4 .
                    i 1  1                               i2 (2 - 1)                    1-   ~ i1

    It should be understood that the shares appearing in these equations are also evaluated at topt . Our
strategy, however, is to treat these shares as parameters and differentiate D opt T opt with respect to the share
ii1 so as to obtain a lower-bound on D opt T opt . During this process, we are allowing the production share
to adjust parametrically according to (50).
    The value D opt T opt changes with the share ii1 according to

      D opt T opt      1-   ~ i1       T opt                                      ~ i1

                     E4                     >                                                           - E4 (1 - ii1 ) .                                 (135)
                             1-   ~ i1        1 + (topt - 1)ii1                [1 + (topt     - 1)ii1 ]

Substituting topt =               so that topt - 1 =
                            1                                   1
                          1 - 1                                1 - 1 ,   we simplify this expression to obtain

                                     1                           1 (1 - ii1 )                                     1 + i 1  1   ~ i1
                     E4 -                                                       +1               > E4 1 -                                .
                               1 - 1 (1 - ii1 )                1 - 1 (1 - ii1 )                                      1-   ~ i1

Then we substitute (92) on the left and we use the bound from Lemma 5 on the right, which implies that

                                                      1 - 1 ( 1 - 1 )                   1 + i 1  1   ~ i1
                                                 >                             1-                            .
                                                            1                              1-   ~ i1
We set ii1 = 0 on the left to obtain a further sufficient condition
                                1  1 1 - i 1
                               1 + 1 1 i1                   1     - 1 ( 1 - 1 )                             1 + i 1  1   ~ i1
                                  1 1 - i 1 1
                                                      -         > 1                                  1-
                              1                           1 - 1                                                1-   ~ i1
                              1 + 1 i1 1
                                                                      1

After extensive simplification, this inequality is written as

                                                                          1 - 1
        (1 - i1 )2 1 (1 - 1 (1 - 1 )) (1 + i1 1 )                               + ( 1 - i 1 ) (  1 - 2  1 ) ( 1 - ( 1 - i 1 ) .  1 )
                                                                            1

            > 1 i1 1 (1 - (1 - i1 ) 1 ) - 1 i1 (1 - i1 ) (1 - 1 (1 - 1 )) (1 + i1 1 ) (1 - 1 )
This inequality fails to hold at i1 = 1, so lower values of i1 are needed. The first set of terms on the left
will involve a cubic in i1 , so to avoid that a sufficient condition is obtained by ignoring those (positive)


                                                                          A31
terms, resulting in

                            (1 - i1 ) (1 - 21 ) (1 - (1 - i1 ) 1 ) - 1 i1 1 (1 - (1 - i1 ) 1 )

                                 -1 i1 (1 - i1 ) (1 - 1 (1 - 1 )) (1 + i1 1 ) (1 - 1 ) .
A further simplification is obtained by observing that (1 + i1 1 ) on the right is made smaller by replacing
it with (1 - (1 - i1 ) 1 ), and dividing out that common term to obtain

                       (1 - i1 ) (1 - 21 )  1 i1 [1 - (1 - i1 ) (1 - 1 (1 - 1 )) (1 - 1 )] .

A sufficient condition for this inequality to hold is provided by (20).
   It follows that we can take ii1 = 0 to obtain a lower-bound for D opt T opt , and also  ~ ii1 = 0 from (50). So
                                                                opt          opt
we set both these shares at zero in (132) and (133) to obtain T |ii1 =0 = t -       ~ i1 and using this in (133),
we obtain

             D opt |ii1 =0 T opt |ii1 =0
                   1-   ~ i1                                                 1 + i2 (2 - 1)                  ~ i1
                                                                                                             
             =                    (topt - ~ i1 ) 1 - E4 |ii1 =0 +                           i 1  1 - i 1  1         E |       .
                    i 1  1                                                     i2 (2 - 1)                   1-  ~ i1 4 ii1 =0

We use these expressions to obtain a bound on D opt of

                           D opt T opt  D opt |ii1 =0 T opt |ii1 =0
           D opt       =       opt

We further set ~ ii1 in the denominator at zero to obtain another lower bound on D opt of

                                                                                   1+i2 (2 -1)                         ~

                   =                         1 - E4 |ii1 =0 1 +                                     -                            .

Evaluating the second term in this expression, we apply (18) which is equivalent to (123) to obtain

                                                          1 + ( 1 - 1 ) (1 - 1 )   topt - 1

                                                          1 + ( 1 - 1 ) (1 - 1 )   t +
                                                                                                          1

                                                                 i 1  1      ~ i1
                                                                             
In addition, the denominator of the term 1 +                  (topt -~ i1 ) 1-  ~ i1   is bounded below by using (18) again to obtain
~ i1 = (1 - i1 )1  1 /topt and so topt -            ~ i1 )  topt -
                                                                                              1                1

Proof: Using (112), the needed condition is that

where Mopt , Em , D opt , Aopt and Ropt are all evaluated at topt . Using Lemma 10, we can rewrite this
expression as

Therefore, we satisfy condition (12),       1+i1 (1 -1)

Because many of the variables on the right-hand side of this equation depend on expenditure or production
shares, we now develop a lower-bound for i that is independent of these shares.
    Using the method in the proof of Lemma 4, we first obtain

We substitute this along with the lower-bound for A(topt ) from Lemma 5, which we rewrite as A(topt ) >
