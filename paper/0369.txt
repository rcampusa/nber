       Energy Prices, Inflation, and Recession, 1974—75



                           ABSTRACT




       The energy price shock depressed real output by two percent

in 1974 and by five percent in 1975, according to our results.

Prices rose by four percent in 1974 and by another two percent

in 1975. These conclusions are derived from an aggregate model

of the U.S. economy with an explicit role of energy in production.

The distinction between expected and unexpected shocks is an

important part of the model. We also examine monetary and fiscal

policies that might have offset the energy shock.

 I. INTRODUCTION

        The rapid escalation of energy prices in late 1973 and early 1974 has a

 dominant role in most accounts of the deep recession and high inflation of

 the mfd—1970s. This paper presents a quantitative appraisal of the response

of real output, prices, and employment to the energy price shock.      It

considers both   the   substitution away from energy as an input to production

that occurred because of the shock and also traces the monetary and general

mcroeconomjc effects. Two of the most important mechanisms considered are
the   adverse impact of higher energy prices on the permanent incomes of
consumers and the reduction in investment brought about by higher interest
rates. The analysis of these and other channels of influence of energy
prices is carried out    within a compact macroeconomic model of the U.S.

economy   with an explicit treatment of energy.
       Our findings suggest that the energy price shock depressed real output
by   two percent in 1974 and by five percent in 1975, and so accounts for at
least   two—thirds of the total decline   in real output from trend that occurred

in those years. Consumption declined permanently by about three percent in

response to the decline in real incomes associated with the Increase in

price of a product which the nation imports, on net. Investment fell

temporarily but by a much larger percent. Prices rose by four percent in

1974 because of the energy shock, and inflation worsened by another two

percent in 1975. Together with the impact of the termination of price

controls, energy prices can account for all of the enormous acceleration of

inflation observed in 1974, but falls short of explaining the continued

inflation in 1975. The deep recession of 1974—75 could have been offset

or moderated by suitable policies.     In particular, the announcement in 1974

of a monetary expansion to take place in 1975 could have postponed the
                                      —2-




 inflation until 1975 and eliminated the recession. This conclusion

demonstrates our model's ability to handle the expectational issues that are

now recognized to be so important in studying the influence of aggregate

policy, but, of course, the conclusion rests on the stark assumption that

the public would believe an announcement of future policy.     Il fiscal

expansion could also havemoderated the recession, but at the cost of

inflation of almost 20 percent. in 1974. The bias in our model toward a

monetary rather than a fiscal offset comes from its incorporation of a full

treatment of the adverse effect of expansionary fiscal policy on aggregate

supply. We also look at the possible success of policies to counteract the

inflationary impetus from the energy shock. We conclude that contractionary

money policy would probably not have been capable of fully offsetting energy

inflation, and only an impracticably large fiscal contraction would have

done the job.

     Our work follows in the footsteps of a number of innovative earlier

studies. One of the first to predict the recession as a result of the

energy shock seems to have been Robert Gordon (1974). A number of later

studies have followed. Some of these have made important theoretical

contributions, like Gordon (l975a), E. Phelps (1978), Solow (1978), and

Findlay   and Roderigues (1977). Others have   employed quantitative models to
simulate   the 1974—75 experience. These include Pierce and Enzler (1974),
Berner et al. (1975), Perry (1975a, b), Eckstein (1978), Fair (1978), Klein
(1978), and from a slightly different perspective Hudson and Jorgenson
(1978). Contributions of the more   informal type include Haberler (1976),

Serot (1978), and Okun (1975). The   present paper is, to our knowledge,   the

first attempt to give a unified treatment of the issues associated with

factor substitution on the one hand and monetary and general macroeconomic
                                         — 3-.




     aspects on the other. We have done this by constructing a medium-sized

    macroeconomic model of the U.S. with an explicit treatment of energy. The

    modeling of energy demand is similar to the various general equilibrium

    energy-economy models (cf. e.g. Hudson and Jorgenson (1977) exce0t that our

    model has a simpler, one—sector structure. The price of energy is taken as

    exogenous, which is convenient for studying the macroeconomic effects.

         The macroeconomic structure of our model includes a financial system,

    which enables us to study various aspects of inflation and monetary policy.

    The model incorporates the hypothesis of rational expectations, but it is

    also somewhat Keynesian in treating money wages as predetermined in the short

    run.. In a purely classical economy where wages clear the labor market

•
    instantaneously, an unexpected energy price increase would reduc the level

    of output as a way of substituting away from energy. Because of an accelerator

    effect on investment, this impact would be larger in the short than in the

    long run. However, there would be no effect on employment or prices. When

    the price of one factor, energy, increases, the price of other factors,

    especially the wage, would fall to offset it. Full employment should always

    prevail, and the price level should be linked directly to the money stock.

    In our model, on the contrary, wages respond slowly to unexpected changes

    in energy prices (and to all other surprises in the economy). During the

    period following an energy price increase but before the accommodating change

    in the wage, labor is priced too high for full employment. Furthermore,

    with wages sticky, an energy price increase increases the price level, so

    that the real money supply is lowered, which has an additional contractionary

    effect on the economy. Our model deals explicitly with these aspects of the

    effect of an energy price shock; investment and interest rates play an

    important role in the relation between the sticky wage rate and the
                                       -4-




resulting levels of prices, output, ard employment.

     When energy is partly imported, as in the U.S. of the 1970s, another

consideration links output and employment to an unexpected increase in energy

prices -—   higher   prices make the U.S. poorer and so reduce the level of

consumption in real terms.. Often this is compared to the imposition of a

tax on U.S. consumers. with the proceeds going to foreigners. As the U.S. is

made poorer, energy—supplying nations become richer. They acquire claims

upon the U.S. and face the choice of accumulating the claims (as government

or corporate bonds, stocks, direct investments and so on) or cashing them in

for goods produced in the, U.S. Our model does not attempt to explain the

choices' of oil producers in this regard, but uses a guess that oil producers

spend a relatively small fraction of their new income on U.S. goods. This

seems consistent. with observations on actual behavior in recent years.

II. The Model

     The results of this paper are. obtained by simulation of a macro model of

the U.S. economy with explicit treatment of energy. The model was con-

structed on the basis of the one used by Hall (1978a), but contains some

important extensions and revisions. The present model treats the economy as

having two. sectors, goodsand energy. Only the goods sector is fully repre-

sented in the model. Energy is used as an input to the goods sector and is

thought of as primary energy, such as crude oil, natural gas at the welihead,

and coal at the minemouth. For simplicity, there is a single price of energy,

though it should be recognized that this is only a rough approximation. The

price of energy is viewed as exogenous, and what cannot be supplied by the

domestic energy sector is imported. The price elasticity of domestic energy

supply is not considered here.

     The goods sector combines labor, capital, and energy to produce goods.

The, term "goods" covers all sorts of goods and services and includes finished

energy products such as gasoline and electricity. Total goods production is

allocated among consumption, investment in the goods sector, government

expenditures, net export of goods, and deliveries to the energy sector. It

differs from real GNP by the amount of the last item, which is small, and

net eergy imports.

     Within this sector, the critical elements of the model are the tech-

nology constraint, the price equation, the specifications of the investment.

process and wage determination, including lags; the consumption function;

and the demand function for money.

     The technology constraint is represented in the form of a unit cost

function

           q(e1t     1'E' K'                                     (1)

 where w is the aggregate wage rate,             the price of energy, and         the nominal

 rental price of capital.       is specified as a translog function and has the

 following properties. The own price elasticity of energy demand is about

 —0.3, and the partial elasticities of substitution are about zero for capital

and energy, unity for capital and labor, and around one half for energy and

labor. These are long—run elasticities; short-run behavior            is   modeled by
specifying K as the shadow price of existing capital .           The low value for the own

elasticity of energy in the aggregate is supported by evidence by Mork (l973a)

and by casual reading of post—1973 data. The unitary elasticity of substi-

tution between capital and labor is strongly supported by the evidence of

Berndt (1976) and many other authors. For the corresponding elasticity

between capital and energy, strikingly different estimates can be found in

various parts of the literature.' Despite new insights and attempted recon—

ciliations,2 the issue seems to remain a subject of controversy. Our choice

of a zero elasticity is partly based on the evidence of Hudson and Jorgenson

(1978). Although their model has capital-energy complementarity for the

manufacturing sector, substitutability in service industries and interindustry

shifts in final demand gives a net effect on capital intensity of the

1973-74 energy price increase that is very close to zero. We hope to pursue

this issue at a later stage.

       The overall price leve, defined as the money price of goods., is

determined as standard unit cost, described by the price equation

            (1 —   T)P =   (e1t w°,   Ps,, PV)                              (2)


where T is a tax parameter for indirect
                                                 taxes. The function 4 is the same as

in (1), but the arguments are slightly different. First, fluctuations in the

efficiency wage due to cyclical variations in productivity, are excluded from

the price equation (2) where as the technology constraint (1) includes them.

Secondly, the capital price used in the price equation is a long-run average

of the real rental price times the price level rather than the actual nominal

price as in (1). This formulation corresponds with the following important

findings of the price equation literature: (1) Apart from the effect via

wages, fluctuations in demand have little or no effect on the price level;1

(2) prices show no sensitivity to cyclical fluctuations in productivity;2

and (3) transitory fluctuations in interest rates do not affect prices.3 In

addition, this specification seems to give a sensible estimate of the partial

impact on the price level of an energy price increase, namely the share of

energy in variable cost.

         Investment demand is derived from the demand for capital. However, in

the short run, the model assumes that the economy's ability to adjust the

capital stock is limited. Part of the investment in the next few years is

already committed today and cannot be adjusted in response to new informa-

tion. Specifically, this is modeled by treating capital as an aggregate of

m categories, such that the quantity of category j needs to be determined

j   -1   years in advance. Each category enters symmetrically in the technology

model; but the categories are imperfect substitutes in production, since

otherwise all investment would be concentrated in the category with the

shortest lead time.     In the year of the energy shock, investment in m -   1


categories is committed already, whereas investment in the last category is

 determined by the demand for capital of that category as determined by present

and expected future prices and demand. The next year, another category

becomes "flexible" until all capital and investment is determined by post-

energy shock forces after four years. This formulation, which is adapted

from Hall (l978a), does justice to the physical lags in the investment

process without introducing arbitrary lags for expectation formulation)

     The lag in wage determination is incorporated in a similar way, except

that it is the nominal wage, not the quantity of labor services, that is com-

mitted in advance. When wages are set, they clear the labor market., or come

as close as they can given current information about future demand for labor.

When unexpected events occur, such as the doubling of the price of energy

considered here, the demand function for labor determines the level of em—

ployment, which may then be well below the supply of labor. This can be

interpreted as a characterization of the Keynesian hypothesis of wage

rigidity and is an attempt to embody the view that the labor market achieves

equality of supply and demand in the long run but that the process takes

time. It implies a kind of Phillips curve for the economy. However, in

place of the expected inflation term that has been the source of so much

instability and conceptual ambiguity in the literature on the Phillips curve,

expectations of future labor demand are formed using the model itself. In

particular, feedback from prices to wages occurs in the model to the extent

that price increases signal current or future increases in the demand for

labor (as they typically do).

     This formulation, set forth by Hall (l978a), has been extended in two

 appropriate.

 directions. First, a cost of living increase has been added to the pre—

 connitted wage rate. Specifically, for each percentage point of unexpected

 price inflation, the Coniiitted wage rate is raised by 0.25 percent in the

 same year and another 0.25 percent in the
                                             year after. Roughly, this corres-
 ponds to a 50 percent escalation clause with a six month lag, assumed to

 reflect the time needed for data collection.   The inclusion of this feature
 is justified by the widespread occurrence of such clauses in the U.S. labor

 contracts (cf. Mitchell (1978)) as well as the theoretical argument
                                                                     by Hall
 and Lilien (1979) that efficient labor contracts will have this feature.

 Furthermore, it allows for a positive feedback from
                                                       energy prices to wages
 in the short run. Since it turns out
                                        that an energy price increase lowers
the demand for labor permanently,
                                    however, this positive feedback is counter-
acted by a tendency towards lower wages in the longer run.

     The other extension is an adjustment fn the comitted wage rate to in-

corporate cyclical movements in labor productivity. This feature makes the

model obey Okun's law but has few other implications and thus will not be

discussed in detail here.

     Consumption in the model is determined by permanent income. Consumers

are viewed as looking into the future to evaluate their future incomes, and

then choosing a growth path of consumption that is the highest feasible given

expected future income. The behavior of consumption has the character de-

scribed by Hall (1978b) —— consumers
                                     always plan a constant growth rate for
consumption. When new information arrives, they make an immediate once—and—

for-all adjustment to the level of consumption. We assume that consumption

is unaffected by real interest rates, in the sense that the rate of growth

of planned consumption does not depend on the interest rate. Note that the

assumption in Hall (1978a) that consumption is unresponsive to all economic
                                      -1 0—




events is replaced by an explicit dependence on permanent income.

     Government expenditure and net export of goods are taken to be

exogenous. Among other things this means that, rather than modeling the

behavior of petroleum exporting countries, we use an outside estimate of

their demand for U.S. goods.

     In the money demand function, the major issue is the specification of

the variable that measures the dollar volume of transactions.   The use of

nominal gross national product for this purpose is one of the many reasons

that macroeconomic models in existence in 1973 were unable to deal effectively

with the energy price shock (cf. the remarks by Pierce and Enzler, op. cit.,

p. 16) -— nominal GNP subtracts imports and so cancels out much of the effect

of higher energy prices. We use the dollar volume of output from the goods

sector as a proxy for transactions. This variable makes sense in view of the

fact that much of the money stock is in the hands of consumers, not businesses.

We neglect the small contribution to the demand for money that might come

from the energy sector (recall that all energy passes through the goods

sector on its way to final demand).

     A technical presentation of the model is given in the Appendix.

 HI. Actual Performance of the U.S. Economy, 1973—77

       The upper panel of Table 1 summarizes the
                                                   actual performance of the U.S.
 economy over the last five years. The data have been recast so as to fit

 into the sectoral and conceptual framework
                                              of our model. Gross output is
 defined as total GNP minus GNP
                                  originated in the energy sector (defined as
 co&1 mining and oil and gas extraction), plus the value of primary energy

 input to the goods sector.1 Investment is defined
                                                      as gross private domestic
 investment except structures for mining exploration, shafts, and wells, and

mining and oilfield machinery. Rather than following the practice of double

deflation, which can be misleading over a period with changing relative

prices, all nominal figures were deflated by a coninon price index. We used

the   Consumer Price Index for this purpose and for general description of the
price level over the period. We preferred the CPI to the GNP deflator
because it corresponds better to our definition of gross output.2'3
      rn spite of the differences in definition, the numbers of Table 1 are

very close to the standard macroeconomic variables. This
                                                             similarity is,
however, the result of several factors
                                         working in different directions. Thus,
the decline in gross output is made larger than the fall in GNP by the

exclusion of the domestic energy sector, whereas the increased value of

energy imports worked in the opposite direction. Furthermore,
                                                                  deflation by

 Mork's data base (cf. Mark et. al. (1978)). Some extrapolation was
 necessary for 1976 and 1977; the possible extrapolation errors are not
 likely to have been important.
    noted by Pierce and Enzler (op. cit.), import price increases affect the
 GNP deflator only through the increases in the prices of domestically
 produced substitutes. There is no direct effect because imports are
 substracted off in the computation of GNP from gross output data.

the CPI made for a somewhat larger decline in real output in 1974.

     The   largest decline in real output took place from 1973   to   1974 with a
growth   rate   of -1.5 percent. The depth of the recession was, however,

reached in 1975 with real production 2.3 percent below its 1973 level. This

was also the year of record high unemployment rates. As for the components

of output, the decline in investment in 1974—75 was most spectacular, as was

its rapid rebound during the recovery. However, the stagnation of consump-

tion was equally significant. Net exports of goods increased substantially

in 1974 and 1975 but declined in 1976 and 1977, apparently as a result of

the worldwide recession.

     The price level movements over this period are well known. The first

jump came with higher food prices in 1973 with another jump, twice as large,

partly caused by higher energy prices, following in 1974. Although inflation

slowed down somewhat after these jumps, prices continued to rise at high rates

in 1975 and the following years. The development of the value of energy

imports from 1972 to 1974 illustrates the transfer of wealth from the U.S. to

oil-exporting countries. Part of the increase is due to an increase in

quantity. This accounts for about half of the increase from 1972 to 1973.

For the following year, however, the quantity increase was minimal. Thus,

the wealth transfer may be roughly approximated as a $19 billion annual

transfer of income.

IV. Estimates of the Energy Price Shock

       Our first step was to prepare a base case describing the possible evolu-

tion of the economy from 1973 in the absence of the abrupt increase in the

price, of energy. Table 2 shows the assumptions in the base case and the

model's corresponding projections. The nominal price of energy was assumed

to increase at the same rate as the general price level. For all years except

1974 this was assumed to be 5 percent, which is the natural rate of Inflation

of the model. For 1974 an additional 2 percent inflation was projected as a

result   of the removal of general wage and price controls. The committed
wage rate and the money stock were assumed to grow at 6.3 percent and 6 per-
cent per     year respectively. Investment commitments for 1974 were assumed to

be   somewhat lower than investment In the mini-boom of 1973 and     to grow

smoothly     from then on. The labor force, expressed as the natural rate of
employment, was assumed to grow at about 1 .7 percent per year, which is
about the same as population growth in recent years.1        When combined with
a labor productivity growth rate of 1 .2 percent, this gives a total natural

growth rate of slightly below 3 percent. This is lower than the postwar

average but seems well in accordance with recent experience.

       The   model's projections are   based on the absence of any surprises or

shocks. The employment rate is the natural or equilibrium rate, which is

6    percent in our model. The wages actually set (the "flexible wage rate")
equal the committed levels; roughly the same is true for investment. Real
output grows smoothly and inflation proceeds at 5 percent.
       Table 3   presents   the modePs estimates of the effects of an unexpected
increase in the price of energy starting in 1974. Here the price of energy

 takes an unexpected jump of 68 percent in 1974 relative to its value in the

base case. There is an additional but smaller surprise in 1975, so in that

year the price of energy is 105 percent higher than in the base case. In all

subsequent years the real price of energy is the same as in 1975. These

figures were chosen to approximate the actual events of 1973-75 and are dis-

cussed in more detail below. Note that the increases are in addition to the

projected increases of 7 and 5 percent respectively in each of the two years.

     Monetary policy is assumed unchanged from the base case, but the simula-

tion run underlying Table 3 assumes a permanent downward shift in money demand

of 2 percent     starting in 1976   in accordance with recent observations) Net

exports   of   goods are assumed to increase but only by a fraction of the

transfer of income from the U.S. to foreigners following the oil price

increase (Cf. Table 1). Specifically, the sum of net exports of goods and

government expenditures is assumed to follow its actual path for 1974—76 and

to grow at a constant rate after that.



Overall Impact

     The energy price shock generates a sizeable recession in the model. The

energy price increase affects the economy via two principal channels. The

first is a permanent lowering of the growth path of the economy as a result

of labor-energy substitution. The higher energy prices induce more labor-

intensive methods of production, but since the supply of labor is fixed in

the long run, this can be done only by lowering output. The reduction in

output carries with it an accelerator-effect on investment.      Consumption is
also affected since real income to domestic consumers is reduced by the

amount of increase of the real value of energy imports. This effect is,

1Cf. Goldfeld (1976).
                                    -l 8-.




however, mitigated, first by the substitution away from energy, and secondly

by the fact that some of the energy imports are financed by accumulating

claims rather than export of goods. For the same reason, exports of goods

is increased, but by less than the increase in energy imports. All these

effects concern only the real part of the economy; the story told above is

essentially a one—sector version of Hudson and Jorgenson's multisectoral

studies,1 except that our model does not assume that the labor market clears.

More than half of the recession in the model seems explainable this way.

     The other channel is related specifically to the financial sector of the

economy. As wages are largely predetermined when the shock occurs, the

sharp energy price increase causes a jump in the. price level. Consequently,

the transactions demand for money increases; stated equivalently, the real

money supply declines, so that, in Keynesian terms, the LH-curve shifts to

the left. The financial tightening drives up interest rates, thus dis-

couraging investment. The resulting loss in real wealth depresses consump-

tion as well. The fall in real money supply-is furthermore increased by

additional increases in the price level triggered by cost of living

escalators in wage contracts, and by a permanent increase in the real

interest rate of 0.35 percentage points.

     The net result of all these forces and their interactions is an extra-

ordinarily high inflation rate combined with a severe recession. For 1974,

the model estimates that the total impact on real output was a reduction of

26 billion dollars, or about 2 percent. This is almost exactly the same

amount as the reduction in consumption, whereas investment decreased by

7 billion and net exports of goods and government expenditure increased by

the same amount. The effect on output is largest in the second and third
                -

years after the shock, in 1975-76, when real output is down by 63 and

 54 billion 1972 dollars, respectively. The bulk of this is decreased invest-

ment,    especially in 1975; but the 3.3 percent permanent drop in consumption
 is sizeable enough.   The fall in real output Is acconipanied by a decline in

employment of 2 million workers in 1975 and a corresponding increase in the

unemployment   rate of 1.7 percentage points.
       The predicted effect on the price level is substantial in the first two
years.    The monetary expansion implicit in the shift in money demand from
1976 maintains the effect and Increases it slightly. In terms of rates of
inflation, the effect is by far largest in 1974 with 4 percentage points
added to the inflation rate. It tapers off thereafter and becomes slightly

negative in 1977. The model offers a complete explanation of inflation in

1974, but cannot explain completely the cOntinued high inflation in 1975 and

the following years.

       Comparing Table 3 with the lower panel of Table 1, the energy price

shock appears to explain about two thirds of the recession in terms of

decline in real output in 1974 and 1975, and practically all its shortfall

thereafter     As will be shown below, however, a part of the remaining one
third for the first two years can be explained as a decline in the demand for
consumer durables, which is not treated explicitly by our model. This may
increase the 1974—75 figures from two thirds to about four fifths. The mag-
nitude of these ratios depend, however, crucial.ly on how large the total
recession is thought to be, in other words,     what the   base case should be
like. Thus, our base case incorporates a . billion drop in investment from
1973—74. Also, the natural growth rate in our model        is lower than the post-

war average, but close to the average of the early seventies. We find it
                                      -20-




difficult to draw firm   conclusions about the total magnitude of the
recession.    It seems clear, however, that the energy price shock was its

largest single cause; and that, given the assumptions used here, very little

of the behavior of real output is left unexplained.


Consumption

     Consumption is determined by permanent income in our model. This, in turn,

is affected mainly by three factors associated with the energy price increase.

The largest, and perhaps most obvious effect comes from the transfer of income

resulting from the increased value of energy imports. The magnitude of the

transfer is reduced somewhat by substitution away from energy; but the

19 billion figure derived in section III may serve as a good approximation.

     The second factor affecting permanent income is the recession itself.

The decline in investment induced by the financial tightening represented a

permanent loss of productive capacity and hence income. The third factor

goes the other way and follows from the fact that oil-exporting countries

accumulate part of their new wealth as claims on the U.S. economy rather than

spending it. Since this accumulation is in fact saving, the productive

capacity of the U.S. economy is increased, and hence permanent income)

     The simulated consumption path tracks actual consumption quite well .   The

exception occurs mainly in 1975, when actual decline was much larger; and a

similar, but much smaller discrepancy is found for 1974. The main reason

for this discrepancy is probably the failure of our model to account



1This result depends crucially on the assumption that oil exporters will not
 attempt to exchange their claims for U.S. goods in the foreseeable future.
 If this were expected, the model should have assumed a future increase in
 the net export of goods. This wouH have reduced Dermanent income for
 domestic consumers.
                                     —21—




explicitly for the special behavior of expenditures for consumer durables.1

As is well known, a decline in permanent income has an accelerator-like effect

on the spending on durables. For the present drop in permanent income, the

resulting one—time drop in spending can be estimated roughly as 15 billions.

f it is assumed that one third of this took place in 1974 and the rest in

1975, the consumption level of 1974 is explained fully, and half of the gap is

closed for 1975.2 The authors hope to return to this issue in future work

with the model.


Itment
     Since investment demand is derived from the demand for capital as an input

to production, the magnitude of the decline in investment in the model depends

on the elasticity of substitution between capital and energy, which we have

assumed to be practically zero. The drop in investment would have been larger

with capital-energy complementarity and lower if the two inputs are substi-

tutes in production. Although our choice of a zero elasticity is open for

attack from both sides, it does give a good tracking of the actual investment

data. We hope to investigate this aspect more carefully at a later stage.



Price Level

     Our model indicates that the effect of the energy price shock on the

                                                                         Adding
 consumer durables as a third asset in addition to money and capital would
 have added considerably to the complexity of the model because of its
 rational expectations property, so that the solution method presently used
would have been highly inadequate.
2The discussion of this aspect in the literature (cf. Eckstein (1978),
                                                                       Perry
 (1975a), Okun (1975)) has concentrated on automobile sales, which dropped
 substantially in 1974. One has to be cautious, however, so as not to
 confuse income and substitution effects in automobile demand, since a good
 deal of the change that took place was from larger to smaller cars, and
 possibly from automobiles to other, less energy—intensive consumer goods.

general price level was quite substantial.   In fact, it can be claimed that the

extraordinary inflation in 1974 can be explained completely by this event and

the removal of general price controls. Table 4 shows a decomposition of in-

flation in 1974 and 75. Out of the 11 percent inflation in 1974, the model

attributes 2.8 percentage points, or about one fourth of the total, to the

direct impact of higher energy prices. Another 0.7 percentage points are attri-

buted to the permanent increase in the real cost of capital,1 and a similar

contribution comes from wage increases. The wage increase itself is a weighted

average of the increase due to cost of living clauses and the decrease in the

market-clearing wage. This decrease is somewhat lower than it would have been

if the monetary expansion implicit in the shift in money demand had not been

assumed.2 Adding all these effects. gives a total contribution to inflation

of about 4 percentage points. Together with the effect of price decontrol

and natural inflation in the model, this gives an inflation rate in 1974 that

is very close to the observed increase in the consumer price index.

     The 1975 inflationary experience is not so easily explained by our model.

There was another direct impact of energy price increase about half as much as

in 1974, and wages continued to increase somewhat in the model. There is,

however, a gap of 2percentage points of inflation for 1975 that we are unable

to explain as a result of the energy price shock.

     The impact on the price' level depends of course crucially on the measure-

ment of the energy price increase itself. It is worthwhile to consider this

problem in a little more detail. The price of energy covers all forms of

'We are aware that previous attempts to find an interest rate effect in the
 price equation have not been very successful (cf. section II above). Our
 price equation reflects this finding by excluding the current real interest
 rate and using a long—run average instead. Failure to include this long—run
 average would have produced a serious logical inconsistency in our model by
 forcing firms to run permanent deficits.
    the other hand, this shift also gives a slight permanent reduction in
 the real interest rate, which tends to reduce the price level.

primary energy: crude oil (and imported petroleum products), natural gas,

coal, and hydroelectric and nuclear power. The observed crude oil prices for

this period were affected by the price equalization program. It has been

argued, however, that this program was hot fully effective in regulating the

price of oil to final users because the prices of petroleum products are largely

determined by the world market.1 Rather than taking sides in this discussion,

we looked at the published prices of petroleum products, calculated backwards

what the increase in crude prices would have been to give the observed product

price increase, and termed this the effective increase in crude oil prices.

This was 110 percent from 1973 to 1974 and 16 percent the following year. For

coal, the wholesale price index was assumed satisfactory, which gave 52 and

16 percent increases for the two years, respectively. Hydra and nuclear elec-

tricity were evaluated as the fossil fUel cost it replaces, and their prices

were assumed to follow that of coal. The most serious problem existed for

natural gas because the observed prices obviously did not clear the market in

the relevant period. At this point we made the assumption that the effective

price of gas followed that of crude oil. We then computed a preliminary energy

price index as a Divisia index of the coal and oil prices. This gave an increase

in the price of primary energy of 99 percent in 1974 and 16 percent in 1975.

We recognize, however, that, because of regulations and controls, only a part

of the 1974 increase reached the final users in that year. This is particularly

true for fuel used for electricity and utility gas, because energy deliveries

from utilities typically cannot be resold in the open market. Consequently, we

assumed that the effective real increase in the price of energy in 1974 was only

80 percent of what our preliminary index indicated, but that our energy price

level for 1975 was fully effective. This gave the energy price numbers in

Table 3.

 V. Comparison of Models

       Table 5 presents the estimates of six different models of the impact of

 the energy price shock on inflation, aggregate output, investment, and con-

sumption. For results other than our own in Table 3, the sources are

 Eckstein (1978) for the DRI model, Perry (1975b) for the FRB and University

of Michigan models, Pierce and Enzler (1974) for the FIPS model, and Fair

 (1978) for Fair's model. Making the estimates comparable offered some

problems. First, inflation is measured by different indices in the various

models. This is discussed further below.        Secondly, the sector division of

our model is somewhat different from the rest. We assume, though, that

relative changes in GNP and gross output of our model are roughly comparable,

and that the same is true for investment in the goods sector as against

overall investment. Thirdly, since the models have different baseline

projections, deviations  for the real variables are presented as percentages
of the actual levels. A special problem was encountered for the MPS model,
which was simulated from 1967 rather     than l974. For this model, deviations
for   the real variables   were computed in percent of the actual levels of 1967

etc., but presented as results     for 1974 and the following years. Finally,
different   deflators had been used, resulting in real figures in 1958 and

1972 as well as 1973 dollars. Using the 1972 deflators of the three years,

these were all converted to 1972 dollars.

      Because of the different measures used, it is difficult to compare the

estimates of the inflationary impact of the energy price increase. As

discussed above in section II, the GNP deflator tends to give a lower esti-

mate than measures of consumer prices, because imports are subtracted off in

the construction of the GNP deflator. This difference becomes apparent in

Eckstein's figures, who presents estimates for both the GNP deflator and the

 Consumer Price Index as well. Furthermore, Fair's estimate is based on a

slightly different definition of the shock in that he compares actual inflation

to predicted inflation with all import prices growing at 6 percent per year.

However, even accounting for this difference, Fair's estimates seem unreasonably

high, implying that import prices were responsible for three quarters of all

inflation in 1974. Comparing our model to the remaining ones we find that,

even after accounting for the conceptual differences, our estimate of the

inflationary impact is substantially higher, whereas the other models agree

fairly well among themselves.

     Given the disagreement about the effect on inflation, the estimates of the

real effects are remarkably close. All models predict a significant recession

as a result of the energy price shock, but no model depicts this shock as its

single cause. It may also be noted that the more recently published results,

whose authors benefited from hindsight, indicate a deeper recession. Ibpefully,

this means that economists have learned some lessons over the past few years.

       The real effect of the energy price shock is different in our model not

so much in magnitude as in structure. With a slightly unconventional formula-

tion of money demand1 and a relatively high interest elasticity of investment

demand, the drop in investment becomes the most significant feature of the

recession in our model. Indeed, our model predicts a drop in investment for

1975 tnat is three times as large as in the DRI model and very close to what

actually happened. The Michigan model has figures similar to the DRI model

for investment, and the FRB model somewhat less.    Pierce and Enzler do not

report results for investment separately; but judging from the changes in

       All models predict significant effects on consumption)    it is

interesting to note that models with more or less Keynesian consumption

functions give results that are very similar to our permanent income formula-

tion with rational expectations. It is clearly suggested by the numbers of

Table 5 that the assessment of the real effects of energy price changes is

quite robust with respect to many basic model assumptions.




Eckstein's effect on consumption is based on comparison with unrevised actual
 figures published at an early date. If we compare with the revised figures,
 his   numbers for consumption would decrease to -.1.4 percent in both 1974 and
1975. This is the result of the fact that, from March to July 1976, actual
growth in consumption for 1975 was revised upwards from 0.9 to 1.9 percent.
As Eckstein pointed out to us in private conversation, this means that data
revisions were almost as large as the effect of the energy price shock.

VI. Policies to Offset the Macroeconomic Impacts of the Energy Shock

     The effects of the energy price shock on output, employment, and prices

could have been altered by manipulation of macroeconomic policy instruments.

For example, with monetary or fiscal expansion, the effects on output and

employment    could have been attenuated or even eliminated. Table 6 shows the
results of two such policies, both aimed at stabilizing   employment at around

6 percent in all years.

     The two policies are expansion of the money supply and a government

spending program. The monetary expansion alternative seems by far the most

attractive of the two. It gives higher real growth and much lower infla-

tionary response than the fiscal expansion. The necessary monetary expansion

has a somewhat curious form: no extraordinary money growth is needed in the

year of the shock, if an announcement is made that money supply will grow by

an extra 2.4 percentage points the year after, 1.2 percentage points in the

third year, and then return to its normal growth rate. The inflationary

response of this policy is also somewhat surprising, in that inflation is

predicted to go down rather than up in the year of the shock. The explana-

tion for this is that monetary expansion lowers the real interest rate per-

manently and that this effect dominates the Phillips curve effect for this

year. Obviously, this response is a conjecture and has not been inferred

     Fiscal   expansion can also stabilize the unemployment rate. However, a

significant part of the employment effect in this case is a substitution

effect as fiscal expansion increases the real interest rate substantially.

second year occurs with the opposite sign, but this does not change the over-

all picture very much. Finally, there is a problem of how to carry out this

policy. As a pure spending program it could be done as shown in Table 6,

but it is clear that the amounts of extra spending needed are extremely

large. In practice, tax cuts have been more popular among political decision

makers; but there seems no simple answer to how an increase in spending

equivalent to the one in Table 6 could have been obtained within a framework

of permanent income consumption.

        The other possible policy goal is of course to stabilize inflation. On

the surface, monetary restraint seems the most obvious candidate for this

purpose. However, although monetary policy is the perfect i.nstrurnent for

affecting the price level in the long run In our model, the short run is not

so simple. It turns out that the monetary contraction needed to depress wages

sufficiently in our model also pressures the real interest rate upward perma-

nently, so that the negative effect on prices is offset. We wereable to

simulate a monetary response that brought inflation rates for the first two

years back to their base case levels only by introducing a monetary expansion

in the third year that would be even more extreme than the contraction needed

in the first two. Although this did the trick of keeping down the real

interest rate, we do not find this alternative credible for actual policy-

making. Hence, we conclude that eliminating the energy—induced inflation in

1974—75 by monetary policy would not have been practically feasible.

        Since fiscal policy has the opposite effect on interest rates, it seems

more attractive for this purpose. Table 7 shows the results of such a simula-

tion. However, the necessary policy response is     unrealistically   large; indeed,

a near 35 percent surplus in the federal budget would have been needed in

1975.    We   conclude that any attempt to eliminate the increased inflation in

this    period completely would have been fUtile.

VII. Summary and Conclusions

     We have constructed and simulated a relatively small macroeconomic model

of the United States with energy. The important features of the model are a

technology constraint with the three inputs capital, labor, and energy and

with a flexible functional form; a money demand function with gross output

as the transaction variable; a permanent income consumption function;

rational expectations; and some important short run rigidities, notably in

wage and price determination and in the investment process.

     Large and unanticipated changes in the price of energy are found to have

substantial disruptive effects on the economy. We have simulated the 1973—74

energy price increase and found the following effects: the rate of inflation

was increased by four percentage points in 1974 and near two percentage

points in 1975. Real output was decreased by 26 billion dollars (1972) in

1974, 63 billion in 1975, and around 50 billion in each of the following

three years. For 1975, the relative decline was near 5 percent. The effect

was found to have been largest for investment, but consumption decreased by

a significant 3.3 percent in each year. The effects on employment can be

expressed as an increase in the unemployment rate of near one percentage

point in 1974, rising to 1.7 percentage points in 1974, and tapering off

thereafter. The energy price shock was clearly a major cause of the 1974-75

recession and inflation. Other forces were present, however, such as the

removal of the last price controls of the Economic Stabilization Program,

and the slowdown of investment activity after the preceding miniboom. The

collective effect of these and other possible factors seem, though, to have

been substantially less than that of the energy price shock.

     Our findings carry obvious implications for the expected effects of

current events in the world market for oil. At the time of this writing it

is not entirely clear how large the price increase is going to be and how

much of it will be unanticipated. It seems likely that the oil price increase

will be substantially smaller than in 1974; however, the aggregate cost share

of energy is larger in the U.S. today than it was. five years ago, which

suggests a larger effect per percentage point of energy price increase. The

authors plan to follow up the present paper with a study of these events.

Appendix:         Technical Presentation of the Model

       The model is a monetary growth model of a type similar to that of

Sidrauski     (1967), but with energy as a third factor, rigidities In the   short

run, and rational expectations. The static part of the model is made up of

five   markets:

       —   Input      markets:

              - Labor

              —   Capital
              — Energy

       - The market for goods

       -
           Money market

The money market and themarket for energy clear in each period; the three

other markets may or may not clear, depending on rigidities.

       The rigidities are of three kinds. First, for the goods market, a

standard unit cost pricing rule is assumed rather than marginal cost pricing

in the short run. Secondly, only a fraction of the capital stock can be

adjusted in the short run; and the adjustable part is assumed an imperfect

substitute to the unadjustable part. Thirdly, wages are downward rigid.

       The dynamic part of the model is made up by capital accumulation and

permanent—income consumption on the one hand and by rational expectations

price dynamics on the other. The latter is derived from the assumed
                                                                        equality
of the real return to capital and the real interest rate.

        Factor demand under cost minimization is determined by Shephard's lemma:


                                   i=L,K,E

The supply of energy is assumed to be infinitely elastic at the exogenously

given   price. Rigidities in the investment process are modeled in the
following way. There are m categories of capital; the quantity of category i
is determined j — 1 years in advance. The various categories                     enter

symmetrically in the technology model but are imperfect substitutes, or else

all investment would be concentrated in the category with the shortest lead

time. A simple Cobb—Douglas form is chosen for the capital submodel

In                                              quantities of the m —   1 last categories are
predetermined; by symmetry, they all have the level i, whereas the first
category has the level R1. The year after, m — 2 categories have the level
K2 and two have K2, etc. Defining bt as the fraction of categories having
their level determined by post-shock conditions ("f1exible capital), (A.3)

The quantity of flexible capital is determined by the demand equation


             Kt =
                           Kt"Kt                   K(e           REt' Ktt             (A.6)


where Vt is output.

        Since the quantity Kt ("rigid" capital) is predetermined, its price is

determined by the equation


                   =
                       (PKt1Kt)K(e1t                            "Et' Ktt              (A.7)


        Investment in rigid capital is derived simply from capital accumulation:

                   =
                       t   —
                                       — t-i                ( = 0.1)                  (A.8)


The average amount of flexible capital in the absence of any investment is

        Wage rigidity is modeled analogously except that here it is price,

not quantity, that is predetermined. A similar subfunction is postulated,

             L =
                    L111       .   .       .    Li/n        (n = 6)                   (A.li)


Wages are thought of as determined by contracts. All contracts last n years,

and contracts are renegotiated by one category each year. Wages are

negotiated so as to clear the market in expectation. The market-clearing

wage renegotiated after the shock is denoted , and full employment is
                                                -39-




given as the exogenously given natural level of employment 1

        Contracts negotiated before the shock set a starting wage level of

to be paid in the absence of unanticipated inflation. If unanticipated

inflation occurs, a cost of living adjustment is made of the form


                = (1 +             r =   0.51                              (A.12)

   is the expected price level, specified as the base case forecast. Thus,

defining      as the fraction of categories with wages renegotiated after the

shock, the average wage per worker is

                          *1-ft1


        The efficiency wage over the cycle differs from w because of cyclical

fluctuations in labor productivity. This component of productivity is

approximated by the following formulation. Consider the market for a

category of labor whose contract has not been renegotiated. Disequilibrium

in this market can be measured by the relative difference between the

actual nd the market-clearing wage, i.e., by the ratio


            w/w
The tightness in the labor market as a whole depends also on how many

categories have had their wages renegotiated. The following measure is

proposed:




1This formula and (A.ll) should riot be thought of as strictly technological
 relationships, but rather as a convenient way of modeling wage rigidity.
                                               -40-.




 Thus, the average wage rate per efficiency unit is defined as

                      U          h(l_f)
           w =      w(w/)                 ,   h =   0.8                       (A..14)


 This is the wage rate that enters in the factor demand equations, whereas

w is used in the price equation (cf. below).

      This gives the following demand functions for labor.

                =
                                                    REt' Ktt                  (A.15)

                = e
                          1t(w/w)L(e_U1t            REt' Ktt                  (A.l6)

and total employment is

                           + (1 —
          Lt =
                    ftLt                                                      (A.17)

Clearly, when         <   1,   the labor market will clear only if    w   =




The Goods Market

     The demand for goods consists of consumption, investment, net exports

of goods, and government expenditures. The latter two are considered

exogenous, and investment demand is discussed above. Consumption follows

the permanent income hypothesis. This is modeled as



             =      gt
where g = 0.029 is the sum of the rate of growth of the labor force and the

rate of labor productivity growth.
                                              C0 is determined endogenously as
described below.

     Goods are produced by capital ,          labor,   and energy subject to the produc-

tion possibility constraint (A.l). After a shock occurs, some categories

of capital have predetermined levels so that the firms' marginal cost
                                                     -41 -




schedule is upward sloping in the short run. Rather than treating this as

the supply schedule for goods, however, the model specifies a standard unit

cost pricing rule and assumes that firms passively supply any amount of

goods demanded at that. price. The pricing rule takes the form of the price

equation

            (1 -   T)P =   (e1tw0,             E'' T               = 0.065                       (A.18)

where v is a long—run average of the real rental price of capital                                ,    P   is the

price of goods, and r a tax parameter accounting for indirect taxes.                                          is

the same function as in (A.1), but its first and third arguments are w° and

P rather than w and                  Since          is a market-clearing price for a

(partially) fixed factor, It fluctuates procyclically whereas PV does not.

Thus, there is no demand effect in the price equation.



The Market for Money

     The financial sector of the economy is compressed into one equation of

our model, namely the money demand equation. Its form is

            tn(PY/M) =             + 11r   +
                                               2t       ,          = 2.0,     =    0.019         (A.19)


Money supply, M, is thought of as supplied exogenously by the monetary

authority and, in the absence of specific policy actions, to grow at a

constant exponential rate. Money and capital are considered perfect

substitutes so that arbitrage gives


            r =    v./(l   —
                               dt)
                                     -      -e      +       n((l   —
                                                                       dt+1)P÷i)
                   —   n((l    -
                                   dt)Pt)      ,
                                                   dt
                                                            =   0.036 (all t);        =   0.13       (A.20)

Here v. =
            Kt't       is the real rental price of capital ,
                                                                                 dt   is the investment

tax credit, and o is the rate of tax on capital as a fraction of its value.

Dynamic Solution of the Model
     The solution algorithm assumes initial guesses for the initial levels of
consumption and price level and for the long run average of the real cost of
capital V. The initial level of V is given historically. The model can then
be solved period by period, and (M.l), (M.2), (M.l4) and (NL18) give the
dynamic links between periods.

     Since it turns out that the roots of this system are unstable, the

solution based on initial guesses will give a finite path of price level and

capital stock only by chance. The model therefore searches over several

values of initial price and consumption levels until it finds a pair that

gives a finite solution. This process limits the initial price level to a

very tight interval and determines the permanent income level of consumption.

A final set of iterations makes the value of V consistent with the steady—

state value of v.
