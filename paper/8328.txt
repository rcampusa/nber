1 Introduction
Better-educated people are healthier. This is one of the most robust empirical findings in health.

Farrell and Fuchs (1982) argue that this relationship is ‚Äúone of the strongest generalizations to

emerge from empirical research on health in the United States.‚Äù Socioeconomic status in general

has been shown to affect mortality and morbidity in a number of studies (Marmot, 2000; Smith,

1999). In particular, the association between education and health is pervasive and quantitatively

large (Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973; Haan et al, 1987; Feldman et al, 1989; Preston and Taubman,

1994; Pappas, 1993; Schoenbaum and Waidmann, 1997).


Grossman (1972) was among the first to present an explicit theoretical model linking schooling

and health.1 In an earlier paper, Welch (1970) analyzed the more general relationship between

education and productive efficiency. The theoretical research has been accompanied by a

tremendous amount of empirical evidence substantiating the correlation between schooling and

health. Socioeconomic status in general has been shown to affect mortality and morbidity in a

number of studies (Marmot, 2000; Smith, 1999). In particular, the association between

education and health is pervasive and quantitatively large (Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973; Haan et

al, 1987; Feldman et al, 1989; Preston and Taubman, 1994; Pappas, 1993; Schoenbaum and

Waidmann, 1997).


However, there has been considerable debate about the source of the relationship. The

traditional arguments‚Äîthat the less well-to-do have access to less or lower quality medical care




1
 For an earlier discussion of the similarities and differences between education investments and health investments,
see Mushkin (1962). Muurinen (1982) provides a later, more general formulation of Grossman‚Äôs model.

                                                          1
or a stronger pattern of deleterious personal behaviors such as smoking and excess drinking‚Äî

have been rejected as incomplete.2 For his part, Grossman argues that more educated people are

better producers of health. Fuchs (1982), however, responds that the link is not causal, but that

unobserved characteristics such as higher ability or lower discount rates make people more

disposed towards investments in human capital of all types, be they health investments or

education investments. Kenkel‚Äôs (1991) empirical analysis sheds some light on this debate with

its finding that part, but not the majority, of the relationship between schooling and health is

explained by real differences in health knowledge. Other researchers have used instrumental

variables methods to argue for a causal link between schooling and health.3 Perhaps not

surprisingly, Fuchs (1996) has remained unconvinced by these responses.


Despite this contentious body of work, virtually no research has investigated how health

disparities across education groups vary with market forces, across time, and across different

groups in the population. There are at least three important reasons to study how health

disparities vary across education groups, given a fixed distribution of education. First, as a

practical matter, public policies of various types often aim to limit these disparities by means

other than wholesale changes in the distribution of education. Medicare and Medicaid, two of




2
  Recently, some intriguing theories have arisen that emphasize long-term impacts of early childhood or
even intrauterine environmental factors (Barker, 1993; Wadsworth and Kuh, 1997), the cumulative effects
of prolonged exposures to individual stressful events (Seeman et al., 1997), or reactions to macro-societal
factors such as rising levels of income inequality (Wilkenson, 1996; Deaton and Paxson, 1999).
3
 Berger and Leigh (1989) use a two-stage selection model to demonstrate this. Arkes (2000) uses state-level
variation in unemployment rates as an instrument for schooling, to show that schooling has a causal effect on health.
Lleras-Muney (2000) uses compulsory schooling laws as an instrument for schooling attainment, to show that
schooling lowers mortality.

                                                          2
the largest public investments in health, have this as an explicit goal. However it is not possible

to limit disparities through policymaking unless their economic determinants are well

understood. Second, the perennial uncertainty about the true channel of causation from

schooling to health makes it important to investigate how health disparities change, given fixed

disparities in education. It is hard to be sure about how changes in education will affect health

disparities, because it has proven to be very difficult to identify the true nature of the causality

from schooling to health. A different approach would be to understand how health disparities

respond to economic variables when the distribution of education‚Äîand thus the various factors

that influence education‚Äîremains fixed. Third, an analysis of how changes in education affect

health disparities may not yield practical implications. Education is determined by many factors

other than health; it seems difficult to defend wholesale changes in the education distribution on

the basis of health alone.


It is also natural to ask: why study health disparities across education groups? A long and

distinguished literature has examined wage disparities across education groups (e.g., Katz and

Murphy, 1992; Murphy and Welch, 1989), in part because education is one of the best (if not the

single best) observable correlates of permanent income. If one cares about disparities in lifetime

utility, a natural way to proceed is to examine disparities across education (and thus permanent

income) groups.

To be precise, we investigate theoretically and empirically the determinants of health disparities

across education groups. We will develop a theoretical model and derive three important sets of

testable implications: (1) Reductions in the price of health care expand health disparities across

education groups; (2) Groups in the population that benefit more from health investment will

                                                   3
exhibit greater disparities; (3) More educated patients will devote relatively more resources to

managing their own health, rather than having it managed. One of the most important and

attractive features of the model is that its implications do not depend on the specific causal link

between schooling and health. The only requirement is that schooling is correlated with a set of

characteristics that make people more efficient producers of health.

A simple example helps illustrate the first two implications. Consider a society with two people:

person E is an educated and efficient user of health inputs, but person U is an uneducated and

inefficient user. Under fairly general conditions, E will use more health care than U, because she

is a more efficient user. Accordingly, suppose that E uses 2 units of health care, but U uses only

1. If the price of health care falls by $1 (or the marginal productivity of health care rises by $1)

E receives a windfall gain of $2, but U‚Äôs gain is only $1. E will parlay her disproportionate

monetary advantage into a disproportionate gain in health, because on the margin, she spends a

larger fraction of her income on health.4 This example also illustrates why our results do not

depend on the specific causal link between schooling and health. It is driven entirely by the fact

that better-educated people are better at producing health and will thus invest more in it. It does

not matter whether schooling itself makes them better producers, or whether they are better

because they are more forward-looking, more able, or because of some other factor.

These two implications help us unravel how new technologies or shocks to health can affect

health disparities in different and unexpected ways. First, technological innovation always




4
 On the margin, health care is equally productive for E and U in equilibrium. Therefore, additional
health care consumption will not benefit one person more than the other, to a first-order approximation.

                                                    4
lowers the price of health care. This leads to the surprising result that many technological

changes can actually expand health disparities. However, we will also consider an important

exception to this rule. Certain innovations change the nature of health production by making

time inputs much less productive. When the productivity of time investments falls, this

especially hurts the educated patients, since they are the heaviest investors of time. As a result,

new health care technologies that supplant time investments can in fact contract disparities. For

example, the typhoid vaccine made it much easier to prevent typhoid, without spending a great

deal of time boiling water, washing fresh vegetables, maintaining a high level of hygiene, and so

on. By making those time investments much less productive, the advent of the vaccine made it

relatively cheaper for the uneducated to prevent typhoid and thus may have contracted health

disparities due to typhoid death. In some cases, this countervailing effect of ‚Äútimesaving

innovations‚Äù can be large enough to offset the effect of the price reduction.

Similarly, health shocks have different effects on disparities, depending on their nature. An

individual who contracts a chronic but treatable disease may suddenly find that health

investments are more productive for him. Such a health shock would expand health disparities.

Therefore, we expect that people with chronic but treatable conditions would exhibit greater

disparities. On the other hand, the advent of a highly untreatable, fatal disease might in fact

lower the productivity of health investments. Among people suffering from such conditions,

therefore, we might expect fewer disparities in health.

The effects of price and productivity also have important policy implications. Universal health

insurance or other blanket price subsidies for health care can actually exacerbate health

inequality, as can subsidies for medical research. On the other hand, the prevention of treatable

                                                  5
conditions will not only improve average health but may also reduce health inequality.

Therefore, from the point of view of inequality alone, it is at least as important to prevent

treatable disease as untreatable disease.

Our empirical analysis will test our implications for technological change and health shocks.

First, we will examine the impact of technological change on health disparities using examples

of both ‚Äútimesaving‚Äù innovations and different innovations that are unlikely to have supplanted

time investments. Prior to the advent of antihypertensive drugs, the control of hypertension

involved substantial investments of time and know-how by patients. Therefore, since these

drugs supplanted time investments, they could have substantially limited health disparities. We

use data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) to show that in fact the emergence of these

drugs dramatically reduced disparities in hypertension and hypertensive heart disease over a

period of just a few years. The development of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART)

for HIV represents a very different example. While the new drugs improve immune function,

they also required patients to comply with complicated treatment regimens. They did not

supplant time investments and may have even made them more important. Using data from the

HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study (HCSUS), we show that HAART substantially

expanded the gap in health status across education groups within a few years‚Äô time.


We will also examine the impact of treatable and untreatable health conditions. We use the

National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to show that health disparities are larger for those with

treatable chronic illnesses to health disparities in the rest of the population. To investigate the

impact of untreatable disease, we use the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) to show



                                                  6
that disparities are lower among elderly people in their last year of life than among similarly

aged people who are not about to die.



2 Schooling and the Determination of Health
It seems reasonable to assume that schooling and its determinants have no effect on the quality of

care delivered by a given physician, surgeon, or hospital. That is, a patient‚Äôs schooling will not

help him when he is on the operating table, but it might help him to choose a better doctor or

hospital before he enters the operating room. Alternatively, since schooling and its determinants

might affect the patient‚Äôs adherence to a treatment regimen, they might also affect the therapy

offered by the physician. However, holding all these patient investments constant, they may not

have any effect on care. This leads us to distinguish between investments of the patient‚Äôs own

time in her health, and investments in medical goods or services. The first type requires the

patient to manage her own care in some way. Examples would be diet, exercise, complex

medication regimens, or choosing a health care provider. It is important to recognize that

shopping for medical goods or complying with treatment are also investments of the patient‚Äôs

own time. The second type of investment requires no patient management, and is delivered

entirely by a physician or other health care provider. Examples would be surgical procedures or

physician office visits. An increase in the individual‚Äôs schooling (or health knowledge) makes

own-time investments more productive, but does not affect the productivity of investments in

medical goods. Put differently, since our concept of medical care investment holds all patient

investments fixed, it reflects a quality-adjusted measure of medical inputs applied to a

‚Äústandardized‚Äù patient.




                                                 7
To understand the distinction more concretely, consider the example of cardiac bypass surgery.

We do not view the surgery as consisting entirely of medical care inputs. On the contrary, it

involves substantial investments of individual time. For example, the individual spends time

choosing a surgeon, a cardiologist, a hospital, as well as rehabilitating from the surgery. To be

sure, the patient‚Äôs skill at performing any of these tasks may influence the doctor‚Äôs treatment (for

example, the two types of inputs may be complementary), but controlling for all patient inputs, a

given doctor should experience equal rates of success, regardless of how well educated her

patients are.


A fair amount of evidence argues for the importance of own-time investments in the production

of health. Fuchs (1974) has argued that differences in mortality outcomes bear very little relation

to spending on medical inputs. For example, he notes that Utah and Nevada, which have very

similar allocations of doctors and hospitals, have vastly different mortality rates. Life

expectancy in Utah is almost ten years more, largely because Utah‚Äôs residents smoke less, drink

less, and engage in healthier lifestyles. On the other hand, the RAND Health Insurance

Experiment found that increasing medical expenditures, all other things equal, did not improve

health outcomes (Newhouse 1993). While medical expenditures seem not to matter much, there

is a plethora of evidence that health and mortality are strongly related to education and wealth

(Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973; Haan et al., 1987; Feldman et al., 1989; Preston and Taubman,

1994; Pappas, 1993; Schoenbaum and Waidmann, 1997). These points taken together suggest

that the inputs under an individual‚Äôs control are more important than medical goods.




                                                  8
2.1 A Model of Patient-Intensive Therapies

We denote the two types of health investments as t for own-time investments, and M for

medical goods. These investments are complementary, because higher levels of patient

investments are assumed to make physicians more productive. The productivity of own-time

investments rises with schooling, S . More generally, we allow for the possibility that

productivity depends on a third factor, a , that also determines schooling; this could represent

ability, rate of time preference, or similar unobserved factors.


Formally, health is produced according to the technology F (t , M ; a ) . To emphasize the effect of

health knowledge on relative productivities, we assume that ability raises the output elasticity of

      Ft t                                   F M
t,         , but leaves the elasticity of M , M , unaffected.5 Finally, we assume complementarity
      F                                       F

between t and M . Higher levels of patient investment make physicians more productive on the

margin, or FtM > 0 , and in percentage terms, so that own-time investments raise the output

                                  ‚àÇ √¶ FM    √∂      6
elasticity of medical goods:
                                  ‚àÇt √ß√® F   √∑ ‚â• 0 . Total health is equal to initial health plus the health
                                            √∏

that is produced: H 0 + F (t , M ; a) .




                                                  FMa Fa

    The restriction on the elasticity of M implies that=    , or that a unit change in ability raises
                                                   FM    F
                                                                                         F       F
output and the marginal product of M proportionately. The other restriction implies that ta > a , or
                                                                                          Ft     F
that a unit change in ability raises the marginal product of own-time by a greater percentage than output.
6
    This condition would be satisfied, for example, by a Cobb-Douglas health production function.

                                                          9
To simplify, we consider a pure investment model, where health does not enter the utility

function, but time available for labor is a concave, increasing function of total health,

l ( H 0 + F (t , M ; a)) . Schooling depends on ability, according to S (a ) , and the wage rate is

w( S (a )) , which rises in schooling and ability. An individual who faces the medical goods price

œÄ M solves the problem:


                            max t , M [ w( S (a ))]{l ( H 0 + F (t , M ; a)) ‚àí t} ‚àí œÄ M M              (1)


This problem has two first order conditions:


                                                          Ft l ‚Ä≤ = 1
                                                                                                       (2)
                                               w( S (a)) FM l ‚Ä≤ = œÄ M


An increase in ability always raises the equilibrium health, because it raises the marginal revenue

of health by more than the marginal cost.7 However, the key to understanding how health

disparities change over time and across groups is to understand how the demand for health inputs

varies. As our earlier example demonstrated, health disparities will be higher among populations

that demand more health inputs.


Ability will raise input usage, provided that it raises the marginal revenue of input usage by more

than marginal cost. To ensure this marginal revenue condition, it is necessary to assume that a

one percent increase in health investment lowers its marginal revenue by less than one percent:



7
 Suppose that growth in ability pushes up the wage by one percent. To a first-order approximation, the
marginal revenue of health investment, w( S (a ))l '( h) , rises by exactly one percent. In contrast, the
marginal cost of health, w( S (a ))th + œÄ M M h , rises by less than one percent, so long as M > 0 .

Given our previous assumptions about the effects of ability on output elasticities, this condition

is enough to imply that ability raises the marginal revenue of time investments, Ft l ‚Ä≤ , and of

medical care investments, FM l ‚Ä≤ .8


The impacts of changes in other parameters are similar. When the price of medical care M

rises, the individual invests less in both types of inputs. The own-price effect on medical goods

is standard, and reduction in the use of medical goods makes own-time investments less

productive.9 The implications for initial health are essentially the reverse of those for ability:

increases in initial health lower the usage of both inputs, because they make them less

productive.10 Finally, growth in the monetary returns to schooling raises both types of health




8
    A unit change in ability raises FM and health by the same percentage, but raises Ft by a greater
percentage (see footnote 5). Moreover, equation 3 guarantees that l ' falls more slowly than health grows.
These facts taken together imply that ability raises Ft l ' and FM l ' . A formal proof is provided in
Appendix A.

     This follows from comparative statics, as long as equation 3 holds, and l is concave.

inputs. Suppose that w( S (a )) = wS (a ) and that w rises. In this case, the marginal revenue from

health investment of either type rises.11

These results imply that health investments will be higher among groups that: face lower prices

of medical care; face greater shocks to underlying health; or face higher returns to schooling.

There are two empirically important qualifications to these results. New medical care

technologies can lower the price of M and will thus tend to expand health disparities. However,

innovations that are ‚Äútimesaving‚Äù can actually have the opposite result. In particular, suppose a

new technology lowers the output elasticity of t . To return to our earlier example, the advent of

a typhoid vaccine makes it much less productive for people to spend time boiling water, cleaning

fresh vegetables, and the like. As a result, people may invest less time than they did previously.

The second qualification concerns health shocks. Certain kinds of health shocks‚Äîsuch as

untreatable, terminal conditions‚Äîcan actually lower the productivity of both types of inputs.

People hit with these kinds of shocks may thus invest less in their health than healthy people.

     Denoting the Hessian of the objective function as Det , comparative statics implies that:

2.2 Implications for Health Disparities

To show how these comparative static results translate into implications for health disparities, let

us return to the example we presented earlier: E is an educated patient, and U is an uneducated

one. We have just shown that E consumes more of both types of health inputs than U. To take

an example, suppose that E consumes 2 units of each input, while U consumes 1 of each. Now

suppose that the net marginal revenue product of one health input rises. Both agents receive a

windfall gain from this increase in productivity. Moreover, since we showed previously that

gains in net marginal productivity raise input usage, both agents will use at least part of their

gains to finance additional health investment. However, since E uses more of each input, he

receives a larger windfall gain. In addition, since better-educated people use more health inputs

ceteris paribus, E spends a larger fraction of his income on health inputs at the margin.

Therefore, E will choose to invest a larger fraction of his larger gain on health. Since E will

spend more additional resources on health than U, his health will rise by more.


This is a heuristic description of the key result that health disparities rise with the net marginal

productivity of health investments. Health disparities will be larger for: (1) Those who face

lower medical care prices œÄ M ; (2) Those who enjoy higher marginal products of time, Ft , or

medical care, FM ; and (3) Those who face higher monetary returns to schooling. It is important

to note that when we refer to health disparities, we are focusing on absolute differences in health,

rather than percentage differences in health, because the former are more relevant for making

welfare comparisons. Some of our results for absolute differences do carry over for percentage

differences, although this tends to depend on the form of the production function.


                                                  13
To derive these implications formally, we impose a few simplifications. In particular, suppose

that l ( H 0 + F (t , M ; a, H 0 )) = {H 0 + t Œ± ( a ) M Œ≤ } , where Œ¥ < 1 , and Œ± + Œ≤ ‚â§ 1 . The previous
                                                   Œ¥




assumptions we made about the output elasticities imply that Œ± a > 0 . This Cobb-Douglas type

production function embeds all the restrictions we imposed in the previous section. In Appendix

A, we show formally how our results follow from this model.


2.2.1 Testable Implications

Our results have important implications for technological change in medical care. The effects of

technological change depend on whether or not an innovation is ‚Äútimesaving.‚Äù Any innovation

that is not timesaving‚Äîi.e., does not lower the marginal product of time investments‚Äîwill

always expand health disparities by lowering the price of medical care. On the other hand, an

innovation that is timesaving can contract health disparities, because the reduction in the

productivity of time investments hurts the educated more than the less educated. In particular,

we define a timesaving innovation as one that makes medical care cheaper (and possibly raises

the output elasticity of medical care), but lowers the complementarity between medical care and

time investments. This would have the effect of lowering the marginal productivity (and output

elasticity) of time investments. Formally, Ft (t , M ; a) would fall for every input combination if

FtM fell. Assuming that the technological change shifts out the production possibilities frontier,

Ft
   would also fall for all input combinations.
F


Similarly, the effects of health shocks on disparities depend on the precise nature of the shock.

Consider first a chronic, treatable illness. This would have the effect of lowering initial health

                                                       14
and making health investments more beneficial. As a result, chronic illness would tend to raise

health disparities. At the other extreme, consider an acute, untreatable illness. A health shock

like that would make health investments less productive and would tend to contract health

disparities. This seems relevant at older ages, where individuals are hit with health shocks that

may often result in death. As a result, health disparities may contract with age among very old

populations.


Finally, the model yields implications for treatment choices. Even though their time is more

valuable, more educated patients are predicted to invest more in time-intensive treatments.

Among the chronically ill, for example, we would expect more educated patients to spend more

time monitoring their health, adhering to their physician‚Äôs orders, controlling their diet, and

exercising.


2.2.2 Normative Implications

Health care policy is informed by a variety of motives other than inequality, but the behavior of

policymakers does suggest that the desire to limit inequality is a powerful one. For example,

major public health programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare, are explicitly designed to

guarantee health care for those who might otherwise not be able to afford it. In the interests of

informing policy, therefore, it is crucial to understand the real effects of economic variables and

health care policy on inequality. The model presented above provides some useful guidance for

limiting inequality.


Our results for the impact of wage and price changes have normative implications. First, the

usual concern over wage inequality should be magnified somewhat, since wage inequality also

                                                 15
leads to health disparities. More surprising is our implication for the effect of medical care price

reductions. Some have argued that high medical care prices promote an unfair distribution of

resources by impeding access to care for the poor.12 Our results imply exactly the opposite

conclusion. Reductions in the price of medical care actually raise inequality along educational

(and thus permanent income) lines. Government policies that seek to lower the overall price of

health care‚Äîsuch as universal health care coverage‚Äîare likely to be particularly blunt

instruments for improving the health of the poor. A better approach to limiting disparities would

emphasize subsidies that are targeted towards the poor. This would argue in favor of US-style

Medicaid programs, rather than European or Canadian-style National Health Systems. Another

approach might emphasize investments in pre-natal and early childhood health. The latter kinds

of investments could help limit lifetime health disparities by limiting chronic, treatable disease.


Clearly, government policy should not be targeted solely at limiting disparities; it should also

focus on improving the absolute health of the population. However, policymakers are likely to

prefer actions that both improve absolute health and reduce inequality. Investments that improve

underlying health and prevent chronic illness can help accomplish both goals much more

effectively than price subsidies or federally funded medical research. Public health

investments‚Äîin sanitation, or pollution prevention‚Äîrepresent particularly compelling examples

of policies that can improve average health and promote a fairer distribution of health.




12
  In ‚ÄúA National Health Program for the United States: A Physicians‚Äô Proposal,‚Äù Himmelstein et al
(1989) argue that ‚Äúfinancial barriers to care‚Äù represent a serious injustice of the present health care
system.

                                                     16
The model also provides some justification for targeting health care subsidies towards the aged,

because they tend to be sicker. The actual effect of Medicare in the US, however, is somewhat

more complicated, because it is unclear whether or not it targets subsidies towards the poor

elderly. Everyone over the age of 65 receives Part A Medicare coverage, and nearly everyone

over the age of 65 in the US is enrolled in Part B.13 Since Medicare is not means-tested, the

entire population over 65 faces uniform prices for medically intensive inputs. At first glance, it

would appear that Medicare lowers prices and raises inequality among the elderly, but this

ignores important policies that affect the below 65 population. The federal government

subsidizes the purchase of employer-based health insurance. It tends to be the richer and well-

educated segment of the population that benefits from these tax incentives. In other words, œÄ M is

lower for the better educated among the population under the age of 65. Therefore, Medicare has

two opposing effects on health disparities. First, it lowers the price of medical care for everyone

over the age of 65. This raises disparities. Second, however, it equalizes the price of medical

care across educational groups. This benefits the less educated and lowers disparities.14 The

overall effect of Medicare is theoretically ambiguous and is thus a subject we later propose for

empirical study.




13
  In 2000, for example, 96% of the eligible population over age 65 enrolled in Part B. (House Committee
on Ways and Means, Green Book 2000.)
14
  It is worth pointing out that these results hold true, even though more educated people over age 65 may
receive supplementary Medigap insurance from their (current or previous) employers on a tax-free basis.
Since Medigap covers a much smaller portion of total health care costs than health insurance for the
young, the subsidy received by more educated workers is much smaller over age 65 than under it.
Therefore, even though health care prices may not be perfectly uniform over age 65, the disparity may be
substantially reduced.

                                                   17
3 Empirical Analysis
The theoretical model clarified the key econometric issues with our analysis. In the model,

schooling is endogenous, but we derived implications for how disparities across education

groups change with technology and health shocks, conditional on a fixed relationship between

schooling and ability, S (a ) . Therefore, we do not need to know how changes in the distribution

of schooling affect disparities in health. This simplifies our econometric problem somewhat. To

estimate the true effect of schooling changes on health disparities, it would be necessary to

ensure that S (a ) = S , or that all variation in schooling is exogenous. This would require a

traditional instrumental variables approach. However, to estimate the effects of technological

change or health shocks on health disparities, given a fixed distribution of schooling and ability,

it is necessary only to ensure that S (a ) is stable across the relevant comparison groups.

Intuitively, suppose we find that a new technology does increase health disparities among a

particular population. This is consistent with our predictions only if we can show that the result

is not driven by a concurrent expansion in the ability-schooling relationship S (a ) among the

chronically ill. This weaker condition is definitely satisfied if we have a valid instrument for

schooling, but it can also be satisfied without one. In the empirical work that follows we suggest

various approaches, including the traditional instrumental variables approach, to solve this

identification problem. At the end of each subsection, we explain how this condition for

identification will be met for each specific piece of analysis.


3.1 Technological Change and Health Disparities

Technological change can have different effects on health disparities, depending on the nature of

the innovation. An innovation that is not timesaving‚Äîin that it does not lower the marginal
                                               18
productivity of time investments‚Äîwill always raise health disparities. However, by simplifying

health care, or lowering the relative productivity of patient time, certain new technologies could

contract health disparities. We propose to examine the impact of each type of technology.

Antihypertensive drugs, perhaps the single biggest medical breakthrough of the past fifty years,

greatly simplified the treatment of hypertension. Instead of exercising, watching their diet, and

controlling their weight, hypertensive patients were able to take two pills in the morning to

control their blood pressure. On the other hand, new HIV treatments have greatly improved

immune function among HIV patients, but have not simplified its treatment. The theory predicts

that the breakthroughs in hypertension would have limited health disparities in hypertension and

related ailments, while the breakthroughs in HIV may have had the opposite effect on HIV

patients.


3.1.1 Breakthroughs in Hypertension Treatment: Beta Blockers

Perhaps the most important set of innovations in medical care over the past fifty years occurred

in the treatment of heart disease. In 1960, roughly two-thirds of deaths were attributed to heart-

related conditions, while by 1986 this had fallen to one-third.15 In particular, since 1970 there

has been a substantial decline in mortality from conditions that are directly linked to

hypertension. From 1970 to 1994, mortality from stroke fell by at least 50% across sex and race

lines, while mortality for coronary heart disease fell by roughly the same amount (Joint National

Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, 1997).

Followback Survey (NMFS).

                                                 19
While the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension actually rose from 1960 to 1971, it has

declined steadily ever since then. During the 1960s, prevalence rose from 30% to 36%, but by

1988, it had declined to 20% (Burt et al., 1995). Much of the decline that began in 1972 was

probably the result of new antihypertensive drugs. In 1965, a new drug called propranolol, a

member of the class of drugs now called beta-blockers, was introduced in Europe. However, in

the US, the FDA was slow to approve this drug. While propranolol was approved for a few

minor uses in 1968, it was approved for the treatment of angina only in 1973, and for

hypertension in 1976 (Ruwart, 2002). At roughly the same time, in 1967 and 1970, there

emerged evidence from two clinical trials that diuretics and vasodilators could also treat high

blood pressure effectively (Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group on

Antihypertensive Agents, 1967, 1970). Not coincidentally, mortality from heart disease began to

fall from 1973 onwards and continued to fall until the early ‚Äò90s, when mortality rates reached a

plateau at about 50% below their initial level (Joint National Committee on Prevention,

Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, 1997). In terms of mortality

reduction, it is possible that these rank as the most significant medical breakthroughs of the past

50 years. We propose to study their effects on health disparities.


The introduction of new drugs for the treatment of hypertension supplanted the former treatment

of diet, exercise, and weight control (occasionally supplemented by the use of diuretics). The

previous treatment regimen placed significant emphasis on the patient‚Äôs ability to spend time

monitoring subtle variations in her health. The advent of the new drugs, however, made these

time investments much less important in determining the effectiveness of treatment. As a result,

complementarity between time and treatment likely fell, as did the productivity of time

                                                 20
investments. This would suggest that these breakthrough drugs would have contracted

disparities in the severity of hypertension. Previously, the educated would have been better able

to control their blood pressure, but the decreased productivity of time investments would have

lessened their advantage.


To analyze the effect of antihypertensive drugs, we will use the Framingham Heart Study (FHS).

The FHS tracked the health of a cohort of 5209 white men and women, aged 28 to 59 in 1948,

and who resided in the town of Framingham, Massachusetts.16 From 1948 onwards, this cohort

received biennial medical exams, which also included interviews about health history and

behavior. We will use data from the ninth exam, conducted in 1966, through the seventeenth

exam, conducted in 1982. We have chosen only exams that post-date the enactment of

Medicare, in order to net out the effects of Medicare on health disparities. We break up this

period into two segments: 1966-72, the pre-beta blocker period; and 1976-82, the post-beta

blocker period. In 1976, beta-blockers were finally approved for the treatment of hypertension

specifically. We will examine health disparities during the 1966-72 period for the 2005

respondents who are aged 58 through 75 in 1966. These will be compared to disparities during

the 1976-82 period for the 1983 respondents who are aged 58 through 75 in 1976. This

represents the widest age interval present during both time periods. Moreover, the age

distribution for respondents in the pre-period cohort is essentially identical to the distribution for

the post-period cohort.




16
  Since the FHS is a local study, it is unable to track migrants from Framingham. However, we study 58
to 75 year-olds, for whom migration is a much less important possibility.

                                                  21
At baseline, all individuals reported their age and educational attainment, which was broken

down into six groups: less than 8th grade, some high school attended, high school graduate, some

college attended, college graduate, and those who attended graduate school, nursing school, art

school, music school, or business school. Since they seem to behave similarly empirically, we

group college graduates with those who attended some college. The last educational group is

extremely heterogeneous, and should not necessarily be interpreted as a group of postgraduates:

over this time period in the US, nursing school or art school, for example, was sometimes

conducted at an early college or high school level. Indeed, this group does not seem healthier

than those who simply graduated from college.

The FHS does not ask a question about general health status, but there are several objective

measures of health that can be correlated with education: whether an individual has high blood

pressure, hypertensive cardiovascular disease (HCVD)--defined as the presence of high blood

pressure and an enlarged heart--or heart disease. Each biennial exam contains three blood

pressure readings. We define an individual as having high blood pressure if all of his systolic

readings exceed 160 mm/Hg, or if all of his diastolic readings exceed 95 mm/Hg. This

corresponds to the World Health Organization definition of high blood pressure as a systolic

pressure exceeding 160 or a diastolic pressure exceeding 95. (An alternative definition we will

explore is if all systolic readings exceed 140 mm/Hg, or all diastolic readings exceed 90 mm/Hg.

This has been proposed as a better measure of hypertension.) HCVD is diagnosed by the

examining physician, based on blood pressure readings, X-Rays of the heart, and Electro-

Cardiograms (ECG). While this is no longer a commonly used diagnosis category, HCVD is a

subset of congestive heart failure, which is a commonly used diagnosis today. Heart disease is

also diagnosed by the examining physician, who identifies the individual as being in one of six
                                             22
functional classes: no definite heart disease, class 1, class 2, class 3, class 4, or class 5. We

define an individual without heart disease as one diagnosed with ‚Äúno definite heart disease.‚Äù


Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the pre-period and post-period cohorts. By design, the

age and sex composition of the pre- and post-cohorts is quite similar. Observe, however, the

dramatic decline in hypertension and hypertensive cardiovascular disease. Much of this decline

has been attributed to the emergence of beta-blockers and other antihypertensives (Joint National

Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, 1997).

There was not a coincident reduction in heart failure. While uncontrolled hypertension is a risk

factor for heart failure, it is possible that the prevalence of heart failure rose, because more heart

patients survived to the point where they would experience heart failure. It is also important to

understand changes in the educational distribution between the two cohorts. To identify the

effect of technology, we must rule out changes in the ability-schooling relationship as an

alternate cause. The post-period cohort shows a substantial increase in high school attendance

and graduation‚Äîthere is a shift in the distribution out of ‚Äúno high school‚Äù and into the some high

school and high school graduate groups. Presumably, therefore, the average ability of the ‚Äúno

high school‚Äù group would have fallen. However, the proportion of people with post-high school

education barely moved. If anything, therefore, the ability gap between the no high school and

post-high school groups would have grown. This would bias us against finding that technology

contracted health disparities across education groups.


Using these measures of health, along with dummy variables for education groups and age

categories, we will estimate the following regression for the pre- and post-antihypertensive

periods:
                                                  23
                                 Healthit = Œ≤ 0 + Œ≤1Edi + Œ≤ 2 Ageit + Œµ it                           (4)


These regressions will allow us to investigate whether health disparities changed after the

introduction of antihypertensive drugs. If beta-blockers were indeed timesaving, one would

expect a lessening of health disparities in the severity of hypertension.


The results of the regression are shown in Table 2. In the post-period, there is no statistically

significant gradient in hypertension, while in the pre-period, college attendees were ten

percentage points less likely to be diagnosed with it. The mean prevalence of hypertension fell

by about eight percentage points, according to Table 1, and so did disparities across education

groups. The same can be seen by hypertensive heart disease, although the effects are less

dramatic. The gradient is about half the size in the post-period. The effects were robust to the

inclusion of age category variables, rather than the age and age-squared specification reported in

the table. Finally, notice that the gradient in heart failure did not change, just as its prevalence

did not go down. This could be because hypertensive treatments did not have such immediate

effects on the prevalence of heart failure, as shown in Table 1. This finding is also significant,

because it shows that there was not a generic decline in health disparities from one period to the

next. This provides further evidence against the argument that a contraction in the schooling-

ability relationship explains our results. It is also worth noting that there is relatively little

evidence in the labor economics literature to support the contention that the ability-schooling

relationship has changed across cohorts (see, e.g., Katz and Murphy, 1992). In particular,

changes in the wage premium seem to occur within cohorts rather than between cohorts.




                                                    24
An important issue to consider is the generalizability of the FHS results, since after all they are

based on a cohort of whites in the single town of Framingham, MA. Without question, the town

of Framingham is wealthier than average. Data from the 1990 Census Summary Tape File, for

example, show that median household income was about 43 percent above the national average.

The poverty rate in Framingham was 6%, compared to the national average of 13%. Only 5% of

residents in Framingham were receiving public assistance, compared with 7.5% of Americans

nationwide. The fact that the Framingham population is richer and healthier does not alter our

predictions for how technology will affect health disparities, but it does affect how quickly

technology will have an effect. It is likely that the very rapid response of the Framingham

population to the introduction of new drugs is unique to a highly educated and healthy

population.


To investigate this hypothesis, we exactly repeated our calculations using the National Health

and Nutrition Examination Surveys, Waves 1, 2, and 3. Wave 1 took place from 1971 to 1975,

wave 2 from 1976 to 1980, and wave 3 from 1988 to 1993. We examined the education gradient

in physician-assessed hypertension for white 58-75 year-olds in each wave of the NHANES,

using the same regression specification used for the FHS. We found that education gradients in

waves one and two were significant and essentially identical. However, we found virtually no

education gradient in wave three. This suggests that it may have taken up to ten years longer for

the new treatment technology to diffuse out to the overall population, although in the end, it had

the same effect on health disparities.

3.1.2 Breakthroughs in HIV Treatment: Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy

The treatment of HIV presents a useful example of technological change that did not reduce the

complementarity between time and medical care; indeed, it may have even increased it. During

the mid-1990s, Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatments (HAART) became available for the

treatment of HIV. These treatments substantially improved the health statusof HIV patients, but

they often involved highly complex medication regimens that required substantial patient

adherence (Goldman and Smith, 2002). As a result, the new therapy was highly complementary

with patient investments, and made it substantially cheaper to survive HIV. This makes it a

perfect candidate for our purposes. Moreover, since it was introduced very rapidly during the

mid-1990s, it is possible to identify periods with relatively low and relatively high exposure to

HAART.

The data on the HIV positive population come from the HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study

(HCSUS). HCSUS employs a multi-stage national probability sample design, described in detail

elsewhere (Frankel et al 1999). The HCSUS sample is representative of the 18 and older HIV

positive population, which made at least one visit for regular care in the contiguous United States

in early 1996.17 Women and patients of private, staff-model HMOs are over-sampled. HCSUS is

a panel data set with three rounds of interviews. The first round of 2864 interviews was

conducted between January 1996 and April 1997, the period during which HAART were first

coming into broad use. The second round of 2466 interviews was conducted between December

1996 and July 1997, and the last round of 2267 interviews was between August 1997 and



17
  The HCSUS sample does not include patients whose only contact with the health care system was through
military, prison, or emergency department facilities.

                                                      26
January 1998. The first wave covers the period prior to the introduction of HAART, and the

latter the period post-introduction.

In addition to other covariates, HCSUS collects data on educational attainment, health insurance

status (Medicare, Medicaid, Private Insurance, or other Public Insurance), income, and whether

or not a respondent was using HAART. Individuals can be placed into one of three groups that

differ in the severity of the disease: asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients, or patients

with full-blown AIDS. HCSUS also reports an individuals CD4 T-lymphocyte cell count, a

critical measure of the function of the patient‚Äôs immune system. A depletion of these cells

correlates strongly with the worsening of HIV disease and the risk of developing acquired

immunodeficiency syndrome-defining opportunistic infection (Harrison et al., 1997). Other

demographic data on income, sex, race, sexual orientation, exposure route(s), and age are also

available.

Table 3 displays the characteristics of the HCSUS population. The average educational make-up

of the HCSUS population does not change over time. The population does become sicker, as

more people move out of the asymptomatic and symptomatic categories into the full-blown

AIDS category. People also tend to move out of the uninsured group into the publicly insured

groups. However, immune function goes up.


At baseline, only about 30 percent of respondents with AIDS had ever been exposed to HAART

treatment. However, just six months later, over 60 percent of respondents had been exposed. At

a minimum, physicians‚Äô cost of acquiring information about and prescribing HAART seems to

have gone down precipitously during this period, as its dissemination suddenly became



                                                27
widespread. The wide dissemination of HAART in the second follow-up suggests that health

disparities among HIV patients would have risen post-baseline.


Our theory predicts that the introduction of HAART should have increased health disparities,

controlling for initial health. Consider the following linear probability model for individual i

and time t :


  Diedit +1 = Œ≤ 0 + Œ≤1 Schi + Œ≤ 2 Insuranceit + Œ≤ 3CD 4it + Œ≤ 5 Sexi + Œ≤ 6 Blacki + Œ≤ 7 Ageit + Œ≤ 8 Ageit2 + Œµ it

                                                                                  (5)


The results are presented in Table 4. The most important finding, shown in the first two

columns, is the expansion in health disparities from baseline (the early HAART period) to

second and third periods (the late HAART period). The gap between high school dropouts and

high school graduates (which includes those who attended college but did not receive a degree)

expands dramatically. Our results are robust to the inclusion of insurance status, as well as

measures of log income and income category (not shown in the table).


One problem with this analysis is its lack of statistical power. In spite of the apparently large

estimated increase in health disparities, there is not enough power to reject the hypothesis that

health disparities are constant, simply because there are relatively few observations and even

fewer deaths. It is thus important to explore whether or not the change in health disparities is

consistent with random variation. If it were generated by random noise, the expanding health

gradient should not be affected by adding controls for whether or not a respondent was on

HAART therapy. On the other hand, if the introduction of HAART caused the larger gradient,

adding this variable would reduce the expansion.
                                                        28
The effect we have estimated is in fact the effect of the new technology, provided that the ability-

schooling relationship S (a ) did not change between waves in HCSUS. Since no one in the

HCSUS cohort is acquiring schooling, this will be mechanically true, so long as ability is fixed

for each individual. Of course, some of this may be due to mortality, which is the primary

source of attrition between waves. There are two reasons to believe that this is not driving our

results. This effect, if anything, is likely to induce a contraction in health disparities over time.

Empirically, differential mortality tends to contract health disparities. Indeed, among very old

populations, uneducated people are less likely to die than more educated people (Hurd,

McFadden, and Merrill, 2001). Similar patterns can be observed for other risk factors: among

the elderly, having smoked in the past is positively correlated with survival, even though it is

negatively correlated with survival for the young.18 This is because the average uneducated

decedent is likely to be healthier than the average educated one. Differential mortality lowers the

average health of the less educated by relatively more and would thus contract health disparities.


3.2 Health Disparities and Chronic Illness

The theory also implies that a health shock that comes in the form of a chronic, treatable illness

will raise health disparities, while one that represents an untreatable, fatal illness may contract

them. If true, it demonstrates the value of preventing treatable illnesses; doing so can improve

average health and reduce health inequality. We examine directly whether populations with

treatable chronic conditions exhibit larger health disparities. The major econometric issue is

whether the ability-schooling relationship changes with illness status. Since there is no clear

     Based on authors‚Äô analysis of the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) data.

                                                    29
theoretical answer to this question, we employ an instrumental variables strategy, by using

quarter of birth as an instrument for schooling. This is a particularly appropriate instrument in

our context, as we discuss below. We will also attempt to assess the effect of non-treatable, fatal

conditions by examining very old populations. We propose to use data on the elderly from the

Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) to compare disparities among people in their last

year of life, to disparities among other people.


3.2.1 Treatable Illnesss

We will use individual-level data from the National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS). The

NHIS is an annual survey, conducted every year since 1957, in which individual respondents are

asked various questions about their health, economic, and demographic conditions. We pool the

surveys for every year from 1982 to 1996, incorporating year-specific fixed-effects.19

To separate the NHIS sample along the lines of chronic illness, we identify five major chronic,

treatable illnesses: hypertension, diabetes, asthma, arthritis, and heart disease (defined as the

presence of any of the following: ischemic heart disease, heart rhythm disorders, congenital

heart disease, or other non-hypertensive diseases of the heart). Unfortunately, while the NHIS

asks respondents about a variety of chronic illnesses, not every respondent is asked about every

illness. There are six non-overlapping lists of illnesses; each list is asked of a one-sixth sub-

sample. Each individual is thus asked about conditions on one of the six lists. We can identify a

set of individuals that definitely have a particular condition, but we cannot identify the complete




19
  Prior to 1982, the NHIS used a different general health measure. After 1996, it used a different scheme for
identifying the chronically ill.

                                                         30
set of individuals that do not have the condition, because we cannot rule out the possibility that

some sick people were not asked about their particular condition. To separate the population

along illness lines, therefore, we adopt the following conservative procedure: we define as

chronically ill people who definitely report having at least one of the five conditions. All other

people in the sample are taken to be the ‚Äúnot chronically ill‚Äù population, which could include

people with one of these five illnesses. This will bias us against finding a difference in health

disparities across these populations.

From the NHIS, we will use data on years of schooling, age, sex, and self-reported general health

status. General health is measured on a 5-point scale: each individual in the NHIS sample is

asked whether her health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. From these variables, we

construct a binary variable called GoodHealth , which is one if the individual reports good, very

good, or excellent health. We will explore whether or not our results are sensitive to restricting

this definition to, say, very good or excellent health, or just excellent health. (It does not make

sense to expand the definition further, since there are relatively few people who report poor

health.) From the years of schooling variables, we construct three dummy variables:

HighSchool , which is one if the individual has exactly 12 years of schooling; SomeCollege ,

which is one if she has more than 12 years, but less than 16; College , which is one if she has at

least 16 years of schooling. In general, we estimate the within-year health returns to schooling by

regressing GoodHealth on age, sex, and our three educational dummies:20

       GoodHealth = Œ≤ 0 + Œ≤1 HighSchool + Œ≤ 2 SomeCollege + Œ≤ 3College + Œ≤ 4 Age + Œ≤ 5 Sex + Œµ (6)



20
     By ‚Äúwithin-year,‚Äù we mean that year-specific fixed-effects are included in the regression.

                                                            31
In most cases, these regressions will be run separately for 5-year age intervals. In these cases,

we will enter age linearly. In other cases, data from all age groups will be pooled, and we will

use dummy variables for narrow (five years or less) age categories, or age splines.

Table 5 compares health disparities for the chronically ill and healthy populations. Within the

‚ÄúNot Chronically Ill‚Äù and ‚ÄúChronically Ill‚Äù panels, each row shows the results of a single

regression for the given age group of good health on the three listed education dummies, a linear

age term, and a dummy for sex. Within nearly every age group, health disparities are roughly

twice as high for the chronically ill than for the healthy. Not surprisingly, the magnitude of the

difference is declining with age‚Äîone would expect the prevalence of unobserved chronic illness

among the healthy population to rise with age. Among the youngest populations, however,

disparities are about two and a half times as high for the chronically ill than for the healthy.


To explore the robustness of these results, we must confront two potential problems. First, it is

possible that variation in the educational gradient reflects ‚Äúdiagnosis bias.‚Äù Suppose that more

educated people are diagnosed with chronic illnesses earlier and in milder forms. Among the

chronically ill, therefore, the educated would tend to be relatively healthier. To rule out this

explanation, we use another measure of health from the NHIS: whether or not an individual

reports that he is able to work. The bias with this measure will be in the opposite direction, since

educated people will have the most incentive to stay in the labor force, even if they are ill. On

the basis of their responses to a series of questions about their ability to work, the NHIS

classifies respondents aged 18-69 in one of four categories: unable to work because of a health

condition, limited in the kind or amount of work because of a health condition, limited in non-

work activities only, and not limited at all by health conditions. We classify an individual in

                                                  32
either of the first two categories as being ‚Äúunable to work‚Äù because of a health condition. Once

again, we are adopting the conservative procedure of including people who might be only

slightly impaired in our ‚Äúunable to work‚Äù category.


Table 6 presents the results of this breakdown. The results are essentially the same as for the

chronic illness analysis. At every age and level of schooling, health disparities are greater for

those unable to work than those who are. For the younger age groups, the gradient is about three

times as steep for those that are unable to work; for the older age groups, it is nearly twice as

steep. It is sensible that the difference between the two groups is more pronounced for the

young, because the actual difference in health across groups is probably most pronounced among

the young. Among the elderly, even those who pronounce themselves ‚Äúable to work‚Äù may not be

in perfectly robust health.


The second problem requires us to rule out the possibility that the ability-schooling gradient is

steeper for the chronically ill. To address this problem, we will use an instrument for schooling

that we believe is uncorrelated with ability, time preference, or other plausible factors that jointly

determine health and schooling. In particular, we use an individual‚Äôs quarter of birth, whose use

was first suggested by Angrist and Krueger (1991) in the context of estimating the wage returns

to schooling. Angrist and Krueger argue that children start school at different ages, depending

on their season of birth, but compulsory schooling laws cease to bind at a particular age. As a

result, the number of compulsory schooling years varies with a child‚Äôs quarter of birth. In

particular, children born earlier in the year tend to end up with less educational attainment than

those born later in the year.



                                                 33
This instrument requires us to confront two issues. First, samples above 100,000 observations

are required in order to identify the correlation between quarter of birth and educational

attainment with the required precision. Therefore, we pool our data across age groups, and

estimate the effect of age as a piecewise linear spline. We are also limited to estimating the

effect of years of schooling attained, rather than the effect of three educational dummies, because

the instrument lacks the power to identify all three categorical variables. Second, since age

affects health, and quarter of birth influences age, this could invalidate the instrument. However,

this is unlikely to be a problem here. A simple regression of good health on sex, education

dummies, and single-year age dummies for the population aged 25 to 99 reveals that health

significantly declines at adjacent age groups only 3 out of 74 times. In other words, even though

health declines with age, it does not decline at the frequency of one quarter; indeed, it does not

even decline at the frequency of one year.


Table 7 presents these results. The table shows the coefficients on sex, highest grade attained,

and the coefficients on the piecewise linear age spline. The first two columns present the OLS

estimates, while the second two present the IV estimates. In both cases, health disparities are

about twice as large for the chronically ill. The IV estimates are also consistently larger than the

OLS estimates; this is consistent with the findings of many other researchers. Card (1995)

reports that nearly all researchers who estimate IV models of the monetary return to schooling

find that the IV estimates are larger than the OLS estimates. Lleras-Muney (2001) uses state-

level compulsory schooling laws as an instrument for the effect of schooling on mortality and

also finds that the IV estimates are considerably and consistently larger than the IV estimates.




                                                 34
This may be because the effect of schooling is larger at lower levels of schooling, where the

schooling instruments derive their explanatory power.


3.2.2 Untreatable Illness

The effects of chronic, treatable illnesses are predicted to differ from those of diseases that

respond less to treatment. It is not straightforward to identify an ‚Äúuntreatable‚Äù disease, because

many diseases that can be treated often become untreatable at the end of life, and because

diseases that seem treatable may not turn out to be (Garber, MaCurdy, and McClellan, 1999).

The best we can do, it would seem, is to analyze whether health disparities contract for people

who are in their last year of life. While people in their last year of life clearly do not know this

ex ante, on average they will probably be facing conditions that are less treatable than elderly

people who will live longer than one year.


We can perform these comparisons using individual-level data from the Medicare Current

Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). The MCBS is a rotating panel survey, available from 1992 through

1998, designed to be representative of the Medicare population in the given year. It contains

data on age, sex, education, self-reported health status (also on a scale of one to five), and most

importantly, whether the respondent died in the year of the survey. Among the oldest segments

of the MCBS population, deaths are common enough for us to construct reasonable samples. For

example, pooling the 1992-8 samples, 2085 people over age 80 died during the survey year.


The data we use are summarized in Table 8. Among those in their last year of life, only about

30% report that they are in good health, while the proportion is about twice as high for other

respondents. It is also not surprising that men are at greater risk of death, although the gap

                                                  35
narrows with age. Finally, those in their last year of life are slightly less educated than other

respondents, but these differences are not very large. Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for the

equality of distributions, we cannot reject at the 10% level that the distributions are equal for 85-

90 year-olds and those over 90. We can reject this hypothesis for 80-85 year-olds, but not at the

5% level. This is consistent with other research that finds mortality gradients narrowing among

the very old (Hurd, McFadden, and Merrill, 2001). The rough similarities of the education

distribution provide us with some comfort that the ability-schooling distribution does not vary

dramatically for those in their last year of life.


Table 9 compares health disparities for those in their last year of life to disparities for other

respondents. Disparities among those in their last year of life are about 40 to 50 percent smaller

than disparities among other respondents. The standard errors for the survivors regression are

clustered by respondent, to account for the fact that some people enter this regression twice.



4 Conclusions
We have developed a theory that helps us understand how and why health disparities vary over

time and across population groups. The theory predicts that most technological innovations in

health care, by lowering the price of health, will expand health disparities. However, certain

innovations can contract health disparities, if they simplify the production of health and reduce

the importance of time investments. In addition, the advent of a chronic, treatable illness will

tend to widen health disparities, while the advent of an untreatable illness will contract them.

The data bear out our predictions for the effects of different types of technological changes and

different types of health shocks. The development of new HIV drugs that involved complicated

medication regimens widened health disparities, while the development of hypertension drugs
                                                     36
that lessened the need to undertake diet control, weight control, and exercise had the opposite

effect. Similarly, people with chronic, treatable conditions exhibit wider health disparities than

healthy people, while people in their last year of life‚Äîwho presumably suffer from less treatable

conditions‚Äîexhibit narrower disparities.


This paper suggests the importance of an empirical research agenda designed to understand how

health disparities vary across the population and over time. We have identified a few important

dimensions along which the returns vary, but there are likely to be many other dimensions that

require further empirical and theoretical investigation. In addition, this paper has relied on

advances in technology as a source of change over time in health disparities. While we have

taken these types of innovations as exogenous, it is possible that health disparities themselves

have a role to play in the development of technological change. Timesaving technologies may

be more likely to arise when large numbers of uneducated people suffer from a disease;

conversely, timesaving technologies are less likely when a disease is confined to the educated or

the rich. Alternatively, economy-wide growth in schooling may encourage certain types of

technological change that involve more own-time investments. Growth in schooling raises the

payoff to developing such technologies. Future work could examine the theoretical linkage

between the growth in the educated population and the incentives for patient-intensive

technology.


Hopefully, our paper has laid the groundwork for a research agenda aimed at understanding the

cross-sectional variation in the health returns to schooling. Understanding this variation seems

crucial for gaining further insight into the relationship between socioeconomic status and health,

the relationship at the heart of many discussions about health and economic inequality.

The term Det , the determinant of the Hessian matrix, is positive if the second order conditions

To prove the model‚Äôs implications for health disparities, it is helpful to observe the following

Consider first changes in Fa across groups. Computation reveals that Fa = FŒ± a ln t . Since t

and M are complementary, all groups that use more t also engage in more health investment h .

Therefore, they exhibit higher levels of Fa . This applies to groups with lower initial health,

Note: Table shows the difference in the probability of reporting good health between the listed education group and those
with less than a high school education, using a linear probability model. Regressions are run separately for each age
group and illness status, and also control for gender and year. The chronically ill are those who report having either:
hypertension, diabetes, asthma, arthritis, or heart disease. Data are from the 1982-1996 NHIS.

Note: Table shows the difference in the probability of reporting good health between the listed education group and
those with less than a high school education, using a linear probability model. Regressions are run separately for each
age group and work-limitation category, and all contain dummies for gender and year, and a linear term for age.
Data are from the 1982-1996 NHIS.
