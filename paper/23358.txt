                                         ABSTRACT

Several ˝field experiments fi˝nd positive returns to grants for male and not female micro-
entrepreneurs. But, these analyses largely overlook that male and female micro-entrepreneurs
often belong to the same household. Using data from randomized trials in India, Sri Lanka and
Ghana, we show that the gender gap in microenterprise performance is not due to a gap in
aptitude. Instead, low average returns of female-run enterprises are observed because women's
capital is invested into their husbands' enterprises rather than their own. When women are the
sole household enterprise operator, capital shocks lead to large increases in profits. Household-
level income gains are equivalent regardless of the grant or loan recipient's gender.

1     Introduction
Several studies, such as the seminal work by De Mel et al. (2008) in Sri Lanka, show that relaxing
capital constraints of micro-entrepreneurs in developing countries leads to substantial profit gains.
This finding indicates both that microenterprises have high returns to capital and that micro-
entrepreneurs are poised to take advantage of investment opportunities when provided with the
resources to do so.
    An important auxiliary finding, which has been replicated in other settings, is that male but
not female-operated enterprises benefit from access to business grants (see Table 1; Blattman et al.
(2014) is one exception). A common explanation for this finding is that female-run enterprises
have low returns to capital or, alternatively, that women are less able to make sound enterprise
investments when the opportunity arises.1 This, in turn, has led some to ask whether credit
programs for the poor, such as microfinance, should direct loans to men rather than women.2
    In this paper, we propose and evaluate an alternative explanation: both women and men
invest grants and loans in the highest-return enterprises within the household, which are very often
operated by men. This behavior is consistent with the canonical separability result in economic
theory which implies that, if returns to investment in male-operated activities in the household
exceed those of female-operated activities, all household members (irrespective of gender) should
optimally invest in the male-operated enterprises until marginal returns to capital across male and
female activities are equalized.3 If male enterprises outperform female enterprises or if average
returns are equal but female micro-entrepreneurs are simply more likely to be married to male
micro-entrepreneurs than the reverse, relaxing capital constraints will be associated with higher
levels of investment in male enterprises as long as liquidity constraints are binding.
    In order to assess evidence for this explanation, which we term the Enterprise Household
Model, we examine the impact of increased financial access for one household member on all en-
terprises in a household. We first consider household investment responses to a field experiment
we conducted with microfinance clients in Kolkata, India in 2007 (the primary results of which are
reported in Field et al. (2013)). In that experiment, we randomly assigned female microfinance
clients to either the classic microfinance contract or to one that eases liquidity constraints by
providing a grace period before the first repayment. Using profit data from all household enter-
prises, we study how male- and female-run enterprises respond to an exogenous change in liquidity
constraints granted to a female borrower. Next, for further corroboration of the Enterprise House-
hold Model, we re-estimate returns to capital for the De Mel et al. (2008) and Fafchamps et al.
1
  In de Mel et al. (2009), the authors further explore the gender gap in returns to capital among Sri Lankan micro-
  entrepreneurs and find suggestive evidence that both sectoral composition and spousal capture constrains female
  micro-entrepreneurs’ investment decisions.
2
  Fafchamps et al. (2014), for instance, write, “ ..microfinance programs that focus primarily on women may be
  ignoring a large group of enterprises with a need for more capital.”

(2014) samples in Sri Lanka and Ghana, explicitly accounting for the enterprise composition of
the household.
       To begin, we observe that female micro-entrepreneurs very often have access to multiple in-
vestment opportunities within the household. In our Kolkata sample, more than half of female
micro-entrepreneurs live with another enterprise owner. Similarly, in the Sri Lanka and Ghana
samples, 48% and 41% of female participants lived with another micro-entrepreneur at baseline.
In contrast, only 29% of male participants in the Sri Lanka study and 26% in the Ghana study
belonged to a household with a second self-employed person.4
       In the first step of our analysis, we aggregate profits (and income) across household members
in the Kolkata sample to estimate household returns to increased financial flexibility. Then, to
examine whether returns to capital vary by household composition, we classify households with
a female micro-entrepreneur by the portfolio of investment opportunities available to her and
compare enterprise-level returns across clients with different opportunity sets.
       We note two striking results. First, there is an important discrepancy between enterprise-
level and household-level returns: while treatment has zero effect on female-enterprise profits,
it has a substantial effect on household profits. The average impact of being in the treatment
group (i.e. the impact of easing the female entrepreneur’s credit constraint) is an increase of 20-
29% in household profits relative to the control group. Second, the returns to relaxing liquidity
constraints for female micro-entrepreneurs varies with the enterprise-ownership composition of
the household. When the household has multiple enterprise owners – in other words, when the
female micro-entrepreneur has alternative investment opportunities – the grace period contract
has no impact on profits of the female-operated enterprise. But, when a female client is the sole
entrepreneur in her household (30% of our sample), the grace period contract has a very large
impact on her enterprise profits: there is an increase of 70-81% relative to the control group.
Moreover, the gender gap in returns to easing credit constraints disappears: the level increase in
these female entrepreneurs’ profits is statistically indistinguishable from the increase observed in
male-operated enterprises in multiple enterprise households.
       Next, we similarly categorize female entrepreneurs in the De Mel et al. (2008) sample and re-
estimate the treatment effect of grants on profits for households in that study. We find comparable
results: On average, cash and in-kind grants have no impact on profits for female enterprise owners
in the Sri Lanka sample but, among female micro-entrepreneurs in households with no other
self-employed persons, grants lead to a statistically significant 7% increase in profits. Further,
consistent with our Enterprise Household Model explanation, we observe a rise in household
income among the full sample of households where female entrepreneurs receive a positive liquidity
4
    In our sample, 54% of male entrepreneurs belong to households with other enterprise owners. But, given that our
    sample is limited to households that contain a female microfinance client, this share is likely to be much higher
    than in the general population of male entrepreneurs. A full breakdown of enterprise composition within the
    household is given in Section 2.

shock.
       The discrepancy between individual- and household-level estimates of return in the Kolkata
and Sri Lanka samples provides clear evidence that multiple-enterprise households choose to in-
vest in male-operated enterprises. But, because this means that female entrepreneurs in these
households are not recipients of a capital shock, we cannot estimate the marginal return to capital
for their enterprises. We are therefore unable to compare returns across male and female enter-
prises in multiple-enterprise households and so cannot establish that the marginal returns to male
enterprises are higher and that households are in fact investing optimally. For this analysis, we
turn to Fafchamps et al. (2014), where female and male micro-entrepreneurs in Ghana received
either cash or in-kind grants. In-kind grants are arguably difficult to liquidate and thus less likely
to be reallocated to a household enterprise that was not sampled for the study.5 We categorize
study participants by household investment opportunities and separately estimate returns for re-
cipients of the cash and in-kind grants. We show that when women are the sole entrepreneur
in their household, their returns from the in-kind grant are not statistically different from the
returns we observe for male entrepreneurs in multiple-enterprise households. Second, returns to
female enterprises in multiple-enterprise households are significantly lower than those of men in
multiple-enterprise households.
       In summary, poor households often own multiple enterprises and these enterprises belong
to various household members. Easing capital constraints for female and male entrepreneurs
in single-enterprise households leads to comparable returns, but there is a large gender gap in
impact when capital recipients are members of multiple-enterprise households. Evidence suggests
that, when there are multiple enterprises in a household, women’s enterprises attain much lower
returns than those operated by men. It is beyond the scope of this paper to identify the causes
for these household investment decisions. Nevertheless, we can conclude that, as predicted by
the Enterprise Household Model, individuals optimize household income and not necessarily the
returns to their own enterprise. Because of this, studies that measure profits only at the enterprise
level risk underestimating the returns to increased financial access for female entrepreneurs.
       In demonstrating that endogenous household investment decisions impact observed profitabil-
ity of household enterprises, we build on insights from theoretical models of household transition
out of agriculture via entrepreneurship (Banerjee and Newman, 1993) and related empirical studies
such as Ghani et al. (2014), which find that households in transition out of agriculture coordinate
investment decisions so as to optimize household-level profits. Our findings also reconcile re-
sults from the enterprise grant studies described here with results from recent evaluations of cash
transfers and microfinance, which estimate returns at the household level and find that gender of
the recipient is irrelevant (see Haushofer and Shapiro (2016); Fiala (2014) and Benhassine et al.
5
    In the Sri Lanka study, participants were also randomly assigned to receive either in-kind or cash grants. But,
    unlike in the Ghana study, De Mel et al. (2008) did not stratify on gender.

(2015) for examples from the cash-transfer literature, and Augsburg et al. (2015) and Kevane and
Wydick (2001) for examples from the microcredit literature).
       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 uses the Field et al. (2013) sample
to describe the nature of households enterprises and then demonstrates how level of aggregation
influences estimated returns to capital. Section 3 describes comparable results for the De Mel
et al. (2008) and Fafchamps et al. (2014) samples, and Section 4 concludes.

2        The Nature of Household Enterprises and Investment Choices:
         Evidence from Field et al. (2013)
Levels of entrepreneurship are typically high for poor urban households; moreover, these house-
holds undertake significant diversification of economic activity (Banerjee and Duflo, 2007). Using
data from the Field et al. (2013) field experiment, we describe some salient features of household
enterprise composition for a sample of poor urban households. We then examine how household
investment responses to relaxed liquidity constraints for female entrepreneurs vary according to
household enterprise composition.

2.1       The Nature of Household Enterprises
The experiment reported in Field et al. (2013) was conducted in 2007 in Kolkata, India in part-
nership with a microfinance institution, Village Financial Services Private, Ltd. (VFS). Inclusion
criteria for selection into the study were that a client must be a woman aged between 18 and 55
and reside in a household with at least one income-generating activity in the form of an enter-
prise. VFS gives out individual-liability loans but clients are organized into groups for repayment
meetings. Among clients in our sample, loans ranged from Rs. 4,000 – Rs. 10,000 (90 – 225
USD at the 2007 exchange rate). In the sample of Kolkata-based clients in Field et al. (2013),
the average household owns 1.7 enterprises and 38.5% have multiple entrepreneurs.
       We group households in the Kolkata sample according to the following categories: (1) only the
female client owns an enterprise (30% of the sample); (2) only non-client household members own
enterprises (31.5% of the sample); or, (3) both the client and non-client household member(s) own
enterprises (38.5% of the sample). At least one fifth of households in each category have multiple
enterprises and, in households with multiple micro-entrepreneurs, one quarter have three or more
enterprises (see Figure 1, below).6
6
    Categorization of households is based on retrospective data gathered at the three-year follow-up. At that time,
    we collected data on all household enterprises that were open at baseline or that had been opened in the interim
    period between surveys. We classify households according to investment opportunities available over the course of
    the three-year period: thus, if a female client was the sole entrepreneur at the time of intervention, but another
    household member later opened a enterprise, the household would be classified as having multiple enterprises (even
    if one or more of the enterprises closed before follow-up).

                   Figure 1: Number of Enterprise Owners by Household Type




   Two key patterns in household economic activity emerge: First, our categorization closely
maps to the gender composition of enterprise ownership. In 97.6% of households with multiple
entrepreneurs, the non-client entrepreneur is the client’s spouse or another male household mem-
ber. In households in which the client does not own an enterprise, enterprises are exclusively
operated by men (by construction, client-only households have only female-operated enterprises).
   Second, while there are stark differences between female-run enterprises in multiple- and single-
enterprise households, male-run enterprises are almost identical across household types. Male
micro-entrepreneurs report average weekly profits of between Rs. 1625 and Rs. 1430 in multiple-
and single-enterprise households, respectively. Similarly, household enterprise composition does
not affect male micro-entrepreneurs’ industry choice: across household types, men predominantly
operate in the retail sector. In contrast, for female micro-entrepreneurs, the presence of a second
entrepreneur is associated with significantly lower profits and a different sector choice. In multiple-
enterprise households, female micro-entrepreneurs report average weekly profits of Rs. 357 and
the modal enterprise is piece-rate stitching. These women’s profits amount to only 22% of what
their spouse or other male household micro-entrepreneur earns. Yet, when a woman is the sole
enterprise owner in the household, her average weekly profits are 1.5 times larger and, like male
entrepreneurs, she predominantly chooses to operate in the retail sector. The link between a
gender gap in profits and sectoral choice is also noted by de Mel et al. (2009).

2.2    Experimental design and estimation strategy
Between March and December 2007, 169 newly formed five-member loan groups were randomly
assigned to one of two repayment schedules: 85 groups received the standard contract, in which the
first loan repayment was due two weeks after loan disbursal and installments were due every two
weeks after that. The remaining 84 groups received a contract that featured a two-month grace

                                                  6
period before the first loan installment. All other contract features were identical across the two
groups.7 In 2010, nearly three years after loan disbursement, we surveyed every enterprise owner
within the household and collected data on long-run enterprise-level profits and household-level
income.
       VFS offers credit only to women, not all of whom are entrepreneurs. Thus, to make our
sample comparable to the study samples for the enterprise grant experiments listed in Table 1,
we exclude households in which the client did not operate an enterprise. Appendix Table A1
shows that treatment and control groups remain balanced after this sample restriction. Loan
contract randomization allows us to estimate the causal impact on profit and income of relaxing
credit constraints via the grace period contract. We estimate profits using responses to the
following question: “Can you please tell us the average weekly profit you have now or had when
your enterprise was last operational?” Following De Mel et al. (2008), if a client runs multiple
household enterprises, we report (in column 1) the profits of the largest enterprise she owned in
2007. To measure the treatment effect on the clients’ enterprises, we follow De Mel et al. (2008)
and estimate the following enterprise-level regression:

                                    Yf hg = α1 + β1 Gg + Bg + γ1 Xhg + µf hg                                     (1)

where Yf hg are the enterprise profits of client f who lives in household h and belongs to microfi-
nance group g. The omitted group consists of clients that operate in households assigned to the
standard contract. Standard errors are clustered at the group-level. Gg is an dummy variable
that equals one if the group was assigned to the grace period contract and Bg is a indicator of
the stratification batch. No respondents dropped out of our experiment, so β1 is the average
treatment effect of being assigned the grace period contract. Table 2, Panels A and B report
estimates without and with the controls (Xhg ; we use the same controls as in Field et al. (2013)
and these are listed in Appendix Table A1). To address noise in survey responses to questions
that require a high level of aggregation, we trim enterprise and income outcomes such that the
top 0.5% of the distribution is omitted from the analysis.
       Following Field et al. (2013), we also estimate the following household model:

                                     Yhg = α2 + β2 Gg + Bg + γ2 Xhg + µhg                                        (2)

Unlike in equation (1), here we aggregate enterprise profits across all household enterprises. β2
is the average treatment effect on all household enterprises combined of being assigned the grace

    In particular, after the first installment was paid, groups met with loan officers and repaid every two weeks,
    the full loan had to be repaid within 44 weeks, and all borrowers faced the same interest rate charges. For
    a comprehensive discussion of the control and treatment groups’ relative interest rates, see Field et al. (2013).
    Groups were randomized into treatment or control in batches of 20 groups and were informed of their treatment
    status after group formation and loan approval, but prior to loan disbursement.

period contract.

2.3        Enterprise Classification and Returns in the Kolkata Sample
Consistent with findings from cash or in-kind grant studies, column (1) of Table 2 shows that the
average treatment effect of the grace period contract on self-reported weekly profits for female
loan recipients is not different from zero (equation 1). But, when we estimate effects at the
household level (equation 2), results show that the grace period increases average weekly profits
by 43–48% of the control mean (column 2). Household-level increases in profits are more than
three-fold client-level estimates. This suggests that the average client largely invests her loan in
other household enterprises.
       Next, we turn to the intra-household dynamics underlying observed differences in household-
and client-level responses to the liquidity shock. To do so, we examine enterprise-level profits
but distinguish between households in which only the female client operates an enterprise and
those in which the female client and other members operate enterprises.8 A clear pattern emerges.
While we observe no change in profits for female clients in households with multiple entrepreneurs
(column 4), this seems to be because loans are invested in another household enterprise: as shown
in column (5), the profits of husbands’ and other household members’ enterprises increase by
44–50% in response to the grace period. Meanwhile, we observe strikingly large treatment effects
when women are the sole household enterprise owner: weekly profits for female entrepreneurs
in this group are 70–81% higher than those of women in the control group (column 3). The
treatment impact for women in this group also reduces the gender gap in profits: the level increase
in profits for female entrepreneurs in single-enterprise households is statistically indistinguishable
from the level increase in profits for non-client entrepreneurs (who are almost all male) in multiple-
enterprise households (comparison of columns 3 and 5).
       Estimates of effects on household income (columns 6 and 7) are noisy but comparable: treat-
ment increases income by 20–29% for both household types. With the inclusion of controls, the
income effect is significant at the 10% level for households in which the client is the sole enterprise
owner and at the 5% level for households with multiple enterprise owners.

3        Comparison with microenterprise grant experiments
To evaluate the generalizability of the Enterprise Household Model, we undertake a parallel anal-
ysis for the De Mel et al. (2008) and Fafchamps et al. (2014) samples from Sri Lanka and Ghana,
where the nature of treatment – provision of cash or in-kind grants to micro-entrepreneurs – is
different from variation in loan contract.
8
    This method of aggregation differs from column (1), where we followed the protocol of other studies and report
    profits of the client’s largest enterprise. In columns (3)–(5), we aggregate profits across all of the enterprises that a
    client operates. This method is consistent with the argument of the paper that, rather than selecting one enterprise
    to survey, studies should be surveying all household enterprises.




                                                               8
3.1    Enterprise classification and returns in the Sri Lanka sample
We start with the De Mel et al. (2008) sample. In 2005, the authors identified a sample of 617
male and female micro-entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka who were self-employed, of working age, and
had no paid employees.9 A randomly assigned subset of these microenterprise owners were either
offered unconditional cash grants or offered in-kind grants for enterprise equipment or inventories.
Grant size was also randomized and grants were worth approximately USD 100 or USD 200. The
authors conducted eight rounds of follow-up surveys over roughly two years.
    Table 3 reports treatment effects on female-operated enterprises in the Sri Lanka sample.
Column (1) replicates the authors’ finding: the average treatment effect for female-operated
enterprises is indistinguishable from zero.10 Next, as we did with the Field et al. (2013) sample,
we classify women in the Sri Lanka sample according to household investment opportunities.11
We first consider the subset of female micro-entrepreneurs living in households with no other
self-employed member. These women – whose household investment opportunities are limited to
their own enterprise – reap significant benefits from the grants and their real profits increase by
30.1% of the control mean (column 2). This increase is statistically significant at the 10% level.
    Are women with other self-employed household members re-allocating their grants to other
household enterprises, as we observe in the Kolkata sample? While De Mel et al. (2008) did
not include a detailed financial activity module for other household enterprises, they do collect
monthly household income data. In column (3) we report a significant and large treatment
effect on the log of total monthly household income for female entrepreneurs: households in the
treatment group earn on average 8% higher income than households in the control group.12

3.2    Enterprise Classification and Returns in the Ghana Sample
Since cash grants and loans in multiple-enterprise households are often allocated to the male-run
enterprise, we cannot accurately estimate the marginal returns to investment in female enterprises
in these households in the Kolkata or Sri Lanka samples. Would the extra rupee invested in a
female enterprise in a multiple-enterprise household produce a lower return than the extra rupee
9
 The authors excluded enterprises that were directly affected by the 2004 tsunami from their main analysis, which
 left them with a sample of 408 enterprises.
10
   We use the authors’ publicly available data and follow their method of analysis, including specification and data
   transformations. As such, we pool across cash and in-kind treatments and across survey rounds. Also following
   the authors, we trim outlying profit observations, eliminating the top 0.5% of absolute and percentage changes
   from one survey round to the next. Point estimates in column (1) of Table 3 identically replicate those in column
   (2) of Table V in De Mel et al. (2008) (though the authors include the full sample and interact gender with
   treatment amount, while we restrict the sample to female enterprise owners).
11
   Appendix Note A2 describes our method for categorizing women in the Sri Lanka sample.
12
   In unreported regressions, we separately estimate effects on household income for female micro-entrepreneurs
   in the De Mel et al. (2008) sample who live with another self-employed person and for those who are the sole
   entrepreneurs in their household. While the regressions are under powered, both groups report an increase in
   total monthly household income: women with no other self-employed household member report an increase in
   household income of 5% and women with other self-employed members report an increase of 8%. In the Field
   et al. (2013) sample we observe significant increases in household income for all household categories.

invested in a male enterprise? To investigate this question, we use the Ghana data reported in
Fafchamps et al. (2014). The authors randomly assigned either in-kind or cash grants to female
and male microenterprise owners. Unlike cash, which is fungible and can easily be invested in
any household enterprise, in-kind grants tend to remain within the enterprise to which they are
assigned. As the authors argue, this may reflect differences in the liquidity of in-kind grants or
the structure of social expectations for sharing.
    In Table 4, we exploit the stickiness of in-kind grants to estimate the returns to female and
male-operated enterprises in households with multiple entrepreneurs. As with the De Mel et al.
(2008) data, we first create a measure for whether a study participant is the only self-employed
member of their household. This measure is interacted with the study participant’s gender and
with whether the participant received a treatment (in-kind in column 1 and cash in column 2) or
was assigned to the control group. The omitted group are male enterprise owners in the control
group. At the bottom of the table we provide the p-values from an F-test that compares the returns
for female entrepreneurs in single-enterprise households to the returns for male entrepreneurs in
multiple-enterprise households. The p-values of columns (1) and (2) show that we cannot reject
equality between returns to the grant for these two groups. The second set of p-values are for
a comparison of the returns of female- and male-run enterprises in households with multiple
entrepreneurs. As shown in column (1), women in multiple enterprise households who received
in-kind grants have significantly lower returns than do male in-kind grant recipients in multiple
enterprise households. Estimates of the impact of cash grants are similar but with more noise.

4    Conclusion
Structural transformation and economic development in low-income countries is accompanied by
a transition from agriculture to informal self-employment. As households take the first step in
this direction and engage in informal self-employment, they typically diversify income-generating
activities among members (Banerjee and Duflo, 2007), often through investment in multiple mi-
croenterprises: for instance, a wife and her daughter-in-law might work as seamstresses at home,
while her husband fixes bicycles on the roadside. A growing experimental literature in devel-
opment economics seeks to identify interventions (such as microfinance, business grants, skills
training, cash transfers, or others) with the most potential to advance households’ progress out
of poverty.
    Randomized evaluations in several countries have yielded evidence that easing the liquidity
constraints of micro-entrepreneurs results in higher profits for male-operated but not for female-
operated microenterprises. In this paper, we present a model that sheds light on this puzzle.
We show that accounting for the multiplicity of investment opportunities within a household
significantly affects the estimated returns to capital for women. When returns to capital are
measured only at the enterprise-level, investment responses by female micro-entrepreneurs can be


                                                10
easily overlooked. By classifying women in the sample of female microfinance clients in Kolkata
(Field et al., 2013) by household type, we show that relaxing liquidity constraints for single-
enterprise households leads to very large increases in female entrepreneurs’ profits. The estimated
returns to capital among this subset of female enterprise owners are of equal magnitude to those
of male enterprise owners in our sample. Similarly, when we analyze returns to business grants
among micro-entrepreneurs in the De Mel et al. (2008) study, we see that when women are the
sole self-employed person in their household there are large treatment effects, though female-run
enterprises demonstrated no returns to the grant on average.
   Our findings suggest that female entrepreneurs are as capable as male entrepreneurs of making
sound investment decisions. As such, while there may be household-level returns to interventions
that aim to improve women’s business skills, such programs are unlikely to have a significant
impact on their level of profits. Research and policies that further our understanding of female
entrepreneurs’ sectoral choice and investment constraints hold more promise for closing the gender
gap in microenterprise returns.

     (1) The outcome variable in columns 1-6 is ”Can you please tell us the average weekly profit you have now or when your business was last operational?”; the
     outcome variable in columns 7 and 8 is the log of total household income over the previous 30 days.
     (2) Regressions include stratification fixed effects and standard errors are clustered by loan group. Regressions in Panel B also include all controls presented in
     Appendix Table 2. In cases where a control variable is missing, its value is set to zero and a dummy is included for whether the variable is missing.
     (3) To address noise in survey responses to questions that require a high level of aggregation, profit and income variables are trimmed such that the top 0.5% of
     the distribution are omitted from analysis.
     (4) Number of observations differ between columns because of trimming: Each outcome variable is trimmed at the enterprise level and trimming occurs separately
     for the female client, spouse, and other household member distributions. For columns 2, 7 and 8, trimmed enterprise-level distributions are then summed across
     enterprises in the household. The household-level observation is thus included in the analysis if either the client or the other entrepreneur is within the bottom
     99.5% of their respective distributions.

The following notes are taken from DMW:

(1) The outcome variable in columns 1 and 2 is What was the total income the business earned during [month]
after paying all expenses including wages of employees, but not including any income you paid yourself. That is,
what were the profits of your business during [month]?; the coefficients in columns 1 and 2 show the effect on the
outcome variable of a 100 rupee increase in the capital stock. The outcome variable in column 3 is the log of
responses to the question How much is your total monthly household income now?.

(2) The sample for column 2 consists of households with female entrepreneurs and no other self-employed person.
The sample in columns 1 and 3 includes all female enterprise operators. Following the authors’ protocol, the
samples in all columns exclude 20 enterprises which respondents reported were jointly operated, or where the
identity of the owner changed in at least one survey round.

(3) The authors collected data via nine quarterly surveys, from March 2005 through March 2007. (Household
income data is missing for wave 6). Both outcomes were measured monthly. The regression specification is identical
to that reported in DMW, though they do not report the household income outcome. Following the authors’
instructions for the specification: Profits and household income (collected in Sri Lankan Rupees) are deflated by
the Sri Lankan CPI to reflect March 2005 price levels. Profit and income regressions include enterprise and survey
wave fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the enterprise level and are shown in parentheses.

                    Appendix Note A2: Description of Analysis using DMW Data

DMW offer unconditional cash grants or in-kind business grants worth roughly USD100 - 200 to
a sample of male and female entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka. Our analysis uses data collected through
the authors nine quarterly enterprise surveys and three household surveys, conducted from March
2005 through March 2007. Study participants were awarded grants after the first and third round
of surveys.13 190 female enterprise operators are surveyed at baseline and are included in the
authors analysis. We classify these female entrepreneur according to investment opportunities
available to them within the household: In the three household surveys (conducted at Rounds
1, 5, and 9), respondents are asked to describe the employment activities of all other household
members.14 Female entrepreneurs who report that another household member is engaged in self-
employment activities in any of the three survey rounds are considered to have other investment
