                                 AN ANALYSIS OF DIVISIONAL
                                    INVESTMENT POLICIES




       This paper investigates   the divisional investment policies of diversified firms.       We find

that investment   of the smallest division of diversified firms is significantly    related to the cash

flow of the other segments.      We then show that the smallest division’s         investment   is more

sensitive to the cash flow of the other divisions for firms where one expects aggregate investment

to be related to cash flow also, namely low q firms and firms with high leverage.       This and other

evidence we provide is consistent with what we call the bureaucratic       rigidity hypothesis.    This

hypothesis states that relative allocations of investment funds in diversified firms are sticky. We

fail to find support for the view that diversified      firms allocate more funds to divisions       in

industries with better investment opportunities.

1. Introduction.

             Does it matter for a division’s          investment           policy whether          it is pad of a highly

diversified     firm, a moderately          diversified   firm, or is a stand-alone                 firm? The view that

diversification       creates value is often based on the idea that being part of a diversified

firm makes        it possible      for a division     to invest without           the impediments                 from capital

market imperfections.           q We call this the efficient               internal     capital    markets         hypothesis.

The alternative        view that diversified       firms invest less efficiently              is generally             associated

with the proposition           that, because of their additional             layers of management,                     they find it

difficult to take advantage           of good investment           opportunities        at the division level and fail

to   decrease          aggressively         investment        in   divisions      that      have        poor       investment

opportunities.        We call this hypothesis        the bureaucratic          rigidity hypothesis.             In this paper,

we   first     show     that    divisions    of diversified        firms     invest      differently      than          otherwise

comparable        stand-alone      firms and then explore why this is so.

         Even though           the various views of diversified               firms lead to the conclusion                    that

investment       differs between a division of a diversified                 firm and an otherwise                comparable

stand-alone       firm, there      is little evidence         on how investment              policies         differ     between

diversified     firms and specialized          firms. Most of the evidence               on the investment                policies

of diversified     firms is indirect        and demonstrates           that diversified           firms are valued            less

than comparable          portfolios    of specialized     firms,2 One exception               is Lament (1996), who

reports that diversified         oil companies      reduced investment                in non-oil divisions when they

faced   decreased         oil revenues.        Lament’s       (1996)       evidence       shows        that     division-level

investment      of diversified     oil companies      depends        on other variables            than the investment

diversification  increases efficiency  of firms that are liquidity-constrained because
management allocates more funds to the more efficient divisions.

of comparable          single-segment         firms,   but his research            is not focused          on trying      to

understand       how     investment      in diversified         firms      is different,     but rather       to provide

evidence on the existence            of liquidity constraints.

          The literature    on investment          policy at the firm level has documented                         a strong

relation between        a firm’s investment        and its cash flow.3 One explanation                    for this result

is that external finance is expensive             relative to internal finance. This can be because                       of

information     asymmetries         and/or because           of agency costs. With this explanation,                  firms

that find it most expensive          to access outside funds finance                   investment        mostly through

their cash flow. Diversification          breaks the link between                 a division’s       cash flow and its

investment      even if the firm finds outside funds expensive.                    A diversified        firm can use the

cash flow from one division             to finance       investment         in another       division.    We therefore

investigate     first whether   the link between             a division’s      cash flow and its investment               is

weaker than the link between a firm’s cash flow and its investment                             and whether          there is

a relation between the investment                of a division          and the cash flow of other divisions.

Finding     such a relation     would be evidence               that the internal          capital   market        plays an

important     role in diversified    firms.

          In our investigation,        we consider            separately       small   and large         divisions.    The

largest     division   of a firm      should      have       an investment          policy     fairly    similar     to the

investment      policy of a stand-alone          firm since it typically         represents       a large part of the

diversified    firm. In contrast,     we would expect the investment                   of the smallest        division to

be less related to its own cash flow               than it would be if the division was a stand-alone

firm, We find strong         evidence         supportive       of this view.        Investment          of the smallest

division does not depend            on the smallest           division’s    cash flow when the firm is highly

diversified,       but depends        significantly     on the cash flow of the other divisions.                       In other

words,       if the other segments             have unexpectedly             high cash flow, this increases                   the

investment          of a small        segment         more       than   if that      small      segment      itself    has     an

unexpectedly          high cash flow. In contrast, the investment                    of the largest division depends

significantly       on its cash flow and seems                    unaffected        by the cash flow of the other

divisions.

           Establishing       that the investment            of small divisions          depends      significantly     on the

cash flow of other divisions             shows that the internal capital market of diversified                         firms is

important.        It does not establish         whether          the role of this capital          market       is positive    or

negative.        We then show, however,               that a division in a diversified              firm may invest less

than its industry because the other divisions are doing poorly or more because                                        its other

divisions      are doing well. Such evidence                 suggests       that the internal         capital     market can

lead firms to underinvest             or overinvest       because        of the performance            of other divisions.

We      explore      three       hypotheses     of the investment                policies      of diversified      firms      and

investigate       to which extent they can explain such results:

           1. The bureaucratic             rigidity     hypothesis.              It is often     argued     that diversified

firms      are     inefficient      because      the     added          layers      of    management            make       them

unresponsive          to new investment           opportunities           at the division          level.   This argument

suggests         that intra-firm    capital allocations          are sticky, in that each division’s               fraction    of

the capital        budget     is insensitive    to its investment           opportunities.         If a firm’s aggregate

cash flow is an important              determinant       of its capital budget,             there should be a relation

between       a division’s       investment     and the firm’s cash flow irrespective                   of why there is a

relation     between         aggregate     cash flow and the capital                     budget.       Consequently,            a

division’s       investment      is related to the cash flow of other divisions.                   With this hypothesis,




                                                             3
one would expect the relation between a division’s investment                          and other divisions’      cash

flow to be weak for those firms where one does not expect investment                             to be sensitive to

cash flow. Firms with low leverage                 and/or highly valued          investment      opportunities    can

borrow at low cost, so that one would not expect their investment                           to be as sensitive        to

cash flow as the investment                 of highly levered        firms and firms with poor investment

opportunities.    We find that the dependence                  of a division’s     investment    on the cash flow

of other     divisions   is much weaker             for firms with valuable            investment     opportunities

and/or low leverage.          Presumably,       bureaucratic       rigidity would become more of an issue

as the firm’s degree          of diversification        grows. Consequently,          we would expect that the

cash flow of other divisions should become a more important determinant                              of a division’s

investment     as the number of segments                increases.     We find that it is indeed so.

           2. The efficient      internal     capital    market      hypothesis.      If management      wants the

firm to grow or if it pursues         positive net present value projects,               one would expect it to

grow divisions     that have good investment                  opportunities   and shrink divisions        that have

poor investment      opportunities.         If outside funds are expensive            because the firm is highly

levered and/or has poor investment                 opportunities,     the firm relies mostly on its cash flow

to finance investment          and one would expect the other divisions to benefit if the largest

division    has poor investment             opportunities      but large cash flow. The smallest            division

should grow especially          if it is in an industry that has good growth opportunities.                We split

the sample according          to above-median           and below-median           investment    opportunities   and

cash flow of the largest segment.                We fail to find evidence           supportive    of the view that

the firm directs more resources               towards       its smallest division     if it is in an industry    with

good growth opportunities.

           3. The free cash flow          hypothesis.       Jensen’s     (1986) free cash flow hypothesis

 implies that firms overinvest         rather than pay out cash flows to investors.                 If a firm’s core

 business     has poor growth         opportunities,       management       will seek growth         opportunities

through      diversification.    One would therefore         expect management            to grow the smallest

division     if the firm’s core business       has poor growth opportunities               but generates         cash

flow that can be re-invested.          This behavior       relies on the existence        of an internal capital

market, With the free cash flow hypothesis,                  shareholders     may well be better off             with

diversification     than without.     If management         could not diversify,        it might invest more in

the core business         that has poorer investment          opportunities     than other segments!             The

direct prediction      of the free cash flow hypothesis          is that the firm will invest more in non-

core segments         if its core business     has poor gro~h           opportunities     but generates         cash

flow that can be invested.           We find that investment           of the smallest     segment        depends

more on the cash flow of the other segments                     when the firm has a low q, which                   is

consistent     with the free cash flow hypothesis               but also with the bureaucracy               rigidity

hypothesis.       To provide more support for the free cash flow hypothesis,                    we should also

find that the smallest          segment   grows more (less) when the largest                 division    has high

(low) cash flow and poor (good) growth opportunities.                     We find that the investment              of

the smallest segment            does not depend        on the cash flow of the other segments                   when

the largest segment has good growth opportunities                  and low cash flow. However, we fail

to find convincing        evidence    that the smallest       segment      grows more when the largest

segment has poor growth opportunities              but high cash flow.

           The paper proceeds        as follows.   In section 2, we present our data. In section 3,

we investigate       the relation    between    investment      of the smallest         (largest)    division    and

cash flow of the largest (smallest)          division and show that our results are not explained

by mismeasurement.           In section 4, we investigate              the bureaucratic       rigidity, the efficient

internal capital market, and the free cash flow hypotheses.                       We conclude         in section 5.




Section     2. The data.

          All our     data   comes        from     COMPUSTAT.            The     Business      Information       file   of

COMPUSTAT             provides    information          for firms   disaggregated         for up to 10 different

industry segments,          FASB-SFAS       No. 14 and SEC Regulation                  S-K require firms to report

segment       information    for fiscal years ending            after December          15, 1977. SFAS No. 14

defines an industry segment            as “A component             of an enterprise      engaged       in providing      a

product     or service, or a group of related products                   or services      primarily    to unaffiliated

customers       (i. e., customers     outside          the enterprise)      for a profit.”     Firms     must     report

information     for segments        that represent         10% or more of the consolidated                sales. The

files have information        available     for some firms for 1976 and 1977, though firms did not

have to report for these years if their fiscal year ends December                          15 or earlier. The files

contain     110,238     segment-year        records for the period from 1976 to 1992. We do not

use the 1976 and 1977 years since reporting for these years is not uniform.                                  Since we

use lagged variables          in our regressions,          omitting     1976 and 1977 means that we can

report    results   for investment        from     1980 onwards,           From    1980 on, we have 96,228

segment-years,        For our analysis, we use the active and research files of COMPUSTAT,

so   that     our   sample       includes        the    firms   that     were     subsequently        delisted     from

COMPUSTAT           because of mergers, bankruptcies,                  liquidations,    and so on.

          Compared       to the other databases            used in the literature,        the one used here has

both strengths      and weaknesses.          In an earlier study measuring              the degree of diversifica-

tion of firms, Ravenscraft         and Scherer (1987) use data from the 1975 Line of Business

sample of the Federal Trade Commission.                       To construct     this sample, the FTC collected

sales and other financial variables            from 471 large corporations.            The data classify sales

using 262 manufactured            product     categories,         but allows firms to aggregate         sales from

different categories        into one in cases where sales in one category are small. Wernerfelt

and Montgome~           (1988),    Lichtenberg           (1992)    and Liebeskind      and Opler        (1992)    use

census data on plants and measured                       diversification     in terms of numbers        of different

SIC codes       for plants.    Lichtenberg       (1992)       also uses the Compustat           SIC File, which

reports   up to 90 SIC codes               per company.           More recently,    Berger     and Ofek     (1995),

Comment       and Jarrell (1995) and Lang and Stulz (1994) use the same database                             we do.

For this study, none of the alternative            databases         would be suitable because they do not

provide    time    series     of investment,        However,         the     COMPUSTAT         database      reports

information     for up to ten segments          only, does not have private firms and, as argued by

Lichtenberg      (1991) and others, is subject to possible reporting biases.

          For each segment,         we collect six variables:              net sales, operating      profit (loss),

depreciation,     capital expenditures,         identifiable       total assets, and SIC code. We exclude

segments      which   do not contain          complete         information     on these    variables.     Doing so

reduces the sample to 52,700 segment-years.                        Throughout      the paper, we focus on the

largest   and smallest        divisions.     This yields        35,488     segment-years       corresponding        to

17,744 firm-years.      An important        difficulty    in using this data is that firms reorganize            their

segments      over time. To prevent           such reorganizations            from affecting    our conclusions,

we eliminate      segment-years       where any of the five ratios used in our analysis                    exceeds

one. The ratios are the current and lagged value of net capital expenditures                               over the

previous yeat’s total assets, sales change over the previous yeat’s sales, cash flow to

total assets,     and finally,    other segments’             cash flow divided      by total assets      of these

segments.       Cash flow is defined         as operating         profit (loss) plus depreciation.      The ratios

we use are dictated to us by data availability.            After excluding      outliers, we end up with

 16,476 firm-year records corresponding             to 3,000 different firms.

           Table 1 provides      descriptive   statistics for our dataset.     In panel A, we report the

number of firms each year per number of segments.                  The number of firms exceeds             900

each year. Throughout          the paper, we emphasize        results for the largest and the smallest

divisions of each firm. Consequently,           in table 1, we provide the means and medians                   of

the ratios we use in the paper for both the largest and smallest divisions.                  Note that the

number of segments           falls over time. Although     some of that fall may be due to changes

in reporting    practices,     most of it is due to the decrease             of firm-level   diversification

during     the 1980s.    Evidence      consistent    with this interpretation      is that studies     using

different databases      document      a decrease in diversification    also.4

           The table does not indicate the industry of the segments.                The SIC code of the

largest segment      is also generally     the main SIC code of a firm. Consequently,                the SIC

code distribution    of the largest segment         is similar to the main SIC code distribution            of

the Compustat       files,    The one-digit     SIC code with      the largest      number     of smallest

segments      is 3 which has 5,794 smallest segment-years.             That SIC code has more than

twice the number of segment-years              than the SIC code with the next largest number of

smallest    segments,    which is code 2, That code has 2,414 segment-years.                     The other

SIC codes have between           1,000 and 2,000 smallest segment-years              except for SIC code

1 which has only 523 smallest            segment-years.     Since we are trying to understand              the

investment     policies of diversified    firms, it is important   for us to include segments           from

all one digit SIC codes. For instance, it could be that firms diversify away from their one

firm diversification also.

Section       3. Investment   policies     of the smallest      and largest    segments.

          In table 2, we report estimates            of investment      equations     for the smallest         and

largest segments.        Although    we do not report these regressions              in the paper, we also

estimated      all our regressions    excluding     the smallest segment when its assets represent

more than 20% of the firm’s total assets. None of our conclusions                     are affected    by using

such a threshold.         In the equations        of table 2, we regress         the ratio of net capital

expenditures       in period t+l     to the segment’s        assets at the end of period t on (a) the

lagged value of that ratio, (b) the growth in sales of the segment from period t-1 to t, (c)

the segment’s        cash flow in t normalized            by the segment’s    total assets at the end of

period t, and (d) the sum of the cash flows of the other segments                     in t normalized       by the

sum of their assets at the end of period t. We cannot                     use a Tobin’s        q proxy for the

segment as an explanatory            variable because        no data is available     to construct        it. Since

the sample period we use corresponds               to years that differ in tax regimes and stages of

the business       cycle, we add a dummy variable for each year to the regression.                         We do

not report these dummy variables in the tables. All regressions                 in the paper use White’s

adjustment       for heteroskedasticity.       In some of the regressions           reported    later, we also

control for industry,

          Panel A uses all the firms in our sample. In all four regressions                    reported     in that

panel, the most significant         variable   is the lagged value of the dependent              variable.     We

find that if we use all the firms that have at least two segments,                         all variables       are

significant     and have a positive        coefficient,     including   the other segments’          cash flow.




                                                     10
However, when we restrict the sample to the firms that have five segments                         or more, the

results     differ   substantially     between     small    and   large   segments.      For     the   smallest

segment,      neither past growth in sales nor the segment’s               cash flow are significant,       but

other segments’        cash flow has a positive significant          coefficient.   Looking      at the size of

the coefficients,      the coefficient      on other segments’      cash flow is twice as large as the

coefficient    on the segment’s         cash flow. From this regression,        there is no evidence       that

proxies for the segment’s            performance   or investment     opportunity      set such as growth of

sales or cash flow matter for the segment’s                  capital expenditures.      In contrast,    for the

largest segment of firms with five segments                or more, the coefficient     on other cash flows

is not significant     and its point estimate shows no economic             significance.      The coefficient

on the segment’s         own cash flow is more than three times the size of the coefficient                  on

the segment’s        cash flow in the comparable            regression    for the smallest       segment   and

has a t-statistic    of 4,30.

          The sample       used to obtain panel A includes            many small firms, so it could be

argued      that these    firms are not informative          for the investment       policies    of the large

diversified     firms which     are the focus of most analyses            of the benefits        and costs of

diversification.     It is also possible      that the data is not as reliable for these firms. This

could be especially         the case for data on the smallest             segment      of small firms. We

therefore     restrict our sample in the following           to firms with sales of at least one billion

dollars in 1977 dollars each year in which they enter the sample. This insures that the

smallest segment         is fairly large. The book value of the assets of the smallest segment

has a mean of $970 million and a median of $339 million. This contrasts                          with the book

value of the assets of the largest segment which has a mean of $4,411                            million and a

median of $1,633 million. This sample has many fewer observations                       than the sample of

panel A, The estimated          equations     are reported in panel B of table 2. For the firms with

five segments          or more, there is no difference          worth reporting       between        the two panels.

For the firms with two segments             or more, the main difference            between the two panels is

that now other segments’               cash flow is no longer significant             for the largest        segment.

Hence, for large firms, the differences              between      the investment          policies of the smallest

and largest segments            seem magnified:         the largest segment          does not seem to invest

more when the other segments               do well, in contrast to the smallest segment.

            The sample in table 2 contains              firms whose segments              are in similar industries

as well as firms whose segments               are in quite different        industries.      It could be, therefore,

that other       segments’      cash    flow is significant       in our regressions            simply     because        it

happens        that for the smallest       segment       the firm has other,         larger segments,           in very

similar industries,       In this case, other segments’          cash flow might be a better proxy for the

smallest       segments’     investment     opportunities       because       the larger other         segment       in a

closely related industry might have more stable cash flows. We therefore                                  estimate    the

regressions       of table 2 using as other segments’             cash flows only the segments               that have

different      2-digit    SIC   codes     from    the    smallest     segment.        These        regressions        are

reproduced       in table 3. The results of table 3 are similar to those of table 2. Therefore,                           it

is difficult    to argue     that our results      are due to a lack of diversification                   within     firms

because        other     segments      are somehow           too similar     to the smallest          segment.        The

approach        used     here   does     not allow      us to take     into      account       vertical    integration,

however.

            The results shown so far make no adjustment                    for industries.     Taking into account

the industry in which a segment             operates      allows us to investigate           whether      a segment’s

investment       relative   to its industry      is greater     or smaller      depending        on how the other

segments        of the diversified      firm are doing. In the regressions                reported     in table 4, we

subtract the industry median from all variables except other segments’                            cash flow.

Industry is defined by the 2-digit SIC code. The results reported                         in table 4 are similar to

those reported       in the earlier tables, but have a slightly different                   interpretation.      These

results indicate that the smallest segment                  invests more relative to its indust~            when the

firm’s other segments         perform better. These results bear on the issue of the efficiency

of investment       within    diversified     firms.    For firms with five            segments       or more,     it is

apparent       that whether      the smallest        segment      in the diversified        firm outperforms           or

underperforms       its industry,     this has no implication            for the segment’s         ability to invest.

Although      our results    are supportive          of the view that the multi-division              firm plays an

active role in transferring       cash flows from some divisions                to others, it is not at all clear

that this activity     is beneficial.        In the next       section,     we therefore        investigate      three

alternative     hypotheses       of the investment           policies     of diversified     firms    and examine

whether they can explain our evidence.

         How robust is the result that the investment                   of small divisions     in diversified     firms

depends       on the cash flow of other divisions?             To examine the robustness               of this result,

we estimated       alternative      specifications      of the regressions         of table 2, used different

sample periods,      and finally estimated           the regressions        using samples         restricted    to one

digit SIC codes, We discuss all these estimates                   in the remainder         of this section but do

not report them in tables since there are so many of them.

        The first alternative        specifications      of the regressions            in table 2 we considered

had contemporaneous           rather than lagged cash flows and both contemporaneous                               and

lagged cash. These alternative              specifications     lead to the same qualitative             conclusions

as the regressions      in table 2. If we do not control for past investment                         and past sales

growth as a way to take into account                 division-specific      effects,    the coefficient       on other

cash flow is much larger than the coefficient                on own cash flow. However,              the coefficient

on other cash flow is only significant            using a one-tailed         test whereas      the coefficient      on




                                                       16
own cash flow is both economically                    and statistically        negligible.     We also estimated            the

regressions        using gross investment             as the dependent           variable.     This seems to increase

the coefficient        of own cash flow as well as the coefficient                             of cash      flow     of other

segments.

           Table     2 provides        estimates      using levels of variables               rather    than difference

variables.      We investigated          difference      versions       of the specification           in table 2. For the

whole      sample,     we find         a strong     effect      of the contemporaneous                  change       in other

divisions’ cash flow on the change in investment.                        The coefficient       on the change in other

divisions’    cash flow is 0.0714 with a t-statistic                 of 2.61. There is no positive                 significant

effect of the change in own cash flow on investment.                            When we focus on firms with five

segments        or more, neither the change              in own cash flow nor the change                       in other cash

flows is significant.         The coefficient       on other cash flows is 0.0403                    with at t-statistic     of

0,96. The coefficient          on own cash flow is -0,0090 with a t-statistic                    of 0.32. The problem

seems to be one of power.                  Differencing         reduces     the number         of observations.          If we

consider       firms   with     four    segments        or      more,     we     almost      double      the     number      of

observations.        For these firms, the coefficient              on changes        in other segments’            cash flow

is 0.0908       with a t-statistic       of 2.17,      In contrast,       the coefficient       on own cash flow is

negative and insignificant.

          The      investment      regressions         reported         seem     stable      through     time,     but    their

significance       falls   some        as the     sample        is divided      in two       equal     subsamples.         We

estimated      the regressions         of table 2 over two subperiods:                 1980-1985         and 1986-1992.

In those regressions,          other cash flow is never             significant     for the largest segment              but is

significant     at least at the 0,10 level for the smallest segment.                         Further, own cash flow is

always highly significant          for the largest segment                but is not significant         for the smallest

segment       if it belongs to a firm with five segments                  or more. Somewhat              surprisingly,     the




                                                           17
explanatory       power of the regressions           is much lower for the smallest          segment       in the

second      subperiod.    In particular,    the R2 of the smallest       segment     regression       when the

smallest     segment      belongs   to a firm with five segments          or more is only 0.06 for the

second subperiod,         which is much lower than the value of 0.22 for the first subperiod.

Rather than dividing the sample into two subperiods,                we also estimated        the regressions

of table 2 year by year, Doing so, the sample size falls dramatically.                  Nevertheless,        for 9

years out of 14, the coefficient           on other cash flows for the firms with five segments                   or

more exceeds        the coefficient       on own cash flow for the smallest          segment.        [n addition,

the coefficient     on own cash flow is never significant            but the coefficient       on other cash

flows is significant      for four years at the 0.10 level for a two-tailed         test.

           We finally considered          the issue of whether     our results are industry-specific             or

induced     by vertical    integration.     We estimated      our regressions       restricting     the sample

each time to all firms in a one digit SIC code. When                     we do that, the sample             sizes

become      quite small. We therefore          estimated     our equations     first using all firms rather

than only the large firms. When we did that, the coefficient                 on other cash flows for firms

with two or more segments           is significant    for the smallest segment       for SIC codes 2, 3, 4

and 6. When we consider only the large firms, the same coefficient                     is significant     for the

SIC codes 1, 2, 4 and 6.




Section     4. What determines        the allocation       of funds within     the multi-division        firm?

           So far, we have seen that the smallest             division   of a multi-division        firm invests

more when the other divisions              have high cash flow, but the investment                of the largest

division    seems insensitive       to the cash flow of the other divisions.            In this section,         we




                                                     18
attempt to understand          whether       the evidence         is consistent        with the bureaucratic     rigidity

hypothesis,     the efficient internal capital market, or the free cash flow hypothesis.

           There     is considerable         evidence        on     the     relation     between     cash     flow     and

investment.     Though       it is not clear why this relation exists, there is enough                      evidence     at

this point to conclude         that this relation is not explained                 by cash flow acting as a proxy

for investment        opportunities.      In this paper,          we do not focus             on understanding         the

relation    between      cash flow and investment                 better.    Rather,       we take this relation        as

given and use it to investigate           the bureaucratic         rigidity hypothesis.

           It is commonly      observed       that firms that cut capital expenditures                 tend to do so

through     across-the-board       cuts in investment             budgets.     This suggests       that the share of

the aggregate        investment     budget accruing to each division is sticky but the size of the

investment      budget      is not. If firms maintain             some       relation    between     the size of the

investment         budget    and   cash      flow,    one    would          then    observe     a relation     between

investment     at the division level and the firm’s cash flow. For small divisions,                         this implies

a relation between          the division’s    investment          and the cash flow of other divisions.                For

large divisions, this relation should exist too. However, the coefficient                          of other cash flow

in the investment       equation should be inversely related to the size of the division relative

to the firm’s size. Hence, this suggests                 a small coefficient            on other cash flow for the

large division and a large coefficient               on other cash flow for the smallest division. At the

same time, one would expect the coefficient                       on own cash flow to be increasing                  in the

relative size of the division.         Our evidence          is consistent         with these implications       of the

bureaucratic       rigidity hypothesis.

           One would        expect the relation        between        cash flow and investment               to be less

tight for firms that have substantial           borrowing         capacity. If the relation between           cash flow

and investment        is driven by the cost of external funds, firms with substantial                        borrowing




                                                        19
 capacity   have a lower cost of external funds.               One would therefore          expect the relation

 between     investment     and other cash flow to be much weaker                     for firms with high debt

 capacity. To investigate       this hypothesis,      we divide the sample between                firms that have

 above-median       leverage     and firms     that     have    below-median          leverage.5     Leverage      is

defined     as total debt divided by total assets. One would expect other cash flow to be

less important     for firms with below-median              leverage.      Table      5 reports    the results    of

regressions     for firms with below-median           leverage    in panel A and for firms with above-

median leverage      in panel B. The results are supportive                of our hypothesis.       In firms with

below-median      leverage,     the cash flow of other segments              has no significant        impact on

the investment     of the smallest       segment,       In contrast,    for the firms with above-median

leverage, the coefficient       on cash flow of other segments              for the investment       equation     of

the smallest     segment      is significant   for both the whole sample               and for the sample         of

firms with at least five divisions.      For the largest division, the coefficient             of the cash flow

of other segments         is negative     but insignificant      for the low leverage             firms with two

segments      or more and negative and significant,            at the 0.10 level, for low leverage firms

with five segments        or more. In contrast,       for the high leverage           firms, the coefficient     on

other segments’     cash flow is positive and marginally                significant     for the firms with two

segments      or more and is positive but insignificant            for the firms with five segments              or

more. Hence, for highly levered firms, there is weak evidence that even the investment

of the largest division depends on the cash flow of the other divisions.

          Lang, Ofek and Stulz (1995) show that leverage                 does not appear to impede the

growth    of firms with      valuable    investment       opportunities.      In their     paper,    investment

opportunities   are measured       by a proxy for Tobin’s q. Hence, one would expect that the

 relation between       other cash flows and investment               should be weak for firms with good

 investment      opportunities.      In table 6, we divide the sample              of high and low leverage

 firms further    according       to whether       our measure       of Tobin’s    q is above the median            or

 below the median.         We use the firm’s market              value divided         by its book value      as a

measure of Tobin’s q (as in Smith and Watts (1992), the precise definition                           is the ratio of

the market value of shares outstanding                    plus total assets       minus book equity        and the

book value of total assets). We would expect the coefficient                       on other cash flows to be

weakest       for firms with low leverage          and a high q and to be strongest           for the firms with

high leverage and a low q. We find in panel A of table 6 that for high q firms, the cash

flow of other segments            does not have a significant          positive coefficient      for the smallest

or the largest segment,           whether the firm is highly diversified           or not, and whether       it has

high leverage      or not. Surprisingly,       the coefficient       on the cash flow of other segments

has a significant      negative      coefficient     for the largest segment,           suggesting    that as the

other segments        do better, the firm effectively           imposes     a tax on the largest         segment.

PaneI B reports results for low q firms, For these firms, the cash flow of other segments

has a significant      coefficient     in the regression       for the smallest        segment    when the firm

has at least two divisions whether             the firm has high or low leverage.             When we turn to

the firms with five divisions        or more in panel B, the same coefficient                has a t-statistic   of

2.14 for the firms with low leverage                 and a t-statistic    of 1.30 for the firms with high

leverage.     It is useful to note, however, that the coefficient            on other segments’         cash flow

for the low q firms with above-median                    leverage,    0.0708,     is about    the same as the

coefficient     on the same         variable   in table 5 for firms with              above-median      leverage,

0.0668, It seems, therefore,          that for low q firms the coefficient          on other segments’        cash

flow   is large and not significantly              different   for low leverage         low q firms     and high

leverage low q firms. This suggests that investment                   opportunities     play an important     role

in the relation           between     a division’s      investment        and     the     cash   flow   of   other   divisions


irrespective      of leverage,


           The    results     in table 6 do not distinguish              between         our various     hypotheses.       The

bureaucratic        rigidity hypothesis       and the efficient internal capital market hypothesis                         both

imply that investment               of one division        is more related          to the cash flow of the other

divisions      when aggregate           investment       is more related to aggregate                   cash flow and the

free cash flow hypothesis              has no implications           for this.

           A firm can have an efficient                 internal     capital market that takes resources                  from

cash rich divisions with poor growth opportunities                         and funnel these resources                towards

divisions with better investment              opportunities.         With the free cash flow hypothesis,                 these

resources        are put to poor           use in that shareholders                     would    be better      off if these

resources        were paid out to them in the form of dividends.                          With the Williamson         version

of the efficient      internal capital markets hypothesis,                  these funds are put to good use, in

that they fund profitable              investments        that would       not take place in specialized                  firms

because of capital markets imperfections.                     The efficient internal capital market therefore

makes the prediction             that firms with large divisions with poor growth opportunities                             will

reallocate       funds      towards    smaller       divisions     with better          investment      opportunities.     We

investigate       this prediction       in two steps.        First, we address             the issue of whether             the

smallest       division     grows more when the largest division                        has high cash flow but poor

investment       opportunities,       Second, we investigate             whether the smallest division receives

more funds if it has greater investment                  opportunities.          In the first test, we use as a proxy

for the investment           opportunities      of the largest division the market-to-book                       ratio of the

whole firm, assuming             that the market-to-book             ratio of the whole firm mostly reflects the

investment       opportunities        of the largest division,          In the second test, we use as a proxy

for a division’s investment            opportunities      the median market-to-book                  ratio of its industry.

Table 7 provides        results for the sample split according              to q and according           to the cash

flow of the largest division.           We divide firms according           tothemedian        cash flow of the

largest segment.        Panel A provides          investment      regressions        for the smallest       segment

depending       on whether the cash flow of the largest segment is high or low. We see that

if Tobin’s q is low, the investment              of the smallest     segment     depends       positively     on the

cash flow of the other segments              irrespective     of whether     the cash flow from the largest

segment is large or small, but the coefficient               on other segments’         cash flow is significant

only for the firms with two segments                or more when the largest              segment        has below-

median        cash flow and for the firms with five segments                    or more when             the largest

segment       has above-median          cash flow, In contrast,       when Tobin’s         q is large, the cash

flow of the other segments              is irrelevant    if the cash flow from the largest             segment       is

below the sample         median,     However,      in the case of firms with five segments                  or more

where    the largest      segment        has above-median          cash flow,        the coefficient       on other

segments’       cash flow is a surprisingly       large 0,10. Panel B provides results for the largest

segment.       We find there       that whether         the firm has a high or a low Tobin’s                  q, the

coefficient    on other cash flow is insignificant           in the largest segment        regressions.       In half

the cases, the regression          coefficient    is negative but insignificant.        Interestingly,     the cash

flow of the largest segment             has a significant     coefficient   in all    cases except when the

largest segment       has below-median           cash flow and the firm has a high q. These results

offer mixed support for the free cash flow hypothesis:                 other cash flows matters more for

low q firms but whether the largest segment has high or low cash flow does not seem to

matter as much as the free cash low arguments                   would suggest.

         Though we do not report the estimates                  here, we also investigated           regressions

for the largest and smallest segments               when these segments              are suffering     losses. We

found   a significant     coefficient     on other segments’          cash flow in the largest             segment

 regression      for firms with two or more segments                but not in the regression          for firms with

 five or more        segments.       For the firms with five or more                 segments,       the regression

 coefficient     is 0.069, which is large compared              to the other values reported           in this paper,

 but the t-statistic        is 1.25. This regression      has only 91 observations,              however,    which is

the lowest sample size of regressions              discussed        in this paper. The coefficients          on other

segments’        cash flow are 0.137           and 0.177 for the smallest              segment       regressions    for

firms with two segments              or more and firms with five segments                      or more, and the t-

statistics     are, respectively,     3.27 and 3.06. Surprisingly,             in these regressions          the own-

segment cash flow has a marginally                significant      coefficient.    This suggests      that losses in

the smallest segment slow down investment                   in that segment. There is no evidence                  that

there is such an effect for the largest segment.

            Our alternative      approach   to testing the efficient internal capital market view is to

investigate      whether       a division grows more if it is in an industry that has better growth

opportunities.      We measure        industry investment          opportunities       as follows. We start from

the 3-digit      SIC code of a segment.         If there are five or more firms which have that 3-digit

SIC code as their main SIC code, we take the median                               market-to-book      of these five

firms. If there are less than five firms in the 3-digit SIC code, we turn to the 2-digit code.

We compute         market-to-book      deciles for each year in the sample. Having computed                        the

market-to-book        deciles, we then use an interactive               dummy variable          in two ways. First,

we divide        industry     market-to-book      each    year     into four      quartiles.    We    then   interact

indicator      variables     for the second,      third and fourth         quartiles    with other      cash flows.

These regressions           are presented      in panel A of Table 8. We find there that the indust~

investment       opportunities    have no significant      effect for the second and third quartile.               For

the fourth      quartile,    they have a negative         effect     that is significant        for firms with five

segments       or more. These results are not consistent               with the efficient internal markets

 Industry growth opportunities are mesured by the median market-to-book           in the division’s
Iindustry. Panel A provides estimates of investment equations for the smallest segment.
1Dummy variable D2 takes a value of 1 if the division’s industry market to book is in 2nd
 quartile of industry market to book ratios that year, and so on. Panel B provides estimates of
 investment equations where the dummy variable Dm takes a value of 1 if the division’s
 indust~ market to book is greater than the median industry market-to-book value in the same
 year. To identify the timing of the observation of the variables, we use periods 1, 0 and -1.
 The dependent variable is the segment’s net capital expenditures in period 1 divided by the
 book value of the segment’s assets at the end of period O. t-statistics are in parentheses.

 to be significantly       positive.     In panel B of Table 8, we estimate                the same regressions

with   an indicator        variable      for industry    investment        opportunities       above         the   sample

 median.      It turns out that whether            an industry     has investment         opportunities        above     or

 below the median has no impact on how much this segment invests.

           As a last piece of evidence supportive                of the bureaucratic       rigidity hypothesis,        we

regressed        the smallest     segment’s         net capital     expenditures         normalized      by segment

assets on the firm’s net capital expenditures                   normalized        by the firm’s book assets. For

firms of five segments         or more, the slope of this regression                is 0.5122 with a t-statistic        of

6.83. The adjusted         R-squared       of this regression       is 0.13. The investment           rate of the firm

therefore       explains   considerably          more of the variation         in the investment             rate of the

smallest      segment      than   the segment’s          cash     flow,    This    suggests       that the smallest

segment grows if the firm grows and stagnates                     otherwise.




Section      5. Conclusion.

           In this paper,     we explored          the divisional     investment       policies     of multi-division

firms. Most of our results are for large diversified                firms, Our results can be summarized

as follows:

          1, For the whole             sample,     the investment         of the smallest         division     depends

significantly     on the cash flow of the other divisions.                In contrast,     the investment          of the

largest division      depends     on its own cash flow but not on the cash flow of the other

divisions.




                                                        32
           2. The dependence               of the smallest        division’s    investment         on the cash flow of

 other divisions         exists only for firms with above-median                 leverage        and firms with below-

 median market to book ratios.

           3. There        is no evidence        that segments             in industries        with    better    investment

 opportunities      receive relatively more of the firm’s cash flow.

           Our evidence          is consistent    with the view that the investment                     policy of divisions

differs from the investment               policy of similar stand-alone          firms. Focusing              on the smallest

segment,       we show that its investment                is driven by the cash flow generated                       by other

segments        rather than by the prospects               of its industry.       The smallest           segment       invests

more than stand-alone               firms in the industry           when the other           segments            do well and

invests     less when        they     do poorly.        This    suggests       that investment            in the smallest

segment       can be quite inefficient,          being too little at times and too large at other times.

Hence, even though our evidence                  is consistent          with a strong role for an internal capital

market     in diversified        firms,    it appears     that this internal          capital     market        may lead to

misallocation      of resources.          One hypothesis        that can explain this result is that divisional

shares of a firm’s investment                budget are sticky, so that when the investment                           budget

falls because        of lower cash flows at the firm level, divisional                          investment         falls also.

Overall, the evidence            provides     support for the bureaucratic               rigidity hypothesis.         We fail

to find evidence          supportive        of the hypothesis            that internal     capital      markets      allocate

funds     efficiently.     Our    evidence       is only       partly    consistent      with     the     free    cash   flow

hypothesis,      in that we do not find              strong       support      for the view            that    management

expands      the smallest        division     more when          the largest      division       has poor investment

opportunities     and high cash flow,
