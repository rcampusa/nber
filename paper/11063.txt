                                          ABSTRACT

Many companies have defined-contribution benefit plans requiring employees to pay the full cost

(before taxes) of more generous health insurance choices. Research has shown that employee

decisions are quite responsive to these arrangements. What is less clear is how the total

compensation package changes when health insurance premiums rise. This paper examines employee

compensation decisions during a three-year period when health insurance premiums were rising

rapidly. The data come from a single large firm with a flexible benefits plan wherein employees

explicitly choose how to allocate compensation between cash wages and other benefits. Under such

an arrangement, higher health insurance premiums must induce changes in the composition of total

compensation–either in lower after-tax wages or in decreased contributions to other benefits. The

results suggest that about two-thirds of the premium increase is financed out of cash wages and the

remaining one-thirds is financed by a reduction in benefits.

INTRODUCTION

       Many companies have redesigned their benefits plans to require employees to pay the full

marginal cost (pre-tax) of more expensive plans. Such ‘fixed subsidy’ schemes have been

discussed for over two decades (Enthoven 1978), but have gotten more attention recently as

health insurance premiums escalate. These schemes are more efficient if workers have different

tastes for health insurance, and research has shown that employee insurance choices are quite

responsive to these arrangements (Buchmueller and Feldstein 1996; Cutler and Reber 1998).

       What is less clear is how the total compensation package changes when health insurance

premiums rise. If the premium elasticity of demand for health insurance is less than one—and

the evidence suggests it is (Cutler, 2002)—then workers will increase expenditures on health

insurance as their share of premiums rises. But if labor supply and demand remain fixed, then

total compensation should not change, just its composition into health insurance, wages, and

other benefits (Smith and Ehrenberg 1983). This paper examines whether employees finance

increased health insurance expenditures by reducing current income (essentially wages) or other

benefits (life insurance, disability insurance, and other benefits) in the short-term.

       We know of no other work looking at the effects of rising health insurance premiums on

the structure of compensation, although there is evidence on the tradeoff between wages and

fringe benefits. Some of this research tries to estimate the substitution between benefits and

wages using data aggregated at the firm or industry level (Woodbury 1983). These estimates are

somewhat limited because the fringes are often allocated as part of a collective bargaining

agreement or a less explicit process based on worker preferences that calls into question the

underlying assumptions of flexible wages and costless mobility (Freeman 1981; Goldstein and

Pauly 1976). Others have tried to estimate the relationship with employee-level data from



                                                                                                  2
multiple firms. The implausible result that wages and benefits do not tradeoff—holding

productivity fixed—are best explained as bias due to unobserved heterogeneity (Smith &

Ehrenberg 1983). Other work exploits natural experiments or time-series variation. Gruber and

Krueger (1990) find that firms facing higher worker’s compensation premiums passed on

approximately 85% of the costs to employees in the form of lower wages. Gruber (1994) finds

that all of the cost increases associated with state and federal mandated maternity benefits in the

late 1970’s and early 1980’s were passed on to the female population in the form of lower wages.

A similar type of cost shifting appears to occur with employee Social Security payroll taxes,

which could be interpreted as reducing wages to finance retirement benefits (Brittain 1971;

Vroman 1974; Hamermesh 1979).

       In this paper, we examine employee compensation decisions during a three-year period

when health insurance premiums were rising rapidly. The data come from a single large firm

with a flexible benefits plan wherein employees explicitly choose how to allocate compensation

between cash wages and other benefits, such as health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and

dental benefits, and these decisions are recorded for each employee. Such cafeteria-style plans

cover 13% of workers in medium and large firms, and the proportion is growing, so they are also

interesting to study in their own right (BLS 1999). Under such an arrangement, higher health

insurance premiums must induce changes in the composition of total compensation–either in

lower after-tax wages or in decreased contributions to other benefits—and we observe these

tradeoffs. The results suggest that about two-thirds of the premium increase is financed out of

cash wages and the remaining one-thirds is financed by a reduction in benefits.

       Our focus is on responses to premium increases because we are interested in the

allocation of compensation to the actual costs faced by the employee. However, there is a




                                                                                                      3
distinction that should be made between the price of insurance and the premium paid. Most

importantly for our purposes, premiums reflect not only the price, but also the expected benefits.

This is a point we will come back to later when we interpret our findings. In the subsequent

section, we describe our data, methods and results. We then discuss their implications for policy.


DATA

        The original data set consists of three years (1989-1991) of earnings and benefit

information for employees under age 65 at a single U.S. company.1 We use data from the three-

year period of 1989-1991—a period characterized by large premium increases well above the

rate of inflation similar to the rapid premium growth situation in 2000-2001—as shown in

Figure 1. Our study focuses on a sample of single employees who signed up for a health

insurance plan2. Families are excluded because we have no information on the health insurance

opportunity sets of spouses, and how those might change over time. These employees are

geographically dispersed across 47 states. The data also include a limited set of demographic

controls such as age and sex. Since we analyze changes in employees’ allocation decisions

relative to the previous years, we restrict our attention to employees with at least two years of

data – resulting in an analysis sample of 7,896 employee-year observations.

        Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the sample. Total compensation averaged

$27,412. Approximately 2.3% of compensation ($623) went towards the purchase of health

insurance, 1.1% ($286) went towards purchase of other benefits within the cafeteria plan and the

remaining compensation was taken as wages. Employees in this firm were given a menu of

  We excluded a small number of single employees (222) who did not enroll in the employers health plan
despite a free catastrophic health plan option.


                                                                                                         4
benefit options. To finance these benefits each employee was also given a completely fungible

credit allocation that depends on salary and job tenure. However, the credit allocation does not

determine expenses on benefits as employees can make additional pre-tax deductions from their

salaries or wages to finance benefits. In addition, employees can also choose to cash –out most of

their credit allocation.

        Table 2 shows the mean, standard deviation and probability of contributing, for each

benefit component of total compensation in 1990. Employees spend their total compensation on

wages, health insurance, dental insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, health care savings

account,3 retirement plan, accident insurance, survivor insurance, and life insurance to cover

dependents. Some of these components are rarely used, and the contributions are small. Rather

than estimate models for all of them, we aggregate these into three broad categories – wage,

health insurance and other benefits. Although the benefits in the “other benefits” category are

diverse, they are conceptually related. Most of them are insurance products that involve forgoing

current consumption (in terms of premiums) for future and uncertain payouts.

        Table 3 shows the enrollment in each year for the different health insurance plans offered

by the firm. The company offers two types of health insurance plans: fee-for-service (FFS) plans

and HMOs. Table 3 shows that within the FFS class, there are three types of plans: a catastrophic

plan with a deductible of 5% of salary, a low option plan with deductibles of $300 for

individuals, and a high option with deductibles of $150. The other plans consist of 43 HMOs

nationwide, with each employee’s available options depending on state of residence and year.

        As with most employers, this company contributes towards the purchase of these plans.

Unlike many employers, however, the amount does not vary by plan choice, but depends only on

                                                                                                          5
the number of beneficiaries. By not contributing more generously to more expensive plans, the

employer makes employees face the full marginal cost of more generous coverage (on a pre-tax

basis). The employer’s subsidy—also known as a defined contribution—is equal to the premium

for the catastrophic plan.

       Table 4 shows the variation in the copremiums—the amount of total premium paid by the

employee—across plans. HMO copremiums rose faster in absolute and percentage terms from

1989 to 1990. From 1990 to 1991, the premiums in the low-deductible FFS plan rose faster than

the HMO premiums, but the HMO premiums still increased substantially. The drop in

enrollment in both types of plans (shown in Table 3) during that period may reflect these

premium increases. Table 4 also shows that HMO premiums vary considerably over this period,

sometimes falling as much as 26% or increasing by 34% year-to-year. We exploit this

considerable variation to identify our models.


METHODS

       We model how the allocation of total compensation varies with an increase in costs of

health insurance for employees. That is, we want to know the responsiveness of each component

of total compensation (wages, health insurance expenditures, other benefits) to changes in health

insurance costs for employees. The key challenge is to measure changes in the cost of health

insurance for employees.

       Ideally, a measure of increase in the cost of health insurance would show the difference

in the costs of obtaining a reference level of utility due to a new vector of health insurance

copremiums. However, the problem with constructing this “true cost index” is that utility is not

measurable. To circumvent this problem, alternative estimates of cost changes calculate the

difference in costs of obtaining a fixed basket of goods at a new vector of prices. Two well-



                                                                                                   6
known indices are the Laspeyres price index, which measures the difference in costs of

purchasing the base year basket of goods, and the Paasche price index, which measures the

difference in costs of purchasing the current year basket of goods. Although these fixed weight

indices are easy to calculate they induce some bias in the measurement of cost changes. Most

importantly, these indices ignore the possibility of substitution among goods due to changes in

relative prices. For example, employees might switch to cheaper health plans in response to

changes in the relative cost of health plans (This is true in our data as shown in Tables 3 and 4).

Thus using base year enrollment in different health plans as weights for the cost index will

overstate the true increase in the cost of health insurance. Fisher (1922) proposed an index that is

the geometric mean of the Laspeyres and Paasche price index. The Fisher price index has much

lower substitution bias and other desirable properties compared to other fixed weight price

indices (Diewert 1976). In particular it closely approximates the true cost index if preferences

are homothetic. Most statistical agencies use the Fisher index to measure changes in prices and

quantities (Boskin et al. 1998), and this is the index we use to measure change in costs. Since

HMO plan options and copremiums vary with the state we create separate indices for each state

in our data. Details of these calculations are available in the technical appendix.

       We estimate separate employee fixed-effects models for each component of total

compensation. Essentially, an employee fixed-effects model controls for employee-specific time

invariant unobservables (such as preferences for insurance) and primarily uses variation in

employee choices and costs over time to identify parameter estimates. Models that ignore these

fixed effects will produce biased estimates if the employee-specific unobservables are correlated

with our explanatory variables. More detail can be found in the technical appendix. To better

illustrate our results we also compute the expenditure elasticity of each benefit category k with




                                                                                                      7
respect to the health insurance cost at the mean benefit allocations in 1989. These elasticities can

be interpreted as the percentage change in wages, health insurance expenditures, or other benefit

expenditures due to a one percent change in the cost of health insurance.

       Our model assumes that cost increases are exogenous—essentially, that premium changes

reflect shocks to insurance supply for this firm. Thus, we would be suspicious if the premiums

were going up at rates much faster than at other firms, perhaps due to experience-rating.

Fortunately, the premium increases we see at this firm mirror economy-wide trends. According

to Congressional Budget Office testimony, 1990 and 1991 witnessed double-digit rates of

premium growth in two of the largest purchasing groups—the Federal Employee Health Benefits

Program, and the California Public Employees Retirement System—as well as for all employers

based on surveys by Hay/Huggins, Foster Higgins, KPMG Peat Marwick, and the Bureau of

Labor Statistics (Antos 1997).


RESULTS

       The estimates for the models for wages, other benefits, and health insurance expenditures

are shown in Table 5. The results show that a $1 increase in the price of health insurance leads

to a 52 cents increase in health insurance expenditures. This 52 cent increase in health insurance

expenditures is financed by a 37 cent reduction in take home wages and a 15 cent reduction in

other benefits. Thus approximately 70% of the increase in health insurance expenditures due to

increase in premiums is financed by wage reductions. Put in elasticity terms (Table 6), each

100% increase in the price of health insurance leads to a 50% increase in health insurance

expenditures, a 1% decrease in take home wages, and a 28% decrease in other benefits.




                                                                                                     8
DISCUSSION

       To help interpret our results, it is useful to first consider what would happen if an

individual did not change health plan choices when faced with fixed compensation. To make

this more concrete, we suppose there is an employee who makes $30,000 a year and is currently

paying $600 annually for health insurance. The individual also allocates $400 to other benefits,

leaving $29,000 for cash wages. We now suppose the cost of that insurance rises 50% to $900.

Since total compensation remains fixed, if this employee continues to purchase insurance, he will

have to reduce either wages or other benefits by $300. If he chooses to split the increase so that

wages decline by $200 and other benefits by $100, then wages will fall by only 0.7% (from

$29,000 to $28,800) whereas spending on other benefits falls by 50% (from $400 to $200).

Thus, the elasticities—which are computed as the percentage increase in expenditures on each

component of compensation divided by the 50% premium increase in our example—would be

1.0 for health insurance expenditures, -0.014 for wages, and 1.0 for other benefits. On the other

hand, if the employee dropped coverage, the corresponding elasticity would –1.0 for health

insurance expenditures. The savings of $600 from not buying health insurance any more could

be allocated to both wages and other benefits, resulting in positive elasticities for those

components of compensation.

       We estimate an elasticity for health insurance expenditures of 0.5, indicating that

employees facing an increase in the price of health insurance respond by lowering their level of

insurance coverage. However, employees do not completely substitute away from health

insurance—in fact, increases in prices lead to increases in health insurance expenditures.

       These increases in expenditures on health insurance are accommodated by reducing both

the take-home income and other benefits such as life insurance, disability insurance, dental




                                                                                                     9
insurance and retirement benefits. Thus, our results suggest that rising health insurance prices not

only reduce resources for current consumption but also lower insurance purchases against a

variety of risks. If health insurance prices continue to rise and individuals continue to reduce

their purchase of health insurance and other insurance products that might leave them vulnerable

to health, mortality, disability and other significant risks in the long run.

          How do employees reduce their expenditures on health insurance in the face of rising

premiums? There are essentially two options. An employee can drop health insurance

completely, or they could switch to a less-generous plan. As an example of the latter, one could

imagine an employer offers two plans: a generous plan that costs $500 annually; and a less

generous plan that costs $375. If both premiums rise 100% in the subsequent year, an employee

who switches from the more generous plan to the less generous one would see their health

insurance expenditures rise from $500 to $750. (This would imply an elasticity of 0.5, as we

observe in our data.) In fact, single employees in this company did leave their health plans for

less costly options. HMO premiums rose 25% between 1989 and 1991, and the premium on the

most generous FFS plan rose by 29% (Table 4). At the same time, enrollment in the most

generous FFS plan fell 9 percentage points (from 43% to 34%), and enrollment in HMOs fell 6

percentage points (from 43% to 37%). Enrollment rates in the catastrophic plan more than

doubled (from 6% to 15%); and enrollment in the high-deductible FFS plan increased from 9%

to 14%.     More detailed analysis by Goldman, Leibowitz, and Robalino (2004) using

multivariate analysis tells a similar story.

        To understand the implications for policy, we need to recognize why premiums are

rising. If premiums rise because administrative costs rise—thereby leaving the underlying value

of the health insurance unchanged—then we would expect fewer people to take up coverage.




                                                                                                   10
However, if premiums rise because of an increase in medical care costs (such as new but

expensive treatments), the story becomes more complicated. On the one hand, insurance may

actually become more valuable if these treatments are very efficacious. However, if these

treatments are not very effective—and only serve to drive up costs—then we would expect

people to switch to less generous plans that might not cover or use these treatments. At the

extreme, people might drop expensive private coverage altogether and rely on ‘safety-net’

options (Cutler, 2002). (In our data, the safety-net is a catastrophic plan that is offered free to

single employees.) Thus—whatever the cause of premium increases—our findings suggest that

single employees do not seem to value them very highly and therefore switch to less generous

plans. This also suggests that as health insurance premiums continue to rise, we will see fewer

employees taking up generous health insurance, including HMOs. One important caveat is

worth noting. In our data, the premiums on the HMO plans were, on average, more than the fee-

for-service alternative. Nationwide this is not the case. In any event, plans that encourage

consumers to reduce waste—such as catastrophic plans or otherwise consumer-driven—would

seem to have the upper hand.

           We create separate indices for each state in our data. If the vector

      (                                   )
Ps ,t = P1, s,t , P2, s,t ,.., Pj ,s ,t ,.., PJ ,s ,t represent the insurance copremiums for each of the J health

plans offered in each state s in year t and the vector

       (                                      )
Qs,t = Q1,s ,t , Q2,s ,t ,.., Q j ,s ,t ,.., QJ ,s ,t represents the percentage of employees enrolled in each of

the J health plans in state s in year t, then the Fisher index for state s in year t is defined as4:

                                  Ps,t .Qs,89     Ps,t .Qs,91
                Fishers ,t =
                                 Ps ,89 .Qs ,89   Ps ,89 .Qs ,91

           Finally we create a price of insurance variable for each state s in year t ( Prices ,t ) by

multiplying the Fisher index for each state-year with the average copremiums in that state in

1989. This essentially rescales the unit-less Fisher index to 1989 copremium dollars in each state

and thus makes our regressions results easy to interpret.

                Prices ,t = Fishers,t * ( Ps,89 .Qs,89 )

           We estimate separate employee fixed-effects models for each component of total

compensation. Essentially, an employee fixed-effects model controls for employee-specific time

invariant unobservables (such as preferences for insurance) and primarily uses variation in

employee choices and prices overtime to identify parameter estimates. Models that ignore these

fixed effects will produce biased estimates if the employee-specific unobservables are correlated

with our explanatory variables. If i and t subscript the employee and year then our empirical

model can be summarized by the following equations:

               Wagei ,t = α iwage + δ wage Pricei ,t + β wage X i ,t + ε iwage
                                                                          ,t

The base year is 1989 and 1991 is the current year


                                                                                                                    22
            Benefiti ,t = α ibenefit + δ benefit Pricei ,t + β benefit X i ,t + ε ibenefit
                                                                                   ,t


            Health Insurancei ,t = α ihealth + δ health Pricei ,t + β health X i ,t + ε ihealth
                                                                                         ,t


            Total Compensationi ,t = Wagei ,t + Benefiti ,t + Health Insurancei ,t ∀i, t

       Where, α k represents the employee fixed effects for benefit k, δ k measures the increase

in expenditures on wage or benefit k due to a one dollar increase in the price of health insurance,

and similarly the vector β k measures the changes in benefit k due to changes in other covariates X

in our model. The last equation is an accounting identity and states that expenditures on wages,

health insurance and other benefits add up to the total compensation of the employee. It, along

with the three previous behavioral equations, also implies that                         δ k = 0 . That is, given that total
                                                                                    k


compensation is fixed, any change in health insurance expenditures due to rising health insurance

prices must be financed entirely by changes in benefits or wages.

       We also compute the expenditure elasticity of each benefit category k with respect to the

health insurance price at the mean benefit allocations in 1989 as follows:

                   δ k * P89
            ξk =      k
                     E89

Here ξ k measures the percentage change in expenditures on benefit k due to a one percent

                                          k
change in the price of health insurance, δ is the parameter estimate from the wage, benefit, and

                                                                                k
health insurance equations, P89 is the mean health insurance price in 1989 and E89 is the mean

expenditure on benefit k in 1989.
