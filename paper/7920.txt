I.       INTRODUCTION


         Theoretical and empirical analysis of effects of tax policy on foreign investment

has focused on the incentive effects of effective marginal tax rates on investment. While

such an emphasis is arguably reasonable for portfolio investment,2 it is questionable for

foreign direct investment (FDI), which is usually associated with strategic choices,

imperfect competition, and the generation of economic rents. In this paper, we build on

recent models of multinational firm decision making to develop a framework for

evaluating effects of tax policy on the strategic choices of multinationals and on national

welfare.

         From a national viewpoint, the conventional result for tax policy (since Musgrave,

1963, 1969, and formalized by Feldstein and Hartman, 1979) is that the domestic

effective marginal tax rate on outbound FDI should be set equal to the effective marginal

tax rate on domestic investment. This would be achieved by taxing the worldwide income

of resident multinational firms, but only allowing firms to deduct foreign taxes in

determining the home tax base, rather than crediting them. This strategy is intended to

achieve production efficiency by equalizing rates of return before home-country taxes, as

opposed to before all taxes.

         However, this result depends on there being a fixed amount of saving to be

divided between domestic investment and outbound FDI. If instead, domestic firms are

able to raise finance on the world market, this link between the effective marginal tax




2
  For portfolio investment, because the investor can be expected to earn a normal rate of return, modeling
the impact of taxation on the required rate of return can reasonably emphasize the effective marginal tax
rate. Since the early application of this concept of tax effects by King and Fullerton (1984), researchers
have extended the analysis to cross-border investment (see, e.g., Alworth, 1988; OECD, 1991; and
Devereux and Pearson, 1995).


1
rates on the two forms of investment is broken. For example, Mintz and Tulkens (1996)

consider the case in which domestic firms have access to the world capital market, but

where there is some revenue requirement from capital income taxes. In this case they

derive Ramsey-type inverse elasticity rules governing the optimal tax rates on each form

of investment; in general the two optimal tax rates are different from each other. In the

absence of a revenue constraint on capital income taxes (if, for example, public goods can

be funded from other sources of tax), then optimally, both tax rates should be zero. But it

is possible that the domestic tax rate is constrained (as implicitly assumed by Feldstein

and Hartmann, 1979), perhaps because it cannot stray too far from the domestic labor

income tax rate without generating tax avoidance possibilities. In this case, and in the

absence of other linkages between the two forms of investment, the optimal tax rate on

outbound FDI remains zero, even if the tax rate on domestic investment is positive.

         In contrast to both of these approaches, the U.S. Treasury has generally advocated

the doctrine of capital-export neutrality, under which worldwide efficiency in the

allocation of capital is maximized by investors paying equivalent taxes on capital income

from marginal investment projects, regardless of the country in which that income is

earned (see, e.g., Musgrave, 1963, 1969; and Horst, 1980). 3 A capital-export-neutral

income tax would tax the worldwide income of resident multinational firms and provide a

full tax credit for taxes paid abroad, as opposed to a deduction.4


3
  Using different frameworks for analysis than ours, Frisch (1990) and Hufbauer (1992) have questioned
the application of capital-export neutrality to the taxation of multinational firms in the presence of portfolio
capital flows and R&D (and other “headquarters” investment). Grubert and Mutti (1995) argue that these
considerations do not overturn the desirability of capital-export neutrality in multinational taxation, though
they abstract from the strategic choices we emphasize (and use a different measure of welfare).
4
    In practice, tax systems do not correspond to either the conventional national approach, or to capital
export neutrality. (For a more detailed description of the U.S. system, see Joint Committee on Taxtation
(1993) and Hines and Hubbard (1995). OECD (1991) and Chennells and Griffith (1997) provide detailed
international comparisons.) First, no country attempts to tax income when it is earned rather than when it is
repatriated. Second, no countries either deduct foreign taxes or give a full credit for foreign taxes in
computing the home country tax on foreign source dividend income. Instead, countries either exempt such
income, or offer a limited credit system under which the rate of foreign tax credit is limited to the home
country domestic corporate tax rate. There have been attempts to explain observed tax systems. For


2
         All of these models are essentially applications of Diamond and Mirrlees (1971),

where the optimal tax system generates production efficiency in the presence of perfect

competition. By contrast, in this paper, we explore optimal tax policy in the presence of

economic rents earned by multinational firms. Economic analysis of the multinational

firm in industrial organization generally stresses economic profits from certain activities

as a reason both for the firm’s existence and for its overseas investment.5 Such models

are typically based on the “OLI” framework of Dunning (1977, 1981), in which

advantages to investment through a multinational firm trace to ownership, locational, or

internalization advantages (see also the review in Caves, 1996; and Markusen, 1995);

more formal models include Horstman and Markusen (1992) and Motta (1992).

         In such settings, key decisions about the location of investment (as opposed to

marginal expansion of existing investment) are driven by a comparison of after-tax profit

among discrete choices. Two factors are important: first, economic rents (from

intangibles, cost advantages, or location-specific advantages) constitute at least part of

the return on potential projects; and second, decisions involve choices among mutually

exclusive locations. There is evidence to suggest that both elements characterize many

FDI decisions for multinational firms (see, for example, the review in Caves, 1996). In

the presence of these two factors, the relevant concept of “tax” is the fraction of expected

profit absorbed by taxation in each choice. Hence the location decision is affected by the

effective average tax rate on profit.6 An emerging body of empirical work has isolated

economically meaningful effects of effective average tax rate measures (or related



example, Bruce (1992) and Gordon (1992) analyze the case of a Stackelberg leader in tax-setting, which by
crediting foreign taxes can induce a higher tax rate abroad and so facilitate enforcement of its own source-
based taxes.

public economics and industrial organization.
6
  Other examples in industrial organization – including R&D, constraints on investment imposed by costly
external financing of projects, or entrepreneurial selection – also suggest the importance of the effective
average tax rate for studying tax policy; see the discussion in Devereux and Griffith (1998a).

proxies for average rates of taxation) on location and investment decisions by

multinational firms.7

         We build on recent models of multinational firm decision making to develop a

simple analytical framework for considering the impact of effective marginal tax rates

and effective average tax rates on the strategic choices (e.g., location and production) of

multinationals and on national welfare. We do so by applying a general model of the

international tax system to an adapted version of the model of Horstman and Markusen

(1992), in which two firms resident in different countries (one of which is the home

country) compete in a third country, and must decide whether to locate at home or in the

third country.

         In order to focus on determinants of outbound investment by multinational firms,

we first solve the model in a simplified framework, abstracting from taxes outside the

home country. After documenting conditions under which effective average tax rates

influence strategic choices, we examine the impact of home-country tax policies on the

strategic choices of the multinationals. We analyze two regimes: one in which overseas

earnings are taxed only on a cash flow basis when repatriated (analogous to “deferral” for

active foreign-source income under current U.S. law for investments financed out of

retained earnings), and one in which overseas earnings are taxed on an accrual basis. We

show that cash flow taxation - implying a zero effective marginal tax rate - generally

results in higher pre-tax rents for the nation compared to accrual income taxation.

         In the more general model, we consider both the choice between cash flow and

accrual taxation and the choice between a deduction and a foreign-tax-credit regime. The

results of the more general model are less clear-cut, and depend on the rate of tax levied

7
   See, for example, Devereux and Griffith (1998b) for an empirical study using a measure of the effective
average tax rate, defined in Devereux and Griffith (1998a). Studies using as a measure of the average tax
rate defined as current tax liability as a proportion of current income include Collins and Shackelford
(1995), Grubert and Mutti (1996), and Altshuler, Grubert, and Newlon (1997).


4
outside the home country. At low levels of foreign tax, we demonstrate that a tax regime

with deferral and a limited foreign tax credit – as is common practice in a number of

countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom – generally results in

higher national welfare than accrual taxation of foreign-source income with a deduction

for foreign taxes, as suggested by Feldstein and Hartman (1979).8 However, at high levels

of foreign taxation, so much of the economic rent from the investment is captured by the

foreign government that the ranking of these two alternative forms of tax is reversed.

          A small number of other papers take a similar approach to modeling the impact of

taxes on the strategic choices of multinationals, although they differ from the approach in

this paper. The closest is Levinsohn and Slemrod (1993), who also analyze the home

country’s optimal taxation of home and foreign production in the presence of imperfect

competition among multinational duopolists. However, there are several important

differences. First, in our model firms make a discrete choice between producing at home

or abroad, which generates an important role for the effective average tax rate. By

contrast, Levinsohn and Slemrod assume that each firm produces in both locations, and

chooses only the split of production between the two. Second, we model explicitly the

taxation of domestic and foreign source capital income, paying particular attention, for

example, to whether any foreign tax is creditable or deductible. By contrast again,

Levinsohn and Slemrod model output taxes and tariffs; partly as a result, their conclusion

that "the optimal tax rate on foreign source income does not depend on the rate imposed

in the host country" is starkly different from our results.

          Other papers focus on optimal taxation in the host country. For example, Janeba

(1996) analyzes a model in which a multinational firm and a domestic firm both produce

in the same country; the strategic interaction between them is only through output, rather


8
    The basic insight of the Feldstein-Hartman result can also be found in Musgrave (1963,1969).

than through choice of the location or production. Janeba (1998) extends the Brander-

Spencer (1986) strategic trade policy model to allow for mobile firms and finds that

mobility of firms overturns the incentive to subsidize exports. However, this depends on

a uniform tax being levied in the host country; implying that foreign firms locating in a

country would also receive any subsidy paid. Haufler and Wooton (1997) analyze a

model in which two countries compete to attract a single monopolist.

          This paper is organized as follows. In section II, we develop a model of a home

firm and a foreign firm each choosing among three strategies: (A) do not serve the

foreign market; (B) export to the foreign market; and (C) produce abroad to serve foreign

market (entailing FDI). We model the domestic tax system, but assume that there is no

foreign tax. Section III presents the more general model. Section IV concludes and

considers the results of the model in evaluating conventional norms for international tax

policy.




II.       A SIMPLIFIED MODEL OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN THE

          PRESENCE OF CAPITAL INCOME TAXES



          In what follows, we adapt the model of Horstmann and Markusen (1992), who

study the role of fixed costs and transport costs in the strategic choices of multinationals,

in order to analyze trade flows, foreign direct investment, and market structure. We

consider the choice of a home-country multinational of whether to supply a market in a

foreign country, and if so, whether to do so by producing at home or abroad. Choosing to

produce abroad involves a fixed cost of F. In the more general model of section III, we

allow for a tax levied by the home country on corporate income generated both at home



6
and abroad, and a tax levied by the foreign country on outward investment. However, in

this section we present a simplified and more tractable version of the general model, in

which the foreign country does not levy a tax. We set up the model in several stages

below.



         A.       Defining Strategic Choices

         We examine the case of a single firm resident in the home country, H, considering

whether and how to sell good X in a foreign country, G.9 The firm faces potential

competition in G from an (identical) single “foreign” firm resident in a third country, E,

which in principle sells a differentiated good, Y. However, to fix ideas, we begin by

restricting the two goods to be identical; this simplification has no impact on the

qualitative results. In this case, X denotes the output of the home firm, and Y denotes the

output of the foreign firm. There are two periods, and production and sales to the foreign

market both take place in the second period. Where investment occurs, it takes place in

the first period. At the end of the second period, the firm closes down and pays all

remaining cash to shareholders as dividends. The firm’s discount rate is r; this is simply

the rate of return in the international capital market. One can assume, for example, that

shareholders are resident in H, but have free access to world markets.

         Each firm considers the three strategies:

    (A): do not serve the foreign market;

    (B): export to the foreign market; and

    (C): produce abroad to serve the foreign market.

         The demand for the final good in G is given by an inverse demand curve:


9
   For an excellent survey of models of “strategic trade policy” in industrial organization and international
trade, see Brander (1995). Models of an international Cournot duopoly competing in a third market (akin
to the structure we use here) trace their roots to Brander and Spencer (1985).

                                    pij = a - b ( Xij + Yij )                                  (1)


where p is the price of the final good. Prices and quantities are indexed by (i,j), where i =

A,B,C represents the choice of the home firm and j=A,B,C represents the choice of the

foreign firm.

        Strategic choice B incurs transport costs to G of s per unit of exports. In general,

strategic choices B and C require new investment in the first period of K’ij. It is useful to

express this is as a second-period value of Kij = (1+r)K’ij. We further make the

simplifying assumption of a fixed capital-output ratio, so that, for example, Kij = mXij..

There is also a fixed cost associated with strategic choice C in the first period of F’.

Again, it is useful to express this in second-period terms as F = (1+r)F’. Investment in

strategic choice C is undertaken by a wholly-owned affiliate in G. The investment can be

financed either through new equity from the parent firm, or a reduction in dividends paid

by an existing affiliate to its parent in the first period.

        In the absence of tax, the profit levels of the alternative strategies for the home

firm, Vij* , and the foreign firm, Z ij* , expressed in second-period values, are therefore:

Strategy A:

                                      V Aj* = 0       Z iA* = 0                                 (2a)

Strategy B:

                  VBj* = ( pBj − s )X Bj − K Bj        Z iB* = ( piB − s )YiB − K iB
                                                                                                (2b)

                       = ( pBj − s − m )X Bj               = ( piB − s − m )YiB




Strategy C:

                VCj* = pCj X Cj − (K Cj + F )          Z iC* = piCYiC − (K iC + F )
                                                                                                (2c)

                    = ( pCj − m )X Cj − F                   = ( piC − m )YiC − F



8
        Assuming Cournot competition between the two firms in the foreign market and

substituting the demand function (1) into the expressions for profit, it is straightforward

to derive for each pair of strategic choices the optimal level of output for each firm.

Substituting back into the expressions for profit yields the post-tax level of profit for each

combination of strategies, and hence the market structure defined by the Nash equilibria.

We follow this approach below. However, before doing so, it is necessary to define the

tax systems to be analyzed.



        B.       Introducing Taxation

        We consider a standard corporation tax levied in the home country (at a statutory

tax rate of t). The present value of depreciation allowances per unit of capital

expenditure, Kij, is denoted by A. We assume that transport costs are fully deductible.

Hence the post-tax level of profit from strategy B is:

                                VBj = (1 − t )( p Bj − s ) X Bj − (1 − A) K Bj
                                    = (1 − t )( pBj − s − γm )X Bj ,

(3a)

             (1− A)
where γ =            is a factor which reflects the generosity of the provision for
              (1−t )

depreciation. In general, γ ≥ 1 ;10 γ = 1 is the case of cash flow taxation.

        The taxation of outbound investment is more complex, depending on whether the

home country taxes profits earned abroad on accrual or on repatriation to the home

country. In the former case -- and in the absence of tax in the foreign country -- the tax

system is identical to that for domestic investment in the home country. However, in the

latter case, the home country taxes the repatriation of dividends rather than foreign




9
profits. Again in the absence of foreign taxes, the home country tax rate applied to these

dividends is simply t. In the second period, the foreign affiliate closes down and pays all

its remaining value to the parent firm in the form of dividends. This payment is therefore

taxed at rate t. 11

         However, the value of allowances depends on how the investment is financed.

Suppose first that it is financed by retaining earnings in the subsidiary in the first period.

Then repatriated dividends in the first period fall by the cost of the investment, and the

tax falls by a proportion t of this amount. Such tax treatment is akin to cash flow taxation

with new investment receiving a full allowance. By contrast, if the investment is financed

by new equity, then no tax relief can be claimed in the first period. However, we assume

that the initial equity capital investment can be repaid to the parent in the second period

without incurring the tax on dividends; the net present value of this tax relief is t/(1+r).

Denoting the net present value of the relief for investment to be α :

                      α                       Retained earnings                      New equity

                  Deferral                               t                              t/(1+r)

               Non-deferral                             A                                  A



                          (1− α)
         Defining η =             , we can express the post-tax value of the strategy C to be
                          (1− t )

written as:

  Although it can take values less than 1.
11
  An alternative characterization of the “rent” we describe is a “royalty” to compensate the parent firm for
some home-country investment in, say, advertising or R&D. In that characterization, the rent should be
repatriated as a royalty, and we should then confine our attention to the normal return.
We do not believe this characterization is useful for two reasons. First, it is by no means clear in practice
that overseas rents are created only by domestic investments (i.e., Pepsi may have to advertise in Korea to
create brand loyalty there). In the context of our analytical example, suppose the parent firm is deciding
between cases of producing at home for export (with rent R1 ) and producing abroad (with rent R2). If R2 >
R1 , it is due to exploiting conditions in the host country. Second, even if the rent were “domestic,” our
inquiry regards the optimal taxation of foreign-source income (in our model), not current tax practice.

                           VCj = (1 − t ) pCj X Cj − (1 − α ) K Cj − (1 − αˆ ) F
                                                                                                      (3b)
                               = (1 − t )( pCj − ηm )X Cj − (1 − t )ηˆF .

        This formulation allows the fixed cost F to take the form of (i) depreciable capital

investment, in which case α̂ = α and η̂ = η ; or (ii) a deductible expense, in which case

ˆ = t and η̂ = 1 unless the tax system is deferral and the investment is financed by new
α

equity, in which case, α̂ = α and η̂ = η .



        C.        Measuring Welfare

        We are concerned with the choice of tax system by the government of the home

country, H. In order to analyze this choice we use a simple measure of the welfare of the

home country: the pre-tax value of the investment, Vij* .12 In essence, this is a measure of

the impact on the wealth of the country undertaking the investment project, without any

consideration of the distribution between the government and the private sector. 13

        Following Feldstein and Hartman (1979), we generally assume that the domestic

tax system, here summarized by t and A, is given and we consider the optimal taxation of

outbound investment conditional on this domestic tax system. In doing so, we do not

impose any revenue requirements. Of course, there are alternative approaches: for

example, to choose all the elements of the tax system jointly subject to a revenue

requirement. However, the focus of this paper is not on the optimal structure of the

corporation tax itself, but on the taxation of outbound investment given a domestic tax

system. In practice, it is hard to believe that there is a serious revenue constraint applying

to tax raised from outbound investment per se because such tax revenues are usually very

small relative to total tax revenues.

12
 In the general case in which the foreign country levies tax, this is instead defined net of foreign taxes.
13
 That is, we assume that the marginal cost of public funds is unity.



11
D.      Determining Output and Profit for Each Combination of Strategies

        We assume that the two firms play Cournot; that is, each firm chooses its optimal

output level conditional on the strategy and the level of output of the other firm. It does

so by maximizing the profit of the strategy -- Vij and Z*ij, respectively, for the home and

foreign firm --subject to the demand equation (1). Thus, for any output level chosen by

the foreign firm, Yij, the home firm sets Xij as:

                                             X Aj = 0 ,                                   (4a)

                                            a − s − γm − bYBj                             (4b)
                                X Bj =                            ,
                                                    2b
and
                                             a − ηm − bYCj                                (4c)
                                    X Cj =                   .
                                                    2b


Similarly, the foreign firm sets:

                                             YiA = 0 ,                                    (5a)

                                            a − s − m − bX iB                             (5b)
                                    YiB =                     ,
                                                    2b
and
                                             a − m − bX iC                                (5c)
                                     YiC =                 .
                                                  2b



        For further simplicity, we assume values of the parameters which rule out either

firm choosing strategy A. Combining these output levels conditional on the strategic

choice generates the output levels summarized in Table 1, for each strategic choice.

        The output terms reflect the severity of each tax system. Thus, for example, if the

home country H offers low allowances on domestic investment, then A is low and γ is


12
relatively high. This configuration of parameters implies a higher marginal effective tax

rate faced by the home firm on domestic investment, and hence a lower optimal level of

output, given strategic choice B. By contrast, however, because the home firm chooses a

lower level of output in this case, the foreign firm chooses a higher level of output – that

is, a higher γ implies a higher output of the foreign firm, conditional on the home firm’s

choosing strategy B. The corresponding tax parameter when the home firm chooses

strategy C is η, which works in exactly the same way.

         Substituting the output values reported in Table 1 into the demand equation (1)

and the expressions for the value of each strategy for each firm in (2) yields the pairs of

values of V and Z* corresponding to each pair of strategies chosen by the two firms.

These are summarized in Table 2.

E.       Some Implications of the Model

         Before investigating the Nash equilibria, we consider four implications for firm

decisions of introducing a home country tax.

         1. The strategic choice depends on the effective average tax rate, rather than on

the effective marginal tax rate. In the absence of tax the optimal strategy (conditional on

a strategy of the foreign firm) is to choose the strategy, i = A, B, or C, which generates

the highest pre-tax net present value, V ij* . In the presence of tax, the optimal strategy is

that which generates the highest post-tax net present value, Vij . A natural definition of

the effective average tax rate (EATR) in this setting is the proportion of the pre-tax value

captured in tax:

                                                      Vij* − Vij                                       (6)
                                EATRij = Tij =                     .
                                                         Vij*

Using this definition, the strategic choice in the presence of tax can be expressed as:

choose the strategy with the highest Vij* (1-Tij ). For the strategic choice B, the EATR is


14
                                                                  2
                                                      ( 1 − t ) X Cj                         (7)
                             EATR Bj = TBj = 1 −             *2
                                                                       .
                                                           X Cj

                                                       *
          It is straightforward to show that γ ≥ 1 ⇒ X Bj ≥ X Bj ⇒ TBj ≥ t . That is, a cash

flow tax ( A = t ⇒ γ = 1 ) yields an EATR equal to the statutory rate. A less generous

depreciation provision results in the EATR being higher than the statutory rate. For the

strategic choice C,


                          EATRCj = TCj = 1 −
                                                       (
                                               (1 − t ) bX CC

                                                              − ηˆF
                                                                    .
                                                                           )                 (8)
                                                  ( bX CC − F
                                                         *2
                                                                  )
                                   *
As in the previous case, η ≥ 1 ⇒ X Cj ≥ X Cj ⇒ TCj ≥ t , whether or not the fixed cost is

immediately deducted or depreciated as an investment.

          In general, this measure of the EATR has the property that for a very profitable

investment, as Vij* → ∞ then EATRij → t. At the other extreme, as Vij* → 0 then EATRij

→ ∞ .14 As the next two implications make clear, there are two special cases worth

noting.

          2. A tax system with deferral, and investment financed by retained earnings, (i.e.,

α = t) has TCj =t. This follows immediately from the previous analysis. The implication

is that in this case, the tax system for outbound investment is in effect a cash flow tax,

and thus generates an EATR equal to the statutory rate (and an effective marginal tax rate

of zero).

          3. Conditional on the strategic choice, tax does not affect investment decisions if

γ = 1 and η = 1 . If γ = 1 and η = 1 , output levels – conditional on the strategic choice -

are the same as in the absence of tax. This reflects the well-known result that a cash-flow

tax (or equivalent) results in all cash flows -- and hence the net present value of the




15
investment -- being reduced in the same proportion (i.e., t). This implies that the effective

marginal tax rate is zero; an investment with a zero net present value is not taxed in

present value terms. In addition, γ = 1 and η = 1 implies that the EATR=t for strategies B

and C, which in turn implies the tax does not affect the strategic choice.

          4. A tax on accrual (i.e., in the absence of deferral) imposed by the home

country will not affect the strategic choice if: (i) the income stream is independent of tax

(ii) there is a residence-based comprehensive income tax and (iii) the tax depreciation

allowance is equal to the net present value of the income stream. This is simply an

application of Samuelson’s (1964) invariance proposition, and so will not be proved here.

An implication is that, if all countries introduced such a tax, there would be no distortion

to competition between multinationals in purchasing assets. However, note that

Samuelson’s depreciation allowance is required for this to be true, contrary to the claim

made by Slemrod (1995).




F.       Equilibrium of the Model

         To solve the model, we first define combinations of strategies as (i,j), where i is

the choice of the home firm and j is the choice of the foreign firm. Conditional on the

choice made by one firm, the other firm will choose its strategy to generate the highest

post-tax profit. Using the values in Table 2, this can be expressed in terms of the size of

the fixed cost, F. First, we economize on parameters by defining some summary terms.

Let:




14
   For this reason, in their empirical formulation of the EATR, Devereux and Griffith (1998a) scale the
difference between pre-tax and post-tax value by the pre-tax net present value gross of the fixed cost, F.


16
                 ϕ1 = s [a − s − m(2 − η )]
                 ϕ 2 = s [a − m(2 − γ )]
                                                                                              (10a)
                 ϕ 3 = s (a − s ) + m [a (γ − η ) + s (1 − 2γ ) + m{η (η − 1) − γ (γ − 1)}]
                 ϕ 4 = as + m [a (γ − η ) + s(1 − γ − η ) + m{η (η − 1) − γ (γ − 1)}]

        We can then set out the best responses of each agent as follows:

 Then foreign                                         If home firm chooses:
 firm chooses:
                                         B                                               C
      B iff:                              4                                               4
                                      F > ϕ2                                          F > ϕ1
                                         9b                                              9b




        To interpret these conditions, it is useful to begin with the case of no tax, which is

equivalent in strategic terms to setting γ = η = ηˆ = 1 . This implies that

                 ϕ~1 = ϕ~3 = a − s − m, and
                                                                                              (10b)
                 ϕ~2 = ϕ~4 = a − m.

That is, the cut-off points are the same for both firms. That is, for values of the fixed cost
         ~ / 9b , both firms would choose strategy B. We denote this pair of strategic
F above 4ϕ 2

choices as (B,B) where the first element indicates the choice of the home firm and the
                                                                          ~ / 9b , both
second the choice of the foreign firm. Conversely, for values of F below 4ϕ 1

firms would choose strategy C – i.e., (C,C). For values of F such that
 ~ / 9b < F < 4ϕ
4ϕ             ~ / 9b , one firm would choose strategy B and the other strategy C. This
   1             2

implies two possible outcomes, (B,C) and (C,B).




17
        Next consider the case of an arbitrary value of the home depreciation allowances,

A < t, such that γ > 1 . However, suppose that outbound investment is taxed on a cash

flow basis, so that η = ηˆ = 1 . In this case, the values of the cut-off points become:

                ϕ1 = s[a − s − m]
                ϕ 2 = s[a − m(2 − γ )]
                                                                                          (10c)
                ϕ 3 = s (a − s ) + m[(a − mγ )(γ − 1) + s(1 − 2γ )]
                ϕ 4 = as + m[(a − mγ )(γ − 1) − sγ ].

It is straightforward to show that ϕ 2 > ϕ 1 , ϕ 4 > ϕ 2 , and ϕ 3 > ϕ 1 , which introduces new

strategic combinations. For example, values of F such that 4ϕ 1 / 9b < F < 4ϕ 3 / 9b and

4ϕ / 9b < F < 4ϕ 4 / 9b would result in the pair of strategic choices (C,B).

        Finally, for the same arbitrary value of γ > 1 we can consider how the cut-off

points change as the tax treatment of outbound investment becomes less generous -- as η

increases. ϕ 2 is unaffected by changes in η ; this determines the strategic choice of the

foreign firm conditional on the home firm choosing strategy B, and is therefore

unaffected by the tax treatment of its outbound investment. However, ϕ1 is increasing in

η : conditional on the home firm choosing C, a higher η ; implies that the home firm will

choose lower output which makes it more likely that the foreign firm chooses C. By

contrast, ϕ 2 and ϕ 4 are both decreasing in η . That is, whichever strategy chosen by the

foreign firm, a higher η will reduce the post-tax profits of C for the home firm, and

therefore make it more likely that that the home firm will choose B.

        These strategic choices are summarized in Figure 1 for a range of values of η ≥ 1 .

Note that ϕ 1 = ϕ 2 and ϕ 3 = ϕ 4 at η = γ + s / m . As η increases above 1, the home firm

becomes less likely to produce abroad, which reduces the size of the (C,B) regions, but

increases the size of the (B,C) regions.

          G.      Welfare Implications

          Given the definition of welfare above, it can be summarized under each

combination of strategies as follows:

                           Summary of Welfare in Simplified Model

Home Firm                                         Foreign Firm Chooses

 Chooses                              B                                                   C

     B               WBB = {bX BB + (γ − 1) m}X BB                    W BC = {bX BC + ( γ − 1 ) m}X BC


     C             WCB = {bX CB + (η − 1) m}X CB − F               WCC = {bX CC + ( η − 1 )m }X CC − F




Given these expressions, it is possible to identify the welfare-maximizing regime for

alternative values of F, conditional on the choice of the foreign firm. To do this, it is

useful to define two new parameters:

                  χ3 =
                         m
                         3b
                            {                            {                         }}
                            a( η − γ ) + 2s( γ − 1 ) + m 3( η − γ ) − 2( η 2 − γ 2 )
                                                                                                (11)
                  χ4 =
                         m
                         3b
                            {                                {
                            a( η − γ ) + s( γ + η − 2 ) + m 3( η − γ ) − 2( η 2 − γ 2 )   }}
Using these parameters, welfare is highest if and only if the home firm chooses its

strategy in the following way:

 Then home                                             If foreign firm chooses:
 firm chooses:
                                          B                                                  C
         B iff:                         4                                                  4
                                     F > ϕ4 + χ 4                                       F > ϕ3 + χ3
                                        9b                                                 9b



          These critical values of F are similar to the private critical values for the home

firm. There are two differences, however. First, the firm’s critical value is divided by the

tax parameter η̂ . Second, each critical value has an additional term: one of the



19
parameters defined in (11). Given these critical values and η̂ = 1 , welfare is maximized if

χ 3 = χ 4 = 0 ; that is, where the choice of the home firm is that required for maximizing

welfare. Exploring the properties of these two parameters yields a number of

observations.

        1. The only fully optimal tax system is γ = η = 1 -- i.e., a cash flow tax or

equivalent for both domestic and outbound investment. γ = η = 1 implies

χ 3 = χ 4 = 0 .This is not surprising; a cash flow tax generates a zero effective marginal tax

rate and an effective average tax rate of t. Because all investment is treated in the same

way, the tax does not distort either the strategic choice or the level of investment

conditional on each strategic choice. However, there are two other implications of this

observation.

        2. Setting γ = η > 1 -- i.e., a residence based tax on accrual --results in the home

firm’s choosing strategy B for more values of F than is optimal, and hence reduces

welfare relative to no tax or relative to a cash flow tax for both domestic and outbound

investment. γ = η > 1 implies χ~3 > 0 and χ~4 > 0 . Because both of these values are

positive, the critical values of F for maximizing welfare are higher than those for

maximizing profit. Values of η̂ > 1 would increase the difference between the two sets of

critical values. This implies that for a range of values of F, the home firm will choose

strategy B when welfare would be higher if it chose strategy C.

        3. Setting γ > 1 and η = 1 -- i.e., a standard corporation tax for domestic

investment and, in effect, a cash flow tax for outbound investment -- results in the home

firm’s choosing strategy C for more values of F than is optimal, and hence reduces

welfare relative to no tax or a relative to cash flow tax for both domestic and outbound

investment. η = 1 and γ > 1 implies χ~3 < 0 and χ~4 < 0 . Recall also that in this case η̂ = 1 .



20
Hence the critical values of F for maximizing welfare are lower than those for

maximizing profit. This implies that, for a range of values of F, the home firm would

choose strategy C when strategy B would be optimal.

        These last two observations imply that, conditional on γ > 1 and on the strategic

choice of the foreign firm, the optimal choice of η would be between 1 and γ .

However, as the first observation implies, this optimal choice of η depends on the

strategic choice of the foreign firm. If the foreign firm chooses B, the government could

choose a value of η to set χ 4 = 0 ; if the foreign firm chooses C, the government could

choose a value of η to set χ 3 = 0 . These require different values of η .

        Further, even if the government could accomplish this, the choice of η will not be

consistent with the value which, conditional on the strategic choice of the home firm,

induces the optimal level of investment. For example, suppose that we are in regime

(C,C). Then, conditional on this regime, the optimal choice of η is given by solving

∂Wcc / ∂η = 0 , which results in the optimal value being η = ( 5m − a ) / 4 m . The equivalent

value for regime (C,B) is η = ( 5m − a − s ) / 4 m .

        To summarize, only a cash flow tax or equivalent for both domestic and outbound

investment would result in welfare-maximizing choices by home firm. If the domestic tax

system is such that A < t, as is commonly the case, then there is no way of taxing

outbound investment which does not distort at least one strategic choice; even if this were

avoided, there will remain a distortion to the level of investment undertaken.

        In the next section, we compare the performance of the principal tax systems

observed in practice and advocated in the literature, in the more realistic setting in which

the foreign country taxes activity taking place within its jurisdiction. We also generalize

the model to allow for differentiated goods.




21
III.     TAX POLICY IN A MORE GENERAL MODEL

         The most important simplification of the model in the previous section is that it

assumed that tax is levied only in the home country. While this permits a simple analysis

of the strategic choices facing each firm -- and of the role of the home tax in affecting

those choices -- foreign taxation is a significant factor in determining home welfare. The

reason is straightforward: if the foreign country captures part of the economic rent

generated by the home firm, then that part of the economic rent does not accrue to

domestic residents and therefore cannot contribute to welfare.

         In this section, we therefore investigate a more general model by including tax

outside the home country, H. To avoid the introduction of the foreign tax having a direct

effect on the strategic choice of the foreign firm, we assume that the same tax is levied on

profits from all production of the foreign firm, irrespective of where its production takes

place.

         In this section, we begin by describing the tax systems, and hence the values of

post-tax profit and welfare, in more detail. We then proceed in the same way as in section

II. First, we find the optimal levels of output and the corresponding levels of profit of

each firm conditional on each possible combination of strategic choices (i,j). Then, to

solve for the equilibrium outcome of the game between the two firms, we evaluate

strategies first from the foreign firm’s perspective and then from the home firm’s

perspective. We again simplify the model by assuming that at least one of strategy B and

C yields a positive post-tax profit for each firm. This means that we can rule out strategy

A entirely, again leaving only four possible combinations.

         However, we now introduce differentiated products, such that X and Y are no

longer perfect substitutes. The inverse demand equations therefore now become



22
                          p ij = a − bX ij − cYij ,                                 (12a)

and                      q ij = a − bYij − cX ij ,                                  (12b)

where pij is the price of Xij and q ij is the price of Yij, for all pairs of strategies i and j.




        A.      Forms of Taxation

        As before, we analyze standard corporation taxes in each location. The domestic

tax system and the post-tax value of the investment under strategy B for the home firm is

exactly as described in section II. However, it is now necessary to consider the

interaction of the tax treatment by the home country, H, of income derived from

outbound investment, and the tax treatment of the foreign country, G, of the same

income. In the presence of taxation in all countries, the total tax paid by the home firm is

given by:

                                   Tij = tπ ij + t *π ija + σ * Dija ,                      (13)

where π ij and π ija represent taxable profits in H and in G for strategies (i, j), and t* and

σ* represent overall tax rates on, respectively, taxable profits in G and dividends ( Dija )

paid by the foreign affiliate to the parent. These overall tax rates depend both on the tax

system in G and the treatment of the foreign source income by H.

        The parameters t* and σ* depend on the tax system. For example, with deferral,

the home country does not tax the taxable profit arising in the foreign country; hence t* =

ta , the statutory tax rate in the foreign country. Similarly, in the absence of deferral,

there is no additional tax on repatriation of dividends, so that σ* = 0. These and the other

parameters are summarized in the following table for the combinations of deferral and

non-deferral, and limited credit and deduction systems.

                          σ* =0                                            σ* =0



        These parameters can be translated into the parameters representing the overall

tax on outbound investment. To do this, consider a foreign investment by the home firm,

with initial cost of F’+K’Cj , so that F + KCj = F + mXCj represents the cost in second-

period terms, as in the previous section. In this section, we make the assumption that the

fixed cost, F, is treated as capital expenditure by all the tax systems. In the presence of

the tax this investment generates a reduction in taxable profit of Aˆ a (F '+ K ' Cj ) , where Â a

is the depreciation allowance per unit of investment in G. If the investment is financed by

new equity, then the net cost reflects this reduction in taxable profit, multiplied by the tax

rate, t*. If the investment is financed by retained earnings in the subsidiary, then

dividends fall by the cost of the investment, and there is an additional reduction in the tax

on dividends at rate σ*. Combining these effects and defining A * = t * Aˆ a , the net cost of

the investment is given by:




24
                    Retained earnings                                                           New equity

                                                                                                             1+ r



       The income generated in the second period is pcjXcj, which we assume is paid to

the parent. In the case of the investment being financed by retained earnings, it is paid as

a dividend, and therefore incurs tax at rate t* and again at rate σ*. If the investment is

financed by new equity, then it is assumed that the initial capital invested can be repaid to

the parent without incurring the tax on dividends. Hence the net return in each case is:

                Retained earnings                                                         New equity

and λ = σ* for the case of investment financed by retained earnings, and λ = σ*/(1 + r) for

the case of investment financed by new equity.

       The taxes faced by the foreign firm are straightforward. We make the simplifying

assumption that the tax systems in the other two countries -- where the other firm is

resident and where the market is located -- are identical. We also assume that the former


25
does not operate a deduction system. This implies that the foreign firm faces the same

tax system irrespective of its choice of location of production. Specifically, if it produces

at home, its post-tax profit is:

                        Z iB = (1 - ta)[qiB - s - γam]YiB,                               (16)

where q iB is the price of its final good Y, and A a = t a Â a and


                                   γa =
                                          (1 − A a ).
                                           (1 − t a )                                    (17)


        If it produces abroad, the value of its investment is

                        ZiC = (1 - Aa)F + (1 – ta)[q iC - γam]YiC .                      (18)

        The levels of post-tax profit from each strategic choice of the home firm are

therefore given in (3a) for strategy B and (13) for strategy C. The corresponding

expressions for the foreign firm are given in (15) and (16).



        B.      Determining Output and Profit for Each Combination of Strategies

        The profit-maximizing output levels corresponding to each strategy are shown in

Table 3, which are derived from each firm choosing its output level to maximize profit,

conditional on both firms having chosen their strategy.

        These output levels are similar to those of the simplified model. However, in each

case there is an additional term, reflecting the impact of the combined tax system. Note

that in the special case of γa =1 , and b = c (and hence bd = s), we return to the values in

the simplified model of Table 1. Apart from allowing b to differ from c, the additional

terms in Table 3 reflect the role of the foreign tax system, summarized by A a and hence

γ a . Thus, conditional on the strategic choice, lower depreciation allowances in the




26
foreign country raise γ a and increase output of the home firm and reduce output of the

foreign firm.

         These output levels can again be substituted back into the expressions for the

profit for each combination. The resulting post-tax profit for each firm under each

combination of strategies is presented in Table 4. The structure of these expressions is

related to that in Table 2 with two significant changes. First, the foreign firm post-tax

profit is now lower, relative to its output, because it now pays tax on its activities.


27
Second, the parameters of the tax system now reflect the more general tax treatment.

       Given the expressions in Tables 3 and 4, we can again analyze the critical values of F

which determines the strategic choice made by each firm conditional on a given choice by

the other firm. We then identify which combinations of strategic choices will occur for given

values of F and the home tax system; we again summarize the home tax system as it applies

to outbound investment by η. Finally, we analyze the welfare properties of alternative tax

systems.

       C.       Equilibrium of the Model

In solving the model, we again make use the parameters summarized in (19). However, it

is also useful to define some further terms.


       1.       Strategic Choices by the Foreign Firm

       We begin by analyzing the choices of the foreign firm. If the home firm chooses

B, the foreign firm will choose C if and only if ZBC > ZBB ; that is:

                                         2     2
                                     b( YCB − YBB )
                        F < ϕ *2 =                    .                                        (20)
                                              γa


28
Similarly, if the home firm chooses C, then the foreign firm will choose C if and only if

ZCC > ZBC; that is:

                                           2    2
                                      b( YCC − YBC )
                         F < ϕ 1* =                    ,                                    (21)
                                           γa

where ϕ 1* and ϕ 2* are defined in the Appendix.

        These conditions have close similarities to the simplified case we presented in

section II. Hence the comments made there -- especially in relation to the importance of

the tax parameter on outbound investment by the home firm, η -- continue to hold.

Compared with the critical values in that case however, these critical values have two

further elements reflecting the foreign tax system. First, each is divided by γa. As

allowances in the foreign tax become more generous, Aa increases and γa falls (since γa =

(1-Aa)/(1-τa)). Because the fixed cost of investing abroad is assumed to receive an

allowance of Aa, the higher is Aa (and hence the lower is γa), the more likely the foreign

firm is to choose C. Second, the critical values of both ϕ1* and ϕ 2* include an additional

term reflecting again the generosity of the foreign tax system, again measured by γa. This

addition reflects the impact of γa on the profit-maximizing level of output conditional on

a chosen strategy, as discussed in the context of Table 3.

        The critical values of F are illustrated in Figure 2, which plots ϕ 1* and ϕ 2* against

η. As with ϕ 2 in section II, ϕ 2* does not depend on η, so that it is represented by a

vertical segment. The impact of the foreign tax system is to move it to the right of ϕ2.

Again, as in the case of ϕ 1 in section II, ϕ 1* increases with η.




29
         2.       Strategic Choices by the Home Firm

         The strategic choices of the home firm can be analyzed in a similar way. Suppose

first that the foreign firm chooses strategy B. The home firm then chooses C if and only

if VCB > VBB , or :

                                               2       2
                                          b( X CB − RX BB )
                             F < ϕ 3* =                     ,                                               (22)
                                                  η

where R reflects the tax rate on domestic investment relative to the tax on outbound

investment:

                            R = (1 – t )/((1 – σ*)(1 – t* ).                                               (23)



         If instead the foreign firm chooses strategy C, the home firm will choose strategy

C if and only if VCC > VBC, or:

                                               2       2
                                          b( X CC − RX BC )
                             F < ϕ 4* =                     .                                              (24)
                                                  η

Again, the definitions of ϕ 3* and ϕ 4* are given in the Appendix.

         While the expressions for critical values ϕ 3* and ϕ 4* are somewhat forbidding,

they have the same structure as the critical values for the foreign firm, ϕ 1* and ϕ 2* . As

with the critical values in section II, both are divided by η.15 As η increases, both ϕ 3* and

ϕ 4* fall. This makes it more likely that the home firm would choose strategy B rather than

strategy C. This is because the fixed cost receives an allowance, reflected in η.

         There are additional terms reflecting the relative tax treatment of the home and

foreign firms. These are more complex than in the case of the foreign firm because the

home firm faces a more complex tax treatment. However, it is straightforward to show


15
  in section II, this was η̂ , reflecting the possibility that the fixed cost might be deductible whatever the
depreciation allowance.


30
that both ϕ 3* and ϕ 4* fall as η increases – implying that the home firm is less likely to

choose strategy C. It is also possible to show that ϕ 4* always lies to the right of ϕ 3* ; that

is, the critical value of F for the home firm in choosing strategy C over strategy B is

lower if the foreign firm chooses strategy C.

        We also summarize these values in Figure 2. The Nash equilibria follow a similar

pattern to Figure 1. Thus, at low levels of F, there is a (C,C) Nash equilibrium, while at

high levels of F, there is a (B,B) Nash equilibrium. However, as before, the tax

treatment of outbound investment, summarized by η, has important effects on the Nash

equilibria. As before, there are two (C,B) regions which would not exist in the absence of

tax, and also a much larger (B,C) region which also would not exist in the absence of the

tax.



        D.      Measuring Welfare and Implications for Tax Policy

        In the presence of foreign taxation, we define welfare to be the income accruing

to residents of the home country, that is the pre-tax income of domestic investment plus

the post-foreign-tax income from outbound investment. Following this approach, the

welfare under each pair of strategic choices in the more general model is shown below.

        Using the definitions of output for each combinations of strategies, it is

straightforward to show that XCB > XCC and that XBB > XBC. It follows, then, that WCB >

WCC and WBB > WBC. Hence any given strategy for the home firm is more profitable if the

foreign firm chooses B instead of C. However, it is not possible to make other comparisons

between these levels of welfare without more specific definitions of the tax system --

particularly the treatment of outbound investment, summarized by η.

         National welfare depends on both the tax regime and the fixed cost of investing

abroad, F, which, together with the other parameters of the model, determine the strategic

choices made by each firm. Because we are primarily concerned with the tax treatment

of outbound investment by the home firm, we could, in principle, analyze optimal tax

policy by computing the level of welfare corresponding to all possible combinations of F

and η, given other parameters and other elements of the tax system, and taking into

account the impact on the strategic choice and the level of investment conditional on the

strategic choice. This would yield an optimal rate of η corresponding to each value of F.

         We do not follow this approach for two reasons. First, the model is too

intractable to derive such simple optimal values. Second, in any case, even if such

optimal values could be found, they would be of little use to policymakers, who must

create general tax systems which apply to a range of values of F, if not all values of F.

Instead of presenting analytical results, we therefore rely on a simulation model to

examine specific alternative tax regimes. For given values of the parameters, the model

can find the measure of welfare for each tax regime for any value of F. In particular, we

are interested in comparing welfare levels under two specific regimes. The first is the




32
regime proposed by Feldstein and Hartman (1979) -- deduction without deferral. The

second is a regime commonly used in practice -- limited credit with deferral. 16

        The extent to which the foreign government captures part of the pre-tax economic

rent affects national welfare because welfare for the home country is calculated net of

foreign taxes. Ignoring foreign tax, the pre-tax economic rent is generally higher if the

home firm undertakes more outbound investment, and outbound investment is generally

encouraged by use of the deferral system. However, given outbound investment, a higher

foreign tax rate generally implies lower national welfare. As a result, the optimal tax

policy now involves balancing the need not to discriminate against outbound investment

by the home firm against the transfer of welfare to the foreign government. In order to

analyze this balance, we present three sets of results, corresponding to different foreign

tax rates.



        1.      No Foreign Tax

        Figure 3 presents the case of no foreign tax: t a = 0 .17 This is essentially the case

we analyzed in section II; in fact, setting b = c exactly reproduces the model in section II.

Here there is no transfer of welfare to the foreign government. Further, because there is

no foreign tax, there is also no distinction between the limited credit and deduction

methods of taxing foreign income. However, there remains a distinction between taxing

on deferral and on accrual. In Figure 3, the unbroken line represents welfare in the case

of deferral, and the dotted line represents welfare in the case of accrual taxation. The

parameter values are given above the figure: the home tax system is represented by t =


16
  No OECD country attempts to tax active corporate income without deferral, and no
country permits only a deduction for foreign taxes paid, although some countries have an
exemption system rather than a limited credit system.




33
0.5 and A = 0.4. We find a similar picture for a wide range of parameters of both the tax

system and demand and cost factors.

          The Figure indicates – as we also show in Figures 1 and 2 – that for low values of

F, combination (C, C) prevails for both η = γ (accrual taxation) and η = 1 (deferral).

Welfare is higher under deferral because output and profit are higher than under accrual

taxation. This difference represents the standard case of the impact of tax on the cost of

capital and hence output. In the absence of strategic choices, a standard corporation tax

results in lower output, profit, and welfare. A cash flow tax avoids this affect. However,

this effect is dominated by the impact of tax on the strategic choice.

          As F rises the combination of strategic choices changes. This occurs first under

the accrual tax, with a shift from (C,C) to (B,C); that is, the home firm switches to home

production. This creates a decline in welfare under the accrual tax and a greater

advantage of deferral (because pre-tax economic rent remains higher in the (C,C)

combination). This advantage is increased for still higher values of F, as the more

favorable treatment of outbound investment compared with domestic investment induces

the home firm to maintain its outbound investment for higher values of F, inducing the

still more favorable (C, B) regime. This is subsequently reduced as the possibility also

arises of the (B, C) regime. (In this case we measure welfare as the mean of welfare in the

two possible regimes).

          There is only one range of values of F for which the accrual tax generates higher

welfare than under deferral. That corresponds with a high F. In the absence of taxation,

both firms would choose strategy B. With tax and deferral, however, the tax advantage to

outbound investment induces the home firm to choose strategy C (creating a (C, B)

combination) when welfare would be higher from strategy B (a (B, B) combination).


17
     In the case of accrual taxation, we assume that the home government uses A, rather


34
Beyond this range, the costs of outbound investment are so high that they outweigh any

tax advantage, and both firms choose strategy B. Overall, then, in the absence of foreign

taxes, national welfare is higher under deferral than under accrual taxation for almost all

possible values of the fixed cost of investing abroad.



       2.      Low Foreign Tax Rate

       Figure 4 explores the case of a foreign tax with a relatively low rate: t a = 0.2 and

A a = 0.16. Because there is foreign taxation, the home government must now choose

between the limited credit system and the deduction system. We compare the Feldstein-

Hartman regime of deduction without deferral (the dashed line) with limited credit with

deferral (the dotted line). The regimes represented in Figure 4 are the same as those in

Figure 3. For low values of F, both firms choose strategy C. In this range, the limited

credit system yields slightly higher welfare because output is higher. Under both tax

regimes, the foreign government captures part of the economic rent, so that in both cases,

welfare of the home country is lower than in Figure 3.

       However, under the deduction system, the home firm switches to domestic

investment (combination (B,C)) at much lower values of F, reflecting the very high

overall tax rate on outbound investment; there is a smaller drop in welfare moving into

this position, reflecting the lower initial welfare. Although the same effect occurs under

the limited credit system, the effect is much less pronounced, since the overall tax rate on

outbound investment is much lower. There is therefore a much larger range of values of F

under which the limited credit system yields a (C,C) combination and the deduction

system yields a (B,C) combination. Within this range, at higher values of F, the latter

yields higher welfare than the former. This ranking is reversed at still higher values of F,


than Aa, to define taxable profit. This implies that, in this case, η=γ.

35
however, as the limited credit system induces the (C,B) combination, which at these tax

rates yields a higher welfare for the home country than the (B,B) combination despite the

transfer of welfare to the foreign country. Finally, as in Figure 3, there remains a further

(C,B) area with high values of F under the limited credit system which yields lower

welfare than the (B,B) combination which would occur without tax, and with the

deduction system.

       Given these tax parameters, then, the choice between the limited credit and the

deduction systems is ambiguous, although it remains the case that there is a greater range

of values of F for which the limited credit system yields the higher welfare.



       3.      High Foreign Tax Rate

       At still higher values of the foreign tax, however, this position is reversed. Figure

5 shows the position for t a = 0.6 and A a = 0.48. In this case, because t < t a , the limited

credit system implies that no tax is collected by the home government on outbound

investment; in this case, such investment faces only the foreign tax. However, the

deduction system imposes an overall tax rate ( t a + t (1 - t a )) of 80 percent on outbound

investment.

       The implication of this very high tax rate is that, even for F = 0, the home firm

never chooses strategy C. In effect, the (B, C) regime under the deduction system

extends to all values of F. By contrast, under the limited credit system, there remains an

area where the high foreign tax rate does not rule out outbound investment by the home

firm. However, in this region under strategy C, the foreign government captures such a

large share of the rent that home country welfare is lower than under strategy B. In this

case then, by in effect prohibiting outbound investment, the deduction system yields a

higher level of welfare.



36
IV.       SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

          In this paper, we provide a reconsideration of conventional models of taxation of

capital income on foreign direct investment which are based on an analysis of marginal

investment projects and effective marginal tax rates. We begin with the observation,

common in industrial organization research on multinationals economics, that economic

rents figure prominently in the strategic choices made by multinational firms.

Accordingly, the roles of rents and strategic choice should be important elements of

normative and positive analysis of taxation of foreign-source income.

          In the absence of foreign taxation, we find that cash flow taxation of outbound

investment generally generates higher national welfare than accrual income taxation.

That is, deferral of home-country taxation until earnings on FDI are repatriated is

generally superior to including those earnings in current income. This is true even if the

home country taxes domestic investment less generously than under a cash flow tax. The

reasons lie in the characteristics of outbound investment and the strategic interactions in

decisions among multinational companies resident in different countries. We do not

impose that total investment (domestic plus outbound) by home firms is fixed. Indeed,

conditional on being in a specific regime, the two forms of investment are not substitutes

at all.

          Our model implies that the tax system should aim at least not to worsen the

outcome of the strategic choices made by competing multinationals. That is, if there is a

distorting tax on home investment, applying a similar tax to outbound investment would

give an advantage to foreign-based multinationals in two ways: the home firm would be

more likely to produce at home, and consequently supply less output to the market, and

even if the home firm did produce abroad, it would still produce lower output. In both



37
cases this can be exploited by the foreign firm to increase its profits at the expense of the

home firm, and hence the welfare of the home country. These effects can be reduced or

removed by taxing outbound investment on a cash flow, or deferral, basis.

       In the presence of foreign taxes, foreign governments capture some of the pre-tax

economic rent associated with the home country’s outbound foreign direct investment,

and so outbound investment provides a smaller benefit to the home country. This

narrows the national welfare gain from cash flow taxation of multinational firms’

overseas income. If the foreign tax is high enough, it is in the interests of the home

country to discourage outbound investment. However, for low rates of foreign tax, a

limited credit system with deferral generally dominates a system of accrual taxation with

a deduction for foreign taxes paid.

       We believe that we have taken an important step toward analyzing guidelines for

tax policy toward multinational firms in a framework within which realistic industrial

organization plays a significant role. We do not view our model as implying literally that

the any country should adopt deferral or some other relatively generous policy toward the

taxation of income from outbound foreign direct investment since our model is too

stylized to permit such a prescription. Nevertheless, we believe that our emphasis on the

industrial organization of multinationals has important implications for the current policy

debate over whether U.S. tax policy is excessively generous to outbound foreign direct

investment (see the review in Hines, 1999).
