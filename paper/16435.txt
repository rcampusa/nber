Demography and Population Loss from Central Cities, 1950-2000

NBER Working Paper No. 16435
October 2010, Revised September 2011
JEL No. J11,N92,R23

                                             ABSTRACT

The share of metropolitan residents living in central cities declined dramatically from 1950 to 2000.
We argue that cities would have lost even further ground if not for demographic trends such as renewed
immigration, delayed child bearing, and a decline in the share of households headed by veterans. We
provide causal estimates of the effect of children on residential location using the birth of twins. The
effect of veteran status is identified from a discontinuity in the probability of military service during
and after the mass mobilization for World War II. Our results suggest that these changes in demographic
composition were strong enough to bolster city population but not to fully counteract socio-economic
factors favoring suburban growth.

I. Introduction

       The share of the metropolitan population in the United States living in a central city fell

from 58 percent in 1950 to 36 percent in 2000, with the balance residing in the suburban ring.

Suburbanization intensified residential segregation by race and income, hastened the contraction

of the urban tax base, and augmented disparities in access to education and other locally-

provided public services (Baumol, 1967; Benabou, 1996; Fischer, et al., 2004).

       Many economic, political and sociological trends contributed to the rapid growth of the

suburbs. These factors include rising real incomes among American households after World War

II (Margo, 1992); road building programs that reduced the time cost of commuting from

bedroom communities to the central city (Baum-Snow, 2007); federal subsidies for the purchase

of single-family homes through the underwriting of mortgages and the mortgage interest

deduction (Jackson, 1985); the relocation of employment opportunities to the suburban ring

(Boustan and Margo, 2010); and changes in the perceived benefits of urban residence due to

racial diversity, income disparities between cities and suburbs, and heightened crime rates

(Cullen and Levitt, 1998; Boustan, 2007, 2010).

       Alongside these forces favoring suburbanization, a series of countervailing changes in the

demographic composition of the metropolitan population bolstered the size of central cities. This

paper identifies four such shifts: the growing share of the metropolitan population living in a

household with a foreign-born or African-American household head; the declining share in a

household headed by a veteran of the Armed Forces; and the declining share of households

containing a child under the age of 18. We also consider the life-cycle mobility of the large Baby




                                                                                                1
Boom cohort from city to suburb (and back again) but find that it did not have a quantitatively

meaningful effect on residential patterns.1

         Central to our argument is the claim that demographic characteristics help to determine

residential location.2 However, the causal relationship could go in the other direct as well, with

residential location influencing mutable characteristics like family size and veteran status. We

therefore employ instrumental variables to identify the causal effect of having an additional child

or serving in the military on place of residence. In particular, we instrument for household size

with the occurrence of twins on either the first or the second birth (Angrist and Evans, 1998). We

identify the effect of military service by comparing cohorts who came of age during and just

after mass mobilization for World War II (Bound and Turner, 2002; Page, 2008; Fetter, 2010).

         In the final section, we use the estimated determinants of living in the central city to

consider a series of demographic counterfactuals. Overall, we find that, absent these changes in

demographic composition, the share of the metropolitan population living in the central city

would have declined by an additional 10 to 32 percent from 1960 to 2000. However, these

demographic changes were only strong enough to partially reverse but not to overcome the

strong economic and social forces in favor of suburbanization.




1
  A series of recent essays have pointed to the effect of demographic shifts on city growth (Ehrenhalt, 2008;
Leinberger, 2008). Ehrenhalt (2008) lists the “increased propensity to remain single, the rise of cohabitation, the
much later age at first marriage for those who do marry, the smaller size of families for those who have children, and
at the other end, the rapidly growing number of healthy and active adults in their sixties, seventies and eighties.”
2
  The relationship between demographic characteristics and residential location derive from a complex interaction
between household preferences and institutional and social constraints. For example, veterans bought new homes in
the suburbs not only because of their own preference for suburban residence but also because new housing
construction after World War II was disproportionately located in the suburban ring. In documenting these
relationships, we do not aim to distinguish between these demand-side and supply-side mechanisms.

                                                                                                                    2
II. Residential mobility and the decline of central city population

A. Trends in city and suburban population, 1940-2000

         Figure 1a documents trends in city and suburban growth from 1940 to 2000 for the 103

metropolitan areas anchored by the largest central cities in 1940.3 Over the second half of the

twentieth century, the share of metropolitan residents living in the central city fell from 58

percent to 36 percent.4 With the exception of the 1970s, cities experienced positive population

growth in each decade.5 However, the suburban population grew at a substantially higher rate

throughout the period, leading to a steady decline in the share of the metropolitan population

living in central cities. Suburban growth was driven by a combination of city-to-suburban

migration, natural increase and in-migration, both from other countries and from non-

metropolitan areas. The difference between city and suburban growth rates in each decade reflect

net out-flows from cities to suburbs as well as differences in the rates of in-migration and natural

increase between cities and suburbs.

         According to Figure 1a, the popular conception of a recent urban revival is unfounded;

indeed, cities continued to grow at a slower pace than the surrounding suburbs from 1990 to

2000.6 However, many downtown areas, which historically have been industrial or commercial

centers, did experience rapid population growth in the 1990s. Birch (2005) reports that the



3
  This sample includes all metropolitan areas anchored by a city that had at least 50,000 residents in either 1940 or
1970. We note that the core analysis relies instead on a varying number of metropolitan areas whose residents can be
identified by location (city or suburb) in the Census micro data in each year. See section IIIa for a discussion on the
construction of the main sample and Table 2 for results restricted to a consistent set of 109 metropolitan areas that
can be identified in 1980 and 2000.
4
  The share of the total population living in a central city only declined from 31 percent in 1950 to 25 percent in
2000 because the metropolitan shift to the suburbs was partially offset by rural-to-urban migration.
5
  The growth of central cities in this figure is in part driven by the expansion of city land area via annexation. In
1940, the average city in this sample was 48 square miles and by 2000 it had grown to 117 square miles.
6
  We are not the first scholars to point this out. Rappaport (2003) documents that, with the exception of a few large,
coastal cities such as New York, Boston and San Francisco, urban areas did not experience a reversal of fortunes in
the 1990s; rather, most cities either grew continuously or declined continuously since 1950.


                                                                                                                     3
population in the average downtown area grew by 13 percent in the 1990s – faster than the rest

of the central city or the suburban ring. However, by Birch’s definition, the downtown core

consists of a few Census tracts in each metropolitan area and, therefore, is not a bellwether of

general urban health.

       The metropolitan areas represented in Figure 1a are anchored by two very different types

of cities: around two-thirds cities experienced positive population growth from 1940 to 2000

while the remaining one-third declined in size. Figures 1b and 1c display separate patterns of

growth by city type. Despite differing levels of growth over this period, the time pattern of city

and suburban growth is very similar across these two groups. The fastest rates of city growth

were posted in the 1940s, when expanding cities grew by nearly 30 percent and declining cities

experienced their last decade of positive growth. The 1970s was the low point of city growth in

both categories. In the 1980s and 1990s, expanding cities again experienced positive growth and

the rate of population loss slowed in declining cities. Overall, the share of the metropolitan

population living in the central city declined at a similar pace in both cities types.



B. Related literature

       This paper contributes to two related literatures – one on the causes of urban decline and

another on the determinants of residential mobility. Studies in both of these areas emphasis the

roles of race, nativity and household structure in the determination of residential location.

       There is an extensive body of work documenting that African-Americans and the foreign-

born are more likely than native-born, non-Hispanic whites to live in central cities (Massey and

Denton, 1993; Portes and Rumbaut, 2001). Blacks moved in large numbers from the rural South

to metropolitan areas from 1940 to 1970 (Gregory, 2005; Boustan, 2010). Over 80 percent of



                                                                                                4
these black migrants settled in central cities. Although black suburbanization began in earnest in

the 1970s, sizeable gaps in the residential locations of blacks and whites remain (Frey, 1985;

Schneider and Phelan, 1993). 61.6 percent of the black metropolitan population still lived in

central cities in 2000, compared to 26.1 percent of whites.

       Since the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, a large inflow of

immigrants have settled in central cities (Martin and Midgley, 2003; Singer, 2004; Frey, 2005).

However, recent scholarship has emphasized that, unlike European immigrants of the early

twentieth century, new immigrants groups are increasingly “bypassing central cities and settling

directly in suburbs” (Alba and Logan, 1991, p. 432). Despite this trend, immigrants from every

sending country are still more likely than native-born whites to live in the central city; in 1990,

for example, only 33 percent of white metropolitan households lived in the city, compared to

numbers ranging from 40.8 for Asian Indians to 82.9 percent for Dominicans (Alba, et al. 1999).

       A portion of these location differences by race and ethnicity can be explained by group

disparities in socio-economic status. In general, poor households are more likely to live in cities

(Glaeser, Kahn, and Rappaport, 2008). However, notable differences in residential location by

race and nativity remain even after controlling for income and education. This residual gap can

be explained, in part, by the historical processes by which immigrant enclaves and majority black

neighborhoods developed within central cities. To this day, some blacks and immigrants self-

select into these areas to take advantage of familial or social networks or to enjoy community-

specific amenities (Thernstrom and Thernstrom, 1997; Ihlanfeldt and Scafidi, 2002). In addition,

African-Americans and the foreign-born continue to face barriers that preclude suburban

residence, including limited access to mortgage finance (Munnell, et al., 1996; Berkovec, et al.,

1996; Ondrich, Stricker and Yinger, 1999).



                                                                                                 5
        Household structure is another important determinant of residential location. Married

couples are more likely than other household types to live in the suburbs or to move to the

suburbs in a given period conditional on living in a central city (Frey and Kobrin 1982; Alba and

Logan, 1991; South and Crowder, 1997). The preference among married couples for suburban

living is likely related to the association between marriage and child-bearing. A large majority of

married couples either currently live with children, have lived with children in the past, or are

planning for children in the future. Therefore, married couples may place a higher premium on

the larger lot sizes and the bundle of public goods, including higher quality public schools,

available in the suburbs.7 The presence of children in a household is itself positively related to

living in the suburbs though, in some cases, it is negatively correlated with the likelihood of

moving to the suburbs from elsewhere. A long literature, beginning with Rossi (1955) and Long

(1972), shows that households with children are less likely to move overall and, conditional on

moving, are likely to move short distances.

        At midcentury, veterans of the second World War had access to housing benefits that

encouraged homeownership and relocation to the suburbs. The Servicemen’s Readjustment Act

of 1944, commonly known as the GI Bill, included a mortgage program that allowed veterans to

purchase a home with little or no down payment (Fetter, 2010). The Veterans’ Administration

assisted 2.1 million veterans in purchasing a home between 1946 and 1950 alone, the majority of

which were located in suburban areas (Bennett, 1996, p. 24). The civilian market for credit also

expanded during this period, facilitated by the Federal Housing Administration.8 Despite the


7
  The presence of higher quality public goods and more affluent neighborhoods in the suburbs is not an inherent
feature of cities in developed economies. Indeed, many European cities are organized differently, with the most
desirable neighborhoods located in the city center. On the US-European comparison, see Brueckner, Thisse and
Zenou (1999).
8
  The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) began insuring mortgages initiated by private lenders in the mid-
1930s. As a result, mortgage rates fell from 6-8 percent in the 1920s to 2-3 percent in the 1940s and the average
down payment declined from around half to around 10 percent of the value of the property (Jackson, 1985, p. 205).

                                                                                                               6
expansion of credit in the civilian market, Vigdor (2006) finds that eligible veterans were still

seven percentage points more likely than non-veterans to own a home in 1970.

       Journalists have speculated that the aging of the baby boom generation will lead retired

couples to return to cities. Demographers, however, have been more skeptical (Nelson, 1988;

Frey, 1993). Frey (2007), for example, argues that seniors are more likely to “age in place.”

Mobility rates among the elderly are very low; less than five percent of Americans older than 65

move in a given year, compared to nearly 30 percent of individuals in their early twenties. As a

result, there is little increase in the probability of living in the central city after retirement. A

related literature points out that the elderly have high rates of home ownership; in 2003, 78

percent of Americans over the age of 75 owned their own home (Jones, 1997; Myers and Ryu,

2008; Painter and Lee, 2009). Contrary to the life-cycle savings model, there is no empirical

evidence that seniors sell their home in order to dis-save as they enter old age. Rather, home

sales among the elderly are prompted by life transitions, including the death of a spouse or a

change in health status. Thus, while we investigate the effect of the aging of the baby boom

cohort on city population, the demographic literature leads us to believe that this force is unlikely

to be particularly strong.



III. Demographic correlates of living in the central city

A. Estimating equation

       The goal of this paper is to examine whether demographic trends are quantitatively large

enough to have bolstered the population of central cities, despite the strong forces encouraging

suburban growth. This section begins by presenting the demographic correlates of living in the

central city. The analysis is based on individual records from the 1960 to 2000 Censuses



                                                                                                   7
compiled by the Integrated Public Use Micro-data Series or IPUMS (Ruggles, et al., 2008).9 Our

sample includes all residents of metropolitan areas for whom place of residence (central city

versus suburbs) is reported in the data. We can identify place of residence for 76 percent of the

metropolitan sample in 1960, 83 percent of the sample in 1980, and 61 percent in 2000. The

fraction of the population that can be identified by place of residence shifts as the Census privacy

requirements change over time.10 For robustness, we present results with a constant-geography

sample below.

         Our dependent variable is an indicator equal to one if the respondent lives in a central

city. We pool individual records from 1960 to 2000 and estimate equation 1 using a probit

specification:


                  =1 if central cityiact = α + Γ'Xi + νt + μa + θc + εiact                                          (1)


The subscript i indexes individuals who are a years old in Census year t and belong to birth

cohort c. The regression includes fixed effects for Census years (νt), individual years of age (μa),

and five cohort intervals, each representing roughly twenty years of birth cohorts (θc).11 Xi is a

vector of characteristics for the household in which individual i resides.



9
  We do not include data from 1950 because, in that year, veteran status was only asked of individuals on the sample
line (five percent of the population), preventing the accurate identification of veteran-headed households.
10
   IPUMS does not report central city status if doing so would allow users to identify geographic areas with fewer
than 100,000 to 250,000 residents; the exact requirements change by year. Depending on the year, we are able to
identify observations from between 91 and 143 metropolitan areas. We analyze a consistent sample of 109
metropolitan areas in Table 2. To assess whether our inability to identify observations from small metropolitan areas
affects our results, we also tried reproducing Table 1 separately by city size. The only notable difference is in the
estimated relationship between living in an immigrant-headed household and living in a central city. However, given
that, by definition, a small share of the metropolitan population lives in a small metropolitan area, adjusting for this
difference would only reduce the coefficient on being foreign-born from 0.17 to 0.14.
11
   The five cohort groups in the main specification are 1869-1910, 1911-1930, 1931-1950 and 1951-1970, with the
omitted category being those born after 1970. We are able to identify age, period, and cohort effects by constraining
that cohort effect to be identical within these twenty year intervals. Results are robust to instead using finer cohort
groups of either 13 or 16 years.

                                                                                                                      8
       In the baseline equation, Xi contains indicators for the race, nativity, and veteran status of

the household head and a dummy variable for the presence of children in the household. We

define a child as anyone who is 18 years of age or less regardless of his or her relationship to the

household head. In alternative specifications, we allow residential location to vary with the

number of children in the household and add indicators for being married or being an “empty

nester.” Households are considered to be “empty nesters” if one member reports having had

children but there are no children currently present.

       To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to estimate the age profile of city

residence within birth cohorts over time. Vigdor (2006) and others report age profiles of city

residence constructed from single cross-sections. These profiles likely overstate the probability

that the elderly will “return” to the central city by conflating age and cohort effects. For example,

individuals who were 70 years old in 1970 were born in 1900 and came of age before the

diffusion of the automobile and the large-scale suburban growth of the post World War II period.

Therefore, the elderly in 1970 may have been more likely to live in central cities for both life-

cycle and cohort-specific reasons.



B. Probit results

       Our estimating equation produces two sets of results: the age profile of city residence

over the life cycle and the relationship between the other demographic characteristics in the

vector X and the probability of living in the central city. We report the age profile of city

residence in Figure 2, which graphs the average marginal effects by single years of age from

equation 1 (plus the constant). The probability that a metropolitan resident lives in the central

city peaks between the ages of 20 and 22. Many individuals then leave the central city in their



                                                                                                   9
late twenties and thirties. The lowest probability of city residence occurs at the age of 55, an age

at which households are likely to have children and to be able to afford the larger homes

available in the suburbs.12 After that point, individuals slowly return to the city.

         Table 1 presents the average marginal effects relating the other demographic

characteristics to the probability of living in the central city. Members of immigrant-headed

households are 17 percentage points more likely than native-born whites to live in the central

city. The excess probability of living in a city is even higher for individuals living with a black

household head (37 percentage points). In contrast, members of households headed by a veteran

of the US Armed Forces are 4.6 percentage points less likely to live in a central city.13 Consistent

with recent work on immigrant locations, we find that the relationship between immigration

status and residential location changes over time. In 1960, immigrant households, most of whose

household heads were European born, were only 14 percentage points more likely than the native

born to live in a central city. By 1990, the immigrant-native gap increased to 20 points, before

declining again to 16 points in 2000 as immigrants began to suburbanize or to bypass the central

city altogether.

         In the first column, we estimate the effect of children on residential location with a single

dummy variable for the presence of any child in the household. Households with at least one

child are 7.6 percentage points less likely to live in the central city. The second column replaces

the indicator variable with a linear measure of the number of children in the household. Each

child appears to depress the likelihood of living in the central city by 1.2 percentage points.

Together, these estimates suggest that the relationship between the presence of children and

12
   The probability of city residence is also locally minimized at age 8 when many children live in the suburbs with
their parents.
13
   A portion of the relationship between veteran status and residential location appears to be driven by an association
between having served in the military and being married. Controlling for marital status in column 5 cuts the effect
on veteran status in half, but the coefficient is still large and statistically significant.

                                                                                                                   10
residential location is non-linear and, in particular, that the first few children are most strongly

associated with leaving the central city. To further explore this non-linearity, the third column

adds dummy variables for having exactly one child and for having two or more children in the

household. Relative to households with no children, households with one child are 5.9

percentage points less likely to live in the central city and households with two or more children

are 8.7 percentage points less likely to live in the central city.14

        Households may not instantaneously adjust their residential location decisions on the

basis of current composition. Rather, some households may move to the suburbs in anticipation

of having children, while some households that once contained children may remain in the

suburbs even after the children leave home. We provide evidence consistent with this life cycle

perspective in columns 4 and 5. Column 4 uses two indicator variables to summarize household

composition: one for the current presence of children and another for empty nesters who once

had children living at home. The omitted category is individuals living in households that have

never (to date) contained children. Compared to this omitted category, households with children

present are 7.6 points and empty nesters are 1.2 points more likely to be suburban residents.15

        Column 5 proxies for the full life-cycle effect of having children by adding an indicator

for being married, relative either to never having been married or to being divorced or

widowed.16 Married individuals are 11.4 percentage points more likely than singles of the same

age to live in the suburbs.17 Because marital status is highly correlated with the presence of


14
   We experimented with adding a richer set of dummy variables and found no statistical difference between having
two versus three children, three versus four children, etc.
15
   The “empty nest” indicator is only available from 1960 to 1990. In these years, the Census added a question about
children ever born for all women who were at least 15 years old.
16
   We include divorced and widowed household heads in the control group because these marital transitions often
lead to residential mobility. However, results are similar if we instead compare the ever and never married (results
not shown).
17
   Married men have higher labor market earnings than their single counterparts, which may allow married couples
to afford a suburban lifestyle (Korenman and Neumark, 1991; Ginther and Zavodny, 2001). When we control for

                                                                                                                11
children, the independent effects of both the current and prior presence of children in the

household decline substantially.

         In the final column, we expand the sample to include non-metropolitan households. In

this case, the coefficients can be interpreted as the effect of each demographic factor on the

probability of living in the central city, relative to living either in a suburb or in a non-

metropolitan area. The largest change in this expanded sample is the effect of veteran status on

residential location. Although veterans are four percentage points more likely to live in a suburb

relative to a city, they are only one point more likely to live in a non-city relative to a city. In

other words, veterans are unlikely to live in non-metropolitan areas; in this specification, the lack

of veterans in non-metropolitan areas offsets the concentration of veterans in the suburbs. This

pattern is consistent with military exemptions for farm workers during World War II, which we

discuss in more detail below.

         Thus far, we have relied on the set of metropolitan areas for which residential locations

(city versus suburb) is known in the Census micro data. This geography presents two concerns.

First, information on place of residence is available for a varying set of metropolitan areas in the

micro data in each year. Secondly, the boundaries of each metropolitan area, which is composed

of one or more contiguous counties, can expand over time as the Census Bureau adds peripheral

counties to existing area definitions.18 Table 2 presents results using two samples that impose

consistent geography in the 1980 and 2000 Census years.19




household income, the effect on marital status declines by 20 percent (results not shown). We interpret the results in
column 5 as the total effect of marriage on residential location, including a potential earnings channel.
18
   For example, between 1980 and 1990 the number of counties included in the average metropolitan area increased
from 4.6 to 7.5.
19
   We exclude 1960 and 1970 because of additional data restrictions in these years. In 1960, the micro data does not
report metropolitan area of residence and, in 1970, either place of residence (central city versus suburb) or
metropolitan area is known but not both. We then omit 1990 as well for temporal balance.

                                                                                                                  12
       For comparison, the first column of Table 2 uses all metropolitan observations in 1980

and 2000. Metropolitan areas are made up of sets of counties, some of which are themselves

large enough to be identified in the micro data. Column 2 restricts the sample to the 109

metropolitan areas for which at least one underlying county is large enough to be separately

identified in the micro data in both years; in this specification, we include all counties in the 109

metropolitan area in each year even though this set of counties can change over time. The

coefficients are qualitatively unchanged, suggesting that the results are not sensitive to the set of

metropolitan areas included in the analysis. If anything, demographic characteristics are slightly

stronger predictors of city residence in these (larger) metropolitan areas, perhaps because they

have a sharper distinction between city and suburb. In column 3, we create consistent boundaries

for the same set of 109 metropolitan areas by restricting our attention to the set of counties that

are identified in both 1980 and 2000. That is, we exclude counties that were added to the area

between 1980 and 2000 or that grew large enough over this period to be identified in the micro

data only in the year 2000. Again, results are nearly identical to the full sample, suggesting that

residence patterns for peripheral counties are similar to those in core suburban counties.



IV. Instrumental variables: The effect of children and veteran status on city residence

       In the previous section, we estimated the effects of five demographic characteristics –

age, race, nativity, veteran status and the presence of children – on residential location.

Ultimately, our goal is to use these estimates to infer how changes in the demographic

composition of the metropolitan population have affected the population of central cities over the

past half-century. However, before doing so, we must determine that the estimates indeed reveal

the effect of personal characteristics on residential location and not the other way around. In so



                                                                                                  13
doing, we distinguish between predetermined characteristics, such as race and nativity, and

mutable characteristics like veteran status and child bearing. For example, suburbanites may be

encouraged by their friends and neighbors or by the child-friendly environment to have an

additional child. Furthermore, both child-bearing and veteran status may be correlated with other

characteristics that are associated with living in the suburbs. As a result, we employ instrumental

variables to estimate the causal effect of having an additional child or serving in the military on

place of residence.



A. Veteran status

       According to our probit estimates, veterans are less likely than non-veterans to live in the

central city. One explanation for this pattern is that veterans were offered generous housing

benefits that provided the resources necessary to buy single-family housing in the suburbs.

However, this relationship could also be generated by omitted variables that are correlated with

veteran status. Veteran status is determined by a combination of individual initiative (whether or

not to enlist) and military selection. Men who suffer from health ailments or are cognitively

impaired are less likely to serve in the military. At various points, the military also offered

deferments to men who were enrolled in college, employed in a war industry or working in the

agricultural sector. Any of these factors may be correlated with later residential location.

       Our goal is to estimate the direct effect of veteran status on residential location while

minimizing these other confounding factors. To do so, we focus on the era of mass mobilization

for World War II between 1940 and 1945, a period in which the probability of military service

was strongly influenced by external events. Figure 3 reports the share of white, native-born men

from the 1915 to 1934 birth cohorts who served in the Armed Forces. The probability of military



                                                                                                14
service increased from 50 percent for men born in 1915 to over 80 percent for the men born

between 1919 and the third quarter of 1927. Men in this group were 18 to 26 years old at the end

of World War II. The probability of military service then declined from 83 to 70 percentage

points between the 1927 and 1928 birth cohorts. Men born after the third quarter of 1927 were

too young to participate in World War II, although many of them served in Korea.

        With this history in mind, we compare the veteran status and residential location of these

two adjacent birth cohorts who faced different probabilities of military service due to the timing

of World War II. In this setting, we treat quarter of birth as an instrument for the probability of

military service.20 In particular, in our first stage equation, the probability of military service is a

function of a linear trend in quarter of birth and a dummy variable for being born before the

fourth quarter of 1927. We estimate:


     =1 if veteranit = α + β(=1 if born before 4th Q 1927)it + γ(quarter of birth)it + νt + εit                (2)


The linear trend accounts for other factors that may have increased homeownership over time in

the second stage equation, such as rising real incomes. The sample is restricted to white, male,

native-born heads of household from the birth cohorts of 1919 through 1932. As a robustness

exercise, we consider different birth years as starting and ending points of the comparison

window.21




20
   Bound and Turner (2002) and Page (2008) use a similar approach to study the effect of the GI Bill on educational
attainment. Because quarter of birth is only available in the Census from 1960 to 1980, we focus on these years in
our IV estimation.
21
   For brevity, we report results in which the treated group consists of men born between 1919 and 1927 and the
comparison group is either men born in 1928 and 1929 or between 1928 and 1932. Results are similar when we
shorten the treatment window to 1921-1927 or 1923-1927 or lengthen the comparison window to 1935.

                                                                                                                15
         Table 3 presents the coefficients from our first and second stage equations, which are

estimated using linear probability models.22 As is clear in Figure 3, men born before the fourth

quarter of 1927 were 13 percentage points more likely than men born after that period to have

served in the Armed Forces.23 In this restricted sample, our OLS estimates suggest that being a

veteran increases the probability of living in the suburbs by 3 percentage points (a slightly

smaller effect than in the full sample in Table 1). When we instrument for veteran status, the

relationship between military service and suburban residence increases to 6.7 percentage points.

However, we note that, given the size of the standard errors, we cannot reject that the OLS and

IV coefficients are the same.

         The fact that the IV estimates are larger (in absolute value) than their OLS counterparts

implies that, at least during World War II, veterans were selected on attributes that were

positively correlated with living in the central city. This pattern is consistent with draft

exemptions for farmers and agricultural workers. In other words, we suspect that military service

is correlated with living in a central city precisely because draft exemptions were most common

among men living outside of cities.

         This logic is consistent with a number of facts about this era. First, Acemoglu, Autor and

Lyle (2004) show that, across states, mobilization rates of prime-age men varied between 40 and

55 percent, with the lowest call-up rates in the plains states of North and South Dakota and Iowa

and in the agricultural South. Furthermore, in the 1950 Census, young veterans of World War II




22
   We also estimated this system using a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model. The IV probit results are quite
similar to the two-stage least squares estimates (coeff. = -0.076, s.e. = 0.030).
23
   The validity of our instrument depends on the assumption that being born after the third quarter of 1927 only
affects residential location via veteran status. We check this assumption by defining an alternate birth indicator that
ends in the third quarter of 1929. We know of no event in military history that would suggest that men born after this
period were more or less likely to have served in the Armed Forces. Indeed, the first stage coefficient for this
placebo indicator is five times smaller than the estimate for our variable of interest (coeff. = 0.024, s.e. = 0.007).

                                                                                                                   16
were far less likely than non-veterans to live on a farm (6.7 versus 15.7 percent).24 Given these

facts, we suspect that the larger IV coefficients provide the most reasonable estimate of the effect

of veteran status on residential location. However, we note that the estimate is derived from a

particular time period and, therefore, we use both the probit and IV coefficients to conduct the

counterfactual exercises.



B. The presence of children

           In our probit estimation, we find that households with children are less likely to live in

the central city. One explanation for this result is that having children increases the demand for

certain aspects of suburban life, including the larger housing units, presence of open space and

higher quality public schools. However, this finding could be contaminated by either omitted

variables bias or reverse causality. During this period, rich households had fewer children and

were more likely to live in the suburbs, which may bias downward the relationship between

having children and living in the suburbs. On the other hand, suburban residence could directly

influence a household’s preferences for optimal family size. The attitudes of friends and

neighbors in the suburbs may encourage households to have an additional child. In this case, our

estimate would overstate the effect of having children on moving to the suburbs.

           We use the birth of twins as an instrument for the number of children in a household.

Angrist and Evans (1998) argue that, conditional on the age and race of the mother, twinning is

an exogenous event. We focus on the period 1960 to 1980 because of the availability of quarter-

of-birth data used to identify twin pairs in these years. In addition, these years pre-date the

development of infertility treatments that have increased the probability of twinning for (the non-

random set of) mothers who seek medical intervention. A large literature uses twinning to study
24
     Authors’ calculations from the 1950 IPUMS.

                                                                                                  17
the effect of family size on women’s and children’s outcomes (Bronars and Grogger, 1994;

Rosenzweig and Wolpin, 1980a, 1980b; Angrist and Evans, 1998; Black, Devereaux and

Salvanes, 2005).

         We define two children in the same household with the same quarter and year of birth as

a pair of twins. 0.5 percent of households with at least one birth have twins on the first birth. Our

first-stage equations relate the presence of twins to various measures of the number of children in

the household.25 For example, for households with at least one birth, we estimate:


                  Number of childrenit = α + β(=1 if twin on first birth)it + νt + εit                            (3)


Alongside the standard controls included in equation (1), we also control for the race and age of

the mother. One limitation of this approach is that households must have at least one birth event

in order to be at risk for having twins. Table 1 demonstrates that the shift from zero to one child

is an important determinant of residential location; however, twinning cannot be used as an

instrument for the presence of the first child in a household.

         Table 4 presents the coefficients from our first and second stage equations, estimated

using linear probability models.26 The raw data indicates that, among households with at least

one birth, those with a singleton on the first birth have an average of 2.58 children, whereas those

with a twin on the first birth have 3.34 children. Accordingly, we estimate that having a set of

twins on the first birth event increases household size by 0.7 children (column 2). Much of the


25
   The validity of this instrument depends on the assumption that twinning only influences residential location
through its effect on family size. We find no effect of having twins on the probability of living in the central city
after controlling for the number of children in the household.
26
   We also experimented with appropriate probit IV methods. However, the resulting estimates were either
implausibly large or implausibly small. In particular, the estimated effect of the number of children in the household
was very large, while the coefficient on the indicator for having at least two children was very small. These two
findings appear to be logically inconsistent. Therefore, we follow Angrist and Pischke (2009, p. 204-05) in reporting
the more robust 2SLS coefficients.

                                                                                                                  18
difference in completed family size arises from the (obvious) fact that the vast majority of

households with twins on the first birth have at least two children, while only 73.4 percent of

households with a singleton first birth have an additional child. Consistent with this figure, we

estimate that having twins increases the probability of having two children by 25.6 percentage

points (column 4).

       In the restricted sample of households with at least one child, the OLS estimate implies

that each additional child reduces the likelihood of living in the central city by 0.5 percentage

points. Note that this effect is smaller than the coefficient for the full sample reported in Table 1.

The effect of family size on residential location more than doubles when we instrument for the

number of children with the occurrence of twins on first birth. In this case, each additional child

reduces the probability of living in the central city by 1.9 percentage points. The larger IV

estimates suggest that households with many children have unobserved characteristics that are

otherwise positively associated with living in the central city; for example, large households may

have a lower socio-economic status. Furthermore, in this case, the OLS and IV estimates lie

outside of each other’s confidence intervals. However, we note that the IV results are derived

from the subset of households with at least one child and may not be generalizable to the full

population. We therefore conduct our counterfactual simulations using both the probit and IV

estimates.



IV. Counterfactual effects of demographic composition on central city population

       In this section, we document trends in the demographic composition of metropolitan area

residents from 1940 to 2000. We then use a series of counterfactual exercises to assess the




                                                                                                   19
contribution of changes in demographic composition to the maintenance of city population over

this period.



A. Demographic characteristics of the metropolitan population, 1940-2000

       Figure 4 displays demographic characteristics of the metropolitan population over time.

With the immigration restrictions of the mid-twentieth century, the share of the metropolitan

population living in an immigrant-headed household fell from 30 percent in 1940 to ten percent

in 1970. After the expansion of immigration quotas in 1965, this share returned to nearly 30

percent by 2000. Given that the foreign born are more likely to live in central cities, we expect

this pattern to contribute to population growth in central cities from 1970 onward. As blacks

from the rural South migrated to industrial cities, the share of the metropolitan population living

with a black household head increased from eight percent in 1940 to 17 percent in 2000. Again,

this pattern would likely bolster city population.

       After servicemen returned from World War II, the share of the metropolitan population

living in a veteran-headed household spiked from less than five percent in 1940 to nearly 50

percent in 1960 and 1970. Since 1970, the veteran share has declined to just over 10 percent in

2000. Because veterans are more likely to live in the suburbs, the recent reduction in the number

of veterans in the population favors the city relative to the suburbs. The share of households with

a child present has also declined substantially since mid-century. While nearly 80 percent of

households had at least one child in 1950, this share declined to 50 percent in 2000. Again,

because households with children are more likely to live in the suburbs, the growth of childless

households favors the city.




                                                                                                20
        The age structure of the population also notably shifted from 1940 to 2000 with the birth

and aging of the large baby boom cohort (born between 1946 and 1964). Yet, because of the

rapid swings in the age profile of city residence (Figure 2), we find that the aging of this cohort

had little effect on city growth. In essence, there is no decade in which the baby boom generation

has been clustered in either a peak or a valley of the city residence profile. In 1980, for example,

many of the baby boomers were in their early twenties and lived in central cities. However, at the

same time, others in the cohort were still in their teenage years or had entered their early thirties

and therefore tended to live in the suburbs.

        We explore the possibility of age effects on city growth more systematically by imposing

a counterfactual flat age profile and predicting the resulting city share of the metropolitan

population in each decade. In particular, we allow each age between zero and 70 to contain 1.3

percent of population and constrain older ages to each hold 0.3 percent of population. Using the

estimated age effects in Figure 2, we then predict the share of the population that would be living

in the central city under this counterfactual age profile. We find no meaningful difference

between the predicted and the actual city shares, leading us to turn our attention to the other set

of demographic factors (results available upon request).



B. Counterfactual simulations

        Table 5 uses the coefficient estimates relating demographic trends to city residence to

provide counterfactual statements about how much further the share of metropolitan residents

living in central cities would have declined between 1960 and 2000 if not for these demographic

moderators.27 In the simplest exercise, we use the probit or IV coefficients to consider the extent


27
   We select 1960 as our starting point because a number of our variables reached their minimum or maximum point
in that year. We discuss the sensitivity of this result to varying starting points below.

                                                                                                             21
to which center city population increased through each of the four demographic channels. We

then allow for the fact that new arrivals may lead to the departures of some existing residents,

either directly through white or native flight or indirectly via an increase in city housing prices.

        The first row of Table 5 presents the actual change in the share of metropolitan residents

living in central cities from 1960 to 2000. The share of the metropolitan population living in a

central city declined by 17.8 percentage points over this period. The magnitude of this decline

reflects a combination of socio-economic forces favoring suburban residence, on the one hand,

and the demographic trends favoring city residence on the other.

        The second row of Table 5 isolates the role of changes in demographic composition. In

particular, we ask how the share of the metropolitan population living in a central city would

have changed if changes in demographic composition had been the only relevant factor over this

period and if new arrivals did not generate corresponding departures. In this case, the city share

of metropolitan population would have actually increased by 6.4 to 8.3 percentage points from

1960 to 2000. The low and high points of this range measure the strength of the relationship

between demography and residential location using the probit or IV coefficients, respectively.28

        Rows 3a through 3d illustrates how each demographic characteristic contributes to the

total counterfactual change in city population. That is, the sum of the entries in rows 3a through

3d is equal to the total counterfactual change in the city population share in row 2. To generate

these values, we multiply the total change in the variable in question from 1960 to 2000 by the

estimated effect of that variable on the probability of living in the central city. For example, the

share of households headed by an immigrant increased by 16.3 percentage points from 1960 to


28
  Because our IV regressions are estimated on selected samples, we use the ratio between the OLS and IV estimates
in Tables 3 and 4 to scale the coefficients for the whole population from Table 1. Specifically, we augment the
veterans coefficient by 2.3 (= -0.067/-0.029 from Table 3, columns 1 and 2) and we augment the any child
coefficient by 1.6 (= -0.052/-0.032 from Table 4, columns 3 and 4).

                                                                                                              22
2000 and, as a result, the share of metropolitan residents who lived in the central city rose by 2.8

percentage points (= 16.3 · 0.170, coefficient estimate from Table 1, column 1).

       In the probit-based counterfactual, the most important demographic trend contributing to

the growth of city population is renewed immigration, followed by the increase in black

population, the shrinking number of veterans and the declining share of households with

children. The IV estimates suggest a greater role for the decline in veteran status and in the share

of households with children present. However, we caution that the IV estimates are less precisely

estimated. Therefore, we report 95 percent confidence intervals around each of the counterfactual

effects calculated from the IV estimates. Note that if we, instead, had selected 1940 or 1950 as a

starting point for this exercise, the role of racial composition and the presence of children would

have been larger.

       The simple counterfactuals discussed thus far do not account for the possibility that some

existing residents might have left central cities as new households arrived, either due to a direct

distaste for living near black or immigrant neighbors or due to the indirect effect of these arrivals

on city housing prices. The fourth row of Table 5 presents a modified counterfactual using

estimates of white/native flight and housing price responses from the literature to calculate the

net effect of these demographic shifts on center city population.

       Recent studies of white and native flight find nearly one-for-one displacement rates from

cities or urban neighborhoods. Boustan (2010) shows that, over a single decade, one southern

black arrival into a central city led to 2.5 non-black departures. Over the long run, new arrivals

partially compensate for initial white flight and one black arrival is associated with one non-

black departure. Saiz and Wachter (2011) find that one immigrant arrival into a Census tract

leads to the departure of 0.68 native, non-Hispanic whites. Borjas (2006) presents a similar



                                                                                                  23
estimate for the native workforce at the metropolitan level (0.61 departures).29 Adjusting for

native white departures completely offsets the effect of black arrivals and reduces the net effect

of immigrant arrivals by 70 percent. In this case, the 4.4 percentage point gross increase in the

share of the metropolitan population located in the central city due to black and immigrant

arrivals would have only lead to a 0.9 percentage point net increase in the city share (= 2.8 points

· 0.32 + 1.6 · 0.0).

         The other two demographic groups – veterans and households without children – are not

likely to prompt specific outflows. However, their presence could affect the probability that other

households remain in (or move to) a city indirectly via the housing market.30 A larger population

in the city can increase housing prices and, in turn, higher prices may encourage existing

residents to leave or deter other new residents from moving in.31 The best empirical evidence on

the effect of population growth on housing prices is based on variation in immigration across

metropolitan areas.32 Saiz (2007) finds that a one percent net increase in metropolitan population

increases housing prices by 0.77 percent.

         Assessing the effect of higher housing prices on out-migration is an empirical challenge.

In the raw data, there is no correlation between housing rents and net migration at the state level

(Coen-Pirani, 2010). However, this null effect is likely due to the fact that states with higher

housing prices also have either a more productive set of industries (and hence higher wages) or a

29
   Similar work by Crowder, Hall and Tolnay (2011) shows that, for the native born, the log odds of moving
increases with the foreign-born share of the neighborhood.

   The presence of non-veteran households or households without children need not be the result of new in-migration
to the central city. However, these changes in demographic composition may instead lead fewer households leave
the city for the suburban ring or elsewhere. As a result, the central city will have a larger population through
retention rather than through new in-migration.
31
   The extent of price increases depends on the elasticity of housing supply; at the extreme, prices will not respond to
in-migration if each new arrival is met with the construction of a new housing unit.
32
   An earlier literature used the coming of age of the baby boom cohort to assess the relationship between population
growth and housing prices. Mankiw and Weil (1989) document large effects of the entry of baby boomers into the
housing market in the US, while Engelhardt and Poterba (1991) find no effect in Canada. This evidence is hard to
interpret because it is based on national time series.

                                                                                                                    24
more valuable set of amenities (Roback, 1982). Saks (2008) is one of the few papers to

(indirectly) measure the migration response to an exogenous change in housing prices, in this

case driven by variation in zoning regulations. She finds that, in places with strict zoning rules,

in-migration is dampened by a corresponding increase in housing prices; her estimates imply that

a one percent increase in housing prices reduces any given in-migration flow by 0.4 percent.

         According to our probit estimates, the three demographic forces under consideration

increased gross city population by 7.5 percent.33 As a result, housing prices would have

increased by 6 percent, leading to a subsequent 2 percent population decline. In other words, a

7.5 percent increase in gross city population would have resulted in only a 5.5 percent net

increase in the number of city residents due to the effect of population growth on housing prices.

Converting these percentages back into shares, these calculations imply that, net of white flight

and price-induced out-migration, demographic factors would have increased the city share of the

metropolitan population by 2.1 percentage points (Table 5, row 4). Rows 5a through 5d use a

similar logic to illustrate how each demographic trend contributes to the net counterfactual.

         Overall, we conclude that, absent these demographic shifts, central city population would

have declined by 10 to 32 percent more than it did between 1960 and 2000. The range of these

estimates depends on the estimation method used (probit or IV) and assumptions about how

existing residents would have reacted to these new arrivals. Our preferred estimate uses the IV

coefficients to calculate the effect of each demographic factor on city population, while also

accounting for responsive out-migration. By this estimate, the share of metropolitan residents

living in the city would have declined by an additional 3.4 percentage points, or 16 percent, from

33
  The demographic forces include a declining veteran share, an increase in households without children, and the net
increase in population due to foreign arrivals. Together, these forces would have increased the share of metropolitan
residents living in the central city by 3 percentage points. Over this period, around 40 percent of metropolitan
residents lived in a central city. Therefore, city population would have needed to increase by 7.5 percent in order for
the share of the metropolitan area living in a central city to increase by 3 percentage points.

                                                                                                                   25
1960 to 2000 if not for the demographic counterweight (16 percent = 3.4 points/[3.4 points +

actual 17.8 points]). In other words, shifts in demographic composition helped to maintain city

population but were not strong enough to compensate for the powerful forces favoring

population growth in the suburbs.



V. Conclusion

       The share of the metropolitan population living in central cities has declined sharply over

the past sixty years. This paper shows that, absent changes in the demographic composition of

the metropolitan population, this share would have fallen even further. In particular, city

population has been bolstered by the in-migration of southern blacks from 1940 to 1980, the

expansion of international immigration after 1965, and a decline in the share of households with

children or headed by a veteran.

       We provide new estimates of the relationship between each of these demographic

characteristics and the likelihood of living in the central city. Our analysis distinguishes between

predetermined characteristics, such as race and nativity, and endogenous characteristics like

veteran status and child bearing. We instrument for veteran status by comparing birth cohorts of

men coming of age during and just after the mass mobilization for World War II. We use the

arrival of twins to instrument for the number of children in a household. In both cases, the IV

estimates are larger in absolute value (more negative) than the corresponding probits.

       Two counterfactual simulations are used to assess the effect of these demographic factors

on city population from 1960 to 2000. Our simplest approach predicts the gross number of new

residents in central cities using our coefficient estimates and the trends in each characteristic over

time. We then allow for the fact that new arrivals may lead to the departures of some existing



                                                                                                   26
residents, either directly through white or native flight or indirectly via an increase in city

housing prices. The counterfactuals indicate that changes in demographic composition increased

the share of metropolitan population living in the central city between 10 and 32 percent. Our

preferred estimate, which relies on the IV coefficients and allows for responsive out-migration,

suggests that the share of the metropolitan population living in the central city would have fallen

by 16 percent more than it did if not for these demographic trends. Changes in demographic

composition were only strong enough to attenuate, not to reverse, a relative decline in city

population driven by economic and social factors favoring suburbanization.

       Through the 1990s, central cities continued to experience positive population growth but

their expansion continued to be outpaced by more rapid growth in the suburbs. Although we find

no evidence of a recent urban revival, this national focus may miss localized instances of

gentrification in certain neighborhoods or within particular cities that have been fueled in part by

demographic trends (Vigdor, 2002). For example, the interaction between demographic forces,

particularly delayed child-bearing and longer life expectancies, and rising incomes in top income

brackets may have contributed to the renaissance of “super star” cities like New York City and

San Francisco (Gyourko, Mayer and Sinai, 2006). Understanding variation in the role of

demography across different types of cities remains an important avenue for future research.

pseudo R-squared statistics are reported in the last row. In columns 1-5, the sample contains all
residents of metropolitan areas for whom place of residence (central city or suburb) is known.
Column 6 adds all non-metropolitan residents to the sample. Columns 4 and 5 do not include
data from the year 2000 because the variable “child ever born” used to construct the “empty
nester” indicator is not available in that year.

Regressions also contains four birth cohort dummies, one census year dummy and dummies for
single years of age between 1 and 90 and an indicator for being older than 90. Household
members are assigned the race, nativity and veteran status of the household head. Cox-Snell
pseudo R-squared statistics are reported in the last row. In column 1, the sample contains all
residents of metropolitan areas for whom place of residence (central city or suburb) is known. In
column 2, the sample contains residents of the 109 metropolitan areas for which at least one
underlying county is large enough to be separately identified in the micro data in both years. In
the third column, the sample contains the same 109 metropolitan areas and imposes the 1980
metropolitan area county definitions in both 1980 and 2000.

Notes: Row 1 reports the actual share of metropolitan area residents who report living the central
city from IPUMS samples. Row 2 presents the counterfactual share of the metropolitan
population living in central cities under a scenario in which demographic composition is the only
factor allowed to change between 1960 and 2000. The counterfactual in column 3 is based on the
probit regression in Table 1, while the counterfactual in column 4 is derived from the IV

coefficients in Tables 3 and 4. See footnote 23 for the details on translating the IV coefficients
for use in the counterfactual. For the IV-based counterfactuals, we report the 95-percent
confidence interval in square brackets. Rows 3a-3d indicate the contribution of each
demographic factor to the overall counterfactual in row 2. Row 4 reports the results of a
modified counterfactual simulation that allows for the fact that new arrivals may lead to the
departures of some existing residents, either through white/native flight or through an increase in
housing prices. Rows 5a-5d indicate the contribution of each demographic factor to the net
counterfactual in row 4.

Notes: N=103 metropolitan areas. Values refer to the decade ending in the Census year on the x-
axis. All metropolitan areas are anchored by a city that had at least 50,000 residents in either
1940 or 1970. City and county population are taken from the City and County Data Books. The
1970 county definitions of metropolitan areas are applied in all years. Suburban population is
computed as the total metropolitan area population minus the city population.
