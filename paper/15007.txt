Child Care Subsidies and Childhood Obesity

                                              ABSTRACT

Child care subsidies play a critical role in facilitating the transition of disadvantaged mothers from
welfare to work. However, little is known about the influence of these policies on children’s health
and well-being. In this paper, we study the impact of subsidy receipt on low-income children’s weight
outcomes in the fall and spring of kindergarten. The goals of our empirical analysis are twofold. We
first utilize standard OLS and fixed effects methods to explore body mass index as well as measures
of overweight and obesity. We then turn to quantile regression to address the possibility that subsidy
receipt has heterogeneous effects on children’s weight at different points in the BMI distribution. Results
suggest that subsidy receipt is associated with increases in BMI and a greater likelihood of being overweight
and obese. We also find substantial variation in subsidy effects across the BMI distribution. In particular,
child care subsidies have no effect on BMI at the lower end of the distribution, inconsistent effects
in the middle of the distribution, and large effects at the top of the distribution. Our results point to
the use of non-parental child care, particularly centerbased services, as the key mechanism through
which subsidies influence children’s weight outcomes.

I. Introduction

          Over the past three decades, obesity rates among children increased dramatically. Data from

the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate that, since the mid-

1970s, the prevalence of obesity grew from five to 12 percent among children ages two to five and

from seven to 17 percent among children ages six to 11.2 This alarming trend generates concern

among health care officials for a number of reasons. Obesity during childhood is highly correlated

with weight problems throughout adulthood, and obese children are substantially more likely to

develop health problems such as high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes as early as adolescence

(Whitaker et al., 1997; Serdula et al., 1993; Freedman et al., 1999; 2007). Moreover, obesity among

children and teenagers is associated with a number of long-term psychological and labor market

outcomes ranging from poor self-esteem and depression to discrimination and lower wages (Daniels,

2006; Mocan & Tekin, forthcoming; Dietz, 1998; Strauss, 2000). Many of these problems impose a

substantial burden on the health care system. For example, Guijing and Dietz (2002) estimate that

hospital expenditures related to childhood obesity rose from $35 million in the late-1980s to $127

million (in 2001 constant dollars) in the late-1990s.

          Much of the current policy response to the obesity epidemic focuses on children in

elementary and middle school, thereby neglecting the 13 million preschool-age children who spend a

considerable number of hours each year in non-parental child care arrangements (National Center for

Education Statistics, 1996).3 Indeed, about 41 percent of such children attend child care for at least

35 hours each week, and another 25 percent are in care for 15 to 34 hours (Capizzano & Adams,


2
  See http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity/childhood/index.htm. See Anderson and Butcher (2006) for a review of trends.
3
  Indeed, childhood obesity has been identified as one of the most pressing health problems facing the U.S. (U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, 2001) and there are a large number of policy efforts underway to stop or reverse this trend among school-age
children. For example, the Child Nutrition and Women Infants and Children (WIC) Reauthorization Act of 2004 requires that all local
education agencies participating in the National School Lunch Program create local wellness policies no later than July 2006. The Kids
Walk-to-School program developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) aims to increase opportunities for daily
physical activity by encouraging children to walk to and from school in groups accompanied by adults. An increasing number of schools
are limiting access to foods high in fats and sugars by banning soda machines and snack bars in cafeterias and school stores. The School
Breakfast and the National School Lunch Programs are two federal entitlement programs that provide nutritionally balanced, low-cost or
free breakfasts and lunches to millions of children each school day.



                                                                   3
2000). Much of this care now occurs in increasingly formal arrangements. For example, the

enrollment of three-year-olds in center-based care increased from eight percent in 1968 to 39 percent

in 2000, while the enrollment of four-year-olds increased from 23 to 65 percent (Bainbridge et al.,

2005). Today, the predominant child care setting for preschool-aged children is center care (32

percent), followed by relatives (24 percent) and family child care homes (16 percent) (Smolensky &

Gootman, 2003).4

          The growing use of non-parental care has raised awareness among health officials of the

critical role that child care settings play in shaping children’s eating and activity habits. In particular,

given that young children spend considerable time away from their parents, child care providers lay

the foundation for food consumption and exercise patterns. Structural and process features of the

child care environment can dictate the types of physical activities in which children are engaged

(e.g., structured or free-play), the number of hours per day in which children are performing these

activities, and whether these activities occur primarily in indoor or outdoor spaces. In addition, menu

options in child care settings expose children to a variety of new foods and flavors, which can

influence food preferences at home and school (Deckelbaum & Williams, 2001).                                              Child care

providers can also serve as a powerful bridge to aid parents in making healthy food choices in other

contexts (Story, Kaphingst, & French, 2006).

          An array of federal and state child care policies can further shape children’s weight

outcomes. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), which provides employment-based

subsidies targeted at current and former welfare recipients, allows parents to purchase virtually any

legally-operating child care service at a reduced price.5                            Subsidies can influence low-income

children’s weight outcomes through a number of channels. First, insofar as participation in formal

4
  Participation rates in formal child care settings among low-income children now rival those of high-income children (49 percent
compared to 53 percent) (Magnuson et al., 2007).
5
  The CCDF was created by the 1996 welfare reform legislation, which consolidated four preexisting subsidy programs into a single
block grant, increased funding for child care funding substantially, and gave individual states greater flexibility in program design and
administration (Herbst & Tekin, 2008). In 2006, states spent approximately $9.3 billion on child care assistance and served more than
1.7 million children in an average month (Child Care Bureau, 2006).



                                                                   4
care influences children’s weight, one might expect to observe a link between child care subsidies

and weight outcomes given that this policy encourages mothers to shift from informal to formal child

care modes (Tekin, 2005). In particular, child care subsidies reduce the amount of time children

spend in parent and relative care while increasing participation in center- and family-based services.

However, the extent to which subsidy-induced changes in child care utilization are associated with

children’s weight outcomes depends on the relative quality of subsidized child care. Second, the

CCDF stipulates that mothers must be employed to qualify for a subsidy. A number of recent studies

find that children of working mothers are more likely to be overweight and obese, raising concerns

about the subsidy system’s current emphasis on employment (Anderson et al., 2003; Ruhm, 2008;

Classen & Hokayem, 2005; Fertig et al., forthcoming; Phipps et al., 2006; Courtemanche, 2007;

Cawley & Liu, 2007). Finally, by defraying expenses associated with child care, subsidies increase

disposable income that, in principle, can be spent on healthy foods and extracurricular activities.

However, it is unclear whether families spend the additional income on goods that enhance child

quality or whether these resources increase the demand for fast food and sedentary activities such as

video games.

       Despite the potential role for child care subsidies in shaping preschool children’s weight

outcomes, no previous research focuses on this topic. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to

examine the impact of subsidy receipt in the year before kindergarten on several measures of

children’s weight during the fall and spring of kindergarten. Using a sample of children living with

unmarried women drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K), our empirical

analysis proceeds in two steps. We begin by estimating standard OLS and fixed effects models of

body mass index (BMI) and indicators of overweight and obesity status. Next, we use quantile

regression techniques to address the possibility that subsidy receipt has heterogeneous effects on

children’s weight at different points in the distribution of BMI. This method permits us to analyze

whether the impact of child care subsidies is relatively stable throughout the BMI distribution, or


                                                  5
whether subsidy receipt is associated with greater changes in BMI in some parts of the distribution.

In both cases, we pay careful attention to the role of maternal employment and child care utilization

in meditating the relationship between subsidy receipt and children’s weight outcomes.

        Our main results can be summarized as follows. Child care subsidy receipt is associated with

increases in BMI and a greater likelihood of being overweight and obese. We also find substantial

heterogeneity in response to child care subsidies. Subsidies have no effect on BMI at the lower end

of the distribution, inconsistent effects in the middle of the distribution, and large positive effects at

the top of the distribution. Interestingly, center-based care is associated with large and stable

increases in BMI throughout the distribution, while the impact of the other non-parental

arrangements appears to be concentrated at the tails of the distribution. We provide evidence that the

use of non-parental child care, rather than maternal employment, is the key mechanism through

which the subsidy effects operate. Indeed, our results indicate that subsidy receipt continues to be

associated with children’s weight after accounting for mothers’ work history, but this relationship

disappears when child care arrangements are added to the models.

II. Background

        Much of what has been written on childhood obesity focuses on school-aged children and

school-based programs, rather than preschool-age children and child care arrangements (Story, 1999;

Gortmaker et al., 1999; Veugelers & Fitzgerald, 2005; Story, Kaphingst, & French, 2006). This

literature generally concludes that school-based programs play a positive role in reducing the

prevalence of childhood obesity.       However, many of these programs do not explicitly target

economically disadvantaged children, who are at a higher risk of obesity (Frizvold, 2007). To our

knowledge, this is the first study to focus on the role of child care subsidies in influencing low-

income children’s weight outcomes.

        Frizvold (2007) examines the impact of Head Start participation on childhood obesity using

data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. He finds that participation in Head Start reduces the


                                                    6
risk of obesity in late-childhood among black children. Both Head Start and child care subsidies are

means-tested, but unlike subsidies, Head Start places substantial emphasis on quality through the

provision of comprehensive child development services. In addition, many Head Start classrooms

focus explicitly on children’s health through nutritional screening, offering healthy and nutritionally

balanced meals, and engaging in parental outreach and education (Frizvold, 2007).

          Hubbard (2008) studies the impact of maternal employment and child care decisions on

childhood obesity in a dynamic framework using data from the ECLS-K. She finds that any maternal

employment decreases the likelihood of obesity while using non-parental child care increases it. She

also finds that working full-time and using non-maternal care increases children’s risk of being

obese. However, her measure of child care utilization is based on the total number of hours children

spend in three types of settings (informal care from a relative, informal care from a baby-sitter, and

center care). Using this information, she creates a single binary indicator for whether child care was

utilized for more than five hours per week in these settings. Furthermore, this paper does not focus

on any dimension of early care and education policy, including child care subsidies.

          A number of descriptive studies assess the nutritional quality of foods offered in child care

settings.6 A review of these studies suggests that the quality of foods offered in center-based care, in

particular, typically falls short of the standards recommended by The Dietary Guidelines for

Americans.7 For example, Padget and Briley (2005) compare the dietary intake of children attending

center-based care with the recommendations of the Food Guide Pyramid for Young Children.8 The

authors find that such children generally do not receive an adequate diet, and the intake at home does

not compensate for the insufficient consumption of fresh fruits, vegetables, and grains during the

time spent in child care. Furthermore, a number of studies show that preschool-age children in

   A publication put forth every five years by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the The Dietary Guidelines for
Americans provide authoritative advice for people ages two and over about the relationship between increased healthy dietary habits and
the reduction in the risk of major chronic diseases. This publication also serves as the basis for Federal food and nutrition education
programs. Additional information may be found here: http://www.health.gov/DietaryGuidelines/.

                                                                  7
various non-parental child care settings do not meet the recommended guidelines for physical activity

(Story, Kaphingst, & French, 2006).9 However, research suggests that preschools implementing

practices aimed at increasing quality in general and physical activity in particular can be successful at

reaching this goal. For example, in a study of 266 preschoolers, Dowda et al. (2004) find that

children in high-quality preschools, as measured by child-staff ratios, teacher education, and

structural attributes of the facility, participate in greater amounts of moderate to vigorous physical

activity.

          Motivated by the coincident rise in women’s employment and childhood obesity, a number of

studies examine the effect of early maternal employment on obesity. Findings from this research

generally point to negative effects of maternal employment on children’s weight outcomes (Ruhm,

2008; Courtemanche, 2007; Anderson et al., 2003; Fertig, et al., forthcoming).                                   For example,

Anderson et al. (2003) find that increases in hours of maternal work are associated with increases in

the likelihood of childhood obesity. They also find greater effects among children of white mothers,

of mothers with more education, and of mothers at higher income levels. Fertig et al. (forthcoming)

examine the mechanisms through which maternal employment influences children’s weight

outcomes. Cawley and Liu (2007) find that employed women spend significantly less time eating

and playing with their children and are more likely to purchase prepared foods.

          Also relevant to the current study is previous research on the impact of child care subsidies

and arrangements on other dimensions of child well-being, including cognitive and behavioral

development. Using the ECLS-K, a recent study by Herbst & Tekin (2008) find that child care

subsidy receipt in the year before kindergarten lowers reading and math test scores, increases

externalizing and self-control behavior problems, and decreases interpersonal skills at kindergarten

entry. In addition, Baker et al. (2008) analyze the impact of Quebec’s “$5 per day child care”
9
  The 2005 The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that children and adolescents engage in no less than 60 minutes of
physical activity each day. Furthermore, the National Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE) recommends that toddlers
receive at least 30 minutes of structured physical and 60 minutes of unstructured activity each day. Preschoolers should receive 60
minutes of structured play and another 60 minutes of unstructured play each day.



                                                                8
program on several child and parent outcomes. Subsidized children were worse off across a variety

of behavioral and health dimensions, ranging from increased physical aggression and diminished

social skills to increases in common illnesses. The program also led to more hostile parenting, worse

parental health, and lower-quality parental relationships. Previous research finds mixed results for

the impact of non-parental child care on children’s developmental outcomes. A large number of

studies find positive effects of child care attendance (e.g., NICHD, 2003a; 2003b), but others find

insignificant or negative effects (e.g., Bernal & Keane, 2008; Blau, 1999). There is more agreement,

however, that high-quality center-based care has positive effects on cognitive development among

low-income children (e.g., NICHD & Duncan, 2003).

III. Data

          The data used in this analysis are drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study,

Kindergarten cohort (ECLS-K), a nationally representative sample of 21,260 children attending

kindergarten in the fall of 1998.10 Children in the ECLS-K are followed through the eighth grade,

with detailed parent, child, and teacher interviews conducted in the fall and spring of kindergarten

(1998 and 1999) and the spring of first (2000), third (2002), fifth (2004), and eighth (2007) grade.

Approximately 20 kindergartners per school from over 1,200 public and private schools are included

in the sample.11

          Analyses in this study are based on the fall and spring of kindergarten waves of data

collection, in which children’s height and weight were measured and parents were asked questions

about child care attendance in the year prior to kindergarten entry. We limit our sample to children

10
    The ECLS-K is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education. For more information, see the ECLS-K website at
http://nces.ed.gov/ecls/kindergarten.asp. An additional longitudinal study, the ECLS-Birth cohort, follows 14,000 children born in 2001
through kindergarten entry.
11
   The ECLS-K used a multistage probability sample design to select the sample of children attending kindergarten in 1998. The primary
sampling units (PSUs) were geographic areas consisting of counties or groups of counties. The second-stage consisted of public and
private schools within sampled PSUs. The final stage units were students within schools. The school frame was freshened in the spring
of 1998 to include newly opened schools that were not included in the original sample. Once the sample children were identified, parent
contact information was obtained from the school, which was used to locate parents and seek consent for the child assessments and
parent interviews. Completion rates (or response rates that are conditioned on earlier stages of data collection) for the fall of
kindergarten interviews were high: 89.9 percent of child assessments were completed, 85.3 percent of parent interviews were completed,
and over 90 percent of the teacher interviews were completed.



                                                                  9
who lived with an unmarried mother as of the fall of kindergarten interview.12 We focus on single

mothers because they constitute about two-thirds of eligible subsidy recipients (Herbst, 2008).

Exclusions from the sample are made if children were living in two-parent families (14,129) or

missing data on BMI (438), child care arrangements (3,070), or child care subsidies (34). We

exclude an additional 387 children attending Head Start, since the decision to participate in this early

intervention program is not influenced by child care subsidies. Furthermore, the goal of Head Start is

to increase school readiness through an array of child and family services, whereas CCDF child care

subsidies are aimed at facilitating employment.13 Rates of item non-response on the remaining child

and family variables are low, usually well below one percent of the final sample, and we retain these

cases by imputing zeros for the missing values and creating dummy variables to control for the

possibility of non-random imputation. Our analysis sample consists of 3,113 children in the fall of

kindergarten and 3,007 children in the spring of kindergarten.

          Our outcome variables are based on body mass index (BMI), which is calculated as weight in

kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2). In addition to estimating models using BMI

expressed in levels and logarithms, we construct binary indicators to represent children who are

overweight or obese. For children ages two to 19, BMI values are plotted on growth charts from the

Center’s for Disease Control (CDC) to determine the corresponding BMI-for-age percentile.

Children at or above the 85th percentile of the gender- and age-specific BMI distribution are coded as

overweight, while children at or above the 95th percentile of the BMI distribution are coded as

obese.14



12
   Single mothers are identified in the ECLS-K by using the variable P1HPARNT, which describes the child’s living arrangements. We
define single mother families as those in which the child lived with the “biological mother only.”
13
   Additional minor exclusions from the sample are made due to an inability to match children to the 2000 Census geocoded data (5
observations) and mothers with nonsensical ages (3 observations).
14
   For additional information on the CDC growth charts, see http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/growthcharts/resources/growthchart.pdf.
Also, see http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/. Until recently, this nomenclature differed across children (ages two to 19) and adults.
Children with BMIs above the 95th percentile of the gender- and age-specific distribution were considered “overweight,” and those above
the 85th percentile were considered “at-risk-for-overweight.” However, an expert committee convened by the American Medical
Association (AMA) in collaboration with the Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration



                                                                 10
          A key independent variable in our analysis is a dummy variable indicating whether a child

received subsidized, non-parental child care in the year prior to kindergarten. Parents are asked a

series of questions about child care utilization during the past 12 months, including the types of

arrangements used, the amount of time that each arrangement was used, whether there was a cost

associated with each arrangement, and the amount paid for care. Regarding subsidy receipt, parents

were asked the following: “Did any of the following people or organizations help to pay for this …

provider to care for {CHILD} the year before {he/she} started kindergarten?” Four possible choices

were then presented to parents, and we code those answering “a social service agency or welfare

office” as receiving a child care subsidy.                          Similar questions appear in several nationally

representative surveys (e.g., National Survey of America’s Families and the Survey of Income and

Program Participation), and other researchers construct indicators of subsidy receipt based on them

(Blau & Tekin, 2007; Herbst, 2008; Tekin, 2007). The U.S. Department of Health and Human

Services (1999) finds that between 12 and 15 percent of eligible families received a CCDF subsidy in

1998. In our ECLS-K sample, 14.5 percent of children are coded as receiving subsidized care in the

same year.15

          Another key variable is an indicator of early maternal work, defined as a dummy variable that

equals unity if a given mother was employed at any point between the child’s birth and kindergarten

entry. We also create mutually exclusive groupings of child care arrangements. Specifically, we

code children as attending relative care (which includes caregiving inside and outside the child’s

home), non-relative care (nanny, babysitter, or family-based), center-based care (daycare center), or

school-based services (prekindergarten, preschool, and nursery school). Children who did not attend

any of these services are coded as receiving parent care. A non-trivial number of children received


(HRSA) and the CDC recently endorsed the use of “overweight” and “obese” for children. See this link for more information on the
adjustment: http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/433/ped_obesity_recs.pdf.
15
   Rates of child care subsidy receipt calculated by researchers using the NSAF match closely our ECLS-K estimate. For example, Tekin
(2007) calculates a participation rate of 11.6 percent for a sample of single mothers, and Herbst (2008) estimates a take-up rate of 13.9
percent, also from a sample of single mothers.



                                                                  11
child care from more than one provider, so we create a decision rule to ensure mutually exclusive and

exhaustive categories.16

          We exploit the richness of the ECLS-K to control for a detailed vector of child and family

characteristics as of the fall or spring of kindergarten. Key child characteristics include gender, age,

race, and birth weight. We capture parental reports of children’s health status through a set of

dummy variables indicating whether the child is in excellent health, good health, or fair/poor health.

Health status is also proxied by an indicator for whether the child experienced a premature birth.

Children’s physical activity habits are captured through variables denoting the number of hours per

day the child watches television, the number of days per week the child experiences vigorous

exercise, and whether the child ever participated in athletics. We control for children’s eating habits

and opportunities to consume healthy meals by incorporating variables for whether the child eats a

school-provided breakfast and receives a free/reduced price school lunch. Also of relevance here are

controls for the number of days per week the family eats breakfast and dinner together. Parental time

and skill inputs are captured by the mother’s age, an indicator for whether the child’s parents were

married at birth, the family’s socioeconomic status, and parent’s educational expectations for the

child. Socioeconomic status (SES) is a composite measure incorporating the mother’s and father’s

(or legal guardian’s) educational attainment, mother’s and father’s (or legal guardian’s) job

occupation, and total household income. We parameterize the SES measure through a set of dummy

variables indicating the quintiles of the full ECLS-K distribution. Other parental resources and goods

inputs are represented by food stamps participation and the number of children in the household.

          Summary statistics are presented in Table 1. The average BMI is 16.5, and approximately 29

percent of children are overweight as of the fall of kindergarten interview. Fully 13 percent of


16
  Our decision rule is constructed so that we drop only those children who receive exclusively Head Start. Therefore, our indicator of
subsidy receipt omits those reporting subsidy receipt while participating only in Head Start. A child participating in Head Start along
with another service is coded as participating in the non-Head Start service. The remaining tie-breakers are settled as follows: relative
and center: center; non-relative and center: center; relative and school: school; non-relative and school: school; non-relative, relative, and
center: center; non-relative, relative, and school: school.



                                                                     12
children are obese. This figure is consistent with recent data from the CDC, which reports an obesity

rate of 12.4 percent among children ages two to five.17 As shown in Table 1, the BMIs of children

receiving subsidized and unsubsidized care are quite similar for the fall and spring of kindergarten.

Rates of overweight are slightly higher for subsidized children at both measurement dates. Fully 31

percent and 32 percent of children receiving subsidies are overweight in the fall and spring of

kindergarten, respectively, compared to 29 percent and 30 percent for unsubsidized children.

However, none of these differences are statistically significant. Rates of obesity are also similar

across these groups of children.

            As previously stated, approximately 15 percent of the sample received a child care subsidy in

the year prior to kindergarten entry. Consistent with previous studies, mothers of subsidized children

are more likely to be employed than their unsubsidized counterparts (89 percent compared to 82

percent). Participation rates in the various child care arrangements are as follows: 16 percent of

children received exclusively parent care; 22 percent received care from a relative; seven percent

received care from a non-relative; 16 percent participated in center-based care; and 39 percent

participated in a school-based program.                   As expected, subsidized children are more likely to use

center-based care than their unsubsidized counterparts (40 percent compared to 12 percent). The use

of non-relative care is also significantly greater among subsidy recipients (10 percent compared to 7

percent). Non-recipients are substantially more likely to utilize care from parents and relatives. This

pattern is consistent with previous research indicating that subsidies effectively shift children from

informal child care settings into the formal market (Tekin, 2005).

            Table 1 also shows that subsidized children are less likely to be white and more likely to be

black. Both groups of children are equally likely to be born prematurely and have low birth weights.

Parental reports of children’s health status reveal that subsidized and unsubsidized children are

equally likely to be in excellent health, but subsidized children watch slightly more hours of

                                                                  13
television each day and are less likely to have participated in organized sports at some point before

kindergarten entry. Not surprisingly, a much greater share of subsidized children report eating

school-provided breakfast and lunch.

        The descriptive results presented in Table 1 suggest that rates of overweight and obesity are

equivalent across subsidized and unsubsidized children. Table 2 further explores this issue by

comparing children’s fall of kindergarten weight outcomes across mothers’ work status (Panel A)

and the child care arrangements used in the year before kindergarten (Panel B). Looking first at

Panel A, we find only minor differences in BMI, overweight, and obesity across subsidized and

unsubsidized children, regardless of whether the mother worked since childbirth. Substantially

greater differences emerge when we compare children’s weight outcomes across mothers with

different work histories.   Specifically, children of employed mothers are more likely to be

overweight and obese, regardless of subsidy receipt status. Summary statistics for the full sample

(shown in the first column) reveal that 30 percent of children of working mothers are overweight and

14 percent are obese. The comparable figures for children of non-working mothers are 26 and 12

percent, respectively.

        Turning to the non-parental arrangements (Panel B), we once again find small differences in

weight outcomes across subsidized and unsubsidized children. If anything, non-recipients tend to

have slightly higher BMIs and are more likely to be overweight and obese. However, the story

changes dramatically when we compare the weight outcomes of children in parent care with those

receiving subsidies. Subsidized children consistently have higher BMIs, and the prevalence of

overweight and obesity is substantially greater. For example, 31 percent of subsidized children in

center-based care are overweight and 14 percent are obese. Fully 35 percent of subsidized children

attending school-based services are overweight, while 15 percent are obese. On the other hand, 24

percent of children in parent care are overweight, and 10 percent are obese. In fact, based on the

summary statistics for the full sample, it appears that children in any non-parental arrangement—


                                                 14
regardless of whether it is subsidized—have higher BMIs and are more likely to be overweight and

obese than those in parent care.

          Together, the results presented in Table 2 highlight the potential for child care subsidies to

operate through maternal employment and participation in non-parental child care. By encouraging

low-income mothers to work and by creating incentives to shift children into formal child care

settings, subsidies place children in environments where the average child is more likely to be

overweight and obese. We will investigate these channels more explicitly in the regression analysis

that follows.

IV. Empirical Model

          Our goal is to examine the relationship between child care subsidy receipt in the year prior to

kindergarten and children’s weight outcomes in the fall and spring of kindergarten. Formally, we can

specify this relationship in the context of the following regression model:

          Wi = αSi + φEi + Cδ + Xβ + εi,                                                                                              (1)

where W is one of four weight outcomes for child i in the ECLS-K; S is a binary indicator for

whether a child care subsidy is received by child i; E is a binary indicator of early maternal work; C

is a matrix of child care arrangements; X is a matrix of observable child and family determinants of

children’s health and development, and ε is an idiosyncratic error term. The α, φ, δ, and β are the

estimated parameters. Recall that the four weight outcomes include the level and log of child i’s

BMI and indicators for whether child i is overweight and obese. For ease of interpretation, (1) is

estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.18 Coefficients are weighted using the

ECLS-K Base Year Parent weight, and standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary heteroskedasticity

using robust standard errors.

          An obstacle to obtaining an unbiased estimate of α is the potential endogeneity of subsidy

18
  The least squares estimates of coefficients in linear probability models are consistent estimates of average probability derivatives, but
the standard errors are biased as a result of heteroskedasticity (Angrist & Krueger, 1999). As we note in the text, we report standard
errors that are robust to any form of heteroskedasticity.



                                                                   15
receipt. For example, employed mothers who obtain a child care subsidy and utilize non-parental

care may be systematically different from those who do not in ways that are not captured by

researchers. If high-skilled and physically healthy mothers are more likely to work and use child

care, then failing to control for these maternal characteristics would lead to an upward bias of α if

these characteristics are positively correlated with those of the children.          Another source of

endogeneity stems from the possibility that children’s health and well-being influence maternal

choices regarding work and child care. Mothers with unhealthy children, for example, may decide to

remain out of the labor force or place their children in specialized child care settings. If these choices

are correlated with unobserved child characteristics and the outcomes of interest, estimates of α will

once again be biased.

        We attempt to guard against potential endogeneity by adding a rich set of child and family

characteristics to (1). In particular, we capture the health status of children through such controls as

premature birth, low birth weight, and parental reports of children’s well-being. We also remove the

differential propensities across children to engage in sedentary activities (e.g., watching television)

versus those requiring substantial physical activity (e.g., participation in athletics). Family routines

that are correlated with children’s weight are proxied by the extent to which families eat meals

together, and whether children eat breakfast and lunch at school. Finally, we add controls for family

SES and food stamp receipt in order to account for differences across families in the ability to

purchase high quality food and support extracurricular activities.

        A potential concern is that our extensive set of child and family controls may not sufficiently

account for the selection into subsidy receipt. As a result, we estimate models that incorporate

county fixed effects. These eliminate bias from unobserved characteristics across children residing

in the same jurisdiction. For the purposes of this paper, fixed effects specified at the county-level

hold a number of advantages. Given that state-level economic and policy conditions are identical for

children in the same county, these factors are automatically controlled for and are not needed in the


                                                   16
model. This is particularly important for states’ social policy environment, including the flurry of

recent welfare reforms, expansions to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and pre-kindergarten

initiatives, all of which may influence mothers’ work and child care decisions and children’s well-

being. In addition, to the extent that the availability of fast food restaurants, supermarkets, and parks

is unevenly distributed across the states, inclusion of county fixed effects will control for these

factors as well. Another advantage is that any sub-state-level variation in families’ demographic

characteristics, physical activity and food options, or the social policy environment is captured by the

county fixed effects. Again, this is particularly important for the food and policy environment in

which disadvantaged children are raised. For example, substantial evidence suggests that fast food

restaurants tend to be clustered in low-income urban and rural neighborhoods (Block et al., 2004;

Morland et al., 2002). In addition, a number of studies find that county administrators of subsidy

programs have the authority to shape policy decisions with little oversight (Herbst & Tekin, 2008;

Blau & Tekin, 2007; Layzer & Collins, 2000; Blank, et al., 2001; Mitchell et al., 1997). These local-

level sources of unobserved heterogeneity are removed by the county fixed effects.19

          Although the inclusion of early maternal work and child care arrangements in (1) is

interesting in its own right, we argue that such controls are crucial for understanding the ways in

which subsidies influence children’s weight outcomes. In particular, if the impact of subsidy receipt

operates through the increase in maternal employment, one might expect little or no change in the

subsidy estimates after child care arrangements are included in the model. However, if the impact of

subsidies operates through children’s attendance in non-parental care, inclusion of the arrangement

variables should render the estimates on subsidy receipt statistically insignificant. To test these

19
   An alternative approach to obtaining an unbiased estimate of α is through the use of instrumental variables (IV). The IV method
requires at least one variable that is correlated with subsidy receipt but uncorrelated with children’s weight outcomes. We experiment
with models using characteristics of the states’ child care subsidies system (e.g., CCDF expenditures per child, reimbursement rates, and
eligibility thresholds) as identifying instruments. One concern is that these variables, while being correlated with subsidy receipt, may
also reflect the states’ generosity or attitude toward assisting children and this may be correlated with weight outcomes. The subsidy
coefficients from these models are qualitatively similar to those presented in the paper, but they are much larger in magnitude. Given the
concerns about the plausibility of the instruments and the fact that these results are qualitatively similar to the current results, we do not
present the IV models.



                                                                     17
channels, we begin by estimating models that include just the indicator of subsidy receipt, followed

by models that sequentially add controls for maternal employment and child care arrangements.

          The primary coefficient of interest in (1) is α, which captures the impact of child care subsidy

receipt on children’s weight outcomes. For models in which the dependent variable is BMI, the

estimated parameter represents the conditional mean effect of subsidy receipt across all children in

the sample and over the distribution of BMI.20 For models specifying overweight and obesity, the

coefficient is interpreted as the average partial change in the likelihood of moving to the upper tail of

the BMI distribution. In both cases, however, the OLS coefficients mask heterogeneous effects of

child care subsidies across children’s observable characteristics, including BMI.

          Therefore, OLS estimates provide an incomplete picture if, for example, there are a priori

reasons to be believe that key variables influence not only the conditional mean expectation, but also

the expectation at the tails and other policy-relevant points in the outcome distribution. In the current

analysis, the distributional effects of child care subsidies are of particular interest.                                  For example,

consider the policy implications associated with changes in BMI at the lower and upper tails of the

distribution. If child care subsidies lead to increases in BMI among underweight children, one could

reasonably argue that this form of assistance may not impose additional health risks on already

fragile children. For extremely low-income families that experience frequent food shortages, the

introduction of a child care subsidy may improve health and development by allowing children to

experience stable and healthy food options in the child care environment. In addition, an increase in

disposable income may improve the ability of disadvantaged families to decrease consumption of

low-cost, calorie-dense fast food and increase consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables. On the

other hand, if parents and child care staff are aware that subsidies increase BMI among overweight

children, such information can be used to aid parental decisions about the optimal environment for


20
   In other words, OLS assumes that covariates only affect the location of the conditional distribution of the outcomes, not its scale or any
other attribute of its distribution (Koenker & Hallock, 2001).



                                                                    18
their children. Child care directors can also use this information to address nutrition and physical

activity training for staff, and teachers may restructure daily schedules in a way that maximizes

indoor and outdoor physical activity. Finally, state-level child care administrators may encourage

child care providers services operating in low-income neighborhoods to increase healthy food

options to accommodate children receiving subsidized care.

             Based on these considerations, we explore heterogeneous effects of child care subsidies at

different points in the distribution of children’s BMI. To do so, we utilize quantile regression

methods (Hao & Naiman, 2007; Koenker & Bassett, 1978; Businsky, 1998). Quantile regression is a

semi-parametric technique that is used to characterize the entire conditional distribution of a

continuous dependent variable. This is achieved by dividing the cumulative distribution of a random

function into equal intervals (e.g., quartiles or deciles). Then, unlike OLS, which derives estimates

by minimizing the sum of squared residuals across the entire distribution, quantile regression

estimates are derived for each subsection defined by pn (Koenker & Hallock, 2001)21. Formally,

parameter estimates at the nth quantile are calculated by:

                        min ∑ pn [ yi − k ( xi , β )] ,                                                                               (2)
                          k
                               i


where the function pn(.) is the “check function,” and k(xi,β) is specified as a parametric function in

order to generate the estimates.22 Each coefficient produced by the quantile regression model is

interpreted as the partial derivative of the conditional quantile with respect to the observable

covariates. 23 In the current study, coefficients on child care subsidies represent the marginal change

in the nth quantile of BMI due to changes in subsidy receipt status. Insofar as coefficients of varying


21
     The term “quantile” refers to the general case.
22
     The pn(. ) is called the “check function” because it looks like check-mark when it is plotted (Angrist & Pischke, 2008). Specifically,
                               ⎧ n x u, u > 0
 p n (u ) = u (n − I (u < 0) = ⎨                   .
                               ⎩(n − 1) x u , u > 0
To estimate the quantile regression models, we use the ivqte command developed by Frolich and Melly (2008) for STATA 10.1.
23
  Note that quantile regression is not the same as fitting OLS models for subsets of the conditional distribution of BMI. The latter
approach is equivalent to estimating a model on samples based on truncated dependent variables, resulting in biased estimates.



                                                                     19
magnitudes are estimated at each quantile of children’s BMI, we can interpret such results as

evidence of heterogeneous effects of child care subsidies throughout the distribution of BMI.24

V. Estimation Results

          Discussion of the empirical results proceeds as follows. Table 3 presents the OLS estimates

of the impact of child care subsidies on children’s weight outcomes in the fall of kindergarten. The

odd-numbered columns show the results without county fixed effects, and the even-numbered

columns add these controls. To test whether the impact of subsidy receipt operates through maternal

employment and/or children’s child care arrangements, Table 3 presents results from models that

incorporate just the indicator of subsidy receipt (Panel A), subsidy receipt and maternal work (Panel

B), subsidy receipt and child care arrangements (Panel C), and all three sets of variables (Panel D).

The equivalent results for children’s weight outcomes in the spring of kindergarten are presented in

Table 4. We then turn our attention to exploring heterogeneous subsidy effects. Table 5 (fall of

kindergarten) and Table 6 (spring of kindergarten) show the coefficients from the quantile regression

analysis of BMI. To maintain consistency, we begin with models that incorporate just subsidy

receipt, then sequentially add maternal employment and child care arrangements.25

OLS and Fixed Effects Results

          As shown in Panel A of Table 3, child care subsidy receipt is associated with increases in

BMI and a greater likelihood of being overweight and obese. In specifications without county fixed

effects, the coefficient on subsidy receipt is consistently positive but not statistically significant.

Adding controls for unobserved heterogeneity increases the magnitude and precision of the subsidy

estimate in all models. This suggests that, if anything, the impact of subsidy receipt is likely to be

24
   Quantile regression methods have been increasingly utilized in economics to study the returns to education (Arias, Hallock, & Sosa
Escudero, 2001), changes in wage structure and inequality (Buchinsky, 1994, 1997; Gonzales & Miles, 2001; Garcia, Hernandez &
Lopez-Nicolas, 2001), union wage effects (Chamberlain, 1994), and birth outcomes (Abrevaya, 2001). See Empirical Economics vol.
26, no. 1, 2001 for further examples on some of the applications of quantile regressions. We also located a few papers using quantile
regression to estimate child and adult correlates of BMI. Examples of this work include: Terry, Wei, & Esserman (2007) and Beyerlein,
Toschke, & von Kries (2008).
25
   To economize on space, we only present the coefficients on our key variables. The coefficient estimates from other variables are
mostly consistent with our expectations and in line with those in the relevant literature. They are available from the authors upon
request.



                                                                20
biased downward. As shown in column (4), subsidy receipt is associated with a 1.7 percent increase

in children’s fall of kindergarten BMI. The coefficients in column (6) and (8) suggest that subsidized

children are 5.2 percentage points more likely to be overweight and 3.1 percentage points more likely

to be obese.

        Adding a control for early maternal work (Panel B) leads to only a small reduction in the

magnitude of the subsidy coefficients, and the standard errors remain unchanged. Subsidy receipt is

now associated with a 4.7 percentage point increase in the likelihood of being overweight and a 2.8

percentage point increase in the likelihood of obesity. Coefficients on maternal work are consistent

with previous research. Children whose mothers were employed at some point between birth and

kindergarten experience a 1.5 percent increase in BMI. Such children are also 4.7 percentage points

more likely to be overweight and 2.7 percentage points more likely to be obese.

        Substituting the vector of child care arrangements for the indicator of maternal work (Panel

C) leads to a large reduction in the subsidy coefficients, and renders the estimates statistically

insignificant in all models. For example, the coefficient on subsidy receipt is reduced by 53 percent

in the log BMI model and about 44 percent in the overweight and obesity models compared to the

baseline subsidy estimate in Panel A. Coefficients on the child care arrangements, however, imply

positive and statistically significant increases in BMI, overweight, and obesity.        For example,

children participating in relative care are 6.9 percentage points more likely to be overweight and 4.8

percentage points more likely to be obese than their counterparts in parent care. Children attending

center-based care experience the largest increases in each outcome. Such children have BMIs that

are 4.0 percent higher, rates of overweight that 9.9 percentage points higher, and rates of obesity that

are 6.0 percentage points higher. There is also evidence that participation school-based care is

positively associated with children’s weight outcomes, although the effect sizes are not as large as

those for center-based care. Interestingly, rates of overweight and obesity among children in non-

relative care are not significantly different from those in parent care.


                                                    21
          When the full model is estimated (Panel D), the coefficients on child care subsidies

experience a further drop in magnitude and remain statistically insignificant. It is interesting to note

that a similar pattern of results emerges for early maternal employment.                                     Although maternal

employment is initially associated with significant increases in children’s weight outcomes, these

effects attenuate and become imprecisely estimated once the child care controls are added. On the

other hand, the estimates for child care arrangements are largely unchanged by the inclusion of

maternal work. Participation in center-based care continues to be strongly related to children’s

weight outcomes. Children attending this mode of care have BMIs that are 3.7 percent higher, rates

of overweight that 9.0 percentage points higher, and rates of obesity that are 5.5 percentage points

higher than their counterparts in parent care.

          Results presented in Table 3 are consistent with the picture emerging from the descriptive

evidence in Table 1 and 2. Although subsidized children tend to have slightly higher BMIs and are

somewhat more likely to be overweight and obese, these differences are not nearly as large as those

between children in parental and non-parental child care arrangements.                                     Accounting for the

differential participation in child care settings renders the differences in weight outcomes between

subsidized and unsubsidized children statistically insignificant. Variation in employment rates, on

the other hand, does not appear to be responsible for the subsidy-induced changes in children’s

weight.      Rather, the subsidy effects operate through the shifting of children into non-parental

arrangements, where, children have higher BMIs and rates of overweight and obesity. Furthermore,

our results indicate that participation in center-based care is primarily responsible for the larger

weight outcomes among subsidized children. Two pieces of evidence support this claim. Center-

based care is the predominant arrangement among children receiving subsidies, and this child care

setting is consistently associated with the largest increases in BMI, overweight, and obesity.26


26
   We subject this assertion to a more rigorous test. We re-estimate the basic regression of children’s weight outcomes on subsidy
receipt, but only among children in different child care arrangements. In the model using the log of BMI as the dependent variable, the



                                                                 22
          Table 4 examines the persistence of subsidy, maternal work, and child care arrangement

effects. Results in Panel A indicate that the impact of subsidy receipt attenuates between the fall and

spring of kindergarten.             Generally speaking, the subsidy coefficients decrease in magnitude as

compared to those from the fall of kindergarten, and none of the coefficients are statistically

significant. Adding the controls for maternal employment and child care, as shown in Panels B

through D, further reduces the magnitude of the subsidy effects. The impact of early maternal work

also attenuates by the spring of kindergarten. Interestingly, strong associations between child care

arrangements and children’s weight outcomes are still present as of the end of kindergarten. When

the full model is estimated (Panel D), participation in relative care is associated with a 2.1 percent

increase in BMI, center-based care is associated with a 3.8 percent increase in BMI, and school-

based care is associated with a 1.5 percent increase in BMI. Furthermore, center-based care is

expected to increase the prevalence of overweight by 6.8 percentage points and obesity by 7.6

percentage points. School-based care also remains significantly related to overweight and obesity.

Quantile Regression Results

          Having established a relationship between subsidy receipt and children’s weight outcomes at

the upper tail of BMI, we now turn to the quantile regression results, which characterize the entire

distribution of BMI.27 Table 5 shows the estimates for the fall of kindergarten BMI, and Table 6

shows the estimates for the spring of kindergarten BMI. As previously stated, we begin by including

only the measure of child care subsidy receipt, and then we add controls for early maternal work and

child care arrangements. All models show coefficients using the level parameterization of BMI

across the 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 quantiles.                                  County fixed effects are

incorporated into all models.


coefficient on subsidy receipt implies a statistically significant 3.8 percent increase in BMI among children in center-based and family
child care homes. As for the obesity regression, the coefficient on subsidy receipt implies a statistically significant 6.8 percentage point
increase in obesity among such children. Across no other arrangement were any of the subsidy coefficients significant.
27
   We also estimated quantile regression models using ln BMI. The results from these models are very similar to those with the BMI in
terms of both pattern and significance.



                                                                    23
        As shown in Panel A of Table 5, we find evidence of substantial heterogeneity in response to

child care subsidy receipt. For comparison purposes, it is useful to recall that the average effect of

subsidy receipt in the fall of kindergarten is 0.308 BMI points (Panel A, Table 3). When the full

distribution of BMI is characterized, the impact of subsidy receipt ranges from 0.065 to 0.420.

Generally speaking, the magnitude of subsidy effect increases monotonically as children move to

higher BMI quantiles. Throughout the first three quantiles, the coefficient is small in magnitude and

statistically insignificant, suggesting that child care subsidies are not associated with increases in

BMI at the lower end of the distribution. Subsidy receipt, however, is associated with increasingly

large and precisely estimated gains in BMI among children above the median. In particular, we find

that BMIs among subsidized children increase from 0.151 points at the 0.5 quantile to 0.397 points at

the 0.9 quantile, peaking at 0.420 points at the 0.8 quantile. This shift represents an increase of 163

percent.

        Adding the control for maternal employment (Panel B) reduces somewhat the magnitude of

subsidy coefficients across all BMI quantiles, although qualitative story remains the same.

Furthermore, the impact of maternal work does not reveal a consistent pattern over the BMI

distribution, and very few of the coefficients are statistically significant. Incorporating the vector of

child care arrangements (Panel D) renders statistically insignificant all of the coefficients on subsidy

receipt and most of the coefficients on maternal employment.

        As shown in Panel D, an interesting story emerges from the estimates on child care

arrangements. On the one hand, it appears that center-based care leads to comparatively large and

stable increases in BMI throughout most of the distribution. With the exception of the highest BMI

quantile, where the effect is 0.801 points, the impact of center care ranges between 0.301 and 0.483

points over the BMI distribution. A relatively stable effect size throughout the distribution of

children’s BMI amounts to a location shift: as center-based participation increases BMI among

children in the middle of the distribution, children located at other points along the distribution


                                                   24
experience similar increases in BMI, causing the entire distribution to shift to the right.          The

remaining child care arrangements exhibit a different pattern, characterized by BMI increases

concentrated at the lower and upper tails of the distribution. Participation in relative care, for

example, is associated with statistically significant increases in BMI at the 0.1 and 0.2 quantiles,

inconsistent effects throughout much of the middle of the distribution, and a large effect at the 0.9

quantile (0.597 BMI points). Similarly, the only quantile at which non-relative care significantly

raises BMI is 0.1, with an effect size of 0.312 BMI points. Participation in school-based care

significantly increases BMI only among children at the upper tail of the distribution (0.522 BMI

points). Across many of the other quantiles, school settings are associated with reductions in BMI,

although in no case is the estimate statistically significant.

        Quantile regression results based on the spring of kindergarten BMI (Table 6) are quite

similar to the pattern established in the fall of kindergarten. Although the effect sizes attenuate, the

range of subsidy coefficients in Panel A remains large (from 0.021 to 0.537 BMI points) and most of

the coefficients at the upper tail are statistically significant. The relationship between subsidy receipt

and BMI continues to be strongly monotonic: For children below the median BMI, subsidy receipt is

associated with gains ranging from essentially zero to 0.0.86 BMI points. For children above the

median BMI, the gains range from 0.214 to 0.537 BMI points.

        Generally speaking, the pattern of results exhibited in Panel B, C, and D is also broadly

consistent with the fall of kindergarten. Parameter estimates suggest that subsidy receipt remains

significantly related to BMI at the upper tail even after accounting for early maternal work, but the

relationship attenuates after incorporating controls for child care arrangements.         Attendance in

school-based services continues to increase BMI among children at the upper tail, but some of the

significant effects for relative and non-relative care as of the fall of kindergarten are no longer

significant in the spring.   It is interesting to note that the impact of center care tends to increase in

magnitude, become more heterogeneous, and remain highly statistically significant. For children


                                                    25
below the median, center care increases BMI between 0.255 and 0.402 points. For children above

the median, the effect size increases from 0.490 to 0.728 points. It is difficult to interpret these

findings, but we offer two explanations. First, the increased magnitude and heterogeneity reflect the

possibility that children in center care are more likely to enroll in kindergarten programs that are less

attentive to serving healthy foods and allowing children sufficient time to exercise throughout the

day. The other explanation is that any center-induced increase in BMI did not reveal itself in

children’s weight until the spring of kindergarten.

VI. Conclusions

        The U.S. child care subsidy system places considerable emphasis on moving welfare

recipients into work, and keeping those currently employed out of the welfare system. Indeed, a

number of recent studies suggest that a child care subsidy is an effective policy tool for increasing the

labor force participation of single mothers (e.g., Blau & Tekin, 2007). Furthermore, the principle of

“parental choice,” in which families are able to use subsidies to purchase virtually any legally

operating child care service, is beneficial to low-income families struggling to balance work-life

obligations. However, there may be unintended consequences associated with child care subsidies.

In particular, there are a number of design features associated with states’ CCDF plans that create

disincentives for parents to choose high-quality care and for providers to make costly quality-

enhancing improvements (Herbst & Tekin, 2008).           Consequently, a number of observers have

become concerned about the implications of child care subsidies for children’s health and well-being

(e.g., Adams & Rohacek, 2002).

        In this paper, we seek to understand the relationship between child care subsidies, measured

in the year before kindergarten, and children’s weight outcomes throughout kindergarten. Our

findings suggest that child care subsidy receipt is associated with increases in BMI as well as

increases in the likelihood of being overweight and obese. We also find initial support for the claim

that the estimated subsidy effects operate through children’s participation in non-parental child care


                                                   26
settings. Specifically, our results point to enrollments in center-based care as the primary mechanism

through which the subsidy effects operate. Children in this type of arrangement have substantially

higher BMIs and experience a significantly greater likelihood of being overweight and obese. In

light of our results, it is no coincidence that center care is the predominant child care mode among

subsidized children. Estimates from the quantile regression models provide evidence of substantial

heterogeneity in response to child care subsidy receipt: BMI gains due to subsidized care are

dramatically different depending on where children are located in the BMI distribution. Children at

the upper end of the distribution experience BMI gains that are greater than the gains among children

at the lower end. Once again, our quantile regression results imply that center-based care emerges as

a likely candidate to explain the pattern of subsidy effects.

        A possible explanation for these results is that child care subsidies induce mothers to choose

formal arrangements that are of questionable quality. As previously stated, the CCDF’s principle of

“parental choice” allows parents to purchase child care services operating outside states’ regulatory

regimes. Furthermore, conditioning eligibility for subsidies on employment and income creates

challenges for maintaining stable child care arrangements. In particular, if changes in employment

and income are related to lapses in subsidy receipt, such instability could undermine child well-

being. States’ reimbursement rates can also influence quality. If reimbursements are below the

federally recommended level, families may not have access to high-quality care, thereby reducing

incentives for providers to make important quality enhancements.

        Indeed, recent empirical work seems to confirm these critiques. Several studies find that

subsidized children receive lower-quality care than other low-income, unsubsidized children (Adams

et al., 2001; Jones-Branch et al., 2004; Mocan, 2007; Raikes, Raikes, & Wilcox, 2005; Queralt,

Witte, & Greisinger, 2000; Thornburg et al., 2002; Whitebook et al., 2004; Witt, Queralt, & Witte,

2000). As summarized in Story, Kaphingst, and French (2006), another body of evidence suggests

that many child care centers in the U.S. fail to provide children with healthy foods and sufficient


                                                   27
opportunities for physical activity. Finally, a recent analysis by Herbst and Tekin (2008) finds that

subsidized children perform worse on tests of reading and math ability and teacher’s assessments of

externalizing     behavior       problems,      self-control,     and       interpersonal      skills.

Notes: Robust standard errors are in parentheses. Analyses are based on Stata’s ivqte command produced by Frolich & Melly (2008). N=3,113 in all models. The dependent variable is the child’s
BMI, measured in the fall of kindergarten. Unless noted otherwise, all models include the full set variables listed in Table 1, as well as county fixed effects. All models include dummy variables that
equal unity for the child and family controls with missing data. *, **, *** indicate that the coefficient is statistically significant at 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01 levels, respectively.

Notes: Robust standard errors are in parentheses. Analyses are based on Stata’s ivqte command produced by Frolich & Melly (2008). N=3,007 in all models. The dependent variable is the child’s
BMI, measured in the spring of kindergarten. Unless noted otherwise, all models include the full set variables listed in Table 1, as well as county fixed effects. All models include dummy variables
that equal unity for the child and family controls with missing data. *, **, *** indicate that the coefficient is statistically significant at 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01 levels, respectively.
