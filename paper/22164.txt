                                         ABSTRACT

The literature on aid and growth has not found a convincing instrumental variable to identify the
causal effects of aid. This paper exploits an instrumental variable based on the fact that since
1987, eligibility for aid from the International Development Association (IDA) has been based
partly on whether or not a country is below a certain threshold of per capita income. The paper
finds evidence that other donors tend to reinforce rather than compensate for reductions in IDA
aid following threshold crossings. Overall, aid as a share of gross national income (GNI) drops
about 59 percent on average after countries cross the threshold. Focusing on the 35 countries that
have crossed the income threshold from below between 1987 and 2010, a positive, statistically
significant, and economically sizable effect of aid on growth is found. A one percentage point
increase in the aid to GNI ratio from the sample mean raises annual real per capita growth in
gross domestic product by approximately 0.35 percentage points.

1. Introduction
Whether foreign aid causes economic growth in recipient countries is a highly
debated research question. Identification of the causal effect of aid on growth
has been elusive so far due to the endogeneity of aid in growth models. An
instrumental variable is needed to address these problems. However, as
Clemens et al. (2012) conclude in their recent assessment: “the aid-growth
literature does not currently possess a strong and patently valid instrumental
variable with which to reliably test the hypothesis that aid strictly causes
growth.”
    In this paper we contribute to this literature by instrumenting, in an
economic growth equation, the endogenous aid variable exploiting a plausible
quasi-experiment created by the income threshold set by IDA (International
Development Association), the World Bank’s program of grants and
concessionary loans to low-income countries. We exploit this new instrument
to investigate the causal effect of aid on growth.
    This income threshold has been used as a key criterion in allocating scarce
IDA resources since 1987, and is adjusted annually only to take into account
inflation. Other major donors also appear to use the IDA threshold as an
informative signal about where development aid is most needed, and we show
that total aid declines significantly once a recipient country crosses the IDA
income threshold from below. The IDA threshold is nevertheless an arbitrary
income level that does not necessarily represent any structural change in
economic growth. Threshold crossing is thus a plausibly valid instrumental
variable for aid over years for a recipient country in a panel data model that
controls for initial income levels and also includes country and period effects
(we group years into 8 three-year periods).




                                        2
The main concern with successfully identifying an internally consistent
estimate is that some countries might cross the threshold by experiencing a
series of large positive shocks that are eventually reversed, making the
exclusion restriction invalid. We argue that this concern is largely misplaced.
On average, our sample of countries grew faster after crossing the IDA
threshold than before, consistent with the fact that developing countries in
general exhibited better performance in the latter part of our 1987-2010
sample period. Moreover, our empirical growth model accounts for the
differential timing at which countries cross the IDA threshold. In our analysis
we exploit only the data for the countries that cross the threshold from below
during the period studied while our growth model allows countries to grow at
different rates over time (by allowing for country-specific effects on growth
and by allowing conditional convergence). Additionally, countries start at the
beginning of the sample period from different levels below the threshold.
Hence, the differential timing at which countries cross the IDA threshold from
below exploited for identification in our study does not have to be driven by
unobservable shocks.1 We further investigate this threat to our identification
strategy by implementing a battery of tests and robustness checks. In particular,

1
    This assertion applies to countries crossing from below, but perhaps not to the smaller set of
countries crossing the threshold from above; at least they display systematic negative growth
rates. Moreover, IDA policies are premised on the expectation of growth and eventual
graduation, and instances of crossing the threshold from above are dealt with in a more ad hoc
fashion. In such cases, IDA has often been “reluctant to accept renewed claims on its scarce
concessional resources, especially if this would reward poor performance” (Kapur et al., 1997).
Crossing from above and from below may therefore have highly asymmetric effects on aid,
and in turn on subsequent growth. In particular, crossing from above would likely be a weaker
instrument for aid, and its effects would be less precisely estimated due to the smaller sample
of relevant countries. We therefore focus only on the countries that cross the IDA threshold
from below.




                                                 3
we fail to reject the null hypothesis of no serial autocorrelation in the error
term of the model implied by the threat to the validity of our instrument posed
above. We also show that results are robust to controlling for one and two
period lags of growth, which would not be the case if the country receives a
transitory positive shock around the time of crossing which is eventually
reversed. Importantly, we use an alternative instrumental variable based on a
smoothed income trajectory which is unaffected by country specific
idiosyncratic shocks and obtain similar results. All in all, these and other
robustness checks do not point toward rejecting our identification strategy.
    Using a sample of 35 countries that crossed the IDA threshold from below
between 1987 and 2010, we find that a one percent increase in the aid to GNI
ratio raises the annual real per capita short term GDP growth rate by 0.031
percentage points. The mean aid to GNI ratio at the crossing is 0.09, so a one
percentage point increase in the aid to GNI ratio raises annual real per capita
GDP growth by approximately 0.35 percentage points. This effect is about
1.75 times as large as those reported by Clemens et al. (2012). Using OLS
with fixed effects and lagging aid by a period, they find that a one percentage
point increase in aid/GDP (at aid levels similar to our sample mean) is
followed by at most a 0.2 percentage-point increase in growth of real GDP per
capita. We find similar-sized effects in our sample, without instrumenting for
aid but merely lagging it by a period and including fixed effects. We also
present evidence consistent with the possibility that OLS estimates suffer from
attenuation bias due to measurement error in aid, which is exacerbated when
the variability in the aid to GNI ratios is exploited to identify the effect of aid
on growth in a fixed effects or first-differenced growth equation commonly
used in the literature. Thus, one should expect that a valid 2SLS produces




                                        4
larger estimates than OLS. Naturally, this could also be the case if growth
affects aid levels.
    The sizable effect of aid on growth we find may be attributable in part to
the fact that our sample consists of low-income countries that successfully
crossed the IDA threshold at some point between 1987 and 2010. Aid may
have been more effective in these countries--e.g. due to better economic
policies and lower corruption -- than in countries remaining below the
threshold. Relative to middle-income countries, countries in our sample likely
face more stringent financial constraints, which again should make aid effects
stronger. Furthermore, it is possible that reductions in aid after crossing the
IDA threshold may have a larger negative effect on growth than any positive
effects from aid increases, due to adjustment costs. We provide suggestive
evidence, however, that our results might have meaningful external validity to
the remaining poor countries as they grow closer to the IDA threshold.
    A simple growth accounting exercise and the coefficient on aid in
investment regressions suggest that investment could be an important channel
through which aid affects growth. We show that the investment rate drops
following the reduction in aid. Increasing the aid to GNI ratio by one
percentage point increases the investment to GDP ratio by 0.54 percentage
points, although this coefficient is generally not significant. The magnitude of
the effects on growth and investment is consistent with the average capital
stock to GDP ratio for the sample countries, which we estimate to be
approximately two.
    As in most of the literature relying on panel data covering a short period
of time, we estimate the short-run effect of aid on growth, an effect that
mainly operates through physical investment. In the long run, aid could affect




                                       5
growth through several other channels, but its identification requires
exogenous changes in aid over a very long period of time. Our instrument does
not provide such exogenous variability to estimate that parameter.2
       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews
past studies testing the causal effect of aid on growth. Section 3 describes the
data and the sample. Section 4 presents the effect of IDA threshold-crossing
on the volume of aid received. Section 5 presents the empirical model and the
baseline results. Section 6 explores some mechanisms and Section 7 discusses
the external validity of our results. Section 8 concludes.

2. Previous Aid-Growth Studies
Following the influential studies by Boone (1996) and Burnside and Dollar
(2000), many others have emerged, but a basic consensus is still absent.
Easterly et al. (2004) show that the key finding of Burnside and Dollar (2000)
– namely that aid contributes to growth but only where economic policies are
favorable – is not robust to the use of an updated and enlarged dataset. Rajan
and Subramanian (2008) and Arndt, Jones and Tarp (2010) are only two of
many recent papers that review the bulk of the existing literature yet arrive at
differing conclusions.3
      Identifying the causal effect of aid on growth is fraught with difficulties.
First, aid relative to GNI is likely measured with error. The problem of
measurement error is exacerbated as the estimated model is often demeaned or
first differenced to eliminate the country fixed effects. Second, identification
2
    Regressing the average growth rate over a long period of time on the average aid in that
period does not identify the long-term effect of aid on economic growth, even if aid were
exogenous in that equation.

evidence, and practice of foreign aid.

might be confounded by unobserved factors that determine both economic
growth and aid. Third, growth itself could also affect aid. In response to these
potential problems, previous studies have introduced different instrumental
variables to identify the causal effect of aid on growth. In this section we
briefly review the major identification strategies exploited in the literature.
    Studies using cross-sectional data often rely on population size, economic
policies and donor-recipient political connections as instruments for aid (e.g.,
Boone, 1996; Burnside and Dollar, 2000; Rajan and Subramanian, 2008).
These instruments are likely to violate the exclusion restriction, as they are
correlated with observable and plausibly also unobserved country-level
characteristics that also contribute to growth (Hansen and Tarp, 2001). For
example, population size can affect economic growth through channels other
than aid (Bazzi and Clemens, 2013). Donor-recipient ties (e.g. colonization,
trade or migration) that are correlated with aid flows can also affect growth
indirectly through the institutional environment (Acemoglu, Johnson, and
Robinson, 2001) or other channels.
    Other studies relying on panel data control for time-invariant determinants
of growth by first differencing the data or by conditioning on country fixed
effects. These studies focus mainly on the short term effect of aid on growth.
Many such studies adopt a dynamic panel model and employ difference or
system GMM estimators, instrumenting for current aid with lagged values of
income and aid, and with other standard cross-country regressors (e.g., Hansen
and Tarp, 2001 and Rajan and Subramanian, 2008). However, recent studies
show that GMM estimators of dynamic panel models using all mechanical
instruments are unstable and potentially severely biased in finite samples, due
to the problem of many and weak instruments (Roodman, 2007, 2009a, 2009b;




                                         7
Bazzi and Clemens, 2013; Bun and Windmeijer, 2010). System GMM
estimators, in addition, use additional instruments and require additional
assumptions on exclusion restrictions.
    Sharing the spirit of our paper, several recent studies exploit
donor-recipient connections interacted with over-time variations in total donor
contributions. Werker et al. (2009) instrument for aid with the interaction
between the price of oil and a dummy for whether recipient countries are
Muslim, and find a small and marginally significant effect of lagged aid on
growth using annual data. However, using four-year period averages, they find
no significant effect of (contemporaneous) aid on growth. Nunn and Qian
(2013) find that humanitarian aid extends civil war, using variation over time
in U.S. wheat harvests to instrument for the amount of humanitarian aid that a
country receives. Temple and Van de Sijpe (2014) find that aid increases net
imports and total consumption (both as shares of GDP) by constructing a
synthetic measure of aid by taking each recipient country’s share of aid in a
donor’s aid budget in an initial period and multiplying it by the donor’s total
aid budget in the current period. Dreher and Langlotz (2015) use the
interaction between donor government fractionalization (by party) and a
recipient government’s probability of receiving aid from the donor to
instrument for aid, and find no significant effect of it on growth. Arndt et al.
(forthcoming) review a range of aid-growth studies published since 2008 that
attempt to address the endogeneity of aid in various ways (e.g.. Clemens et al.,
2012 and Bruckner, 2013), and conclude that “the large majority…have found
positive impacts,” particularly when effects are assessed over longer time
periods. While these papers rely mostly on historical relationships between
bilateral donors and recipients or natural shocks in grain outputs, we adopt a




                                         8
different identification strategy, exploiting a natural experiment based on
declines in aid after developing countries surpass a pre-determined level of
GNI per capita. Because instrumental variable-based estimates reflect local
average treatment effects for the complier group (Angrist, Imbens and Rubin,
1996), our identification strategy only identifies the effect for low-income
countries that experience changes in aid after crossing the IDA graduation
threshold.

3. Data and Sample
The data for this study are primarily from two sources. Income, investment,
economic growth, and other country characteristics are from the World Bank’s
World Development Indicators (WDI). 4 Aid data are obtained from the
OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC).5 Following much of the
previous literature, aid is measured by total net Official Development
Assistance (ODA) disbursements as a share of GNI, in current US dollars.6
       We identify 35 countries that crossed the IDA income threshold from
below between 1987 and 2010.7 Table 1 lists these countries and their years
of crossing. For countries that crossed the threshold more than once, in our
baseline specification we consider only the first crossing in defining the
instrumental variable. We show, however, that our results are robust to
changes in this criterion. Following the literature, we smooth out fluctuations

    Sao Tome and Principe crossed the threshold in 2009. It has only 2 periods of data in the

in the annual data by using period averages. Due to the length of our panel
dataset, and because IDA has a three-year replenishment cycle, we group
years into 8 three-year periods that roughly coincide with the IDA
replenishment periods. 8 The first period, with data from calendar years
1987-1989, corresponds roughly to IDA8, covering fiscal years 1988-1990
(July 1, 1987 to June 30, 1990). The final period, with data from 2008-2010,
roughly corresponds to IDA15 (July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2011). Donors pledge
contributions for each replenishment period, rather than annually. Moreover,
policies for allocating IDA funds (e.g. the relative weights assigned to poverty,
economic policies, and quality of governance) among eligible recipients are
often modified between IDA periods but never within an IDA period. For this
reason country allocations should be more correlated from one year to the next
within an IDA period than across two replenishment periods. The 3-year IDA
periods are therefore a natural way of grouping the data. The timing of actual
graduations from IDA also tends to coincide with the end of replenishment
periods. The baseline sample contains 247 country-period observations.
      Online Appendix Table A lists the definitions and data sources for all
variables, and Online Appendix Table B presents summary statistics for the
baseline sample. Real per capita GDP of the sample countries grew at an
average annual rate of 2.9%. ODA equaled about 8% of GNI for a typical
country in a typical year in the sample. Of total ODA, about 9% is from IDA,


8
    Many recent panel studies often group years in 4- or 5-year periods. Temple and Van de
Sijpe (2014) use 3-year periods. As Clemens et al. (2012, p.594) observe, “The question of
when to test for growth impacts plagues the entire growth literature, not just aid-growth
research. Empirical research on the determinants of growth cannot escape the selection of a
fixed observation period,” but there is no consensus regarding the time intervals over which to
study growth.

67% is bilateral aid from DAC countries, 2% is bilateral aid from non-DAC
countries, and 23% is from non-IDA multilateral agencies. The mean value of
ODA/GNI is 8.5% in periods when countries are under the income threshold
(including the periods in which they cross), and 7.4% in post-crossing periods.
The mean of IDA/ODA declines from 11.8% to 5.5% post-crossing, the
largest relative drop among the four donor groupings.

4. The IDA Threshold and Aid
Beginning in 1987, a major criterion for IDA eligibility has been whether or
not a country is below a certain threshold of per capita income, measured in
current US dollars. This “operational threshold” was established for the
purpose of rationing scarce IDA funds. Prior to 1987, a higher threshold (now
called the “historical cutoff”) had been in effect, but economic crises in
developing countries increased the demand for IDA funds in the early- and
mid-1980s, necessitating a new lower cutoff (World Bank, 1989). Figure 1
shows the evolution of the IDA operational threshold converted in current US
dollars between 1987 and 2010. It was originally set at $580, and has been
adjusted annually only for inflation, as measured by the SDR deflator.9 By
2010, the threshold had increased to $1175.
      The other criterion for IDA eligibility is lack of creditworthiness, defined
as the inability “…to service new external debt at market interest rates over
the long term” (World Bank, 1989). China and several other countries
graduated from IDA (i.e. were declared ineligible for new loans) while they


9
    The SDR (“Special Drawing Rights,” the unit of account for the International Monetary
Fund) deflator is a weighted average of the GDP deflators for the U.S., Japan, the U.K. and
the euro area. As shown in Figure 1, the threshold declined slightly for several years between
1998 and 2002, because the SDR deflator was negative.




                                             11
were still under the income threshold, because they were deemed creditworthy.
Conversely, Bolivia’s graduation from IDA was delayed for many years after
it crossed the income threshold due to lack of creditworthiness. The World
Bank’s assessments of country creditworthiness are highly confidential (Moss
and Majerowicz, 2012) and are not even available to most staff members.
However, small island economies – those with populations below 1.5 million
– are presumptively judged as not creditworthy, due to their vulnerability to
shocks.
    In contrast to threshold crossing, actual graduation from IDA is likely to
be endogenous to economic performance, policies and vulnerability to shocks,
even when controlling for a continuous measure of per capita income.
Graduation itself, as opposed to threshold crossing, would thus not be a valid
instrument for aid.
    Once a country has exceeded the IDA income threshold and is judged to
be creditworthy, it is considered on track for “graduation” from IDA.
Allowance is made for the possibility of income fluctuations, so lending
volumes typically are reduced (and repayments accelerated) only after a
country has remained over the threshold for three consecutive years. Thus, in
most cases, threshold crossing will result in reductions of IDA flows
beginning in the next replenishment period, not in the current one (World
Bank, 2010). The decline in aid from IDA is amplified by similar behavior
from other donors. Some agencies, such as the African Development Bank
(AfDB) and Asian Development Bank (AsDB), explicitly use the IDA income
threshold in their own aid eligibility criteria. Other donors often view crossing
the IDA threshold as a signal that countries are in less need of aid and cut their
own aid, reinforcing the decline in aid from IDA (Moss and Majerowicz, 2012;




                                       12
World Bank, 1989). As a result, although IDA contributes less than one-tenth
of the total aid to a typical recipient, crossing the IDA threshold may have a
sizable effect on total aid.
    The relevance of IDA threshold crossing as an instrument for aid can be
tested by looking at its effects on total aid and aid from different donors. We
distinguish among four groups of donors: IDA, DAC (OECD Development
Assistance Committee) bilateral donors, non-DAC bilateral donors, and other
multilateral donors. Following the consensus in the literature (Clemens et al.,
2012), lagged aid is the main explanatory variable in our growth regressions,
so our instrumental variable is a dummy indicating whether the country has
crossed the IDA threshold at least two periods earlier. Throughout the paper
we use 𝑡 to represent a specific year and 𝑠 to represent a specific period,

where 𝑠 includes years 𝑡 − 2, 𝑡 − 1, and 𝑡 . We define 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!!

equal to 1 if a country’s first threshold crossing during the sample period took

place at least two periods before period 𝑠. Otherwise, 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!! equals 0.

We estimate the following equation:

     𝐴𝑖𝑑!!"!! = 𝛽! 𝑦!"!! + 𝛽! 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!! + 𝛽! 𝑃𝑜𝑝!"!! + 𝜆! + 𝜏!!! +

                                  𝑣! !"!!    (1)

The dependent variable 𝐴𝑖𝑑!!"!! is the log of average ratio of aid from donor

type 𝑗 to GNI or the log ratio of average total aid (i.e., the sum of aid from all

donor sources) to GNI for country 𝑖 in period 𝑠 − 1, that is, 𝐴𝑖𝑑!!"!! =




                                        13
             !"!!
ln[(∑ !!!!          !"!!
              !"!!"!!
                           )/3]. 10 In this analysis we use 𝐴𝑖𝑑!!"!! as the dependent

variable because it is the key explanatory variable when we estimate the effect
of aid on economic growth in the current period, as will become clear in the
next section. 𝑦 denotes log real per capita GDP measured in constant 2000
US dollars. 𝑦!"!! is measured as log real per capita GDP in the second year
of the last period 𝑠 − 1, and hence it is equal to 𝑦!"!! . 𝑃𝑜𝑝!"!! is the log of

average population of period 𝑠 − 1. 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!! is defined as earlier. This

second lag is introduced because the IDA graduation process typically begins
only three years after a country crosses the threshold, i.e. in the next
replenishment period. The crossing status lagged one period relative to aid
also allows time for other donors to respond to threshold crossings.
       Table 2 reports the results of estimating Equation 1. For Columns 1 to 5,
respectively, the dependent variables are the one-period lag of the logarithm of
aid share of GNI from (1) IDA, (2) DAC countries, (3) non-DAC countries, (4)
multilateral agencies except for IDA, and (5) all donors. To be conservative,
we use two alternative methods to conduct statistical inference throughout the
paper. We report both robust standard errors clustered at the country level and
the standard errors from the clustered wild bootstrap procedure following
Cameron et al. (2008); see Appendix A for a more detailed explanation. Either
approach yields very similar statistical inferences; for brevity, we will focus
our discussion on the clustered standard errors.
       We find that following IDA threshold-crossing, IDA flows as a share of
GNI ratio dropped, on average, by about 92% (i.e., 1 − 𝑒 !!.! ). Other donors

10
     We follow the convention of the majority of the literature and measure both GNI and ODA
in current US dollars, the same units IDA uses to define its income threshold. A minority of
studies, such as Boone (1996), use GNI in purchasing power parity terms, however.




                                              14
also cut their aid substantially. Estimates of the coefficients associated with
threshold crossing are negative and large in magnitude. Except for aid from
non-DAC donors, the estimated coefficients are statistically significant at
conventional levels. The total aid to GNI ratio dropped, on average, by 59%
(𝑖. 𝑒. , 1 − 𝑒 !!.!! ). Higher income levels are a strong predictor of aid: a
one-percent increase in real per capita GDP is associated with reductions in
aid of about 8.6 percent from IDA, 1.4 percent from DAC countries, 4.7
percent from non-DAC countries, 2.5 percent from other multilateral agencies,
and 1.5 percent for the overall ODA to GNI ratio.

       Potentially, any crossing dummy variable 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!! with 𝑝 ≥ 1 is

a valid instrument. Here we rely on the one that best predicts aid/GNI, namely,

𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!! .11 In reduced-form tests (not reported in tables), we find that

𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!! has the strongest and most significant effect on growth, of

about -2.4 percentage points.
       We conduct two further checks. First, results are robust to controlling for
a quadratic relationship between aid and log initial income level (results are
shown in Online Appendix Table D). The coefficient of the crossing dummy
for ODA aid over GNI, for instance, is now -0.94 and statistically significant
at the one percent level, similar to that in Table 2 (i.e., -0.876). Second, we
conduct a placebo test to ensure that these effects are not a statistical artifact.
Specifically, we replace the true IDA threshold value with a false threshold

11
     In Appendix Table C we report the results of including 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!! , 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!! , and
𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!! in the model while otherwise retaining the specification of Equation (1).
Column 1 presents the results. Coefficients associated with all three variables are negative and
statistically significant. However, the one associated with 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!! has the largest 𝑡
statistic. Reduced-form results are in column (2) of Online Appendix Table C.




                                               15
equal to 50% of the true value, and re-estimate equation 1 using a
threshold-crossing dummy variable based on this false threshold. In the
analysis we retain only country-period observations prior to the period in
which countries cross the actual threshold, so the regression sample is
unaffected by the effect of actually crossing the true threshold.12 Crossing the
false threshold has no significant effect on aid results are reported in Online
Appendix Table E).
       Another concern is that IDA threshold crossing may not be a good
instrument to identify the direct or structural effect of aid on growth, because
country leaders may endogenously alter policies to take advantage of potential
complementarity (or substitutability) between aid revenues and policies. Ex
ante it is unclear whether and how aid might affect the quality of
policymaking— e.g., aid could facilitate policy reform if it is used to
compensate losers, or worsen policy by stimulating rent seeking (Rodrik,
1996)—and whether country leaders can engineer quick policy changes to
have an immediate effect on growth along desired directions. Thus, how aid
affects policies is an empirical question. We investigate this potential threat to
our identification strategy by estimating equation (1) after replacing aid as the
dependent variable by a set of variables measuring policymaking and
institutional quality. These variables include measures of civil liberty and
political rights from Freedom House, the World Bank CPIA (Country Policy
and Institutional Assessment), broad money (M2) as a percentage of GDP,
inflation as measured by changes in the GDP deflator, and dummy variables
indicating respectively bank, currency and debt crises (see Appendix Table A

12
     For sample countries with per capita GNI always above the fake threshold, the crossing
dummy is replaced with 0.




                                             16
for definitions of these variables). Crossing the IDA income threshold turns
out to have no statistically significant effect on any of the policy variables
considered (results reported in Online Appendix Table F). We show below
that our growth results are also robust to controlling for these variables.



5. Foreign Aid and Economic Growth

5.1 An illustration
The effects of aid should be most pronounced two periods after crossing, since
aid volumes drop most precipitously in the period after crossing (see earlier
discussion of results in Appendix Table C). To see this, for the group of
countries that cross the threshold at least two periods before the end of our
sample period, Figure 2 shows the relationship between per capita real GDP
growth and the once-lagged log aid to GNI ratio during the second period after
each country crosses the threshold. We first-difference the two variables to get
rid of the time-invariant effects specific to each country. Almost all countries
experienced a significant drop in aid compared to the last period, and larger
reductions in aid are associated with larger declines in growth.13

5.2 Econometric models
We postulate the following model in order to test the null hypothesis that aid
does not affect growth:
            𝑔!" = 𝛽! 𝑦!"!! + 𝛽! 𝐴𝑖𝑑!"!! + 𝑿!" ⋅ 𝛽! + 𝜆! + 𝜏! + 𝜀!" ,                (2)

13
     The fitted line has a slope equal to 0.8 and a standard error equal to 0.4. Our aid and growth
measures both have some measure of national income in their denominators. In controlling for
both income (per capita) and population, however, and measuring them (and aid/GNI) in logs,
we minimize the possibility of spurious correlation, produced by errors in national accounts or
population estimates (Kronmal, 1993).




                                                 17
where 𝑠 denotes non-overlapping 3-year periods. Period 𝑠 includes years
𝑡, 𝑡 − 1, 𝑡 − 2 . 𝑦 denotes log real per capita GDP. 𝑔!" , constructed as
(𝑦!" − 𝑦!"!! )/3, is the average log difference of real GDP per capita of
country 𝑖 in period 𝑠. 𝑦!"!! is measured as the log real per capita GDP in
the second year of the previous period (i.e., 𝑦!"!! ).14 We expect 𝛽! , which
captures conditional convergence, to be negative. 𝐴𝑖𝑑!"!! is the log of
average aid received by country 𝑖 as a share of GNI in the previous period.15
We use the one-period lag of aid instead of contemporaneous aid to allow time
for aid to take effect (Clemens et al., 2012). 𝑿!" is a vector of time-varying
variables, including log population, assumed to be strictly exogenous. In the
literature, population is almost always on the right hand side of aid allocation
regressions (smaller countries receive more aid per capita), and it is commonly
on the right hand side in growth regressions (usually with scale effects in mind)
as well. While here we show only a parsimonious model of time-varying
variables, we show later that our results remain robust to controlling for other
time-varying growth determinants. 𝜆! is the country i fixed effect. 𝜏!!! is
the period s fixed effect.
       We use three alternative empirical methods in this subsection to estimate

14
     Notice that, by construction, 𝑦!"!! is not mechanically correlated with the dependent
variable. Some studies in the literature use per capita real GDP in purchasing power parity
terms to measure income level and to calculate growth (e.g., Boone, 1996). Real per capita
GDP based on current exchange rates (in constant dollar terms, and using the Atlas method)
and real per capita GDP in PPP terms are highly correlated (at over .95) across countries in
our sample. Growth rates constructed from the two versions are essentially the same. We use
per capita GDP based on current exchange rates (in constant dollars) because there are fewer
missing observations in the WDI database than for the PPP measure. Using instead the PPP
measure we obtain almost identical results for our basic specifications in Table 3.
15
     For further justification of why we use the log form, see Appendix B. In addition, the
results are essentially unchanged when 𝐴𝑖𝑑!"!! is measured as the ODA share of GDP.




                                              18
equation (2). Each method requires particular assumptions. We thus report
baseline results and a series of robustness tests using each of the three
methods.
     The standard way to estimate equation (2) is to eliminate the unobservable
country-specific effects, 𝜆! , by including a set of country dummy variables in
the model, which is equivalent to demeaning equation (2) and estimating the
transformed equation by OLS. This estimator, however, is potentially
inconsistent due to aid being also affected by growth, measurement error, and
time-varying unobservable variables. We therefore instrument aid in period
𝑠 − 1 (𝑖. 𝑒. , 𝐴𝑖𝑑!"!! ) with a dummy variable indicating whether the country
has crossed the IDA threshold by the end of period 𝑠 − 2 , that is,

𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!! . To address the endogeneity of the initial income level 𝑦!"!! ,

we instrument the initial income level with further lags of the income level.
     Our instrumental variable is based on per capita (nominal) GNI crossing
the IDA threshold two periods earlier. Per capita (nominal) GNI level in
period 𝑠 − 2 is correlated with the idiosyncratic shock to (real) economic
growth of that period，𝜀!"!! . Thus, estimating equation 2 by means of the fixed
effects estimator, which first de-means the equation, mechanically introduces
a correlation between the instrumental variable and the demeaned error term,
𝜀!" = (𝜀!" − 𝜀! ). However, if 𝜀!" is not serially correlated, the correlation
between 𝜀!" and 𝜀!"!! will be small if the time dimension of the panel is
large. Our sample has 8 periods, which is not considered short in the literature.
We also show below that we do not reject the null hypothesis of no serial
correlation of the error terms in equation (2).16 We use two other methods to

16
  When the panel is long, 𝜀!" is less correlated with the error term from a particular period,
and the bias will be small. To get a sense of the potential bias in the 2SLS fixed effect model




                                              19
circumvent this potential problem. The first approach is to first-difference
equation (2) and estimating the following equation:
         Δ𝑔!" = 𝛽! Δ𝑦!"!! + 𝛽! Δ𝐴𝑖𝑑!"!! + Δ𝑿!" ⋅ 𝛽! + Δ𝜏! + Δ𝜀!", (4)

In using Δ𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!! to instrument Δ𝐴𝑖𝑑!"!! , our identification strategy

exploits only the sharp variability in aid at the period after crossing the IDA
threshold. Under treatment heterogeneity, both in terms of the effect of
threshold-crossing on aid and of the latter on economic growth, this strategy
will identify a particular local average causal effect. Alternatively, we can also

use just 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!! to instrument for Δ𝐴𝑖𝑑!"!! .

     The validity of the exclusion restriction in this case requires the error
terms 𝜀!" to be serially uncorrelated, i.e., the instrumental variable will be
invalid if the unobservable idiosyncratic error term in the growth equation is
serially correlated up to two periods. Below we investigate the validity of this
assumption.
     In the first differenced model, even if the error terms were i.i.d., the
transformed error terms will not be, and will exhibit first-order serial
correlation. Standard GMM inference when using optimal weights takes into
account this feature while 2SLS does not. Thus, through the rest of the paper,


due to the mechanical correlation between the instrument and the demeaned error term, we
conduct a Monte Carlo simulation. We assume the error term is i.i.d. We use the predicted
                                                                                        !"#
values from the OLS FE model and add an i.i.d. error to simulate the outcome variable (𝑔!"  ).
                                         !"#                     !"#
We reconstruct our instrument as 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!!       = 𝟏{𝑦!"!! + 𝑔!"  ≥ 𝑦!!! }, where 𝑦! is
the IDA threshold in the second year of period 𝑠. In the FE model, the instrument is thus
mechanically correlated with the demeaned error term. We then estimate the 2SLS FE model
              !"#
using 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!! as the instrumental variable for aid and gauge the magnitude of the bias.
We repeat this procedure 1,000 times, take the mean of 2SLS FE estimate and compare it with
the OLS FE estimate (the true parameter). We estimate a negligible bias of less than 2% of the
true parameter value.




                                             20
as in the previous section, we rely on two alternative methods to conduct
statistical inference. We report in parentheses robust standard errors clustered
at the country level, which allow for within-country correlation. We also
report in brackets the standard errors from the wild clustered bootstrap
procedure. Both methods render similar statistical conclusions for our main
parameters.
       The second alternative to the 2SLS-FE model relies on a smoothing
method of the latent process that determines our instrumental variable.
Intuitively, we form a “synthetic control” for each crossing country using
countries that are not in our sample. The synthetic control is constructed in
such a way that the distance between income trajectories of the crossing
country and its synthetic control is minimized. We then use the income
trajectories of the synthetic control to predict the year of crossing, which is a
function of shocks to other countries. Under the assumption that shocks across
countries are not correlated (after controlling for all the covariates in equation
(2)), the predicted crossing is not correlated with 𝜀!"!! .
       Specifically, we proceed to construct our synthetic control as follows. We
include a panel of 130 other developing countries that were official DAC aid
recipient countries between 1987 and 2010, together with the 35 countries in
our original sample.17 We demean all the series in our extended panel (of 165
countries) by projecting the annual log of nominal per capita GNI onto a set of
country fixed effects, denoted 𝑦! . We then take the residuals, 𝑒!" . For each of
the 35 countries in our working sample, we construct a set of weights

w! ∈ w! , w! , . . . , w!    bounded between 0 and 1 for the 130 recipient

17
     Since both our sample and the extended dataset are unbalanced panels, for each of the 35
countries in our sample we use only a balanced panel of available donors.




                                              21
countries such that the following distance function is minimized:

                    𝐷! = ||𝒆! −         𝑤! ⋅ 𝒆! ||,                           (3)
                                    !

where || ⋅ || is the Euclidean distance operator. The vector 𝒆 includes the
residuals 𝑒!" . For each country i, we use all the sample years to minimize the
influence of a given observation around the period of crossing the IDA
                                                               ∗
threshold. Denote the optimal weight assigned to country j as w!" . We then

                        ∗
define 𝑒!" =         ! w!"   ⋅ 𝑒!" , and construct the predicted log per capita nominal

GNI as 𝑦!" = 𝑦! + 𝑒!" .18 Since 𝑦!" is, by the nature of construction, plausibly
uncorrelated with the error in equations (2), the predicted crossing of the IDA
threshold based on exp (𝑦!" ) is also likely to be uncorrelated with the error
                                                                       !"#$
term. Accordingly, the predicted crossing two periods earlier, 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!! ,

satisfies the exclusion restriction needed for identification, and is a valid
instrumental variable for 𝐴𝑖𝑑!"!! . On the other hand, due to the limited
number of comparison countries, predicted crossing may contain measurement
error from an imperfect synthetic matching, which in turn results in a weaker
first stage. For 10 out of 35 countries, the predicted period of crossing differs
from the actual period.19


18
     This algorithm is in the spirit of the synthetic control approach in Abadie et al. (2010).
19
     Using the predicted crossing as the instrumental variable introduces sampling error not
accounted for in the synthetic control step, which leads to bias in the estimation of the
standard error. Usually this is adjusted by bootstrapping the whole procedure. We did not do
this because bootstrap fails for the K-nearest neighbor matching (Abadie and Imbens, 2008).
The intuition is that in the K-nearest neighbor matching the number of matches does not
increase smoothly with the sample size. Synthetic matching does allow the number of matches
to rise as the sample size increases, but the increase is not smooth everywhere because we
restrict the weights to be bounded between 0 and 1. More sophisticated bootstrap procedures

5.3 Baseline results
Table 3 reports the baseline results from estimating the models discussed in
the previous subsection. Column 1 reports the estimate of equation (2) without
instrumenting aid, while column 2 reports the estimate of equation (4) also
without instrumenting aid. Columns 3 through 7 are all estimated by the 2SLS
estimator where we instrument only for aid. Column 3 estimates equation (2)
using 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!! as the instrument for 𝐴𝑖𝑑!"!! . Column 4 uses the
crossings based on predicted per capita GNI from the smoothing exercise,
        !"#$
𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!! , as the instrumental variable. Finally, columns 5 to 7 report

estimates of equation (4) using respectively Δ𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!! , 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!!
            !"#$
and 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!! as the instrumental variable.

     The fixed effect model in Column 1 and first difference estimate in
Column 2 show that aid is positively correlated with real economic growth.
The estimated coefficient is statistically significant at the 5% level, but is
small in magnitude. A one percent increase in the aid to GNI ratio increases
annual real per capita GDP growth by 0.011 and 0.013 percentage points.
     Studies on aid and growth typically calculate the increase in annual real
per capita GDP growth rate in percentage points implied by a one percentage
point increase in ODA’s share of GNI. Because we take logs of ODA/GNI, the
implied effect of a percentage point increase in ODA/GNI depends on its level.
We use the average aid to GNI ratio at the period of crossing (i.e., 0.09)


may recover the correct inference, but we are not aware of a widely accepted method (also see
Imbens and Wooldridge (2009) for a discussion of this issue).




                                             23
because this is the most relevant value given our identification strategy. The
OLS estimate in Column 1 suggests that a one percentage point increase in the
aid to GNI ratio from the average level at the period of crossing is associated
with a 0.12 percentage point increase in real per capita GDP growth. The
result in Column 2 implies that a 1 percentage point increase in the aid to GNI
ratio from the same level is associated with a 0.14 percentage point increase in
growth, consistent with the magnitudes obtained by Clemens et al. (2012).
They address endogeneity of aid simply by lagging it one period in a
fixed-effects regression, as in our Column 1, and find that a one percentage
point increase in aid/GDP from the sample mean increases annual real per
capita GDP growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points in the next (4-year) period.
Werker et al. (2009) estimate a slightly larger effect of 0.22 percentage points
instrumenting aid with the interaction between oil and a dummy indicating a
Muslim country.
       Columns 3 through 7 are estimated using the 2SLS method. The point
estimates of the aid coefficient are more than twice as large as those estimated

by OLS. In column 3 we use 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!! as the instrument for 𝐴𝑖𝑑!"!! .

Now a one percent increase in the aid to GNI ratio raises growth by 0.028
percentage points. The first stage is strong, with an F-statistic of about 16.
Growth is negatively correlated with lagged income, supporting conditional
convergence.20 In column 4 we use the predicted crossings based on the
                                            !"#$
smoothed per capita GNI trajectory, 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!! , as the instrument. The


20
     Column 3 of Appendix Table C presents the estimates of the same specification as in
Column 3 of Table 3, but using 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!! , 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!! , and 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!! as
instrumental variables. The point estimate of the effect of aid on growth remains very similar,
but the first stage is weaker than in our baseline specification.




                                                24
estimated coefficient associated with 𝐴𝑖𝑑!"!! increases slightly to 0.035, and

is statistically significant at the 5% level. The first stage is weaker with an
F-statistic of 7.4. We also report the Anderson-Rubin (AR) 95% confidence
intervals for the coefficient associated with aid. These confidence intervals are
robust to potential weak instruments (Finlay and Magnusson, 2009). Almost
all of these confidence intervals are greater than 0. Note the similarity of the
point estimates of the effect of aid on growth in columns 3 and 4.
       Columns 5 through 7 estimate the first differenced model in equation 4.
The coefficients are all larger than those in Column 3 and Column 4. Column

5 uses Δ𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!! as the instrumental variable for Δ𝐴𝑖𝑑!"!! . In this

specification, we estimate the coefficient of aid using only the variability from
the one period after crossing. The aid coefficient is 0.047. Column 6 uses

𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!! as the instrumental variable for Δ𝐴𝑖𝑑!"!! . The first stage and

the estimated coefficients are essentially unchanged from those in column 5.
                                              !"#$
Column 7 uses the predicted crossing, 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!"!! , as the instrument. The

first stage is strong, with an F-statistic of 24. The aid coefficient is 0.055,
statistically significant at the 1% level. Overall, our instrumental variable
estimates are robust and consistently larger than the OLS estimates.21
       As discussed earlier, for the first differenced model, our instrumental
variable will be invalid if the unobservable idiosyncratic error term in the
growth equation (equation 2) is serially correlated. We test for the presence of
serial auto-correlation in the error terms in equation 2 following Arellano and
Bond (1991). The Arrellano-Bond test for serial correlation tests the 𝑛!!

21
     If we re-estimate the model in column 3 of Table 3 while including quadratic and cubic
terms of 𝑦!"!! , the results remain similar (as shown in Online Appendix Table H).

order of serial correlation of the first differenced error to infer the (𝑛 − 1)!!
order of serial correlation of the error terms in the original equation (see also
Roodman, 2009a). We report the 𝑝 −values of the Arellano-Bond test for
AR(2) after estimations in Columns 5, 6, and 7. None of the tests rejects the
null hypothesis of no serial correlation in the errors in equation 2.
    So far we have treated 𝐴𝑖𝑑!"!! as the only endogenous variable.
However, the initial income level, 𝑦!"!! , could also be endogenous. In
particular, when we first difference the model, 𝛥𝑦!"!! is mechanically
correlated with the first-differenced error term. Table 4 reports estimates
where we also instrument 𝑦!"!! following the standard procedures in the
literature. We therefore test for whether the model is under-identified. The
𝑝 -values of the Kleibergen-Paap rank Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test
uniformly reject the null hypothesis that the model is under-identified.
Columns 1 and 2 re-estimate the models in columns 3 and 4 of Table 3,
respectively, but also instrumenting 𝑦!"!! (i.e., 𝑦!"!! ) with 𝑦!"!! . Column 3
re-estimates the model in column 6 of Table 3 and uses 𝑦!"!! to instrument
for Δ𝑦!"!! (i.e., 𝑦!"!! − 𝑦!"!! ). The aid coefficient remains similar. Columns
4 and 5 are estimated by the difference GMM estimator, which is widely used
in this literature. Given the potential problems with many instruments in finite
samples, we use a parsimonious set of instruments (Roodman, 2007, 2009a,
2009b; Bazzi and Clemens, 2013; Bun and Windmeijer, 2010), namely 𝑦!"!! ,

𝑦!"!! , and 𝑦!"!!" . We use 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!! as an instrument in Column 4 and

        !"#$
𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!! in Column 5. With more instruments than endogenous

variables, we can test the validity of the over-identifying restrictions, and both
the Sargan and Hansen tests do not reject the null hypothesis of their validity.
The GMM estimation does not automatically provide F-statistics. In order to



                                        26
compare with other columns in terms of instrument strength, we report the
first-stage F-statistics based on estimating the corresponding 2SLS models
with the same specification as in the GMM model.
       The failures to reject the null hypothesis of the over-identification
restriction and to detect an AR(1) structure in the error term in equation 2
suggest that the error terms in the growth equation are serially uncorrelated.
Besides these two pieces of evidence, we also provide a third piece of
evidence. If the error terms were serially correlated, including lagged values of
the dependent variable will alter the estimates of the aid coefficient. Including
lagged values of the dependent variable on the right-hand-side also controls
for any positive shocks to growth before crossing which are eventually
reversed. We thus re-estimate the model in Column 3 of Table 3 but include
the once-lagged value of the dependent variable as a control variable (Column
6 of Table 4), or its twice-lagged value (Column 7), and then both the once-

       The estimated effects of aid on growth in Columns 1 to 5 in Table 4 are
all very similar to each other. Taking the point estimate in Column 2 we
observe that a one percent increase in the aid to GNI ratio increases real per
capita GDP growth by 0.031 percentage points. A one percentage point
increase in the aid to GNI ratio from its average value at the period of crossing


22
     In column 3 of Table 4, we find that the clustered standard errors and the robust standard
errors are very similar (results not shown). The similarity between the two sets of standard
errors is consistent with the evidence of lack of serial correlation of the error term in equation
(2).

(i.e.,.031*[.01/.09]*100).23
5.4 Measurement error in aid
Aid/GNI is likely to be measured with error, and this possibility is consistent
with the observation that the 2SLS estimates are larger than the OLS estimates.
There are various reasons why aid is measured with error. Not all donors
report their aid to the DAC in all years. For example, aid from the former
Soviet Union and from China in the Mao era to other communist countries
was not reported to the DAC. Aid from China and other emerging donors has
significantly increased in recent years but is mostly not reported. The official
definition of aid counts $1 in grants the same as $1 in concessionary loans (for
any loan with a grant element of at least 25%). Additionally, but better
understood, the denominator, GNI, is also measured with sizeable error for
many less developed countries (Jerven, 2013). With classic measurement error,
the OLS estimate of the effect of aid is biased towards zero. Demeaning or
first differencing the model likely exacerbates the bias.
       The natural experiment we exploit in this paper provides a unique


23
     We report the robust first-stage F statistic for the overall strength of the first stage
(Kleibergen-Paap rank Wald F statistic) for specifications in Table 4. With multiple
endogenous variables, the first stage F statistic is less informative than the case of one
instrument. We thus construct 95% Anderson-Rubin confidence intervals for the coefficients
associated with endogenous variables that are robust to weak instruments (Finlay and
Magnusson, 2009). With two endogenous variables, the confidence interval of a particular
coefficient depends on the value of the coefficient associated with the other endogenous
variable. Thus the confidence interval for both endogenous variables will be a
two-dimensional figure. We report these graphs for specifications in Table 4 in Appendix
Figure A. Overall, the 95% confidence intervals for the aid coefficient are greater than 0
(except for Column 4 in which we obtain significance only at the 10% level, and we show the
plot for the 90% confidence interval).

opportunity to gauge the magnitude of the attenuation bias in the OLS
estimation due to measurement error. We have shown that the amount of aid a
country receives declines substantially following its crossing of the IDA
threshold. Assuming that the measurement error is i.i.d., it would contribute

much less to the total variation in Δ𝐴𝑖𝑑!" in periods closer to threshold

crossings. Thus the OLS estimates of equation 4 using only periods in the
neighborhood of the crossings are likely to provide more accurate estimates of
aid’s effect on growth than the one exploiting all of the variability in aid from
all periods. To test this, we re-estimate Equation 4 by OLS and 2SLS (using

𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!! to instrument aid), successively narrowing the window of

periods used in the analysis around the crossing point of each country.24 We
expect the OLS estimate of the aid effect on growth to increase as we narrow
the window of estimation. Naturally, the coefficient in the 2SLS estimate of
the first-differenced model should remain stable as the window narrows,
because it uses only a single period for identification. We find exactly that
pattern in Table 5, Panel B.
       Panel A of Table 5 reports the OLS estimates. As we narrow the window,
the estimated coefficient associated with foreign aid monotonically and
gradually increases. The coefficient in Column 6 (with maximal two periods
around the crossing) is 0.0201, more than 50% larger than that in Column 1
(with maximal 7 periods around the crossing). A generalized Hausman test of
the null hypothesis that the coefficient associated with 𝐴𝑖𝑑!"!! is the same in
Column 1 and in Column 6 is rejected with a 𝑝-value of 0.07. These findings

24
     We rely on first differenced models in this exercise because changing the number of
periods also affects the estimation of the country fixed effects, and we want to hold everything
constant except for the signal to noise ratio in aid.




                                                29
are consistent with the existence of significant measurement errors in aid.25

5.5 Bunching
Our identification strategy hinges on the large decline in the amount of aid
received following the crossing of a pre-determined threshold. If countries
manipulate their income data to remain below the threshold, then threshold
crossing may not be a valid instrument for aid.
       Endogenous manipulation of the income level is unlikely to be prevalent
for three reasons. First, the GNI estimates used by the World Bank are by no
means entirely within a government’s control. The national accounts data
produced by national statistical agencies are merely one of several inputs into
the World Bank’s income estimates (Jerven, 2013). Governments cannot
perfectly predict (1) the adjustments to those national accounts data often
made by World Bank staff, (2) the exchange rates used, or (3) the population
estimates used in constructing GNI per capita. Second, crossing also depends
on the current IDA threshold, and its annual adjustments for global inflation
rates cannot be predicted perfectly either. Finally, income level with respect to
the threshold is not the only criterion for IDA eligibility; e.g. countries that
cross the threshold from below can remain eligible if they are judged to be
non-creditworthy for non-concessionary lending.
       Even if governments manipulated GNI to delay their graduation from IDA,
the resulting bias would work against our main finding. Note that GNI per
capita and its growth would be understated prior to crossing the threshold,

25
     Needless to say, as discussed extensively through the paper, this is not the only source of
potential endogeneity in aid. Furthermore, we note that the discussion above is based on the
assumption of a homogeneous treatment effect. Relaxing this assumption, the results found in
Table 5 would also be consistent with the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects where
aid has the largest effect around the IDA threshold (instead of when countries were poorer).




                                               30
when aid is relatively high. After crossing, there would be little reason to
continue understating GNI per capita, and correcting it would overstate growth
for at least one period after crossing, when aid is relatively low.
    Nevertheless, we tested for evidence of data manipulation. Figure 3A is a
histogram that shows the distance between a country’s current GNI per capita
and the contemporaneous IDA threshold. All countries that were ever eligible
for IDA between 1987 and 2010 are included, and each GNI per capita value
in each country-year is treated as a separate observation. We group
country-year observations in 100-dollar bins according to the distance between
the income level and the contemporaneous IDA threshold. If many
governments understate GNI to stay below the IDA threshold, we should
observe significant “bunching” of observations just below the threshold,
relative to the number of observations just above it. Specifically, we should
observe the bin just to the left of the threshold to be abnormally high relative
to the neighboring bins. If there is no bunching, the numbers of observations
in each bin should cross the threshold of zero smoothly. As shown in Figure
3A, there is no visual evidence that countries bunch right below the IDA
threshold. A formal test confirms this result. Using a density test proposed by
McCrary (2008), we find no significant evidence of bunching. Figure 3B is a
density graph that shows the fitted kernel density functions at both sides of the
threshold. The density crosses the IDA threshold smoothly, and the minor
difference is by no means statistically significant.

5.6 Further robustness checks
We next present various additional robustness tests, for which we report two
                                                                              !"#$
sets of results. These tests all use either   𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!! or        𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!!

as the instrument for aid. They are all based on our preferred specification in



                                        31
                                                         !"#$
Column 3 of Table 3 (or Column 4 of Table 3 when 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!! is used as

the instrument). As we shall see, these robustness checks yield results that are
largely consistent with our main findings.26
       Throughout the study, we control for period fixed effects, log of initial
income, and log of population. Period fixed effects take account of any
time-specific shocks that affect all countries. Initial income and population are
among the key time-varying factors that affect economic growth. We also
control for country fixed effects which account for any time-invariant
cross-country variability in economic growth, and most slow-moving factors
(over our relatively short 1987-2010 period) such as the quality of governance.
Here we further test whether other time-varying factors could be confounding
the effect of aid on economic growth, by adding to the baseline regression a
host of economic and political variables, including the primary school
enrollment rate, the Freedom House index of civil liberty and political rights,
the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ratings,
total trade as a percentage of GDP, broad money as a percentage of GDP,
inflation as measured by changes in the GDP deflator, dummies for whether
the country is experiencing a banking crisis, currency crisis, or debt crisis
(central government debt/GNI is available for fewer than half of the countries
in our sample), and a survey-based measure of country creditworthiness from
Institutional Investor. Due to missing values, we add these variables in
separate groups to maintain a reasonable sample size for each regression.
Table 6 shows the results of these exercises. Few of the additional regressors
have a statistically significant effect on growth in either set of estimations for


26
     Results are also robust to other specifications in Table 3.




                                                 32
our relatively small sample of countries. The aid coefficients remain similar in
magnitude to their counterparts in the baseline regressions; the coefficient of
our key aid variable range from 0.028 to 0.046, all statistically significant at
conventional levels.
    Recall that our instrument is a dummy variable that switches from 0 to 1
when a country has crossed the income threshold from below two periods
earlier. The countries in our sample all crossed the threshold at some point
between 1987 and 2010, but for countries that crossed the threshold in the last
and the next-to-the-last periods (i.e. in periods 7 or 8) the instrumental dummy
variable is always zero. We keep these countries in the sample because they
satisfy our simple rule for sample selection and they provide relevant
information for estimating the effects of the control variables. We now check
whether our results still hold when we drop these countries. In Column 1 of
Panel A in Table 7, we drop the seven countries that crossed the threshold in
the final period of our sample (2008-2010). The point estimate increases (to
0.041) and remains statistically significant at conventional levels. In Column 2
we further drop the seven countries that crossed the threshold in the
next-to-last period (2005-2007). The coefficient is slightly larger (i.e., at 0.045)
than that in Column 1 and remains statistically significant at the 5% level. The
first stage remains strong in each case. The first stage is weaker when we use
        !"#$
𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!,!!! as the instrument in panel B, but the results are qualitatively

similar.
    As shown in Table 1, a few countries crossed the IDA threshold from
below more than once during the sample period. These countries must have
crossed the threshold from above after its first crossing from below, then
crossed from below again. These cases might be a threat to our identification



                                        33
strategy. If income drops below the threshold again immediately after the first
crossing for any reason other than a decline in aid, the estimated effect of aid
might be confounded. In Column 3 of Panel A of Table 7, we drop countries
with multiple crossings. The estimated effect of aid (0.026) remains similar. In
Column 4, we use the last threshold crossing (from below) instead of the first
one to construct the instrumental variable. The estimated effect of aid on
growth (0.024) again remains similar relative to the baseline specification. It
remains statistically significant in panel A, but in panel B the standard errors
increase and we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no effect at conventional
levels.
    There are two exceptional groups of countries in the sample. First, several
countries in the sample benefit from the “small island country exception,”
which permits island nations with populations below 1.5 million to remain
IDA eligible, even after surpassing the income threshold. Second, a few
countries were never classified as IDA eligible in the 1987-2010 period due to
various reasons, despite having income levels below the threshold for one or
more years. We include them in the sample because the IDA income threshold
potentially serves as a useful benchmark for donors other than IDA. In
Column 5 of Table 7 we drop the three small island countries. In Column 6,
we drop the four countries that were never eligible for IDA throughout the
sample period. The estimated effects of aid are robust to these sample changes,
with the coefficient ranging from 0.027 to 0.03.

6. Potential Mechanism
Given the positive effect found in this paper, an important question is the
mechanism by which aid boosts growth. In the short run, an important channel
through which aid could cause growth is through fostering physical investment.



                                      34
Irrespective of the form aid takes, it constitutes a flow of funds to recipient
countries, which, if they are financially and perhaps fiscally constrained (see
Kraay, 2012), would release resources in the economy that could be invested.
Because our sample countries were all financially constrained by definition,
this is a relevant scenario. Admittedly, our findings here do not rule out other
mechanisms nor can it necessarily be extrapolated to countries that are more
developed and have better access to credit markets.
       We consider the expected effect of an increase of one percentage point in
aid if it were fully invested in physical capital. Approximating the technology
at the aggregate level of the economy linearly, the rate of economic growth
would increase in the inverse of the capital-output ratio.27 Using the standard
perpetual inventory method, we estimate this ratio to be approximately equal
to 2 in our sample.28 Thus, one would expect that growth could increase by as
much as 0.5 percentage points if all of the aid were invested.
       How much aid fosters physical investment is therefore an empirical
question. To this end, in Appendix Table I we re-estimate the baseline
specifications in Table 3, replacing economic growth with the period average
investment to GDP ratio as the dependent variable. The OLS estimates in
Column 1 and Column 2 of the effect of aid on investment are statistically
insignificant and have the “wrong” sign. Instrumenting aid in Columns 3 to 7,

27
     Even under a linear technology such as the AK model, the effect of aid on growth could be
strictly concave since, for instance, the effect of aid on physical investment might be
decreasing in aid. Moreover, the aggregate technology could be non-linear as suggested by the
robust finding of conditional convergence in the empirical growth literature.
28
     Note that this figure is also consistent with standard growth accounting assumptions.
Assuming capital per capita depreciation rate of 10 percent per year, and an investment rate of
25 percent of GDP per year, a country with a capital-output ratio of 2 would grow, in per
capita terms, at 2.5 percent per year, which is consistent with the figures in our sample.




                                               35
we find that the coefficient associated with aid becomes positive and ranges
between 0.5 and 0.8. In one case it is significant at the 10% level, but in
general the p-values are around 0.15. In column 4 we see that a one percent
increase in the aid to GNI ratio increases the investment to GDP ratio by 0.049
percentage points. Evaluated at the average level of aid to GNI ratio at the
period of crossing, an increase of 1 percentage point in the aid to GNI ratio
increases the investment to GDP ratio by 0.54 percentage points. Using the
estimated capital-output ratio of 2, a 0.54 percentage point increase in physical
investment would raise growth by 0.27 percentage points, not far away from
our back-of-the-envelope calculation of the effect of aid on growth.29

7. Suggestive Evidence on External Validity
The results found in this paper are Local Average Treatment Effects (LATE)
from a sample of aid-recipient countries that all successfully crossed the IDA
income threshold from below between 1987 and 2010. How would our results
apply to other aid-recipient countries, particularly those that are still below the
IDA cutoff? On the one hand, if the sample countries crossed the IDA
threshold level because they have fundamentally different attributes, our
results may have little relevance for those countries remaining very poor. On
the other hand, if the difference between crossing and non-crossing countries
is mainly due to being in different stages of development, and the two samples
have similar growth patterns conditional on the initial income, then our results
may apply to these countries as well when their income level approaches the


29
     Admittedly, the back-of-the-envelope calculation changes somewhat when alternative
growth models are used. Using the A-K model with per capital output function 𝑦 = 𝐴𝑘 ! ,
when 𝛼 = 0.35 and 𝐾/𝑌 = 2, investment accounts for a smaller, but still substantial 29% of
the total effect on growth.




                                              36
IDA threshold.
    We thus investigate whether the crossing countries have systematically
higher growth rates (conditional on the initial income level) than the
non-crossing countries using a simple regression. We include all country-year
observations with per capita GNI level below the threshold, and linearly
project the annual real per capita GDP growth onto a dummy variable
indicating whether the observation belongs to a country in the crossing sample,
controlling for a one-year lag of log per capita real GDP and its square, as well
as for year dummies. When their income levels were still below the IDA
threshold, real per capita GDP in countries that eventually crossed were
growing on average 1.98% per year. During the same period, real per capita
GDP in countries that had not crossed the threshold by 2010 were growing on
average 1.11% per year. In Appendix Table J we show that, after we control
for the initial real GDP per capita level (Column 1) as well as its quadratic
form (Column 2), the difference in average annual GDP per capita growth
between the crossing countries and the non-crossing countries is
approximately 0.7 percentage points and not statistically significant. In
Column 3, we compare the average annual GDP per capita growth of the two
groups of countries within each quartile of the distribution of the lagged
income levels. When the income level is in the lowest quartile, countries that
eventually crossed the threshold were growing at a much higher rate than
those that have not crossed. In other higher quartiles of income level, the
differences in annual growth rates between the two groups become smaller in
magnitude and not statistically significant. Thus, for most of the income
distribution below the IDA threshold, we do not find significant differences in
pre-crossing growth rates between the sample of countries studied in this




                                       37
paper and those still below the IDA threshold. This finding suggests that that
our estimates of aid’s growth effects, based on countries that recently crossed
the income threshold, may be relevant to countries that have not yet crossed,
as the latter group is not systematically different from the former group.

8.   Conclusion
     We present new evidence on the effect of foreign aid on recipient
countries’ economic growth, estimating a model similar to those in the recent
aid-growth literature, but addressing the identification challenge using a novel
instrument     for   aid.    This    instrument     is    derived    from     an
exogenously-determined aid allocation policy, exploiting the substantial drop
in aid after a country crosses an exogenous income threshold set by the World
Bank for IDA eligibility. Using a sample of countries that have crossed the
IDA threshold since 1987, we find that rapid reductions in aid subsequent to
crossing the IDA threshold have a sizable negative effect on growth. Reducing
the aid to GNI ratio by one percentage point from its average value at the
period of crossing decreases real per capita GDP growth by approximately
0.35 percentage points. Our finding of a positive impact of aid on growth is
consistent with a majority of recent studies (Arndt et al., forthcoming),
although our estimated effect is somewhat larger than those reported in
Clemens et al. (2012) and most other studies.
     We address various identification concerns, and our results remain robust
throughout. We provide a new way of constructing predicted income
trajectories and crossing periods using a smoothing technique.
     The estimates are based on a relatively small group of countries, but this
group is particularly interesting because it is comprised of poor and financially
constrained countries that receive large amounts of aid (averaging 8% of GNI).



                                       38
We provide suggestive evidence that our results may generalize to countries
that are still under the IDA threshold as they grow closer to the threshold.
    We present evidence that aid also likely increases the investment rate,
although this effect is less precisely estimated. A back-of-the-envelope
calculation is consistent with physical investment being a main channel
through which aid operates in the short-run.
    Identification of causal effects is a daunting task—especially at the
macroeconomic level—so all causal estimates of country level parameters
should be interpreted cautiously. Still, at the micro level, researchers need to
evaluate on a case by case basis which aid projects work better, if at all. Our
evidence shows only that overall foreign aid increases economic growth
among poor countries where aid is a large source of funding. Moreover, even
at the macro level, aid may have heterogeneous effects depending on recipient
characteristics, aid modalities, and donor motives (Mekasha and Tarp, 2013).
For example, aid provided by some bilateral institutions for political or
commercial reasons may be less effective (Dreher et al., 2014), and may be
less sensitive to crossing the IDA threshold. Our relatively large effect may
apply to less politicized aid. Following the end of the Cold War, however, the
share of aid that is highly politicized has arguably fallen significantly, with
geopolitical motives declining in importance relative to developmental
concerns (Headey, 2008).
    Our relatively small and homogeneous sample is not ideal for testing
heterogeneous effects of aid. Moreover, because we identify only the effect of
aid on growth in the short term, our evidence does not contradict any view of
aid’s effects on long-term development. Despite these caveats, we believe our
evidence contributes to understanding the effect of aid on economic growth in




                                       39
the short-term for poor countries that are financially constrained.
    Our results also contribute to the empirical literature on donors’ aid
allocation decisions across recipient countries (e.g. Alesina and Dollar, 2000;
Chong and Gradstein, 2008). Specifically, they support the conjecture by
Moss and Majerowicz (2012) that bilateral donors use IDA policies – and
specifically its income eligibility threshold – as an informative signal of
recipient need. Patterns of donor “herding” measured by Frot and Santosi
(2011) may be partially due to donors’ common responses to recipient
countries’ crossing the IDA income threshold.

                        Appendix A: Standard Errors
We first report robust standard errors clustered at the country level, which
allow for arbitrary within-country correlation. There are 35 countries in our
sample. Standard asymptotic tests might over-reject the null hypothesis under
the presence of few clusters. Although 35 clusters is not a small number, for
robustness we also report the standard errors from the clustered wild bootstrap
procedure following Cameron et al. (2008). Cameron et al. (2008)
recommends the clustered wild bootstrap-t procedure for better asymptotic
properties, as the t statistic is “pivotal”. However, in order to compare with the
clustered standard errors, we report the standard errors from clustered wild
bootstrap procedure. Inference based on the bootstrap-t procedure is
quantitatively similar to that based on bootstrapped standard errors. Either
approach yields very similar statistical inferences. Throughout the paper, we
report both sets of standard errors. For brevity, we focus our discussion on the
clustered standard errors, and in tables, we mark asterisks after these standard
errors to indicate conventional levels of statistical significance.

                 Appendix B: The Functional Form of Aid
Our measure of aid is slightly different from most of the literature, which often
uses the aid to GDP or GNI ratio as the main explanatory variable. We take
the log of aid since the previous body of evidence suggests that the marginal
effect of aid on growth is decreasing. The logarithmic form is a parsimonious
way to introduce concavity while preserving our ability to identify aid’s causal
impact with only one exogenous binary instrumental variable. However, note
that instrumented aid still takes on a large number of values on its domain,
since each country’s aid is shifted by the instrument starting from different
values (over time). The logarithmic specification is admittedly less flexible
than a quadratic specification; in particular, it does not allow the marginal
effect of aid to change its sign. Clemens et al. (2012), however, find that the
effect of aid on growth does not turn negative until aid exceeds roughly 15%
of GDP. In our sample, over 90% of the observations are below 11% of GDP.
Thus, a logarithmic specification provides a good approximation over the
range of observed values on aid. Additionally, we report as a robustness test in

                        ∗
the measure for aid. 𝐴𝑖𝑑!"!! has a positive, quantitatively large, and
marginally significant coefficient, despite a lower first stage F statistic. We
find that a 1 percentage point increase in the aid to GNI ratio raises annual per
capita GDP growth by 0.57 percentage point at the sample mean of the aid to
GNI ratio. This estimate is even larger than our baseline result, reported later
in Section 5.

Note: There are 1,920 country-year observations from 112 countries that were ever on the DAC list between 1987 and 2010. For each country-year
observation, we calculate the distance of the current per capita GNI (yit ) from the current IDA threshold (ȳt ). We restrict the distance (yit − ȳt ) between
-1000 and 1000. Graph A is a histogram of country-year observations against (yit − ȳt ), grouped in 100-dollar bins. Graph B shows the McCrary density
test. The discontinuity estimate (log difference in height from left to right) is -0.0476, with a standard error of 0.1776.

Note: Countries that crossed the IDA threshold from below between 1987 and 2010.
1 . Inactive countries: no active IDA financing due to protracted non-accrual status.
2 . Blend countries: IDA-eligible but also creditworthy for some IBRD borrowing.
3 . Small island economy exception: small islands (with less than 1.5 million people, significant vulnerability due to size and geography, and very limited
credit-worthiness and financing options) have been granted exceptions in maintaining their eligibility.
4 . Borrowing on blend terms: countries that access IDA financing only on blend credit terms.
5 . India graduated from IDA at the end of FY14 but will receive transitional support on an exceptional basis through the IDA17 period (FY15-17)
6 . Never IDA-eligible.

Note: Each observation is a country-period. Dependent variables are the log average share of aid in GNI by donor in the last period
and share of total aid in GNI in the last period. There are 35 countries in the sample. Country fixed effects, period fixed effects, and
log population in the last period are controlled in all columns. Crossingis−2 is a dummy variable indicating whether the country
crossed the IDA cutoff at least two periods earlier. yis−1 is the log real GDP per capita in the second year of the last period, yit−4 .
Cluster-robust standard errors are in parentheses, ∗p < 0.10, ∗ ∗ p < 0.05, ∗ ∗ ∗p < 0.01. Wild cluster bootstrapped standard errors
are reported in brackets.

Note: Each observation is a country-period. The dependent variable is the period average real per capita GDP growth rate. Sample restrictions are marked in
the short handle in each column. All columns are estiamted using 2SLS. Panel A uses actual crossings as the instrumental variable. Panel B uses predicted
crossings as the instrumental variable. Standard errors clustered at the country level are reported in parentheses, * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.
Wild cluster bootstrapped standard errors are reported in brackets.

Note: Each observation is a country-period. For each variable, the mean, standard deviation, median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile are reported.
Missing values for ODA and ODA by donor are treated as zeros, following the precedent of Arndt, Jones and Tarp (2010) (Page 14). In this sample there are
no missing values in total ODA. Zero values in aid by donor are replaced with 1 dollar before taking logarithm. See Appendix Table A for more details in
construction and sources of these variables.

Note: Each observation is a country-period from countries that crossed the IDA threshold between 1987 and 2010.
Country-period observations included in the sample are prior to the period of crossing the real threshold. There are 34
countries and 162 observations in the regression. Dependent variables are one period lag of average shares of ODA in GNI
by donor. Country and period fixed effects, and log population in the last period are controlled in each column. F-statistic on
Crossingis−2 is reported in Column 5. yis−1 is log per capita real GDP in the second year of the last period, yit−4 .
Standard errors clustered at the country level are reported in parentheses, * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01. Wild

Note: Each observation is a country-year. The dependent variable is annual log per capita real GDP growth. There
are 78 countries that were ever eligible for IDA between 1987 and 2010 as well as the 35 countries in our baseline
sample. The key variable of interest is a dummy variable indicating whether the country belongs to the crossing
sample. The sample consists of country-year observations between 1987 and 2010 that have per capita GNI level
below the IDA threshold. Year fixed effects are controlled. Log real GDP per capita in the last year and its
quadratic terms are included in the regressions. Standard errors are reported in parentheses, clustered at the country
level. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.
