                  INTERDEPENDENT PRICING AND MARKUP BEHAVIOR:
                AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF GM, FORD AND CHRYSLER



                                   ABSTRACT

      Our purpose in this paper is to develop and estimate a model of the US
automobile industry that can be used to analyze the secular and cyclical
strategic markup behavior and market structure of its three major domestic
producers - - GM, Ford *nd Chrysler. The principal novelty in this paper is
not such much in the underlying theory (we build on what Timothy Bresnahan has
called the "new empirical industrial organization" literature), but rather in
the actual empirical implementation of a multi-equation model sufficiently
general to permit the testing of a variety of specific behavioral postulates
associated with the interdependent strategic profit-maximizing behavior of GM,
Ford and Chrysler.

      Using firm-specific annual data from 1959-83, we find that at usual
levels of statistical significance, we cannot reject Cournot quantity-setting
behavior, nor can we reject leader/follower quantity-setting behavior with GM
as leader and Ford and Chrysler as followers; the parameter restrictions
associated with leader/follower behavior are slightly more binding than those
with Cournot, although the difference is not decisive. In terms of the
cyclical analysis of market behavior, our most striking result is the great
diversity of behavior we find among CM, Ford and Chrysler. Depending on which
firm is being analyzed, there is support for the pro-cyclical "conventional
wisdom" of markups (CM and Ford), as well as for the counter-cyclical
"revisionist" literature (Chrysler). Diversity, rather than constancy and
homogeneity, best characterizes firms in this industry.

I.   INTRODUCTION

      In recent years a considerable literature has emerged reporting results

from estimating the market structure of a number of industries, and the

behavioral relations among firms within these industries. Much of this

literature is based on a theoretical framework recently surveyed by Timothy

Bresnahan (1989). Bresnahan outlines an econometric approach to measuring

market power, in which parametric representations rather than accounting data

are employed to measure unobservable marginal cost and markups; he calls this

the "new empirical industrial organization" (NEIO). Data limitations,

however, have made it difficult to develop models that can be used to test

explicit behavioral hypotheses concering firms' interdependent pricing and

markup behavior) Thus most of the analyses to date have tended to focus on

the exercise of market power by broad industry aggregates (e.g., Gollop and

Roberts [1979], Appelbaum (1982), Hall (1986,1988], Domowitz, Hubbard and

Peterson [1988), Morrison [1988,19901). or by product type (Bresnahan (1981]).

      This suggests that it would be fruitful to employ the basic theoretical

framework of the NEIO, but to implement it empirically on several individual

firms in one industry for which firm-specific micro-economic data can be

constructed. In this connection the auto industry appears to be particularly

promising for a number of reasons.2

      First, during the past two decades, this industry has been subject to

significant exogenous shocks (e.g., the dramatic oil price changes and the

apparent shift in consumer tastes toward Japanese cars), and thus it is of

interest to analyze changes in firm and industry behavior in response to such

shocks. Second, since the automobile industry has often been characterized as

a "classic oligopoly", it is particularly attractive for assessing the
                   INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEHAVIOR                    -   PACE   2-
relevance   of models   of oligopolistic behavior, such as Courtnot quantity-

setting and leader/follower models. Third, Friedlaender, Winston and Wang

 [1983] and Aizcorbe, Winston and Friedlaender [1987] have constructed a data

set on the auto industry, thereby permitting a much richer characterization of

firm and industry costs and market behavior than has generally been available

in empirical models of this nature.

      Our purpose in this paper, therefore, is to develop and estimate a model

of the US automobile industry that can be used to analyze the secular and

cyclical strategic behavior and market structure of its major domestic

producers - - CM, Ford and Chrysler. The principal novelty in this paper is

not so much in the basic methodology (we build on the NEIO), but rather in the

empirical implementation of a multi-equation model sufficiently general to

permit the testing of a variety of specific behavioral postulates associated

with the strategic profit maximizing behavior of firms in the US auto

industry. We also analyze the nature and cylicality of the firm-specific

exercise of market power.

      Our paper takes the following form. In Section II we outline a

theoretical framework that can be used to test various behavioral hypotheses

(unconstrained profit maximization, Cournot quantity-setting behavior, and

leader/follower conduct). In Section III we discuss issues involved in

empirical implementation, overview the data and detail the stochastic

specification, and then in Section IV we present and interpret a host of

empirirical results. Finally, in Section VI we summarize and suggest issues

for future research. Three appendices accompany this paper, the first

concerning data construction and sources, the second presenting a stylized

framework for understanding cyclical variations in markups, and the third

consisting of tables with additional econometric results.

II.   THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

      In   this section we first describe a simple Cournot model of myopic

behavior in which each firm assumes others will not respond to its profit-

maximizing quantity-setting behavior. We develop specific hypothesis tests to

assess whether this strategic behavioral assumption can be accepted or

rejected. We then develop a      leader/follower   model that also involves testable

cross-equation parameter restrictions. A Driori, we do not expect that either

of these extreme cases adequately describe the complexities of oligopoliscic

markets, and therefore we indicate how our framework can be generalized to

analyze the exercise of market power among firms and over time, without

relying on such restrictive and specific behavioral hypotheses concerning firm

interactions. It is worth emphasizing, however, that the constraints imposed

by empirical iniplementability compel us to work within an essentially static

optimization Context. Since in fact the process of strategic interaction

among firms is inherently dynamic, at best our static models should be viewed

as reduced form solutions to these dynamic games or interactions.3

      We begin by assuming there are three firms whose products are close

substitutes, and that each firm sets quantities so as to maximize expected

profits.4 For simplicity, we assume each firm produces a single product,

although this is not essential to the argument. Let Yj be the production

level of each firm, whose costs depend on its output level alone (for

notational simplicity we suppress the other arguments of the cost function),

              Ci —   Ci(yi).                                                      (1)

However, the demand and therefore the revenue functions of each firm depend

not only upon its own output, but also on the output of the other firms. We

can thus characterize the revenue function of each firm as

              Rj —   Rj(yj,y2,y3),   i —   1,2,3                                  (2)

and each firms profit function as
                           INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEHAVIOR                                       - PACE   4-
                    iY1'y2y3        —
                                        R(y1,y2,y3)       -
                                                               Cj(yj), I — 1,2,3.             (3)

          Thus far, our analysis is entirely                  general and incorporates no specific
 behavioral     assumptions. It should be clear, however, that the key elements

 are the revenue functions and the extent to which each firm recognizes demand

 interdependencies embodied in (2) and exploits them in                         maximizing      profits in

 (3). We begin by analyzing the simplest case of myopic firm                            behavior,    in

which each firm follows the Cournot assumption that its quantity-setting

behavior will not lead to quantity responses on the part of its competitors,

resulting in the familiar Nash equilibrium. In this case, each firm maximizes

its profits using the usual marginal revenue/marginal cost (ffi/MC) conditions



                aR1(y1.y1y)
                      a
                          yi
                                        —   8C1(yi)
                                               yi
                                                      ,   i    —
                                                                    1,2,3   and i '   j,k   ,            (4)


where the superscript bars indicate that                  the firm views        the output of its

competitors as being exogenous and thus not influenced by its behavior. As

Bresnahan 119891 has shown, if one specifies revenue as the product of the

inverse demand function and output quantity, equation (4) can be re-written as

the following profit-maximizing behavioral expression for each firm:



                                -   8P1(y1,y1 ''k
                    P —   MC1                                 "i-                                        (5)




         As another extreme example, consider a leader/follower model in which

firm 1 acts as a leader and the other two firms act as followers. Assume that

firm 1 recognizes the interdependency of demand and therefore determines its

profit maximizing quantity level taking this interdependence into account.

Firms 2   and   3   then   observe this output        and determine          their profit maximizing
output    simultaneously,       ignoring any interdependency between their own demand

and that of their competitors. It is worth noting that although this process
                       INTERDEPENDEWr MARKUP BEHAVIOR                                        -   PACE   S-
is   inherently dynamic and sequential, for empirical purposes we model it as

being simultaneous and static. Since the period of observation Is typically a

year, this appears to be a plausible assumption, for the automobile product or

reaction cycle is generally less than a year.5

       If firms 2 and 3 act as Cournot followers, their revenue function is

given by



             Ri —                                 i —      2,3 and i '   l,j                             (6)



where the superscript bars indicate that other firms' outputs are viewed as

being exogenous from the perspective of firm i. Thus each follower will

maximize its profits using the traditional MR/MG condition


             oRi(y1,yi.y I)
                                    —
                                          ac1(y)                (i,)) —   (2,3),   (3,2) ,               (7)
                                                  a
                       yi                             yi


which yields a reaction function for each follower as


                   —
                       i1'Y i       ,         —       2,3 and i'j.                                       (8)



However, since Yj is also a function of                          and Yi' (8) can also be written as

             Yj —      #i(Yl, #j(Y1.Yj))                                                                 (9)

which can be solved for Yj as a function of Yl alone:

              Yi
                   —
                       Yj(Yi).     i —    2,3.                                                          (10)

       Now if firm 1 correctly perceives the behavioral response of firms 2 and

3, it can utilize this information in its revenue function, now written as

              R1 — R1(y1.         Y2Yl' Y3Yl•                                                           (11)

Using the chain rule, we derive the MR/MC condition for firm 1 as

Alternatively,   since R1 —
                                   y1'P1[y1,y2(y1),y3(y1)j,   the MR/MG condition can

also be written as



                         -         8P1[y1,y2(y1), y3(yl)]
            P1 —   MG1       "1'                                                       (13)
                                               a
                                                   yl


where aP1/ay1 is the derivative of firm l's inverse demand function with

respect to its own output, taking a form analogous to the derivative of

revenue with respect to y1 in equation (12).

      It is of course the case that the behavior of firms in oligopolistic

markets is extremely complex, and thus it would not be surprising if firms

behaved in ways more complicated than that implied by the relatively simple

Cournot or leader/follower models.6 It is useful, therefore, that we

recognize this complexity explicitly and rewrite the MR/MG condition, more

generally than in (5) or (13), as




            Pi_MCi            a
                                  yi
                                       '
                                           y                                           (14)



where the expression aP(')/ay is an unspecified relationship among

interdependent firms' prices and outputs.

      It should be noted that the general form of the MR/MG conditions in the

case of competitive (Cournot) oligopolistic behavior, the leader/follower

behavior, and the generalized maximizing behavior is identical, with the

difference being in the nature of the term reflecting the response of the own

price of a given firm to changes in its own output, öPj/ayj. Hence, in terms

of econometric implementation, while the general specification of each of

these cases is identical, the precise interpretation of the coefficients

embedded in 8P/8y will differ under alternative behavioral assumptions.

III.   TOWARDS A1 EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATION

       To implement this rather general theoretical framework empirically,

functional forms must be specified for the cost and output demand functions,

and stochastic assumptions must be detailed. We assume the cost function for

the        firm can be approximated using the normalized quadratic form7

and derive the cost-minimizing demand for the normalized input Xin by solving

the second equation in (16) for x1 and then substituting (15) for C and

(17) for Xj5. We further specify that each firm's inverse demand function can

be written as a linear approximation, with each firm's output being

 imperfectly substitutable.            We write this inverse demand function facing each

 of   the three automakers as

where i —    'i/i"i is the normalized output price and z is a vector of
exogenous variables common to all three firms. This normalization is needed

to ensure consistency between the cost and demand functions, and the MR/MC

conditions. Firm-specific revenue functions are therefore given by

Solving for the MR/NC equilibrium condition within this framework yields the

following general expression, analogous to (5):

                   — °iy     +                           +            +

where Ai takes on different specific values depending on the behavioral model

being postulated. We now consider several special cases of Ai.

        Consider first the case of Cournot behavior, where each firm treats the

other's output as constant.8 This yields an expression for Ai in (20) as
                   —-            i —   1,2,3.

Thus, to test the Cournot model as a special case of the more general

framework in (20), we impose the three coefficient restrictions in (21), in

addition to the cross-equation coefficient restrictions required to ensure

consistency among the parameters estimated in the input demand functions, the

output demand functions, and the MR/MG condition.9

      An alternative behavioral assumption is that the auto market is

characterized by leader-follower relationships. Let firm 1 be the leader, and

firms 2 and 3 be Cournot followers. For firms 2 and 3, the MR/MC conditions

take the form of equations (20) and (21). For the leader firm, however, the

NR/MC condition is more complex, for it must incorporate the reaction

functions of firms 2 and 3. These reaction functions are obtained by

substituting the right-hand side of the follower's inverse demand function

(18) for the left-hand price term in the followers' MR/NC condition (20) and

(21), and then solving for each follower's output as a function of the other

firms' outputs and the exogenous variables. This yields

Finally, substituting    (25) and (26) into the leader's        inverse demand function

This completes the specification of our leader-follower model. Note that

although the leader-follower model has restrictions on the A parameters for

firms 2 and 3 that are identical to the Cournot model, the restriction on
                                                                                   A1
in (28) implied by the leader-follower model is quite different from that for

A1 in the Cournot model (21). Hence, the Cournot and leader-follower models

each involve three independent restrictions on the Aj parameters, and the

models are non-nested.

       Furthermore, by estimating equation (20) directly without constraint,

the above framework can be used to analyze the degree of market power and how

it may have changed over time. Specifically, since               -
                                                                     MC —
where Aj is a parameter estimated from the MR/NC condition (20), one can

assess the extent to which firms have exercised their market power, without

imposing specific strategic behavioral assumptions. By allowing the markup to

change over time in response to various supply and demand shocks, one can also

determine how the exercise of market power changes with respect to different

market conditions, stages of the business cycle, and so forth)°

       Before proceeding with a discussion of data and stochastic specifica-

tion, we now briefly consider several other issues in empirical implementa-

tion. For each of the three automakers, we specify three inputs whose prices

enter the firm-specific cost function: materials (xM), capital (xK) and labor

(XL). Since problems in constructing reliable micro-data on capital input are
                          INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEHAVIOR                           - PAGE   11 -

particularly troublesome and well-known, we employ a long-run cost function
and treat capital as a variable input, thereby implicitly assuming that the

measurement    error problems associated with having xK as a regressor                are
potentially more          significant than the possible mis-specification resulting

from treating that input as variable rather than fixed in the short-run.

        To ensure that the Cost function is homogeneous in factor prices, we

normalize Costs and input prices by the price of labor, wL. We jointly

estimate the materials, capital and labor input demand equations, where the

normalized cost function (15) is substituted into the labor demand equation

implicit in (16). Thus our system of cost-input demand equations takes the

following     form:

        xMi — au      +    miliwil       + ail2wi2 + ajjyj + ajlttj                         (29)

        The output demand relationships for each firm are                  estimated by using a
linear   approximation to a normalized inverse demand function

where   GNP is real gross national product, INR is the                  interest rate, UN the

unemployment rate, GAS the real gas price, CPI the consumer price index, and

EXR the dollar/yen exchange rate, all defined at the bottom of Table 1.

        To estimate marginal costs and markups, we specify and then estimate

parameters in a system of equations consisting of demand equations for three

inputs (capital, labor and materials), an inverse output demand equation, and

an equation based on the profit iiaxiiiization assumption of marginal revenue

                                                                         PACE 12 -

 equals marginal cost, where the marginal revenue equation includes the

 conjectured strategic response of other firms. This five equation system is

 specified for each of the three firms, CM, Ford and Chrysler, and the

 resulting 15-equation system is estimated using the method of nonlinear three-

 stage least squares (3SLS), with appropriate cross-equation constraints

 imposed (both within and between firms) to ensure consistency among the

 equations.

       A distinguishing feature of this research effort is that we employ firm-

specific data. Although there are numerous well-known problems in

constructing reliable micro data, we view our modelling effort with firm-

specific data as somewhat exploratory, helping us to assess whether employing

data with admitted deficiencies generates plausible findings. In our context,

the data requirements for the markup and interdependent pricing model include

prices and quantities of output and the three inputs for each firm, a product

mix variable for each firm (the proportion of large vehicles in total vehicle

production), as well as a set of exogenous demand-shifting variables common

among the three firms.

      The data set for this study consists of annual data from 1959-83, based

on that originally constructed and employed by Ma Aizcorbe, Clifford Winston

and Ann F. Friedlaender (1987]. We describe this data set in greater detail

(particularly our extensions) in Appendix I to this paper. These data are

summarized, however, in Table 1 below, where we present variable definitions

as well as sample means, minimum and maximum values, and standard deviations

for all the variables used in our empirical analysis.

      In terms of endogenous and exogenous variables, we assume that the

macro-economic inverse demand equation variables in (32) are exogenous, as are

the input price variables; however, output quantity,    output price (and

implicitly, marginal cost and markup) are endogenous, as are input quantities

demanded. Although we do not explicitly model determinants of the product mix

variable, in estimation we treat it as jointly determined and account for

possible simultaneity by employing an instrumental variable estimator. Each

of our equations is over-identified. We append an additive disturbance term

to each of the fifteen equations in our system, and assume that the resulting

disturbance vector is identically and independently multivariate normally

distributed, with mean vector zero and nonsingular disturbance covariance

matrix 0. Estimation was undertaken using the three-stage least    squares

commands in the TSP computer software prograa on a MicroVAX 3200 computer.11

      As discussed in the previous section, our framework enables us to test

the Cournot and leader/follower models as special cases of the most general

model in which no constraints are placed on the A1 parameters. For testing

such hypotheses, we employ the Wald (quasi-likelihood ratio) test statistic

procedure, as adapted to the nonlinear three-stage least squares context by

Gallant and Jorgenson (1979].



IV.   EMPIRICAL RESULTS

      We now move on to a discussion of empirical findings, first focusing on

the type of interdependent pricing behavior we find among GM, Ford and
                  INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEIIAVIOR                  - PAGE   15 -
Chrysler,   and then examining more closely the factors affecting the changing

markup behavior of these automakers.

      In Table 2 we present 3SLS parameter estimates assuming that the three

automakers maximize profits, but without specifying the precise nature of

their strategic interdependence; as was noted in Section III, under this

profit maximization with unconstrained strategic behavior specification, no

constraints are placed on the Ai parameters. In this model, estimates of the

cost function parameters a11 are negative for all three firms, for a22 they

are negative for GM and Ford, and for all firms       and a2y are positive, as

is required by the underlying economic theory of cost and production; the

positive estimate of a22 for Chrysler is statistically insignificant.

Further, as expected, estimates of A are positive for all three firms; the

estimate for CM (4.429) is smallest, while that for Chrysler (92.675) is

largest; since from (14) and (20) it is clear that the Aj are simply

interpreted as estimates of -8Pj/öYj, the relative values of the A1 estimates

merely suggest that this derivative is smallest for GM and largest for

Chrysler. On the output demand side, estimates of the öjj parameters in the

inverse demand equations are all negative, consistent with the theory; while

Ford and GM are "substitute." (estimates of 5GF and 6FG are positive),

Chrysler and Ford, and Chrysler and CM are "complements" (estimates of âCF,

6Fc' 6cc and       are negative). Note that in interpreting these parameter

estimates, one must recognize their very partial nature; for example, the

negative estimate of öcc implies that if GM increases sales while the quantity

of autos sold by Ford and Chrylser is unchanged, then the price of GM cars

will fall, ceteris Daribus. Estimates of demand elasticities allowing for

strategic interactions (both quantity and price) require a different and more

discuss such "general equilibrium" demand elasticities later in this section.

For the moment, however, note also that signs of the other estimated 6

parameters are the same across firms, although the variation in magnitudes is

substantial.
      At   the bottom of Table 2, equation-specific R2 values are reported;

these values appear reasonable (those for the inverse demand equation are

particularly gratifying), although the R2 value for the capital demand

equation for Chrysler (.022) is very low.

      As we noted in Section III, the Cournot model of strategic interactions

is a special case of our most general model, and involves placing three

restrictions on the Xj parameters (A —    -      i   — GM, Ford and Chrysler).

From Table 2 it is clear that the unconstrained estimates of Ai, particularly

for GM and Chrysler, are very close to estimates of -dii, and thus it would

not be surprising if these restrictions were consistent with our data. In

Table 3 we report results from testing Cournot as a special case of the

unconstrained profit maximization model; the Wald (quasi-likelihood ratio)

test statistic is 3.975, while the chi-square critical values with three

degrees of freedom are 4.108 (75% confidence level), 6.251 (90%), and 7.815

(95%). We conclude that the constraints implied by the Cournot model are

consistent with our data, given usual confidence levels.

      3SLS parameter estimates with the Cournot strategic behavior

restrictions imposed are given in Table 4. A comparison of estimates in

Tables 2 and 4 is consistent with implications of the fact that the Cournot

restrictions were not rejected, for signs and even magnitudes of the estimated

parameters are very similar in the two models, as are the equation-specific R2

values.

      A different special case of our most general model is that implied by

leader-follower behavior, with CM acting as leader and Ford and Chrysler as

followers; the three restrictions implied by this model are given in (21) for

A2 and A3, and in (28) for A1. As is reported in Table 3, the Wald (quasi-

likelihood ratio) test statistic for these restrictions is 4.614, while the

chi-square critical values are again equal to 4.108 (75% confidence level),

6.251 (90%) and 7.815 (952). We interpret this finding as suggesting that the

restrictions implied by strategic leader-follower behavior are also consistent

with our data, but are very slightly more binding than those implied by

Cournot behavior; however, the leader/follower restrictions are not

sufficiently tight to warrant outright rejection at 90 or 95% levels of

confidence. In interpreting these test results, recall from our theoretical

discussion that the Ai restrictions appear directly in the MR/MC equation for

each firm, and as seen at the bottom of Table 2, the R2 values in this

equation are all above 0.65, implying that our failure to reject the null

hypothesis decisively does not appear to be due to a simple lack of

explanatory power under the alternative hypothesis)2 All we can say is that

there is very slightly more support for the Cournot than for the leader-

follower model, although the differential is not decisive. To conserve on

space, therefore, we do not report 3SLS parameters for the estimated leader-

follower model.13

        We now turn to a discussion of firm-specific estimated returns to scale,

With our normalized quadratic cost function (15), not only are cost function

parameters and estimated returns to scale firm-specific, but they also vary by

observation; our findings suggest that allowing for such diversity among firms
                      INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP 8EHAVIOR                       - PAGE     22 -

 (and estimated standard errors) for five years -- 1959, 1974, 1978, 1980 and
 1983,   based on the unconstrained, Cournot, and leader/follower behavioral
 assumptions.
         The first striking result here is that for any year, estimates of firm-

specific      returns to scale are remarkably similar across the three models; this

reflects in part the fact that constraints implied by the Cournot and

leader/follower models are reasonably consistent with out data. Second, the

estimated returns to scale are smallest for GM and largest for Chrysler, a

result that is not unexpected given the relative sizes of these firms. Third,

although increasing returns to scale are present for all three firms for most

of the sample, at the very end of the sample in 1983 scale economies changed

to decreasing returns, reflecting perhaps the effects of concerted efforts on

the part of automakers to downsize their manufacturing operations and a

somewhat stronger demand in 1983 relative to the 1981-82 recessionary years.14

Finally, note that these returns to scale calculations hold constant the size

composition of output, and in that sense correspond to ray elasticities.

Elasticities of cost with respect to product mix, as well as other elasticity

estimates based on our estimated unconstrained, Cournot and leader/follower

models, are reported in Table A2 of Appendix III to this paper.15

         On the demand side,   one can use the estimated parameters of the firm-

specific inverse demand functions to calculate a variety         of   elasticities. One

"very partial" demand elasticity is computed simply by solving the               firm's

inverse demand equation (32) for, say, Yj and then computing the "very

partial" elasticity aln yj/aln pj —                         —
                                         (ay/ap).(p/y           Pi/(ojiyj);   other

"very partial" demand elasticities for firm i     can   be computed    analogously.

These   estimated elasticities, presented in Table 6 below, are very partial in

the sense that they measure, for example, the effect of a price change on the

quantity demanded for one firm, holding the outputs of other firms fixed as

well as the other macroeconomic shift variables in the demand equations.

        As is seen in Table 6, the estimated own-price very partial demand

elasticities are all negative as expected, they indicate demand is elastic,

and that demand is more own-price responsive for GM than for Ford or Chrysler;

furthermore, while outputs from GM and Ford are highly substitutable, those

between Ford and Chrysler, and GM and Chrysler, are complementary. Since both

Ford and GM appear to be highly complementary with Chrysler, whose own              price
elasticity of demand is relatively smallest, these elasticity estimates

suggest that relatively few consumers view Chrysler as their primary car, but
                    INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEHAVIOR                      - PACE    24 -
instead view    it as a   secondary auto that   can be used in conjunction with

either    Ford or CM as their primary auto.
      In terms of other very partial" output elasticities, a somewhat
surprising result we have is that the demand elasticity with respect to GNP is
negative,    and largest (in absolute value) for GM; the elasticity with respect

to the   unemployment rate UN is negative, as expected, is largest (in absolute
value) for GM and smallest for Ford. The demand elasticity with respect to

the real interest rate INR is positive whenever INR is positive (IHR is

negative in 1974 and 1979), and in these cases it is considerably larger for

GM than for Ford or Chrysler.

         In terms of demand responses to real gasoline prices, all elasticity

estimates are negative and substantial; from 1974 onward, GM's products are

particularly GAS price sensitive, while Ford's are least responsive.

Increases in the CPI relative to the GNP deflator, ceteris paribus, increase

demand for products from all three automakers, with CM's demand being

particularly responsive. Finally, the elasticity of demand with respect to

the exchange rate (S/yen) is negative for all three automakers, indicating

that as the US dollar depreciates, the increasingly less expensive Japanese

imports provide stiff competition for domestic autoniakers; not surprisingly,

this elasticity is largest (in absolute value) for CM, while estimates for

Ford and Chrysler are approximately equal.

      It is worth noting that while the results in Table 6 are based on the

estimated unconstrained model, roughly similar findings occur with the Cournot

and leader/follower specifications.

      A basic problem with interpreting these "very partial" demand

elasticities is that it is of course entirely unrealistic to expect that

within oligopolistic automobile manufacturing, firms' quantities would be held

fixed even if one automaker changed price. Rather, as outlined in our

theoretical section, profit maximizing firms would recognize their

interdependent product demands, and engage in strategic pricing and markup

behavior. Thus a more useful elasticity calculation is one based on a

"general equilibrium" rather than a "very partial" simulation - -   one    in which

the reduced form equations are simultaneously solved, corresponding to

situations in which all three firms simultaneously optimize, setting prices,

adjusting production, and varying their markups to maximize profits.

      To   compute these general equilibrium output prices and quantities, we
first solve the three inverse demand (32) and the three profit-maximizing

MR/MC markup equations (2) for the three firms' prices and quantities, using

historical data on all the exogenous variables.16 The estimated marginal

Costs and optimal markups for the unconstrained, Cournot and leader/follower

models by firm, for selected years, are given in Table 7•17 A number of

results are worth emphasizing.

      First, except for 1974, marginal costs are largest for GM under all

three behavioral specifications, and are larger for Ford than Chrysler until

the end of the sample, when their marginal Costs are approximately equal.

      Second, it is clear from Table 7 that markups vary substantially over

time and among firms, indicating that diversity rather than constancy of

markups characterizes the US automobile industry. Markups are uniformly

larger under Cournot behavior than under unconstrained profit maximization.

Notice also that in the leader/follower specification, markups for GM are

larger than under Cournot, for Ford they are smaller, and for Chrysler they

are very slightly larger. A priori, one might expect that markups under

leader/follower behavior relative to Cournot conduct would be larger for the

leader (CM), and smaller for both follower firms (Ford and Chrysler). The

small but very slightly larger markups for Chrysler under leader/follower

relative to Cournot are therefore somewhat surprising, but this result does

not indicate that the estimated model is inconsistent with expectations based

on theory. Rather, it is due in large part to the fact that the estimated

technology and demand parameters are different in the leader/follower and

Cournot models; we conjecture that if one used all the Cournot parameters and

in addition constrained A1   according   to (28) using the Cournot model estimated

parameters, then profits and markups would be larger for GM and smaller for

both Ford and Chrysler under leader/follower than under Cournot behavior.18

      Third, on an   absolute basis, markups are smallest for GM, and under

unconstrained profit maximization, they are largest for Chrysler; when Gournot

or leader/follower behavior is assumed, however, approximately equal markups

occur for Ford and Chrysler for most years, with Chrysler improving relative to

Ford towards the end of the sample. Since Chrysler's marginal costs are

smallest for most of the sample, on a percentage basis the markups presented in

Table 7 are typically largest for Chrysler and smallest for CM.

      Finally, in all cases the differentials in markups between GM and the

other two firms are much less than differences in marginal costs, particularly

in the case of unconstrained general profit maximization. This suggests that

CM may well be experiencing significant constraints upon its pricing behavior,

constraints not adequately modeled using simple Cournot and leader/follower

frameworks. One   possibility   is that we may be observing a situation in which

CM sets its price and Ford and Chrysler act as a quasi-competitive fringe. In

view of the uniformly higher marginal cost differentials than price

differentials between CM and its rivals, this suggests that Ford and Chrysler

may be adapting to CM's prices and exploiting their relative cost

differentials. A detailed analysis of such Bertrand-type price-setting (rather

than Cournot quantity-setting) behavior is of great interest and is currently

underway, but it is beyond the scope of this paper.

      In view of the high variability of the marginal cost and markup values

over the sample period, it is useful to consider how output prices, output

quantities, and markups have responded to supply and demand shocks that shift

the cost and inverse demand functions. The cyclical nature of markup behavior

has been the subject of considerable recent controversy. Although the

conventional wisdom has been that in periods of slack demand, firms are more
                   INTERDEPENDENT MARXUP BEHAVIOR                     - PAGE   29 -
willing to   cut prices to maintain market share)-9 the recent "revisionist"

literature argues that in periods of booms, firms may believe that the

penalties for cheating are less, and that they can better afford to cut prices

to increase market share.2°

       To examine this issue more closely using our micro data, we compute

reduced form general equilibrium elasticities of output price, output quantity,

marginal cost and markup with respect to the exogenous macro-economic variables

in the inverse demand functions. More specifically, using historical data on

all the exogenous variables and our 3SLS estimated parameters, we solved the

nine inverse demand, MR/MG and marginal cost equations for nine endogenous

variables --   output   price, output quantity, and marginal cost, for each of the

three firms. We then increased one of the      exogenous macro-economic variables
in   the inverse demand equation by lx, obtained a new set of firms' prices,

quantities, marginal costs and markups, and then computed an arc elasticity.

We did this for each of the six macroeconomic exogenous variables, using

parameter estimates from all three models; to conserve space, in Tables 8 and 9

we report results from these "reduced form"     general   equilibrium elasticity

computations for only the unconstrained profit maximization model.21 Several

coents are worth noting.

        First, to us the most striking finding from these tables is the diversity

in elasticity estimates --     both among firms and over time. This diversity
suggests that imposing constancy over time, or equality among firms on markup

behavior masks substantial heterogeneity. In the top panel of Table 8,         for
example, we see that output quantity elasticities tend to have the same sign

for    CM and Ford, but these often differ from Chrysler; output quantity

elasticity estimates differ in sign among automakers for the UN, CPI and EXR

variables, but have the same (negative) sign in the case of GAS. The

idiosyncratic 1959 estimates for Chrysler reflect in part a computational

difficulty we experienced in obtaining a reduced-form solution to Chrysler's

output price, output quantity and markup equations in that year,

         More specifically, as seen in the top panel of Table 8, while CM's and

Ford's output reacts positively to CNP, the elasticity of Ford's output is

considerably larger than CM's; moreover, except for 1959, Chrysler's output

exhibits a consistently large but negative elasticity of output with respect to

CNP. In tens of other macroeconomic variables, CM and Ford have the same

qualitative response of output with respect to UN (positive) and CPI

(negative), although Ford's output responses are more volatile. The response

of output with respect to EXR ($/yen) also varies by fin. When EXR increases,

Japanese imports become more expensive in tens of US dollars, ceteris paribus,

the output of GM and Ford increases (consumers view CM and Ford as being

substitutes for Japanese imports), while that of Chrysler decreases (Chrysler

products being complementary to Japanese imports).

        Second, as seen in the bottom panel of Table 8, for all fins the reduced

form   general   equilibrium output price elasticities are much smaller in absolute

magnitude than output quantity elasticities. Moreover, in many cases these

output price elasticity estimates vary in sign among automakers.

        Tuning to the top panel of Table 9 where we report marginal cost

elasticity estimates, we again are struck by the diversity. CM's marginal

costs are least responsive to macro-economic supply and demand shocks, and

elasticity   estimates for Chrysler often differ in sign from CM and Ford. If
one    interprets the marginal cost elasticity with respect to GAS as reflecting
                  INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEHAVIOR                      -   PAGE   33   -




supply shocks,   for all three automakers these elasticity estimates are

positive, as expected.

      Finally, in the bottom panel of Table 9 we report reduced form        general
equilibrium markup elasticities. In Appendix II to thise paper we show that

even in models much simpler than ours, the predicted signs of these markup

elasticities with respect to supply and/or demand shocks are often ambiguous.

Thus, economic theory provides little guidance on what to expect here, and

instead we must address these issues empirically. In general, we again find

considerable diversity, with sign estimates being the same for GM and Ford, but

different for Chrysler. In particular, for CM and Ford, we find that markup

elasticities with respect to real GNP are positive, lending support to the

"conventional wisdom"; such is not the case, however, for Chrysler. Hence,

depending on the firm    being   analyzed, we find support for both the

"conventional wisdom" and "revisionist" literatures. Markup elasticity

estimates with respect to 1J and EKE are positive for GM and Ford, and those

for Ford are larger in absolute value, suggesting that Ford has a more volatile

markup behavior; for Chrysler, these elasticity estimates are negative. Except

for Chrysler in 1959, markup elasticity estimates with respect to GAS are

always negative,, suggesting that increases in real gas prices, ceteris paribus,

impose substantial pressures on the profitability of all three U.S. automakers.

V.    CONCLUDING REMARKS

      Our purpose in this paper has been to implement empirically, using firm-

specific data from the US automobile industry, a model sufficiently general to

permit the testing of a variety of specific behavioral postulates associated

with the strategic profit maximizing behavior of GM. Ford and Chrysler. We

find that our 1959-1983 data are consistent with both a Cournot quantity-

setting set of constraints, and with the restrictions implied by

leader/follower behavior, with GM acting as leader; although neither set of
                   INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEHAVIOR                  - PACE   34 -
restrictions   is rejected at usual levels of significance, the constraints

implied by the leader/follower model are slightly more binding than those

associated with Cournot behavior. In terms of the cyclical analysis of markup

behavior, our most striking result is the great diversity of behavior we find

among CM, Ford and Chrysler. Depending on which firm is being analyzed, there

is support for the pro-cyclical conventional wisdom of markups (GM and Ford),

as well as for the counter-cyclical revisionist literature (Chrysler).

Diversity, rather than constancy and homogeneity, best characterizes this

indus try.

      Our research can be extended in a number of ways. First, we have

examined only the Cournot-type quantity-setting models, and have not developed

a framework for assessing bertrand-type price-setting models. We are currently

working on developing and estimating such price-setting models, and comparing

them with results from this paper.

      Second, data limitations have precluded us from developing a framework

for introducing the strategic behavior of Japanese automakers explicitly into

our analysis of the US auto market (although our inverse demand equation does

account for changes in the dollar/yen exchange rate). That would seem to be a

useful and informative research topic, but data issues could be somewhat

difficult to overcome.

      Third, although our data have been constructed with care, we well realize

that the reliability of our firm-specific data series can be called into

question, especially for the capital stock estimates. In this paper we have

used a long-run cost function with capital price rather than capital stock as a

regressor, thereby attempting to mitigate measurement error problems. A useful

direction for future research would be to specify instead a short-run cost

function where capital is quasi-fixed and attempt to deal directly with

econometric problems associated with measurement error.

      Finally,   our measure of output has taken product mix into account by

including an hedonic adjustment, but a more satisfying procedure would involve

specifying and estimating a model in which the various sizes would be treated

as distinct outputs. Because such a model would necessarily involve a

considerable increase in the number of parameters to be estimated, however, its

implementation would require increasing the number of observations, and thus

our 1959-83 data would need to be updated, and perhaps even extended backwards

before 1959.

APPENDIX    I:   DATA SOURCES AND DATA CONSTRUCTION

      The data set for this study consists of annual data from 1959-1983, taken

primarily    from that originally constructed and employed by Ana Aizcorbe,

Clifford Winston and Ann F. Friedlaender (19871 and extended by us. We now

describe this data set and our extensions to it; a more detailed description of

the original data is given in Aizcorbe, Winston and Friedlaender (1987.

especially pp. 22-32].

      Data on labor quantity (number of domestic employees) were available from

Moody's and Standard & Poor for Chrysler and Ford, while GM provided data on

its domestic employment. Annual compensation data for domestic employees of

each of the automakers were obtained from the United Auto Workers.

      Because data on the cost of materials purchased by domestic plants were

not available, it was necessary to employ series on the materials purchases by

domestic operations. Following Aizcorbe, Winston and Friedlaender, we assume

that from 1959 to 1983 the ratio of domestic materials purchases to domestic

sales was the same as the ratio of worldwide materials purchases to worldwide

sales. To mitigate problems of double-counting and in interpreting transfer

prices in these vertically integrated firms, we employed as our measure of

materials prices the average cost in dollars per pound of materials purchased

by each automaker.

      The capital rental price measure takes taxes and expected inflation into

account, as outlined in Aizoorbe, Winston and Friedlaender [1987, pp. 27-30].

Although the tax     rate   and expected inflation variables are common among the

three firms (the latter calculated using an adaptive expectations

representation), the cost of financing is firm-specific and is computed as a

weighted average of the cost of borrowing and the cost of equity, where the

latter is estimated using a capital asset pricing model. Based on firms'

financial data from domestic operations and assuming that retained earnings
                    INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEHAVIOR                   - PAGE   37 -

approximate economic profits, total domestic costs were computed     as sales minus
net   earnings plus dividends.    The total capital costs were then calculated as

total domestic costs minus labor costs and materials costs, and capital

quantity was then constructed as total capital costs divided by the rental

price of capital.

        For each of the three firms, input prices were transformed into constant

1975$ by dividing the input price measure by the GNP deflator. Sample means,

minimum and maximum values, and standard deviations for the three input price

and quantity measures for each of the automakers are presented in Table 1 in

the main text of this paper. There it is seen that while average materials

prices were lowest for GM and highest for Chrysler. average labor and capital

prices were the exact opposite, being highest for GM and lowest for Chrysler.

        The output price and quantity data were constructed in two steps. First,

output quantity data were obtained as the number of autos produced, with an

adjustment made for calendar year vs. model year. The corresponding output

price measure was then computed as average revenue, i.e., the dollar value of

sales divided by the number of autos produced.

        The problem with both these measures is that they fail to take into

account the changing composition of automobile production among small,

intermediate and large models. Although we have a preference for specifying a

model that treats these various size classes as distinct outputs, our

relatively small time series of data does not permit such a rich

parameterization, and thus we compromise by employing an hedonic approach that

facilitates a more parsimonious parameterization.

        Specifically, we ran a pooled Box-Cox regression equation for the three

automakers in which a real average revenue variable (average revenue divided by

the GNP deflator) was regressed on a series of annual time dummies, firm-

specific dummy   variables   for Ford and Chrysler, and firm-specific product mix
                       IWrERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEHAVIOR                       - PACE   38 -
variables for     Ford and   Chrysler, where the latter were defined as the share of
large   models   (gross vehicle weight greater      than 3,000 pounds) in total vehicle

production by firm. To avoid problems of scaling, we divided the dependent

variable by the sample geometric mean. Using maximum likelihood estimation, we

obtained an estimate of the Box-Cox transformation parameter equal to 2.71,

with a large-sample standard error of 0.87. Note that a 95X confidence

interval would barely include A —          1.00, the traditional linear specification.
        Based on this Box-Cox regression, for each observation we set the

stochastic disturbance term to zero and then computed the predicted value by

reversing the Box-Cox transformation,


                   -
                       (;.X    +   1)1/;

where u   is   the estimated Box-Cox transformation parameter. To normalize

these quality-adjusted prices, we divided each it by the predicted value for

GM in 1975, and thereby obtained normalized quality-adjusted real price indexes

for GM, Ford and Chrysler. These price indexes are given in Table Al below.

        Finally, to obtain a consistent measure of real output quantity adjusted

for compositional changes, we divided constant dollars sales by the above

composition-adjusted price of output. Sample means, minimum and maximum

values, and standard deviations for the output quantity, output price and

product mix variables are presented for each of the three firms in Table 1 in

the main text. Note that after adjusting for size composition, average car

prices among automakers are approximately equal; CM's average prices are

smallest while those from Chrysler are largest.22

        Last of all, a common Set of variables       was specified as   being exogenous

to the firm-specific demand equations. These exogenous variables included real

GNP, a real interest rate (INR), the unemployment rate (UN), real gasoline

prices (CAS), the ratio of the consumer price index to the GNP deflator (CPI),

       A STYLIZED FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING CYCLICAL VARIATIONS IN MARKUPS23

        In   this appendix we present stylized models of markup behavior that

assist us in interpreting empirical findings on the markup elasticity behavior

of GM, Ford and Chrysler. We begin with the case of a monopolist, and then

consider three types of frameworks for oligopolists.

        For simplification, assume a monopolist faces a quadratic cost function

and a linear demand function, and that it produces a single output y, utilizing

a single input whose price is w. Write the monopolist's inverse demand

function as

               p—a-by+u                                                                              (Al)

where a and b are positive parameters, and u represents a composite exogenous

demand effect. Since the cost function is quadratic, the marginal cost

function can be expressed as

               mc—cw+dy+v                                                                            (A2)

where c and d are assumed to be positive parameters and v represents a

compositie exogenous supply effect independent of input prices. Thus v can be

interpreted as an exogenous technological shock, while unexpected changes in V

can be interpreted as input price shocks.

        Assuming the monopolist acts so as to maximize profits, we obtain the

following reduced-form expressions for optimal output y optimal marginal cost

       and the optimal price-marginal cost markup p*:24:

               y* — (a +           u - cw    -
                                                     v)/(2b   + d)                                   (A3)

               mc — (2bcw          + cia + du + 2bv)/(2b + d)                                        (A4)
                *         *           *          *
                    —(p -mc)/mc
                    —   by*/(dy*          + cw + v) —         b/fd   + (CV + v)/y*)1.                (A5)

Notice that dy*/du >          0,   dy*/dv <          0,   while sign (dxuc*/du) —   sign   (dmc*/dv) —

sign   (d/(2b + dfl. From this, we can conclude that a positive demand shock (du
                     INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEHAVIOR                     -   PAGE   41 -
>   0) will increase the monopolist's output level and markup, while a positive

supply shock (dv > 0) will have the opposite effect.25 If the monopolist is

producing under increasing returns to scale, then d C 0, and the response of

its output and markup to a supply or demand shock is the same as that if it

produces under increasing costs Cd > 0). However, the reponse of marginal

costs will be affected by the returns to scale since a positive demand shock u

will cause marginal costs to increase or decrease depending on whether the firm

producers under increasing or decreasing costs.26

        While the response of a monopolist to demand or supply shocks is rather

intuitive, the response of oligopolists is less so. To obtain an understanding

of the nature of these responses in oligopolistic markets, we find it useful to

consider the behavior of duopolies using three different behavioral

assumptions:27 (i) both firms act as Cournot quantity setters; (ii) one firm

acts   as a leader and the other as a follower; and (iii) firms act as Cournot

quantity setters in a world of asymmetric information.

        (i) Cournot. Assume that the firms under consideration produce close

substitutes Yl and y2, and that they each face linear demand functions of the

form

              Yl — a11p1 + a12p2 + u1                                              (A6)

              y2 — a21p1 + a22p2 + u2                                              (A7)

where all ajj's are constant and u1 and u2 represent exogenous influences on

demand. From the regularity conditions, we know that au C 0 and au > 0

(iØj), and that D — a11a22           a12a21 > 0. The inverse demand functions take the

form

              P1 — (a22y1   -           -                                          (AS)
                                a12y2       a22u1 + a12u2)/D
                 —
                     (-a21y1 + a11y2 + a21u1 - a11u2)/D.                           (A9)

Now let each first operate with a linear marginal cost function, having the form

              mci — b1wi + b2y + ei                                                (AlO)
                     INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEHAVIOR                           - PACE    42 -
where   b1 and b2   are constant across firms, and e1 represents a firm-specific

exogenous   supply effect. Note that if the firms in the industry are producing
under increasing marginal          costs, then b2 > 0, and conversely, if they are

producing under increasing returns to scale.

        If each firm acts as a Cournot quantity setter, it sets its marginal cost

equal to its marginal revenue, assuming a fixed output of the other firm.

Setting mci — mn      (i —   1,2)   and solving the resulting system of equations for

each firm's equilibrium level of output yields the following equilibrium output

levels for each firm:

             Yl — A1E1 + A2E2          + A3u1 + A4u2                                    (All)

             y2 — B1E1 + B2E2 + B3u1 + ¼u2                                              (A12)

Given these sign inequalities, we can see from (All) and (A12) that a positive

demand shock that affects one firm (dui >            0)   will increase the equilibrium

output of both firms. By contrast, a supply shock that adversely affects the

costs of one firm (e.g., dE1 >0) will lower the equilibrium output of that

firm while raising the output of its competitor.28
                 INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEHAVIOR                     -   PAGE   43 -
      While changes in the microeconomic environment can cause firm-specific
demand or supply shocks, changes in the macroeconomic environment should affect

both firms. Thus it is useful to analyze the response of each firm to

simultaneous shifts in each firm's demand function (du1 — du2 — du > 0) and in

each firm's marginal cost function (dE1 — dE2 — dE >   0).   Such demand shifts

could arise due to a booming economy, while supply shifts could also occur from

such a boom or an exogenous increase in input prices, such as the energy price

shocks that affected the US economy during the 1970's.

      In the case of a demand shock, since dy/du1 and dy/du2 are each

positive, it is clear that a general demand shock will increase the equilibrium

output of both firms. In contrast, a general supply shock has an ambiguous

impact, since as noted above an individual supply shock affects each firm in

opposite directions. Nevertheless, there is a presumption that the impact of a

general supply shock on output is negative, since

            dy IdE — D(aij +   2aii   -
                                          Db2)/D1.                             (Al4)

Thus, unless the cross demand effect (au) is very large relative to the own

demand effect (au), dyi/dE < 0.

      It is also clear that both firms' prices will rise from a positive demand

shock, since a rise in firm l's prices due to an outward shift in its demand

function will cause firm 2's demand curve to shift out due to the relative

price effect. Similarly, a positive supply shock on the part of firm 1 will

cause its price to rise and its output to fall. This in turn will shift firm

2's demand curve outward, causing its output and price to rise. Thus it is

clear that a simultaneous demand shock will cause both firms' outputs and

prices to rise. By contrast, a simultaneous supply shock will unambiguously

cause both firms' prices to rise, while having a likely (but not necessarily)

net reduction in their outputs. Hence, while the price effects are

unambiguously procyclical in the case of both demand and supply shocks, the
                          INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEHAVIOR                       -   PAGE   4-
output    effects are unambiguously procyclical in the case of demand shocks and

are likely to be countercyclical in the case of supply shocks.

         Let   us   now consider the response of markups - -          — (p*   mc*)/mc* -   - to
demand or supply shocks. In the case of this duopoly, the markup for each firm

is   given by the following expression:
                      —
                          (-aij/D)/1b2   + Ej/y(Ej.Ejui.u2)].                         (A15)

Since a positive demand shock unambiguously causes each firm's output to rise,

a demand shock will also cause each firm's markup to increase. By contrast, a

supply shock that raises costs will cause the markup to fall since Ej rises and

y falls. If a macroeconomic boom is characterized by both positive demand

and supply (input price) shocks, it follows that the net effect of such a boom

on a firm's markup is ambiguous, since positive demand shocks and input price

effects have opposite impacts upon each firm's markup relative to marginal

costs.

         It is important to note that this analysis has been based on the

assumption that the firms in the industry operate under increasing marginal

Costs, which occurs when there are decreasing returns to scale. If firms

instead operate under constant marginal costs (b2 —             0),   the results given above

will not change since the signs of the coefficients of the equilibrium output

equations given in equations (All) and (A12) will not be affected. If,

however, the firms operate under decreasing marginal costs (b2 <              0),   then it is

generally impossible to sign the relevant expressions since the sign of the

numerators containing b2 generally becomes ambiguous.29 Thus, we cannot derive

general conclusions about the impact of supply or demand shocks in the presence

of decreasing marginal costs; the effects of these shocks depend on the

parameter values of the underlying cost and demand functions.

         (ii) Leader/follower. Any extension of the formal analysis beyond the

Cournot model quickly becomes very           messy analytically. Nonetheless, we can
                     INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEHAVIOR                -   PAGE   45   -



obtain   an understanding of the economic issues underlying differences between

the behavior in a Cournot and in a leader/follower framework by considering a

simple example. Specifically, assume that the demand functions are given by

the following expressions,

             y1— -4p1+p2+u1                                                   (AlG)

                —
                     2l       -
                                   P2 +   u2,                                 (Al7)

and that each firm's marginal cost is given by

             mci —   yi   +       ei,   i —   1,2.                            (A18)

      In this case we can show that the Cournot equilibrium is given by

             Yl — (-lOe1 + e2 + 4u1 + 3u2)/19                                 (Al9)

                — (2e1        -
                                   4e2 + 3u1 + 7u2)/19,                       (A20)

while the leader/follower equilibrium has the form

                — (-lOe1 + e2 + 4u1 + 3u2)/l8                                 (A21)

                                   19e2/90 + 7u1/47 +   llu2/30.
                              -
             y2 — e1/9                                                        (A22)

From this we see that relative to the Cournot solution, each of the leader's

coefficients are larger in absolute value, and each of the follower's

coefficients are smaller. This implies, in turn, that the leader's output will

be more volatile and that the follower's output will be less volatile, in

response to all types of shocks. This occurs because the greater monopoly

power of the leader enables it to exploit more of supply or demand shifts

caused by the shock --         whether positive or negative.
      (iii) Asymmetric Information. To this point we have analyzed market

behavior in a world in which the various firms may be myopic, but in which the

market acts as though there is full information about each firm's cost and

demand functions. Typically, however, instead of there being full information

about the structure of costs and demands, one finds incomplete or asymmetric

information. Thus it is useful to analyze a simple example in which asymmetric

information exists, and then compare it to the case in which full information
                          INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEHAVIOR                                       - PAGE   46 -
occurs. We now show that the effects of demand or supply shocks on output
levels   and firm markups will be smoothed in the presence of asymmetric

information.

        To see this, consider a world of Cournot quantity setters, and let us now

compare the equilibria in the presence of full and asymmetric information.

Assume initially that in firm l's marginal cost function (AlO), e1 — 1 and that

after the supply shock e1 —                0.    Moreover, both firms know that e2 — 0.                 If both

firms act as Cournot competitors with full information, the equilibrium outputs

turn out to be

          — 1:        Yl —       (-10 +    4u1 +    3u2)/19     y2 —       (2    + 3u1 +   7u2)/19      (A23)

       e1 —0:         y1 — (4u1 +          3u2)/19              y2 — (3u1 +         7u2)/l9.            (A24)

Thus, as a result of the fall in e1 from one to zero, firm l's output will rise

by 10/19, while that of firm 2 will fall by 2/19.

       Under asymmetric information, firm 1 knows that e1 falls from one to

zero, while firm 2 believes with probability 0                          that   e1 — 1 and with probability

1 -   • that   e1 —   0.       Let yl denote firm l's output when e1 — 1 and yl denote

firm l's output when e1 —             0.        The respective MR/NC equilibrium conditions for

firm 1 are given by

                          -
                               .5y2 + .S(u1 + u2) — y1 +        1                                       (A25)

                               •5y2 + .5(u1 + u2) — y1.
                          -
                                                                                                        (A26)

Since an expected profit-maximizing firm 2 does not know firm l's supply

structure, it applies the following MR/NC equilibrium condition:
                 -
                      5Y2 + u1 + 2u2) +            (1   -
                                                            *)(-y   -                   —
                                                                        5)r2 + u1 + 2u2) y2.            (A27)

The solution to this Bayesian game is given as follows:

               y111 —         - .5 + 0/38 + 4u1/19 + 3u2/19                                             (A28)

               y11, —         -0/38 + 4u1/19 + 3u2/l9                                                   (A29)

                      —       20/19 + 3u1/19 + 7u2/19.                                                  (A30)
                   INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEHAVIOR                     -   PAGE 47 -

      When e1 —   0,   firm 1 increases its output by 10/19 in a world of full

information, while in a world of asymmetric information, it increased its

output by 10/19 - .5 +    /38.    Since .5 > /38, firm l's change in output is

greater in the world of full information. Similarly, in a full information

environment, firm 2's output falls by 2/19 while in a world of asymmetric

information its output falls by (1 -     #)•2/19.   Thus in both cases, a supply

shock reducing the costs of firm 1 generates smaller shifts in output when

there is asymmetric information, i.e. asymmetric information smooths the

impacts of supply shocks on equilibrium output levels. This arises because the

uninformed firm will always produce an average level of output to minimize its

potential losses under asymmetric information.

      Although the specific responses of output, prices and markups will vary

with the specific market structure, the above analysis suggests that positive

demand shocks (either firm-specific or general) will cause the output, prices

and markups of all firms to rise. Similarly, a general supply shock will tend

to reduce the outputs and markups of the firms in the market, while

simultaneously increasing prices. By contrast, a positive supply shock to a

specific firm will tend to reduce its output and markup while increasing the

output and markup of its competitor. Finally, to the extent that booms are

characterized by simultaneous positive cost and demand shocks, we cannot

predict whether the response of the markup will be pro- or counter-cyclical.

If demand shocks are large relative to cost shocks, then it is likely that

markups will rise with booms. If, however, cost shocks are large relative to

demand shocks, the opposite will occur. This suggests that Cost inflation will

generally be accompanied by falling markups, while demand inflation will

generally be accompanied by rising markups.

      Of course, these results must be adapted if any of the firms in the

industry operate undering decreasing marginal Costs and increasing returns to
                   INTERDEPENDENT MARXUP BEHAVIOR                     - PAGE   48 -
scale.   Specifically,   in such a case, the theoretical results obtained above

must be qualified, since the actual market response depends on particular

parameter   values - - specifically,   the extent of decreasing marginal Costs

relative to the own and cross-demand effects.

FOOTNOTES




1For example. Appelbaum [1979], Porter [1985], Bresnahan [19811 and Sullivan
[1985] have tended to focus on general industry or product behavior, while
Collop and Roberts [1979] and Suslow [19861 have focussed more on firm
behavior. For an empirical analysis of the railroad industry incorporating
dynamic behavior, see Green and Porter (19841 and Porter (1983,1985].

2For other studies of the automobile industry, see Timothy Bresnahan
(1987,19811, Ann F. Friedlaender, Ernst R. Berndt and Hua He [1987], and
Melvyn Fuss and Leonard Waverman (1985,19861.

3See Jean Tirole [19881, especially chapters 5 and 6, for a discussion of
dynamic games and their relationship to static behavioral oligopoly models.

4We treat firms as quantity setters for empirical convenience and the ease
that formulating the problem in this fashion provides in interpreting the
estimated coefficients and parameter constraints. Research on price-setting
(Bertrand) behavior is currently in process. It is also worth noting that
since firms usually use price rather than output as a strategic variable, it
is useful to envisage quantity competition as really being a form of caacitv
competition, in which firms use capacity rather than output per se as a
strategic variable. In such a case, the profit function can be viewed as a
reduced form, once price competition has been "solved out". For a more
complete discussion of these issues, see Tirole [1988, chapter 5], Kreps and
Scheinkman (1983] and Deneckere and Davidson (1985].

5Specifically, within the automobile industry, model changes occur on a yearly
basis, and product runs are typically reassessed throughout the year.

6For example, firms' objective functions might contain additional arguments
such as net worth, or be characterized by a long-term dynamic view of
profitability rather than a short-term static view.

7unlike a simple quadratic approximation, a normalized quadratic approximation
satisfies the condition that the cost function is homogeneous of degree one in
factor prices. The normalized quadratic function is discussed in Daniel
McFadden [1978], has been implemented by Ernst R. Berndt, Melvyn Fuss and
Leonard Wavernian (1980] and by Catherine J. Morrison and Ernst R. Berndt
(1981]; its curvature and flexibility properties have been assessed by W.
Erwin Diewert and Terence J. Wales (1987].

8The analysis of Bertrand-type price-setting behavior is beyond the scope of
this paper, but will form the basis of a subsequent research project.

91n the case of a pure monopolist (and dleting i-subscripts), the MR/MC
condition analogous to (20) is given by P —    + a,y + 5a5w5 + Ày,
where A —   -6. Here 5 represents the own-price effect in the inverse demand
function. For an empirical implementation of such a monopolistic model using
aggregate industry data, see Morrison [1988,1990]. Note that in the Cournot
case, each oligopolist acts as though it were a monopolist operating in its
given market, where the own price effect Sj represents the firm inverse
demand function as opposed to the true monopolist inverse demand function 6.

10Thjs approach has been used by, among others, Appelbaum (1982), Bresnahan
(1987), Porter (1983,19851 and Lee and Porter (1984), although Porter has
                   INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEHAVIOR                     - PAGE    52 -
explicitly introduced dynamic considerations.       For aggregate analyses of
dynamic  changes in monopoly power, see Hall (1986], Rotemberg and Saloner
(1986], and Morrison (1988,1990].
In an interdependent market such as the automobile industry, firms will form
expectations of other firms' endogenous output price, quantity and markup
variables. By using the 3SLS estimation procedure, we ensure that the
conjectured variations in our estimated model are consistent with the rational
expectations hypothesis. For further discussion, see Lars P. Hansen and
Kenneth singleton (1982].

12Note that when the constraints involve cross-equation restrictions, as they
do for both these tests, it becomes more difficultto assign restrictions to
specific equations. To check on the ability of our overall model to reject
hypotheses, we  tested the null hypothesis that parameters of the inverse
output demand, input demand, and MR/MC equations were equal for GM, Ford and
Chrysler; the alternative hypothesis is the unconstrained profit maximization
model summarized in Table 2. We obtained a Wald test statistic of 1637.747,
with the .01 chi-square critical value for 52 restrictions being about 78.6;
hence this null hypothesis is decisively rejected. Incidentally, we also
specified a behavioral model in which total collusion reigned and in which the
three firms were treated as distinct plants producing substitutable outputs,
but owned by a single monopolist. The MR/MC conditions obtained by maximizing
the sum of profits for GM, Ford and Chrysler with respect to these three
outputs turned_out to be a slight generalization of (20) in which, for the ith

tested    their empirical validity using the ald test
statistic for the 9 restrictions was 105.256, whil, the .01 chi-square
critical value is 19.679; hence the null hypothesis is decisively rejected.
We conclude that our model has sufficient goodness of fit and power to reject
hypotheses, and that our result that the restrictions implied by Cournot and
leader/follower behavior are consistent with the data is a meaningful one.

13Not surprisingly, 3SLS parameter estimates from the estimated leader-
follower model do not vary dramatically from those reported in Tables 2 and 4.

14For example, the index of industrial production for motor vehicles and parts
increased 28.4X from a level of 66.8 in 1982 to 85.8 in 1983 (1977 — 100).
Source: Economic Report of the President 1990, Table C-50, p. 350.
150ne result   of particular interest here isthat for GM and Ford. the
elasticity of cost with respect to product mix becomes closer to zero towards
the end of the sample period, indicating that for these firms, cost become
less sensitive to product mix (the share of large vehicles in total
production). This may reflect the general downsizing of the fleet due to CAFE
standards, and thus the relative homogenization of US automobile production.

16Note that one might interpret the numerical iterative steps toward solving
out this system of nonlinear equations as corresponding to a process in which
market participants adjust quantities until a Nash equilibrium is attained.

17These dollar values have been computed by reversing the normalization
procedure used for estimation, and multiplying the transformed prices and
costs by the price of labor. Thus the values should be interpreted as being
in units of 1975$.

18Notjce that since returns   to scale are not constant, what happens   to markups
                 INTERDEPENDENT MARKUP BEHAVIOR                   - PAGE   53 -




for the leading firm is not precisely clear when behavior changes from Cournot
to leader/follower. However, profits for the leader firm should be larger
under leader/follower behavior.

For a discussion and elaboration of this conventional wisdom on cyclical
markup behavior, see F. M. Scherer 11980]

20For a discussion of the revisionist hypothesis, see Julio Rotemberg and
Garth Saloner (19861. Mark Bus (1989] has argued that the revisionist
hypothesis might be particularly plausible for durable goods manufacturers,
such as automobiles.

21Estimates of these reduced form general equilibrium elasticities are roughly
similar under the Cournot and leader/follower specifications.

22Before the hedonic adjustment, average output prices for GM, Ford and
Chrysler were $5899.35, $5493.06 and $5390.90, respectively, while average
output quantities were 4.94, 2.67 and 1.30.

23Thjs appendix owes a great deal to Hua He, who developed the examples and
wrote a first draft of it.

24There is some ambiguity in how one defines the percentage markup. Although
some literature defines it in terms of markup relative to price, we express
the proportional markup relative to marginal cost. This is done for
analytical simplicity, and should not change the qualitative nature of our
findings.

25Further, a shift in w can also be viewed as an exogenous shift in supply.
This has the same effect on equilibrium as that of a shift in v, except that
the effect is multiplied by the positive parameter c.

26For the monopolist to be in equilibrium, 2b + d > 0. This follows because
the marginal cost function must intersect the marginal revenue function from
below, implying that 2b > Idi in the presence of increasing returns to scale.

27The duopoly case is analytically relatively simple and tractable.
Generalization to an n firm oligoply is possible, but the principal results of
interest to us can be obtained within the much simpler duopoly framework, and
therefore we confine our attention here to such a simple market.

    demand shock could come about from, for example, the introduction of an
improved product or an enhanced marketing program. A supply shock that
increased costs to a single producer could emerge from, for example, a shift
in supplier relationships or differential union behavior. Conversely, firm-
specific supply shocks that reduced costs could be due to, for example, a new
innovation or differential technical progress.

       as in the monopolist case, in the oligopoly case stability conditions
require that I2aij/DI > jbj.   This is sufficient to ensure that     > 0 even
if the firms in the industry produce under increasing returns to scale.
