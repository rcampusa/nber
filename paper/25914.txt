                                         ABSTRACT

This paper examines the large, steady, and continuing growth of the Big Three index fund
managers—BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street Global Advisors. We show that there is a real
prospect that index funds will continue to grow, and that voting in most significant public
companies will come to be dominated by the future “Giant Three.”

We begin by analyzing the drivers of the rise of the Big Three, including the structural factors
that are leading to the heavy concentration of the index funds sector. We then provide empirical
evidence about the past growth and current status of the Big Three, and their likely growth into
the Giant Three. Among other things, we document that the Big Three have almost quadrupled
their collective ownership stake in S&P 500 companies over the past two decades; that they have
captured the overwhelming majority of the inflows into the asset management industry over the
past decade; that each of them now manages 5% or more of the shares in a vast number of public
companies; and that they collectively cast an average of about 25% of the votes at S&P 500
companies.

We then extrapolate from past trends to estimate the future growth of the Big Three. We estimate
that the Big Three could well cast as much as 40% of the votes in S&P 500 companies within two
decades. Policymakers and others must recognize—and must take seriously—the prospect of a
Giant Three scenario. The plausibility of this scenario makes it important to understand the
incentives of index fund managers, a topic that we study in other work.

                                     INTRODUCTION

    This paper analyzes the steady rise of the “Big Three” index fund
managers—Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street Global Advisors
(“SSGA”). Based on our analysis of recent trends, we conclude that the Big
Three will likely continue to grow into a “Giant Three,” and that the Giant
Three will likely come to dominate voting in public companies. This Giant
Three scenario raises the importance of the incentives of index fund managers
in general, and the Big Three in particular, that we analyze in other work.1
    Our analysis is divided into three parts. In Part I, we analyze three key
drivers that underlie the steady and persistent growth of the Big Three, and
which mean that this growth is likely to continue. First, we discuss the factors
that have led to the tenfold growth of institutional investor ownership over
the past six decades. Second, we document the steady increase in of the
proportion of the assets managed by investment managers that are allocated
to index funds. Third, we analyze three factors that lead to the heavy
concentration of the index fund sector: scale economies, the liquidity benefits
offered by exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) with large assets, and the ability
of dominant index fund managers to compete quickly with new products
introduced by rivals. These factors are likely to facilitate the continued
dominance of the Big Three.
    In Part II, we present our empirical analysis of the past growth of the Big
Three, their current status as major shareholders of U.S. companies, and their
likely future growth. Our empirical analysis focuses on the companies in the
S&P 500 and Russell 3000 indices, which represent 73% and 91%
(respectively) of the total market capitalization of listed U.S. companies as of
December 31, 2017.2
    We start with the past growth and current status of the Big Three. Among
other things, we document that:
        Over the last decade, more than 80% of all assets flowing into
           investment funds has gone to the Big Three, and the proportion of

   2 Calculated based on market capitalization data from the Center for Research in
Securities Prices. Market capitalization data is based on those types of shares included in the
Russell 3000 and S&P 500, including common shares of U.S. companies, non-U.S.
companies, real estate investment trusts, shares of beneficial interest, and units of companies
incorporated outside the United States.
2                       THE SPECTER OF THE GIANT THREE

          total funds flowing to the Big Three has been rising through the
          second half of the decade;
        The average combined stake in S&P 500 companies held by the Big
          Three essentially quadrupled over the past two decades, from 5.2%
          in 1998 to 20.5% in 2017;3
        Over the past decade, the number of positions in S&P 500
          companies in which the Big Three hold 5% or more of the
          company’s equity has increased more than five-fold, with each of
          BlackRock and Vanguard now holding positions of 5% or more of
          the shares of almost all of the companies in the S&P 500;
        Following two decades of growth, the Big Three now collectively
          hold an average stake of more than 20% of S&P 500 companies;4
          and
        Because the Big Three generally vote all of their shares, whereas
          not all of the non-Big Three shareholders of those companies do so,
          shares held by the Big Three represent an average of about 25% of
          the shares voted in director elections at S&P 500 companies in
          2018.
    Building on this analysis of past growth, we then proceed to extrapolate
from past to predict the likely growth of the Big Three in the next two
decades. Assuming that past trends continue, we estimate that the share of
votes that the Big Three would cast at S&P 500 companies could well reach
about 34% of votes in the next decade, and about 41% of votes in two
decades. Thus, if recent trends continue, the Big Three could be expected to
become the “Giant Three.” In this Giant Three scenario, three investment
managers would largely dominate shareholder voting in practically all
significant U.S. companies that do not have a controlling shareholder.
    We conclude by briefly discussing the implications of the specter of the
Giant Three. Here we build on our large-scale study of index fund
stewardship, which analyzes the incentives of index fund managers and
provides comprehensive empirical evidence on their stewardship activities.5
That study analyzes and documents the incentives of index fund managers,
and especially major fund managers such as the Big Three, to be excessively
deferential toward corporate managers. We argue that recognition of the
Giant Three scenario increases the importance of a serious consideration of
these incentives.

    In addition to our own prior work, the work that is most closely related to
this paper is a recent elegant essay by Professor John Coates.6 Although we
and Coates both focus on issues arising from the growing concentration of
ownership in the hands of a relatively small number of institutional investors,
our works and views differ in key respects. To begin, Coates’s essay focuses
on what he labels “the problem of twelve”—that is, the possibility that twelve
management teams will gain “practical power over the majority of U.S.
public companies.”7 By contrast, we focus on the possibility that a much
smaller number of management teams—the Big Three—will come to
dominate ownership in most public companies. In addition, this paper differs
from Coates’s work in that our empirical analysis focuses on documenting
the growth of the Big Three and estimating its future trajectory.
    Finally, whereas Coates seems to be concerned that investment managers
will excessively use the power that comes from their large ownership stakes,
our work on index fund stewardship focusses on the incentives that the Giant
Three will have to be excessively deferential to corporate managers. We
therefore stress the importance of studying a scenario in which a substantial
proportion of equity ownership would have deference incentives and checks
on corporate managers would be insufficient.
    Whatever one’s view of the nature of the Giant Three scenario, the specter
of the Giant Three that we document and analyze presents signiifcant
questions for future research. We hope that our work will highlight for
researchers, market participants, and policymakers the importance of the
Giant Three scenario. The specter of the Giant Three deserves close attention,
and our empirical evidence and framework of analysis could inform any
future consideration of this subject.

                   I.   THE RISE OF THE GIANT THREE: DRIVERS

    This Part analyzes three key drivers that underlie the consistent growth of
the Big Three and make it likely that this growth and the related dominance
of the Big Three will continue. First, the proportion of shares held by
institutional investors has grown considerably and can be expected to
continue to grow. Second, of the shares held by institutional investors, the
proportion invested in index funds has also grown steadily, and can also be
expected to continue to grow. Third, structural factors have led to heavy
concentration in the index funds sector, and suggest that the Big Three will

only increase their dominance. Sections I.A through I.C examine in turn each
of these three drivers.

                       A. The Rise of Institutional Investors

    Over the last fifty years, institutional investors have come to hold a
majority of the equity of U.S. public companies.8 From 1950 to 2017, the
institutional ownership of corporate equity increased tenfold, from 6.1% to
65%.9 As a result, institutional investors now control a large majority of the
shares of public companies and have a dominant impact on vote outcomes at
those companies.
    Many observers have viewed the steady increase in the share of stock
owned by institutional investors as being driven by a number of factors. 10
Changes in the regulation of retirement savings increased the aggregate
amount of retirement savings.11 Retirement savings shifted from bank savings
accounts to the public equity markets, as a result of favorable tax changes12
and innovations in equity investment products.13 An increasing focus on the
value of low-cost diversification in investments was also met by lower-cost

options for achieving such diversification among public equities.14 These
factors remain in place, and have led to continuing increases in the proportion
of corporate equity owned by institutional investors over the last decade. As
a result, it is plausible to expect the increase in institutional ownership to
continue.

                     B. The Growing Share of Index Funds

    In addition to the growth in the proportion of corporate equity held by
institutional investors, there has also been substantial growth in the
proportion of institutional investor assets that are invested in index funds.
    Index funds are investment funds:funds that pool the investments of many
individuals and others (which we refer to as “beneficial investors”) and invest
them in diversified portfolios of assets. Investment funds may invest in debt
securities or other assets, but we focus on investment funds that invest in
equity securities. Among those equity investment funds, index funds invest
in portfolios that attempt to track the performance of a particular benchmark
stock market index, such as the S&P 500 or the Russell 3000. Index funds
can be either traditional “open-ended” mutual funds or ETFs. A well-known
example of an index mutual fund is the Vanguard S&P 500 Mutual Fund. The
two largest index ETFs are SSGA’s SPDR S&P 500 ETF and BlackRock’s
iShares Core S&P 500 ETFs.15
    The growth of index funds is commonly attributed to a recognition of
their advantages compared with active funds: lower costs, superior returns
after fees, and tax advantages for investors holding funds in accounts that are
not tax-sheltered.16 The shift to index funds has been dramatic, with index
funds increasing their share of the total assets invested in equity mutual funds
more than eightfold in two decades, from 4% in 1995 to 34% in 2015.17
    Table 1 shows the asset flows to (and from, shown in parentheses) both
actively managed investment funds and index investment funds during the
ten years from 2009 to 2018.18 As Table 1 shows, inflows to index funds have
dominated those to actively managed funds over the past decade. From 2009
to 2018, total inflows to actively managed funds were less than $200 billion,
with significant outflows over the last five years erasing most of the inflows

into actively managed funds over the first five years of that period. In
contrast, total inflows to index funds over the same period were more than
$3.4 trillion, eighteen times the total flows to actively managed funds. Flows
to index funds over that decade were consistently positive and increased over
time: the average inflow from 2014 to 2018 was $476 billion per year, more
than double that from 2009 to 2013 ($221.5 billion per year).

    The growth in the share of index funds at the expense of active funds has
been partly due to growing levels of investment in ETFs. Because of the way
in which ETFs operate and are regulated, they are largely limited to
investment strategies that track a defined index.19 As Table 1 indicates, the
majority of the substantial growth in index funds has been driven by the
growth of ETFs. Flows to index ETFs outpaced flows to index mutual funds
every year from 2009 to 2018, and the total asset flow to index ETFs from
2009 to 2018 was 60% greater than the asset flows to index mutual funds
over the same period.

               C. The Concentration of the Index Funds Sector

     Finally, we wish to discuss the heavy concentration of the growing index
funds sector in the hands of three major investment managers. As we explain
below, there are three structural factors that have contributed to the
dominance of a small number of players. Most importantly, these factors are
likely to enable these players to retain their dominance over time.
     Economies of Scale. The first factor is the significant economies of scale
inherent in operating a fund tracking an index. An ETF with assets of $10
billion would have one hundred times the assets under management of an
ETF with assets of $100 million tracking the same index, but the costs of
operating the former would likely be much less than one hundred times the
cost of operating the latter. These economies of scale provide the operator of
the $10 billion ETF with a structural advantage over the operator of the $100
million ETF: the former can charge investors a much smaller expense ratio
to cover costs.20 In a recent paper Professors John Adams, Darren Hayunga,
and Sattar Mansi provide empirical evidence of significant economies of
scale in index fund performance.21 The authors explain that this is partly due
to there being some elements of fixed costs for investment funds that can be
divided over a larger asset base in the case of large funds, including
administration, broker trading commissions, management, and marketing.22
     ETF Assets and Liquidity. There is another related factor that arises with
respect to ETFs, which represent a growing segment of the index funds
sector. An ETF with more assets has a substantial advantage over an ETF
tracking the same index with fewer assets, not only because the larger ETF
has lower operational costs as a percentage of assets (as described above), but
also because the larger ETF offers beneficial investors significant liquidity
advantages.
     Investors considering ETF investments will consider not only the fees
charged by the investment manager but also the bid-ask spreads that the
investor will face when they acquire and dispose of their investment in the
ETF. An ETF with fewer assets can be expected to have lower liquidity and
more significant bid-ask spreads than a larger ETF, which will operate to
reduce the total return the investor will enjoy from holding the ETF.
Accordingly, index fund managers that have enjoyed a first-mover advantage
and that currently manage ETFs with larger volumes of assets can offer

investors liquidity benefits that index fund managers operating ETFs tracking
the same index but with fewer assets simply cannot emulate. The liquidity
advantages of ETFs that already have abundant assets under management can
be viewed as a source of network benefits, and such benefits have long been
viewed as benefitting and protecting incumbent firms.23
     Table 2, below, reports the assets under management of the fifty largest
equity ETFs.24 These ETFs manage together more than $1.8 trillion, with the
largest ETF—the SPDR S&P 500 ETF—holding more than a quarter of a
trillion dollars. The fifty largest ETFs are dominated by BlackRock,
Vanguard, and SSGA, which manage twenty, sixteen, and nine of the fifty
largest ETFs, respectively. Only five of the fifty largest ETFs (and only one
of the largest thirty ETFs) are managed by managers other than the Big
Three.25 Indeed, managers other than the Big Three manage less than 7% of

    Difficulty of Disruption. Finally, a factor relevant for assessing the
persistence of market concentration is the ease with which rivals are able to
unseat dominant incumbents. In some markets incumbent market leaders face
significant risks of losing their dominance if a rival develops a disruptive
product that customers prefer and that the incumbent is not able to replicate
quickly. However, the nature of index fund offerings is such that, if investors
show interest in an indexed product that is not currently offered by the Big
Three, the Big Three can swiftly offer a very similar competing product. This
ability of the dominant players to quickly replicate any product in which
investors show an interest contributes to protecting the continued dominance
of the existing major players.

                 II. THE NUMBERS: PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE

    This Part provides empirical evidence about the steady rise of the Big
Three over the past two decades, as well as their major presence in corporate
ownership and voting, and estimates their future growth based on
extrapolation from current trends. Section II.A provides evidence about past
growth and the present importance of Big Three shareholders. Section II.B
extrapolates from these past trends to predict the growth of the Giant Three.

             A. The Past and Present: The Rise of the Big Three

    As discussed in Part I, there has been tremendous inflows of assets to
index funds over the past decade. Consistent with our analysis of the factors
contributing to the heavy concentration of the index fund sector, the great
majority of these inflows have gone to the Big Three.
    Table 3 reports the asset flows to each of the Big Three from 2009 to
2018.27 The total inflows to the Big Three from 2009 to 2018 were more than
$3 trillion, and represent 82% of the inflows to all active and passive funds
over that period. The dominance of the Big Three as the destination for fund
inflows was naturally reflected in the growth of the Big Three during this
period.
    Table 3 demonstrates that the move to index funds appears to have
accelerated. During the five years from 2009 to 2013, the Big Three attracted
$892 billion of assets, which was 45% of the total asset inflows to investment
funds during that period. Therefore, during this period the Big Three attracted
close to the same amount of assets as all other investment managers

combined. This necessarily represented a higher rate of growth for the Big
Three than for other fund managers, as the Big Three started the decade with
fewer assets under management. And, in the subsequent five years, from 2014
to 2018, the Big Three had $2,139 billion in inflows, more than twice as much
as the preceding five years, representing 125% of total investment fund
inflows.

     Figure 1, below, shows the average percentage of the shares large public
corporations held by the Big Three for each year over the last two decades—
a percentage that has been increasing consistently and at a significant rate.28
It shows that the growth in the proportion of the U.S. equity markets managed
by the Big Three has been dramatic. Panel 1 shows that the proportion of
S&P 500 shares managed by the Big Three has grown approximately fourfold
over the past two decades, from 5.2% in 1998, to 20.5% in 2017.
Furthermore, Panel 2 shows that for Russell 3000 companies, the proportion
of assets the Big Three holds has grown more than fourfold over the past two

    Another way to provide a picture of the consistent and dramatic growth
of the Big Three is to consider the number of companies at which the Big
Three hold positions of 5% or more. We therefore gather data from the
                 THE SPECTER OF THE GIANT THREE                               13

FactSet Ownership database regarding the size of the positions that each of
the Big Three hold in each S&P 500 and Russell 3000 company over the last
ten years. Table 4 shows the number of positions of 5% or more that each of
the Big Three held in S&P 500 and Russell 3000 companies, and the total
number of such positions across the Big Three, in each of the years in 2007,
2012, and 2017.
    Consistent with the results presented earlier, Table 4 displays a
spectacular growth in the number of positions of 5% or more held by the Big
Three. Whereas Vanguard held only fifteen such positions in S&P 500
companies in 2007, by 2017 Vanguard held such positions in essentially all
of the S&P 500, an increase of more than thirty times. Furthermore, the
number of positions of 5% or more in S&P 500 companies held by
BlackRock and SSGA each tripled over the same period, from 165 to 488
(almost the entire S&P 500) for BlackRock, and from 41 to 130 for SSGA.
The total number of S&P 500 positions of 5% or more held by the Big Three
has increased more than fivefold, from 221 in 2007 to 1,118 in 2017. Panel 2
shows similar growth for the Russell 3000: the total number of positions of
5% or more held by the Big Three has increased more than threefold over the
last decade, from 1,481 to 4,608 in 2017.

    The data that we have presented to describe the phenomenal growth of
the Big Three over the past two decades also contains information about the
major role that the Big Three currently play in the ownership of public
companies. As Figure 1 shows, as of 2017 the Big Three held an average
combined stake exceeding 20% of S&P 500 companies and 16.5% of Russell
14                      THE SPECTER OF THE GIANT THREE

3000 companies. Furthermore, as of 2017, practically all S&P 500
companies, and over two-thirds of Russell 3000 companies, had two positions
of 5% or more held by two of the Big Three, and many such companies had
positions of 5% or more held by each of the Big Three.
    Furthermore, the above figures significantly underestimate the voting
power of the Big Three and the extent to which their voting influences
election outcomes. This is because index fund managers invariably vote in
corporate elections, while some other holders—especially retail investors—
do so to a much lesser extent.29 To provide a sense of the effects of such
nonvoting on the significance of Big Three holdings, Table 4 contrasts (1)
the fraction of shares owned in companies in the S&P 500 and Russell 3000
indexes by each of the Big Three, and (2) the fraction of the votes of
companies in those indexes cast at annual meetings held by each of the Big
Three.30

proportion of outstanding shares managed by each of those managers. As a
result, for S&P 500 companies, the proportion of the total votes that were cast
by the Big Three was about 25.4% on average, significantly higher than their
combined ownership stake of about 20.5% on average. Similarly, for Russell
3000 companies, the proportion of the total votes that were cast by the Big
Three was 22% on average, also significantly greater than the 16.5% of
outstanding Russell 3000 shares managed by the Big Three. Thus, ownership
figures by themselves significantly understate the effect that the Big Three
have on voting outcomes.

                 B. The Future: The Specter of the Giant Three

    We agree with the adage that it is difficult to make predictions, especially
about the future. Still, given the steady rise of the ownership stakes of the Big
Three over the past two decades, it is natural for policymakers, researchers,
and market participants to ask what would be the result of a continuation of
past trends in the growth of the Big Three. This Section provides such
estimates based on the evidence regarding recent trends.
    To generate such an estimate we begin by estimating the rate at which
equity ownership by investors other than the Big Three has declined over the
past ten years. In 2008, 13.5% of S&P 500 equity was managed by the Big
Three, so 86.5% was not. Ten years later, in 2017, 20.5% of S&P 500 equity
was managed by the Big Three, so 79.5% was not. We calculate that the
decline from 86.5% to 79.5% over ten years reflected an annual rate of
decline of 0.84%. We then ask what would happen if the ownership of shares
by non-Big Three investors (which we refer to as “non-Big-Three holdings”)
continues to decline at this annual rate.31
    Panel 1 of Figure 2 shows that if the recent rate of decline of non-Big-
Three holdings continues at the same rate as in the past decade, the combined
average ownership stake of the Big Three will rise to 27.6% in ten years, and
to 33.4% of S&P 500 equity in twenty years. Similar figures hold for the
Russell 3000: our estimation indicates that the average combined stake of the
Big Three would rise to 23.9% for the equity of Russell 3000 companies in
2028, and to 30.1% of Russell 3000 companies in 2038.




—————————————————————————————————
  31 This rate is calculated as 10√(c2008/c2017), where c2008 represents the average percentage
of shares of the index not managed by the Big Three in 2008 and c2017 represents the average
percentage of shares of the index not managed by the Big Three in 2017.

    Of course, whereas we use the past ten years to derive an estimate of the
rate of decline of non-Big-Three holdings, one could do so based on
somewhat different periods. To examine the consequences of using such
different periods, we recalculate the rate of decline of non-Big-Three
holdings during the past five years, from 2013 to 2017. We obtain a calculated
rate of decline of 1.05%, exceeding the 0.84% decline used above.
    As we explained in Section II.A, the voting power of index funds is even
greater than would be suggested by the proportion of shares that they manage,
because many other shareholders do not vote. We therefore also estimate the
future voting power of index funds. We first calculate the proportion of non-
                    THE SPECTER OF THE GIANT THREE                                     17

Big-Three holdings that did not vote for the election of directors in each of
the years from 2008 to 2017. We assume that the Big Three voted all of the
shares that they managed in all of those years. This is a reasonable
assumption, as Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) guidance has
indicated that U.S. investment managers like the Big Three have a fiduciary
duty to vote their shares.32 Based on this assumption, the proportion of shares
not managed by the Big Three that voted in director elections varied from
85% in 2008 to 68% in 2017. The average proportion of non-Big-Three
holdings voted at director elections over that period was 73%. We assume
that this proportion will remain constant, and use it to estimate the voting
power of the Big Three in the future. Figure 3 shows our estimates of the
voting power of the Big Three for the next twenty years, for the S&P 500
(Panel 1) and for the Russell 3000 (Panel 2).
    Panel 1 of Figure 3 shows that if the proportion of non-Big-Three
holdings that are voted remains the same, then the Big Three will control
34.3% of S&P 500 votes in ten years, and 40.8% of S&P 500 votes in twenty
years. Panel 2 shows similar results for the Russell 3000: 29.8% of Russell
3000 votes in 2028 and 36.7% of Russell 3000 votes in 2038.

    The estimates we obtained above are based on the rate of change in the
past ten years. We also derive estimates using shorter and longer periods—
specifically, the past five years and the past twenty years. Using these
estimates would result in estimates of the future voting power of the Big
Three commensurate to the estimate we generated above. In particular,
extrapolating from Big Three growth over the past five years would result in
the estimated average percentage of votes cast by the Big Three in S&P 500
companies growing to 28.4% by 2028 and 35.6% by 2038. Similarly,
extrapolating from Big Three growth over the past twenty years would result
in the average percentage of votes cast by the Big Three in S&P 500
companies to grow to 27.2% by 2028 and 33.3% by 2038.

    We reiterate our caution that accurately estimating the future growth of
the Big Three is difficult, and actual outcomes might differ from those we
have estimated above. The pace of Big Three growth over the next two
decades could at some point accelerate (say, due to a tipping point being
reached whereby most investors come to accept the logic of passive
investing) or decelerate (say, due to remaining investors in active funds being
especially resistant to this logic). However, the shift from active to index
investments is expected to continue, and there are strong reasons to expect
the Big Three will continue to dominate index investing. Furthermore, in
evaluating where these developments can be expected to lead, recent trends
provide the most relevant evidence and provide a useful basis for estimating
future growth.

                                      CONCLUSION

    This paper has empirically examined the continuing steady growth of the
Big Three and what it is likely to mean for our corporate governance system.
We have analyzed the three drivers of the rise of the Big Three, including the
structural factors that lead to the heavy concentration of the index funds
sector. And we have documented the rise of the Big Three over the past
decade and their large footprint in current ownership of public companies and
in corporate voting.
    Extrapolating from past trends, we have demonstrated the plausibility that
the Big Three will grow into the Giant Three over the next two decades. In
this Giant Three scenario the Big Three would dominate voting in most U.S.
public companies, casting as much as 40% of the votes in S&P 500
companies on average. The clear message for policymakers from this analysis
is that the Giant Three scenario, and the questions that it raises, should be
taken seriously.
    In particular, we wish to highlight one issue raised by the prospect of the
Giant Three scenario. As we analyzed and documented in earlier work on
index fund stewardship, the stewardship decisions of index funds in general,
and the Big Three in particular, are afflicted by agency problems, including
incentives to under-invest in stewardship and incentives to be excessively
deferential to corporate managers.33 Taking the Giant Three scenario
seriously reinforces the importance of recognizing the agency problems of
index fund managers. These agency problems deserve the close attention of
researchers, policymakers, and market participants.
