                        The Regularity of Business Cycles

                                       ABSTRACT

      Do business cycles have predictable periodicities or are they random

 walks without past regularities or predictive value? Arguments in support of

 either position are found in the literature, with no apparent convergence to

 an agreement. This paper first examines the implications of the NBER

 chronologies and other findings for the question of the regularity of business

 cycles. It discusses hypotheses and presents evidence concerning the

 incidence and coexistence of cycles with different periods. An extension of

 the analysis covers growth cycles in the United States and other major

 countries.

     The paper then considers different models --    linear,   nonlinear,
endogenous, and exogenous --   for   what they have to say about the problem. The

regularity of investment cycles and the possible asymmetries in cyclical

behavior receive particular attention, and some related data and tests are

provided.

     Our results suggest that business cycles defy simple characterizations:

they show a strong tendency to recur and at times even near periodicity, along

with great diversity and evolution of phase durations. The age of a phase is

not of much help in predicting the date of its end; the regularities are

mainly in the dynamics of the developing business conditions.

                                 I. Introduction

       Do business cycles have predictable periodicities? Do their phases die

  of old age? Or are the observed fluctuations merely random walks without past

  regularities of predictive value? These questions are central to modern

 macroeconomic dynamics and they have prompted a considerable amount of

  theoretical and empirical analysis. Yet the answers differ, with no apparent

 convergence to an agreement. There is much support for the notion that

 business fluctuations are just random deviations from growth trends, but also

 for theories that stress the essential regularity of features and even the

 uniformity of causes of expansions and contractions in macroeconomic activity.

      This analytical situation is clearly both unsatisfactory and not

 uncommon. It could be due to any or all of the following: the controversial

 nature of the underlying issues and strong prior beliefs of the inquirers;

 neglect or selective use of the evidence; loose concepts and diversity of the

busines cycles of experience.

      In this paper, an attempt is made to comprehend the problems behind this

apparent impasse by reviewing the literature and historical evidence. This

approach lacks the terse elegance, but also the frequently spurious precision,

of a single quantitative model or formula: the informed judgment it yields

may well be more dependable.

     Past studies, at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and

elsewhere, have shown a persistence of sequential relationships and

interactions among time series representing a wide range of economic,

financial, and other variables. The common features of business cycles

observed in the principal market-oriented economies consist mainly of the

structure of lags and correlations connecting these "cyclical indicator"

series. On the whole, this line of' work suggests the existence of a recursive
                                        2



system that plays a central role in the generation and propagation of business

cycles. It stresses the endogenous and deterministic rather than the

exogenous and random elements of the process, but stops short of expecting the

longer-than-seasonal business fluctuations to have similar durations and

amplitudes over time. This report is concerned only with the overall

dimensions of business cycles, not with the characteristic interplay of the

indicators, but the measures it presents are generally consistent with the

view of the cycle just outlined.

        Part II of the paper examines the implications of the NBER chronologies

and other findings for the question, How regular in duration have business

cycles been? There are brief discussions of the hypotheses and evidence

concerning the incidence and coexistence of cycles with different periods,

short, intermediate, and long. Some new pieces of evidence are introduced and

assessments made. The analysis is extended to fluctuations in detrended

series ("growth cycles") for the United States and other major countries since

I 98.

        Part III considers different theories for what they imply about the

regularity of business cycles. The relevant concepts vary over a wide

range: linear models with damping and white-noise shocks, models of the

"political business cycle," nonlinear models with limit cycles or irregularly

oscillating growth. The problem of asymmetry in cyclical behavior deserves

and receives particular attention, and some data and tests bearing on it are

provided. The final sections look at the questions raised in the opening

paragraph above in a still different way, by considering the role of calendar

vs. historical time, and the predictability and costs of business cycles.

Part IV sums   up the results.

                             11. Durations and Periodjcjties



  1. Business Cycle Chronologies

       The earliest dates of business cycle peaks (P) and
                                                               troughs CT), compiled
  in annual   terms from   limited but well explored information, suggest that

 between 1790 and 1860 both Great Britain and the United States
                                                                      experienced
 business cycles of the same overall frequency (11) and average duration (about

 1 years). Table 1, however, also indicates that the individual phases and

 cycles varied much in length for both countries but particularly the U.S.

 Relative to the corresponding mean durations, the standard deviations

 tabulated for Britain have a range of 30-63% and average L2%; for the U.S. the

 range is 33—79%, the average 511%.     In Britain all but two of the expansions

 lasted 2-5 years and all but two of the contractions lasted one or two

 years. In the United States four expansions were shorter than two
                                                                         years and
one was longer than five years; four contractions exceeded two years.

     For periods between 18511 and 1938 monthly and quarterly as well as annual

lists of reference dates are available for the two countries from the NBER

study by Burns and Mitchell, while the chronologies for France and Germany are

somewhat shorter. The summary measures in Table 2 indicate a substantial

dispersion of the durations of business cycles and their phases as dated by

the National Bureau. The S.D./mean ratios (coefficients
                                                               of variation) average
110—60% for expansions, close to 70% for contractions, and over 110% for full

cycles, based on the longest periods listed (lines 11, 11, 111, and 17). The

ranges of duration in months for the cycles before 1939 are as follows:

     Thus conventional measures show large differences over time between the

observed fluctuations in general economic activity, in terms of both their

overall length and division by upward and downward movements, for each of the

four countries covered. But these statistics include outliers - some very

long and very short expansions and contractions - which are relatively few and

far between. It is important to allow for stochastic and exogenous elements

in business cycle dynamics.

     Here one might note first the tendency of wartime expansions to be

protracted and of immediate postwar contractions to be brief. This is most

apparent for the U.S., mainly because peacetime expansions were on the whole

longer in the other countries. When wartime cycles are excluded,

substantially lower variability measures result, as shown in Table 2 for the

U.S. (of. lines 1_14 and 5-8). The coefficients of variation are reduced from

61% to 1414% for expansions and from 143% to 35% for trough—to-trough cycles,

18514_ 1982.

     The requirements for periodicity can be relaxed by treating the extreme

duration classes as "outliers". Ten of the 14 U.S. peacetime cycles of 18514—

1919 had expansions in the range of 1 to 2 years, and ten had contractions

in the range of 1 to 2 years. All but two of these cycles (86%) lasted 2 to

   years from trough to trough. This way of looking at the duration figures

brings out better their central tendency, that is, the predominance in this

era of American economic history of relatively short movements among business

cycles as defined by the Mational Bureau.

         Note that even this truncation still leaves room for much variability

  (the one-year ranges amount to a doubling of the lengths of the phases).

  Nevertheless, some contributors to the field are content to bestow the

  attribute of "periodicity" upon fluctuations so distributed.1     This may be
  semantically legitimate but the common practice seems to define
                                                                    periodicity
  more   strictly.   At any rate, judging from the NBER historical chronologies

  alone, business cycles would indeed be best described as "recurrent but not

 periodic." This characterization is part of the much quoted working

 definition of Mitchell 1927 and Burns and Mitchell 1946 that has survived well

 several decades of active research applications and
                                                        testing.

         In Europe business cycles were on the average longer and hence fewer than

 in the United States. Thus in the common period 1879-1938 trough-to-trough

 cycles numbered 17, 13, 14, and 10 in the U.S., Great Britain, France, and

 Germany, respectively. The mean duration of the American cycles in that

 period was four years; the corresponding figures for the other economies are
     I
 approximately 4-5 years. To account for most of the early cycles in the

 foreign countries, it is necessary to work with ranges of several years. Of

 the eleven British cycles of 1854—1919, for example, seven lasted 4—8 years;

nine expansions were 2&-4, seven contractions 2-3k years long. The results

for France and Germany are not very different.

     The average duration figures for the interwar period (1919—38) resemble

those for the earlier decades in the case of U.S. (Table 2, lines 5 and 6).

They are smaller than their pre-1919 counterparts
                                                     elsewhere, except for the
long contractions in Britain, which was generally depressed much of that time

of this issue with references to the literature and an alternative treatment

(lines 9—10, 12-13, and 15—16). The dispersion measures are relatively high,

reflecting the particularly diverse experience of this turbulent era.

2. Multiple-Period and Long-Wave Hypotheses

    The Burns-Mitchell definition imposes on business cycles certain minimum

requirements of amplitude and scope as well as length, but only in very

general and flexible terms. It thus allows for a great diversity of behavior,

yet it treats the cycle as a single category.   But some scholars prefer to use

different concepts leading to hypotheses of several interacting cycles, each

with its own characteristic frequency. It is then the combination of

concurrent cycles with different intensities and durations that produces the

seeming lack of periodicity. Different factors are responsible for major and

minor cycles and perhaps still shorter subcycles. The existence of one or two

types of a much longer wave comprising a number of the NBER-dated business

cycles has also been asserted and investigated. It is clear that these

approaches require more complex analyses and larger data bases than the

common-cycle hypothesis.

     Here it is important to recognize that business cycles involve numerous

activities and are not adequately represented by specific cycles in any single

variable; also, that no comprehensive time series exist to cover their long

and varied history. For these reasons, it is more difficult to assess the

relative amplitudes than the relative durations of business cycles, and indeed

we know less about the former than the latter. But tests of models with

multiple periodicities must rely on differences in the size as much as on

those in the length of general economic fluctuations.

     It is of course likely, that durations and amplitudes of cyclical

movements are positively correlated. The prevalence of short and mild

recessions works in this direction. But the relationship is not easy to
                                        9




  document and probably not strong, though it seems clearer for expansions than

  contractions (see Moore 1961, pp. 86-93; Zarnowitz 1981, sec. VI). Certainly,

  the length of fluctuations is not a very reliable indicator of their size.

  Some of the U.S contractions were long and severe (1839_13,
                                                                1873—79, 1929—33),

  some were long but moderate (1882-86, 19O2_0L), still others were short but

  severe (1907-08, 1937-38). Similar examples can be found for other countries.

      Over nearly 150 years between the American Revolution and the low point

 of the Great Depression, U.S. wholesale prices followed long upward trends in

 three periods (1789_181z, 181I3_6z, and 1896—1920) and long downward trends in

 three intervening periods (181Z_43, 18614_96, and 1920—32). In each of the

 intervals of secular inflation (deflation) expansions
                                                         were long (short)
 relative to contractions. This relationship was repeatedly observed and

 confirmed, also in the British, French, and German data (Burns and Mitchell

 1916, oh. 11; Moore 1983, oh. 15; Zarnowitz and Moore 1986, pp. 525-31). The

 dates of the uptrend-downtrend sequences in the price levels provide fair

approximations to the "long waves" introduced by Kondratieff in 1926 and

adopted with various modifications and interpretations by a number of

economists over the years.2 The long price movements are attributable largely

to trends in money and credit creation, and related influences of gold

discoveries and wars. In the short run, prices generally tend to move

procyclicafly around their longer trends, which presumably reflects a dominant

role of fluctuations in aggregate demand.

     A downswing phase of a long wave is supposed to be associated with

average growth rates of technological innovation, capital formation, and




2These include Schumpeter 1939; Dupriez 1917, 1978; Rostow 1978, 1980; Mandel
1980; and van Duijn 1983, who provides a useful critical survey of literature
and evidence.
                                        10




industrial production that are lower than those in the preceding and following

upswing phases. According to van Duijn 1983 (part III), the results based on

composite indexes aggregated across the main capitalist economies are broadly

consistent with these hypotheses, while the tests for the individual countries

tend to be negative, which is attributed to "national peculiarities" (p.

1514). But there are so few of the long wave phases that such results can

hardly be conclusive. The evidence for the "1st Kondratieff" (before 18142-51)

is shown to be defective. In the post-World War II period, the "l4th

Kondratieff" prosperity phase is dated 19148—66, followed by a "recession" in

1966-73, and a "depression" in 1973—? But this chronology is, to say the

least, doubtful. The 1970s and 1980s so far are much less depressed than the

previous periods so classified, 1872-83 and 1929-37. Growth rates have

declined but are positive most of the time in most places, and there is no

general deflation and financial crisis.

    More generally, the problem of identifying the long-wave turns with the

available data is a truly formidable one (for early times, because of the

paucity and defects of the information; for recent times, because of

inevitable truncations and revisions). The smoothing out of the effects of

other, much more pronounced movements (both the shorter cycles and the longest

trend) presents no lesser difficulty. Several old and new tests of the long-.

wave and composite—cycle hypotheses produced largely negative results (Burns

and Mitchell 19146, oh. 11; Adelman 1965; Howrey 1968). But here again the

fewness of relevant observations is a major problem, particularly for the

tests based on spectral analysis. This recently favored method is well suited

for the task of discovering hidden periodicities but only in relatively long,

stationary and homoskedastic time series, i.e., under conditions that clearly

do not obtain in the present context.
                                        11




       There is much disagreement about the very existence of some of the long

  waves even among the supporters of the concept, and more disagreement yet

  about the timing of the waves and their phases. This is In sharp contrast to

  business cycles, where chronologies from different sources are not very

 different and the NBER reference dates are widely accepted and used. There is

 probably no better proof that the uncertainties surrounding the long waves are

 indeed unusually large.

      Industrial production and early estimates of total output, when smoothed

 so as to reduce the influence of shorter business cycles, show 15 to
                                                                        20-year
 fluctuations In the growth rates for the United States between 18140 and

 19114. These movements, clearly associated with waves in the level of

 construction activity, are known as Kuznets cycles. Their explanation relies

 heavily on the role of population growth, and notably the tides of immigration

 from Europe, as sources of both additional labor supply and demand for new

 housing and other capital goods. The demographic forces are treated as

 interacting with economic developments, not as exogenous variables. Other

 important factors in these analyses include growth retardations in Europe,

territorial and railway expansions in America, changes in the current balance

and international capital flows, and constraints on the money supply under the

prevailing specie standard.

     Much has been learned from the literature dealing with these developments

(a.o., Kuznets 1930; Burns 1934; Long 19140; Abramovitz 1964; Easterlin

1968). But some of the central elements in the Kuznets cycles as sketched

above are now recognized as belonging to history. This type of fluctuation,

therefore, is no longer evident in recent times, even though it is probably

not entirely unrelated to long-term deviations from trends in the interwar and

post-World War II periods (Abramovitz 1968; Rostow 1975).

3. Major and Minor Cycles

     Unlike the deeply hidden long wave and the building cycle that apparently

ceased to operate some time ago, major and minor cycles certainly exist as two

very different categories, at least at the descriptive level. One can hardly

object to this distinction as exemplified by the sequences of 1921433-37 (the

deepest contraction and a large but still incomplete recovery, both very long)

and 1957—58-60 (a moderate and short interruption of growth). What is not so

clear is how to define the major and minor cycles more precisely; whether they

constitute a true, systematic dichotomy; and whether at least some major

cycles consist of two or more minor ones.

     Juglar 1862 was the first to observe that fluctuations In prices,

interest rates, and other financial variables often lasted about 7-11 years.

Kitchin 1923 stressed the primacy of 3_Li     year   cycles; the major cycles were to

him "merely aggregates" of two or three minor ones (p. 10). In time it caine

to be widely believed that business investment in machinery and equipment

plays a central part In the major or Juglar cycles, inventory investment in

the minor or Kitchin cycles. The former involve longer decision and

implementation lags than the latter. Fixed capital lasts for years and cannot

be adjusted to desired levels nearly as quickly as inventories that are

normally disposed of in days, weeks, or at most months.

     The NBER chronologies cannot be dichotomized into the Kitchin and the

Juglar durations. Of the 14   cycles   in Great Britain 1792-1858, six lasted 314

years,   six 5-6 years, and two 7 years each from trough to trough. The

corresponding U.S. cycles include three of 2 years each, four of 31 years,

four of 5—6 years, and three of' 7-9 years. The monthly data used for 1854-

1938 permit more detail. Let the classes of 3O—5t months and 78 months or

more serve as the Kitchin and Juglar durations, respectively: they would
                                           13




  account for 31% and 25% of the observations for Britain, 71% and 10% for the

  United States. The rest would fall in between, except for a few very short

  fluctuations. These   measures,   then, are definitely affirmative only on the

  historical prevalence of short cycles in the U.S. chronology.

       Schumpeter 1935 held that "every Juglar so far observed ...     Is    readily
      divisible into three cycles of a period of roughly forty months" (p.

  8). Not surprisingly, no arrangement of the NBER consecutive business
                                                                        cycles
  into groups of three corresponds to the Juglar dates attributable to

 Schuxnpeter. Instead, his nine Juglar cycles marked off by troughs between

  1848 and 1932 can be approximated
                                      by four groups of two cycles each, four of
 three cycles each, and one single cycle (Burns
                                                    and Mitchell 1946, pp. 440-2).
      But there is no good reason to insist
                                                on any particular fixed scheme of
 so many Kitchins per Juglar, and a more relaxed approach may    be   more

 instructive. When major cycles are marked off by troughs of severe

 depressions according to the U.S. monthly reference dates (in 1879, 1894,

 1908, 1921, and 1933), their successive
                                           periods are roughly 15, 14, 13, and 12
years. The corresponding dates for Great Britain are not far off and they

yield similar durations, namely 16, 14, 13, and 11 years. These periods

include 4, 4, 4, and 3 successive business cycles in the United States, and 2,

3, 3, and 3 business cycles in Great Britain. Burns and Mitchell admit
                                                                               that
this result "suggests a fair degree of uniformity" and, upon further analysis,

find some evidence of "a partial cumulation of successive cycles."

Nonetheless, they conclude that "the (observed) relations are not sufficiently




3Also that "the two complete Kondratieff units ...
                                                    contain each of them six
cycles of from nine to ten years' duration."
                                              Schumpeter attributed
periodicjtjes of 54—60 years, 9-10 years, and 40 months or "somewhat less" to
the Kondratjeff, Juglar, and Kitchin cycles, respectively. His full treatment
admists some exceptions (1939, vol. I, pp. 161-74).
                                          114




regular ...   to   justify us in regarding the business cycles separated by severe

depressions as subdivisions of long cycles" (op. cit., p. 1460).

    This is a tentative judgment conditioned on the deficient available data,

not a decisive rejection of all notions of periodicity. But whatever

configurations of minor and major cycles may have prevailed in the half-

century here considered, they did not continue in the following era. The

short but severe slump of 1937-38 occurred only five years after the end of

the great contraction of 1929-33. After World War II, U.S. business

expansions have grown much longer and their durations more dispersed, in

comparison with the pre-19145 and especially the pre-1919 cycles. This was due

in large part, but by no means only, to the incidence of wars (of. lines 1—8,

columns 1-2 in Table 2). On the other hand, contractions became much shorter

and much less variable (columns 3_)4). Of the eight recessions since 19148,

even the longest and largest (1973-75, 1981-82) were far less severe than

earlier depressions such as those of 1920-21 and 1937-38, let alone 1929-33

(see Zarnowitz 1985, pp. 526—28; Moore and Zarnowitz 1986, pp. 767-71).

    Thus if major cycles were to be defined as involving deep depressions,

they could not be found at all in the economic history of the United States

after the 1930s. What can clearly be identified is fluctuations in growth

rates of total output that lasted longer than the average business cycle.

Specifically, in 19148-55 and 1955-61, real GNP rose at compound annual rates

of 14.14% and 2.2%, respectively. This period of 13 years included four

recessions. In 1961-73 growth measured in the same      terms   was 14.0%, in 1973-86

it was 2.3%. This period of 25 years also included four recessions. But no

indication of any definite periodicities emerges from this division.

     To see this, note that the first of these two extended retardations was

less than half the length of the second one, and the end of the latter is as
                                           15




  yet undetermined. Note also the uneven incidence of business cycle phases

  within the two periods: 19I8—55 and 1955-61 include two recessions each,

  1961-73 only one, 1973—86 three. Since 1973 growth rates fell well below the

  previous experience and expectations in all major capitalist economies. This

  may be due to a variety of sources of changes in labor and capital

  productivity distinguished in the studies of "growth accounting" (Maddison

  1987). Oil price rises have attracted particular attention, but policy errors

 and disruptions first of high inflation and then disinflation are probably

 also among the major immediate causes of what happened.

      To be sure, there is room for different interpretations of history, the

 more so the earlier and less reliable are the data.
                                                        Long wave proponents such
 as van Duijn perceive three Juglars in the postwar era, 191857, 1957—66, and

 1966—73 (1983, ch. IX). But there was no business recession in the United

 States in 1966, only a short and mild slowdown; also this breakdown does not

 produce any large differences between growth rates In output for the aggregate

 of the major countries (Ibid. p. 1511).

      Matthews 1959, using troughs in all contractions except the shortest

ones, counts seven major cycles for the United States between 1876 and 1938,

with durations averaging 9 years (standard deviation, 3; range, 4-13). But he

observes that "the periodicity is not really very good" and that "the

circumstances surrounding the middling depressions were so diverse that it is

difficult to regard them as the manifestation of a regular cyclical

tendency." Hence, he sees "distinct forces making for periodicity" at work

only in the cycles of 3-4 and about 20 years dominated by movements in

inventory Investment and house-building,
                                           respectively (pp.cit., pp. 208—15).
For Great Britain, Matthews notes the early dominance of major cycles, of

which four occurred In the relatively
                                        peaceful period 1825-65, ranging from 8
                                             16




to 12 and averaging 10 years (in addition to more numerous shorter and milder

fluctuations). Between 18714 and 1907 four additional peak-to-peak cycles in

national income occurred, lasting from 7 to 10 and averaging 8 years, but

these are attributed mainly to an alternation of two much longer,

unsychronized swings in domestic and foreign investment, a situation seen as

unlikely to recur (ibid., pp. 215-26).

      In short, it is fair to say that direct inferences from time-series data

in annual or shorter units, without resort to any elaborate smoothing or

filtering procedures, lend little support to the concept of well-defined

periodicities that apply to economic fluctuations across time and space. It

is in the work of those authors who are sympathetic or committed to this

concept that the problems encountered by the periodicity hypotheses are most

visible.

4.   Fluctuations      in Detrended Series

      The   measures    in Tables 1 and 2 are based on the consensus of movements in

time series that include long-term trends as well as cyclical fluctuations

(only the seasonal variations are routinely removed). Alternative

chronologies have been constructed from comovements of cyclical dimensions

found in trend-adjusted data. In the upward (downward) phases of these

"growth cycles," the economy grows at an average rate higher (lower) than its

long-term trend rate. Hence not only absolute declines but also sufficiently

large and long slowdowns can and do give rise to such detrended cycles.

      Retardations often precede contractions, and then growth cycles have

shorter upward phases, earlier peaks, and longer downward phases than the

corresponding business cycles, i.e., they are more nearly symmetrical.

Sometimes a major slowdown occurs but no contraction follows, as in 1951—52,

1962-64, and 1966—67 in the United States (the period after mid-1984 may or
                                               17




  may   not   turn out to fall into the same   category).   So growth cycles outnumber

  business cycles. However, it is also possible for a low growth phase to

  include a short and incomplete business cycle recovery, though only one case

 of this sort was documented so far: 1975—82 witnessed two business cycles but

 only one growth cycle.

         When very strong upward trends prevail, growth cycles may replace

 business cycles, that is, phases of below—normal but still positive growth

 occur instead of contractions. In the long sweep of modern history, this

 appears to have happened on a large scale only in Europe and Japan during the

 great post-World War II reconstruction of the 19LOs and 1950s. The condition

 may therefore be a temporary and uncommon one, except perhaps for small

 nations engaged in the process of rapid industrialization and buildup of

 exports. It is the observed postwar development that led to the contemporary

 definition of "growth cycles" and their dating for many countries (Mintz 1969;

 Klein and Moore 1985).

        Since trends vary across the different indicator series for each country

and generally also over time, their elimination might well reduce both the

temporal variability and the spatial differentiation of the observed

fluctuations. One would therefore wish to compare growth cycles with business

cycles with respect to their respective regularities.

        Table 3 suggests, first, considerable similarity between the durations of

growth cycles in the principal economies with relatively unrestricted private

enterprise and trade. The higher growth phases averaged 30—39 months for

eight of the countries covered, 19 and 22 months for the U.S. and Canada. The

low-growth phases averaged 17-22 months, except for United Kingdom and West

Germany, with 28 and 30 months, respectively. Total growth cycles, whether

marked off by troughs or peaks, lasted on the average a little over four years

NOTE:   Growth cycle turning points mark the approximate dates when aggregate economic activity was farthest
        above its long-run trend level (P) or farthest below its long—run trend level (T). The selection of
        dates was based on visual inspection of computer-selected turns in coincident indicators for each

        terms, seasonally adjusted, and detrended).

  (about five years for Switzerland and three years for Canada, to take the

  range). Some of the discrepancies reflect differences in the time coverage.

  Inspection of the dates of successive growth cycles in the different countries

  show a good deal of correspondence between these chronologies. This confirms

  the old lesson that most of the larger fluctuations are transmitted or

 diffused internationally (see Moore and Zarnowitz 1986, section 8, for

 detail).

      Second, the variability of growth—cycle durations over time is less then

 that of business cycles but still large. For the United States      19148-82,

 standard deviations are 50, 52, 145, and 314 percent of the mean lengths of

 high—growth and low-growth phases, trough-to-trough and peak-to-peak growth

 cycles, respectively. The corresponding ratios for business expansions,

 contractions, and total cycle durations are 61, 67, 143, and 147 percent. The

 range is 25-93 months for growth cycles, 28—117 months for business cycles.

 The results for other countries are similar, e.g., the ranges of growth cycles

 in Japan, United Kingdom, France, and West Germany are 140-99, 142-914, 141-70,

and 141—98 months, respectively.

      It is important to recognize that growth cycles are more difficult to

identify than business cycles, and are not as well defined and measured. In

recent years, it was often taken for granted that trends and cycles have

different causes and effects. They used to be treated as independent, e.g.,

the long trend in real GNP as a deterministic function of time, the cycle as a

stationary second-order autoregressive process around that time trend (Kydland

and Prescott 1980; Blanchard 1981). This is now being strongly challenged by

the view that the trends are themselves stochastic, and total output as well

as other important macroeconomic series are stationary only after differencing

(Nelson and Plosser 1982).

     In an instructive article, Harvey 1985 argues in favor of a structured

approach to modeling time series as containing unobserved stochastic trend and

cycle components. He finds the properties of annual series on output,

unemployment, consumer prices, and stock prices to be very different for

periods ending in 19L7 (with starting dates from 1860 to 1909) and the period

19L8_70. For the earlier years "the cycle is an intrinsic part of the trend

rather than a separate component that can just be added on afterwards." For

19L8_70 "a faint cycle can be detected ...   [but   a] stochastic trend model is

sufficient," while "after 1970 ...   it could be argued that the reintroduction
of a cyclical component is desirable" (p. 225). Not surprisingly, the short

cycles of the early postwar period appear but faintly when annual units are

used. The dispute continues but there is increasing evidence that the

permanent components in business cycles are much larger than was previously

assumed (Campbell and Mankiw 1987). All this may be interpreted as a revival

of certain time-honored ideas: that trends are not very stable over long

periods of time but subject to intermittent or sequential changes; that trends

and cycles interact in various ways; and that, therefore, the separation of

trends and cycles may be associated with serious errors (see Zarnowitz 1981

and 1987 for further discussion of this topic and references).

5. How Regular Are Investment Cycles?

     What evidence is there that inventory investment is a source of minor

cycles, fixed investment of major cycles? Studies of the historical record

indicate that the relative importance of changes in business inventories is

very large in short and weak fluctuations, much smaller in the long and strong

ones, whereas the opposite is typically the case for investment in plant and

equipment. Stocks of goods held for current production and sale are generally

subject to prompter and less costly adjustments than stocks of structures and
                                          21




  equipment on hand. Indeed, inventory investment is visibly more volatile than

  investment in "fixed" capital. It is likely to drop in any recession, mild or

 severe, but will also at times show declines of some persistence during long

 business expansions. Fixed capital investment has fewer "extra" movements of

 this kind. Yet comprehensive series on real investment of all types have a

 high degree of cyclical conformity, i.e., they tend to move in broad swings

 whose duration and timing match well the business cycles as dated by NBER. If

 there are any systematic differences in periodicities here, they appear not to

 be sharp enough to be demonstrable by simple methods of comparing "specific

 cycles" in individual time series with "reference cycles" in aggregate

 economic activity.

     The   techniques   of spectral analysis are well designed to serve the

 purposes of detecting and examining cyclical patterns or periodicities in

 large samples of data on stationary processes. They have been successfully

used as such in natural sciences and engineering. In econometric applications

their usefulness is often limited by the small size of available samples of

consistent data and the prevalence of nonstationary processes.

     Most economic aggregates contain strong upward trends. Their short—

period changes are highly autocorrelated and small relative to their

contemporaneous levels. The power spectra estimated for such series show

sharp peaks at the lowest, steep declines at rising, and flat declines at the

highest frequencies) Such convex curves relating power inversely to

frequency (hence positively to the cycle period) were found to be relatively

smooth, except for peaks at seasonal frequencies, and labeled "the typical



This would be so whether the trends are deterministic or stochastic, the
underlying time series models of the ARIMA class or AR(1) with coefficients
close to one. For a discussion of the broad range of interpretations of
spectra with this shape, see Granger and Newbold 1977, pp. 53—55, 63—65.
                                      22




spectral shape" (Granger 1966). In a spectrum so dominated by the long

movement of the series, cyclical features turned out to be very diluted and

difficult to identify. But this was soon recognized as a technical problem,

not a proof of the unimportance of business cycles in general. For series

that are trendless or detrended, more interesting spectra can be estimated.

Differericing Is often recommended and used. Howrey 1972 calculates spectra

for real GNP and its major expenditure components In both first-difference and

linear-detrended form. He finds using the change series preferable but the

results are generally consistent. His conclusion is that "These estimates

indicate, from a descriptive point of view, the reality of three—to five-year

business cycles, particularly in the investment series" (p. 617). The

relative peaks that emerge lack statistical significance according to

conventional tests, but this result is attributed to the shortness of the time

series used.5

     Another large problem in empirical applications of the analysis relates

to the degree of smoothing used to produce the spectral density estimates.

For very long consistent time series that may contain a large number of

cycles, smoothing with weighted moving averages with many constants (a

"truncation point" equal to one fourth or one third of the sample size, for

example) can be appropriate. For the short series (small samples) usually

available in economics, such smoothing may be too heavy. Hillinger 1986

contends that it results in attenuation of spectral peaks at business-cycle

frequency bands as in the "typical" spectral shapes. He presents unsmoothed

spectra for quarterly series 1960_814, which show pronounced peaks only at




5See Howrey, op. cit., p. 62L, where references to Adelman 1965 and Howrey
1968 are used to argue that studies of longer series "indicate more strikingly
the relative importance of business-cycle variation."
                                             23




  business-cycle periods (roughly in the ranges of 3.5—8 and 3.5—10 years for

  West Germany and the United States, respectively). But the unsmoothed

  spectra, like the closely related periodograms, have unsatisfactory properties

  of their own, and in particular lack consistency.6

          Charts 1—14 and Table 14 present the results of an
                                                               exploratory application
 of spectral analysis to quarterly seasonally adjusted series on investment in

  inventories, equipment, nonresidential structures, and housing for United

 States, 1919-141 and 19I886. Unsmoothed and lightly smoothed (3-lag and 7—

 lag) spectra are examined.7 The post-World War II data come from the national

 income and product accounts compiled by the Commerce Department, the prewar

 data are new estimates by Gordon and Veitch 1986, all in constant dollars.

 The series on change in business inventories required no transformation, the

 other series, which show approximately log-linear trends, are cast in form of

 relative rates of change (specifically, log differences).

      The inventory series for 19148—86 show well-articulated peaks at periods

 of 30, 146, and 65 months in both the unsmoothed (SO)
                                                           and 3-lag (S3) spectra.
 In the 7-lag (S7) spectrum, there is also a peak at 2 years and a gently

rising plateau between 14 and 5 years. The prewar SO has peaks at 18, 27, 314,

and 68 months; S3 matches the first two of these well, the next two poorly,




 6That Is, the variance of the estimate does not tend to zero as the sample
size tends to infinity. Also, the covariance between estimates at different
frequencies decreases steadily with the sample size, so that for long series
the risk of finding spurious periodicities is high. But these are strong
reasons to use high degrees of smoothing for large samples (increasing
relative to the sample size); they are not good arguments for applying long
moving averages to spectra of very short series that cover few business
cycles.

7The spectral windows were obtained with simple triangular weighting: 1 2 1
for the 3-lag and 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 for the 7-lag smoothed spectra. The SAS/ETS
SPECTRA procedure was used in the calculations (see SAS/ETS User's Guide, 5th
ed., Cary, N.C.: SAS Institute, Inc., 19814, ch. 18).

  and ST is relatively high between 1-2 years only (of. Charts 1A and lB and

 Table It, lines 1—3). The strong procyclical movements of inventory investment

  in both the pewar and the post war years is well documented (for a recent

 study of the 1929-83 period, see Blinder and Holtz-Eakin 1986). Measurement

 errors in the inventory investment data for the pre—1929 period may be

 responsible for the relative weakness of business cycle indications in the

 smoothed spectra for 1919_in..8

      The 19148-86 spectra for producers' durable equipment show relative peaks

 at frequencies very similar to those located in the corresponding spectra for

 inventory investment, and these peaks show up in the smoothed curves as well,

 although much flattened. The 30- and 50-month peaks also appear, and more

 strongly, in the postwar spectra for both nonresidential and residential

 structures, but here there are some signs of m.zch shorter and much   longer
cycles as well. (Cf. Charts 2A-2D and Table 44, columns 5-8).

      In the 1919-41 period, the 68-month cycle peaks appear in the SO spectra

for all three categories of fixed investment as well as the change in business

inventories but disappear or show up but weakly in the smoothed curves. The

same is true of the 314-month peaks, except for nonresidential structures where

this cycle seems to be at least one year longer. The fixed-investment spectra

also suggest some very short (9-month) and short (about 2—year) cycles. (Cf.

Charts lA—iD and Table 14, columns 114).

     In view of the unresolved problems and doubts noted earlier in this



8See Gordon and Veitch 1986, appendix pp. 328-35, for a description of the
data. Since their estimates of inventory investment were derived as
residuals, they may have larger errors than the other series, especially for
the early years covered. The Chow-Lin 1971 interpolation method was used to
convert the annual series to quarterly observations. For producers' durable
equipment, industrial production of' producers' goods served as the basis for
the interpolation; for plant and housing, industrial and residential building
contracts and construction indexes were similarly employed.

section,   it seems best to treat these results simply as provisional without

trying to test them in any formal way. Yet they are suggestive.    The spectral

peaks in Table I, column 7, correspond to periods of 146, 51, and 57 months,

all very close to the average durations of business cycles before and after

World War II (53—56 months, see Table 2, lines 2 and 3). The longest cycles

represented by relative peaks near 5—6 years (Table 14, columns 14 and 8) also

fit in well with the observed durations of major macroeconomic fluctuations

since 1919. This is not the case for those spectral peaks of inventory

investment that correspond to periods of 1-2 years, which are shorter even

than the average growth cycles of about 3 years (cf. Table L, lines 1-3 and

Table 3, line 1). But these results are at least in rough accord with the

general notion that inventory investment generates short fluctuations, and

indeed graphs of other spectrum estimates show similar local maxima (Howrey

1972; Hillinger 1986).

     The observation that seems most difficult to explain is the apparent

prominence of very short fluctuations in all divisions of fixed investment.

More generally, the limitations of analyses and evidence of this type need to

be stressed. Too many periodicities emerge in unsmoothed spectra, too few

survive even relatively light smoothing. Aggregation across these and other

components would be expected to produce much weaker and probably less periodic

fluctuations in total output and employment.

                            III. Models and Problems



  1. LimIt Cycles and Random and Exogenous Shocks

      Certain theories can produce strictly periodic fluctuations: a classic

 example is the nonlinear model of a limit cycle bounded between exogenously

 given "floor" and "ceiling" growth trajectories.8 In the deterministic case,

 if the parameters of this model were to remain constant, the cycles would

 repeat themselves perfectly. This, of course, is not the observed or expected

 outcome, so random shocks must be added to nonlinear models too, but they play

 a relatively small role in systems with limit cycles. Major departures from

 periodicity may require changes over time in the basic parameters of models in

 this class. Such changes are indeed likely in a world with structural change

 and occasional large disturbances (e.g., wars). They are contemplated in

 discussions of some of these models but are not incorporated in the models or

otherwise explained.



 81n Hicks 1950 the floor and ceiling lines have identical slopes equal to the
 long trend growth rate. The floor is set by the minimum rate of gross
 investment, which includes an autonomous part and maintenance of the current
 stock of capital; the ceiling by the limits on the resources available at full
 employment. Net investment is in large part induced by lagged changes in
 output, with a high value for the accelerator coefficient. Interacting with
 the lagged consumption-income (multiplier) relation, this accelerator would,
 in the unconstrained case, cause output to grow exponentially. But, once set
 in motion by some initial impulse, an expansion will be slowed upon reaching
 the ceiling, and in the resulting downswing the accelerator is suspended until
positive growth Is again resumed when output falls to the floor and starts
moving up along it.
      It is Important to note that the model could be relaxed in several ways
to allow for differentiation of the enodgenous and self-perpetuating cycles
that it produces. (1) The accelerator could be such as to correspond to a
cyclically explosive rather than a monotonically explosive solution. (2)
Investment that is "autonomous", i.e. caused by factors other than the change
in output, may fluctuate, say for technological or financial reasons.   (3)
Weak cycles may occur in which the ceiling is riot reached. (4) Some
variations may be admitted in the rate of growth of full-employment output and
in the sizes and lag patterns of the accelerator and multiplier. See Hicks,
op. cit, passim and expecially ch. IX.
                                         36



     Random disturbances do have an essential part in the dynamically stable

(i.e., damped) linear models which, unless repeatedly shocked, cannot produce

a continuing cycle. The output of such damped systems is represented by a

second-order linear difference equation with a white-noise term u, that is, y

  ay_1 - by_2 +   U, with   complex roots and b < 1 in absolute value (also, a2 <

kb). When b is very close to unity, there is little damping and the

periodicity is relatively high and easy to recognize; when b is lower (say,

near 0.8), damping is strong and periodicity is weak and no longer visible.

(For a demonstration of these relations by means of long—run stochastic

computer simulations, see Britton 1986, pp. 7—9.)

     It   is only the small white—noise shocks densely distributed through time

that serve as a possible source of periodicity in the damped linear models.

Large specific shocks that are discontinuous and sporadic are likely to make

business cycles and their phases less rather than more regular. Such

disturbances can be caused by wars, large strikes and bankruptcies, price

bubbles, foreign debt and financial crises, price cartel actions, and major

shifts in fiscal and monetary policies. They will be particularly important

when autocorrelated, which they probably often are. The conclusion of

Blanchard and Watson 1986 that business cycles are affected by both small and

large shocks but dominated by neither (and hence not "all alike") is plausible

but as yet not well established. Simulations of large econometric models show

them to possess but weak cyclicality properties to which relatively little is

contributed by random noise. Serially correlated error terms in the model

equations and exogenous variables have stronger effects, but generally the

inacroeconometric models are heavily damped and fail to account for much of the

cyclical instability observed in past and recent data (Hicanan 1972; Zarnowitz

1972 a and b; Eckstein and Sinai 1986).

  2.   Government and   the Business Cycle

        The "political business cycle" (PBC) is a simple idea suggestive of

  periodicity: Government policies aimed at winning elections for the party in

  power manage to manipulate inflation and unemployment so as to generate

  inverse cycles in the two variables with turning points associated with the

 electoral campaigns and voting dates. Where the latter are fixed, as in the

 case of the four-year presidential cycle in the United States, the so induced

 fluctuations should have a strong tendency to be periodic. This hypothesis

 led to a considerable amount of interesting work on popularity functions

 relating electoral results to macroeonomic variables and reaction functions

 relating instruments to potential targets of economic policies. But the

 results vary and on the whole fail to be clearly supportive of the PBC

 models. This is not surprising, since it is doubtful that the contemplated

 policies can be sufficiently well timed and executed; also, that the public

 will continually accept, or be fooled by, such policies if they succeed, and

 tolerate them if they fail.

       Business cycles go back a long time during the era of relatively small

governments of limited economic functions and influence; but they have changed

in various ways since, reflecting the evolution of the modern economy in both

its private and public aspects (Gordon 1986). It is certainly important to

study these changes and the role of government transactions, institutions, and

policies in contemporary macroeconomic dynamics. But increasingly it is

recognized that the most promising way to proceed in this direction is by

treating the government as part of the endogenous process generating the

economy's movement. Government policy makers as well as private agents react

to actual and expected economic developments in pursuit of their objectives,

despite the important (though partial) differences in the motivations, nature,
                                     38




and effects of their actions. There is both conflict and cooperation in the

resulting process, with elements of complex gaines among the major partners,

notably central banks and treasuries on one side, financial markets, business

associations, and labor unions on the other.

    Much hard work will have to be done to improve our understanding of these

interactions, but some aspects of the story can be captured by extensions of

current textbook models of the relations between output and interest rates

(IS—LM) and output and prices (AD-AS). Fiscal and monetary policies affect IS

and LM respectively, and hence aggregate demand, AD; they also respond to

shifts in IS, LM, AD and aggregate supply AS that are caused by forces outside

the government. What is needed is (1) to make the system dynamic by

introducing lags and/or norilinearities, and (2) to make the policy variables

endogenous by specifying how they react to changes in economic conditions.

(However, this does not, in principle, preclude allowing for autonomous and

stochastic elements in government actions, which are probably often

substantial.)

    The simplest approach is to use lags in the determination of prices (F)

as well as output (Q), which may be due to slow and uncertain information,

costs of rapid adjustments, desired implicit or explicit contract

arrangements, or deviations from perfect competition. If then AD shifts up so

that Q exceeds its full-employment level       at the existing level of prices,

there will occur a gradual upward adjustment in F and eventually also in

expected prices pe   This will cause wages and other costs to rise and hence

AS to move up, so that over time Q will fall back to Q1. If AD shifts down

and Q declines below QN, lagged downward adjustments of P and pe will follow,

so AS will move down and Q will slowly rise back to         The driving force

here is the variation in demand; supply adjusts at prices and wages that are
                                        39



  predetermined and slow to change, which explains the long lags involved.9

       The fluctuations In AD could be the work solely of real forces in the

  private economy, as in the accelerator-multiplier interaction models, or

  solely of changes in money supply dominated by central bank actions, as in a

  simple exogenous monetarist model. An early formal model that combines real

  and monetary factors within a private economy is Hicks 1950 (ohs. 11 and 12),

 where an IS-LM cobweb-type cycle is super imposed upon the nonlinear-

 accelerator core part of the system. This monetary cobweb results from the

 Joint operation of long distributed lags in consumption and investment and

 shorter discrete lags in the demand for and supply of "bank money." This is

 an endogenous theory of a "monetary crisis" leading to a sharp rise in

 liquidity preference (a "credit crunch" in the more recent parlance).

      Early students of business cycles saw no particular reason to give much

 attention to government activities. Keynesians have long treated the

 government as exogenous and having a large potential for
                                                            reducing instability
 by countercyclical fiscal policies, income transfers and subsidies or

 insurance schemes that keep up the volume of autonomous spending. The idea

that government actions may be strongly destabilizing Is still more recent,

being due mainly to the rise of monetarism and its emphasis on the exogeneity

and importance of monetary policy.

     In the currently prevalent linear stochastic models, fiscal and monetary

operations can produce either destabilizing shocks or stabilizing

                                                                           on
the relation between Q/Q and the actual and expected inflation rates p and
e• When Q/Q' > 1, inflation would accelerate, i.e. p and e increase; when
QIQ < 1, p and e tend to decline. Another modification of the model is that
some authors dispense with the concept of a short-run upward sloping AS curve,
keep the vertical AS curve at full employment, and work directly with shifts
in the horizontal predetermined price levels. (Examples of these different
treatments can be found today in most of the popular macroeconomic texts.)

interventions,   depending on how well they are timed, quantified, and

executed. Some actions are taken to correct previous actions newly discovered

to have been in error. So this approach permits a comprehensive treatment of

policies and related variables, which can be revealing -   if not pushed too
hard.

        Consider a monetary acceleration intended to revive a sluggish economy

that has a cumulative lagged effect of fanning a business expansion into an

inflationary boom, whereupon restrictive measures are taken that shift AD back

and replace excess demand with excess supply. The concept of a cycle driven

by such policy errors was popularized by the persistent monetarist criticism

of the Federal Reserve whose discretionary policies were time and again

described as doing "too much too late." But it is hard to see how this

argument can be generalized, and there is no sufficient evidence to support an

attempt to do so. It would be indeed strange for such failures not to give

rise to caution and learning but rather to be recurring with much the same

negative results. Government miscalculations may well be common but they do

not offer a good basis for explaining the long existence and wide diffusion of

business cycles.

3.   Nonlinearities
        In linear models, time lags that cause overshooting in adjustments to

equilibrium are essential to produce fluctuations in response to shocks.

Nonlinear models can explain endogenously the existence and amplitude of a

limit cycle without any shocks and explicit lags. (This is shown by a long

line of work, from Kaldor 194O and Goodwin 1951 on nonlinear investment-saving

processes and cyclical profit shares to Schinasi 1982 on the integration of

such functions and an IS-LM model with a government budget constraint). But

limit-cycle models need shocks to diversify the cycles and lags to determine
                                        141




  their periods. And after all, it stands to reason that a successful

 explanation of how the "real world" economies move will have to include all

 these elements -- random or exogenous disturbances and delayed reactions as

 well as nonlinearities.

      Technical and scientific advances are facilitating work with reasonably

 comprehensive yet comprehensible models. Empirically much is known about the

 role of leads and lags in business cycles. The part played by shocks is not

 so well understood and more controversial despite (or perhaps because of) the

 current predominance of linear models that rely heavily of outside impulses of

 all sorts. The neglect of nonhinearities may well have led to an

 overstatement of the importance of random factors and perhaps also policy

 changes treated as exogenous.

     Nonlinear models now cover a wide range of business cycle theories: much

of the work has Keynesian and some has Marxian flavor, but classical and

neoclassical ideas are also represented (see the essays in Goodwin, Kruger,

and Vercelli. 19814 and Seinmler 1985). Grandxnont 1985 shows that persistent

deterministic fluctuations will emerge in an overlapping generations model in

which markets clear and perfect foresight is obtained along the transition

path through a sequence of periodic competitive equilibria. The basic

condition is simply that the older agents have a greater preference for

leisure. With the specified lag structure, cycles of different periods will

typically coexist. The model has classical properties and generates some

observed comovements, but it also suggests the possibility of an effective

countercyohical monetary policy. 10



10Compare related results on other applications of the OLG approach that yield
multiple rational-expectations solutions (Zarnowitz 1985, pp. 562-63, gives a
brief summary). Grandmont's system has the classical dichotomy: equilibrium

     Introduction of nonlinearities is necessary for modeling and analyses of

a variety of theoretical ideas such as (1) time irreversibilities or ratchet

effects employed in some early models of consumption and cyclical growth

(Duesenberry 19!9; Smithies 1957; Minsky 1959) and (2) discontinuities or

jumps at certain parameter values that can differentiate the length of cycle

phases or impose irregular fluctuations on long-term growth (from Goodwin 1951

to Day 1982, for example).11 For these and other good reasons, this field of

study is a promising and active one; but the work done so far is lopsidedly

devoted to manipulations of highly aggregative and abstract models. What is

badly needed is the development of tested knowledge of where the non-

linearities in the economy are located, how important they are, and what

effects they have. This will require much careful examination of existing,

and perhaps also collection of new, empirical data.

.   Asymmetries
     An important point that did receive some attention recently is the

possibility of basically asymmetrical cyclical behavior manifested in

contractions being on the average shorter and steeper than expansions. The

view that such an asymmetry exists is far from new; as shown below, it found

support in long historical evidence and was endorsed by some prominent

economists several decades ago. But linear techniques are not capable of



determined in the goods market. Prices are positively, real interest rates
are inversely correlated with output.
     In contrast, a nonlinear model of capital accumulation in Foley 1986
shows how monetary and fiscal policies can fail to reduce cyclical instability
and may even increase it. Here the accelerator amplifies but liquidity
effects eventually constrain the cycle.

The variety of slopes and shapes of the partly smooth, partly oscillating
growth trajectories produced by recently developed purely deterministic models
is remarkable (see Day 1982, Figure 1, p. 1407), but it must be noted that
these movements are much less persistent and more "chaotic" than those
observed in economic aggregates during business cycles.

  representing   or explaining this type of behavior.

        Mitchell (1927, pp. 330314) noted that frequency distributions of month-

 to-month changes in trend-adjusted indexes of business activity for periods

 between 1875 and 1925 are slightly skewed to the left in each case. He wrote

 that "abrupt declines usually occur in crises; the greatest gains ... come

 as reactions after sudden drops;" also, that "the number of declines is

 smaller than the number of advances, but the average magnitude of the declines

 is greater." He concluded that "Business contraction seems to be a briefer

 and   more violent process that business expansion."

        Keynes appears to have narrowed the asymmetry from the total phases of

 rise and fall to the peak and trough zones. He wrote of "the phenomenon of

 the crisis -    the   fact that the substitution of a downward for an upward

 tendency often takes place suddenly and violently, whereas there is, as a

 rule, no such sharp turning-point when an upward is substituted for a downward

 tendency" (1936, p. 311fl.12

       Table 5 shows average amplitude values, i.e., rates of change or slopes,

for cyclical upswings and downswings in several long historical series with

adjustments for secular trends. The measures are reproduced from Mitchell

1927 and   Burns and Mitchell 1946 (or based on the data given therein; see
notes in the table). For Mitchell's series in trend—adjusted form, the number

of   month-to-month increases tends to exceed that of declines but slightly
(column 2), while      the absolute size of increases tends to be smaller than that
of   declines by varying differentials (columns 3 and Zr). The deposits series




 12Hicks held a similar view of the asymmetry but less strongly. He related it
to the "monetary deflation" that may accompany the real downturn and make it
more severe (1950, pp. 115-18, 106—62). Keynes explained the "crisis" mainly
by "a sudden collapse in the marginal efficiency of capital" (op. cit., p.
315).

 provides   the only exception here. The measures of Burns and Mitchell show the

 downswings   as   being on the average steeper (more rapid) than the upswings in

 every case. The differences are relatively large for both the unadjusted and

 trend-adjusted series, except for railroad bond yields, where the trend is

 oscillatory (indeed downward most of the time, see Burns and Mitchell, 19146,

 chart 36, p. 275).13

      Blatt finds the results reported by Burns and Mitchell for the detrended

 series to be very significant economically and statistically, and infers that

 "a pronounced lack of symmetry is the rule" (1980; 1983, p. 232). He views

 this as a strong contradiction of the Frisch-type random shock theory of

 business cycles, which implies symmetrical fluctuations around trend.

     DeLong and Summers 1986 estimate coefficients of skewness in quarterly

 growth rates of real GNP and industrial production from post—World War II data

for the six major OECD countries. The asymmetry hypothesis implies negative

skewness. The estimates have negative signs in 9 out of 12 cases but they are

generally small relative to the calculated standard errors. For the United

States, annual data show more evidence of negative skewness than quarterly

data, particularly for GNP in the postwar period. Surprisingly, the skewness

is positive (but not significant) for the U.S. quarterly real GNP series in

1891—1915 and 1923-140. The authors conclude (p. 176) that "It is reasonable

in a first approximation to model business cycles as symmetric oscillations

about a rising trend" since "GNP growth rates and industrial production growth

rates do not provide significant evidence of asymmetry."




13For electricity output, 1921-33, a strongly growing series, the rise and
fall amplitudes are 1.0 and 0.8 in the unadjusted data, 0.5 and 0.7 in trend-
adjusted data, respectively. This is an example of an asymmetry that is
concealed by the trend in the original series, but it is based on two
corresponding series only (cf. Blatt 1983, p. 231).
                                      246




    It   would seem that this inference is too strong and probably premature,

being based on uncertain assumptions and evidence.   The standard errors of

skewness are estimated from Monte Carlo simulations that assume the growth

rates to be stationary third-order autoregression processes. The reasoning of

Mitchell, Keynes, and Hicks attributes the asymmetry largely to the occurrence

of sharp downturns in investment and/or monetary stringencies and financial

crises. This is a plausible hypothesis which would surely lead us to expect

more asymmetry in the earlier era than after World War II, but the DeLong-

Summers results unaccountably show the opposite. The GNP data inevitably are

much less reliable for the former period. The Mitchell and Burns series used

in Table 24, though limited and partly overlapping in coverage, provide more

observations and may well be on firmer ground. The evidence based on them is

also less general and conclusive that it was interpreted to be, but it

certainly should not be ignored or dismissed.

     Neftci 19824 rejects the null hypothesis of symmetry for unemployment in

the United States 19248—81 on the strength of tests applied only to data on the

direction (not size) of changes in several series of jobless rates. DeLong

and Summers are critical of such tests for sacrificing power but their own

results confirm those of Neftçi even more strongly: quarterly U.S. data show

positive skewness in unemployment and negative skewness in employment, both

significant at the 5% level. However, they find no evidence of asymmetries in

quarterly unemployment series for the five other OECD countries in 1950-79.

This last result, though, relies heavily on difficult trend adjustments for

large rises in European unemployment after 1973 assumed to be noncyclical; if

not so detrended, these series would appear strongly skewed. There is much

that is unexplained and uncertain about these findings.124

     It is true that the appearance of strong asymmetries in unadjusted time
                                         147




  series is due to a large extent to the prevailing secular growth, and so is

  the fact that business expansions are much longer than contractions, as noted

  by DeLong and Summers. But even series that contain no upward trends or from

  which such trends have been eliminated as well as possible often show visibly

  asymmetric behavior of the envisaged type. If no asymmetries occurred, the

 upswing and downswing phases of growth cycles should be about equal in length

 on the average over time. But Table 3 shows that high—growth phases were

 typically longer than low-growth phases (cf. columns 3 and 5).

      Table 6 lists the differences between the
                                                  average durations, high—growth
 minus low-growth phase: they are all positive (column 1). For United States,

 Canada, and United Kingdom, they are small (1 to 3 months), for West Germany

 near zero. For the other six countries, they are much larger (9 to 17 months)

 and statistically significant at 2-15% levels; the strongest evidence that

 high—growth phases tend to be longer comes from the measures for Japan,

 Australia, and the Netherlands (columns 2-14).

     Other indications that nonhinearities are neglected or concealed by

currently popular methods of econometric and time-series analysis are

scattered in recent literature (Blatt 1978; Britton
                                                      1986, pp. 50—52; Neftçi
1986). The conclusions range all the way from saying that these methods are

very deficient (Blatt) to saying that they are the best available and

unscathed by a search for asymmetries (DeLong and Summers). Actually the

search has so far been short and weak. The evidence is not very strong but on




114en detrended and plotted to appropriate scales, the unemployment rate and
(inverted) industrial production show closely similar fluctuations (see chart
in DeLong and Summers 1986, p. 175). The timing differences between the two
are partly systematic but small. Charts for other countries display much the
same cyclical patterns in the corresponding series (Klein and Moore 1985,
chap. 14 and app. 14A and t4B. The test results may overstate the differences in
skewness between output and employment.

  nonlinear characteristics. Further research on this front is certainly

  needed.

  5. Do Expansions Die of Old Age?

       Late in 1985 many observers greeted the third anniversary of the

 continuing business expansion with a touch of worry. As measured by NBER,

 only one of the six peacetime expansions since 1945 lasted more than 39

 months. Of the 14 comparable phases in 1854—1919, none survived more than

 three years, and of the five in 1919145 only one did. Late in 1986 the same

 reasoning would lead to stronger fears of a downturn yet. But by mid-1987 the

 expansion was nearing the peacetime record set only recently in 1975-79 (58

 months) and few forecasters expected a recession before 1988 or 1989. Far

 from being self-evident, the expectation that as an expansion grows older the

 probability of its terminating increases is something that is yet to receive
 full examination.

     If business fluctuations were just random walks, then their past would

have no predictive value, and in particular the probability of a peak (trough)

in any month of an ongoing expansion (contraction) would be a constant

independent of the age of the phase. Indeed, McCulloch (1975) presents tests

showing that the probability of termination is equal for "young" and "old"

expansions, once the movement has exceeded some minimum duration, and that the

same applies to contractions. This suggests to him that business fluctuations

are merely like the "Monte Carlo cycles" the superstitious gamblers

misperceive in their luck at casinos or racetracks, i.e., pseudo—cycles with

"no periodicity, rhythm, or pattern except perhaps a trend" (p. 303).

     On the other hand, Meftci (1982) offers a formula for an "optimal"

prediction of cyclical downturns, one component of which is the probability of
                                     50



a peak this month based just on the length of the expansion to date. (The

other is the probability of observing this month's value of the percentage

change in the index of leading indicators when the trend in that index is

upward.) Neftçi estimates the probabilities by smoothing the distributions of

the observed phase durations and percent changes in the leading index. Thus

he expects the duration of an expansion in itself to be of some help in

predicting the peak (mutatis mutandis, the same applies to contractions and

troughs). A degree of success is claimed for this approach and some

modifications improve it further (Palash and Radecki 1985; deLeeuw, Missouri,

and Robinson 1986).

     McCulloch's tests present some technical problems: it seems that small

changes in the underlying assumptions and data can lead to very different

conclusions (de Leeuw 1987). But even if his results were entirely

acceptable, his interpretation of them is not. Business cycles need not be

strictly periodic to differ radically from purely random movements. The many

important regularities well documented in studies of domestic, foreign, and

international business fluctuations simply cannot be reconciled with the

notion of "Monte Carlo cycles." Business cycles are far too persistent and

pervasive for that, and they contain far too many common features with common

explanations. In both relatively short and long, small and large expansions

and contractions, some variables conform strongly, others weakly, some

positively, others inversely. There are systematic differences in cyclical

amplitudes as well, and numerous recurring timing sequences as some variables

tend to lead, others lag, at business cycle peaks and/or troughs.

     Meftçi's and related exercises suggest that the potential contribution of

the phase duration measures and associated probabilities to the problem of

forecasting business cycle turning points is likely to be modest, though
                                              51




     probably not zero as hypothesized by MeCulloch. It would indeed be surprising

     to find otherwise. The probability of a peak during an expansion, or of a

     trough during a contraction, is clearly not just or even largely a function of'

     the duration of the phase. Various combinations of internal stresses and

  imbalances with external disturbances, including major policy errors, can cut

  the life of an economic recovery short or bring on an unsustainable boom.

 Conversely, well-chosen policies and other favorable developments can prolong

 an expansion by helping to keep a slowdown in the economy from sliding into an

 absolute decline or a speedup from creating inflationary demand pressures. A

 recession may in itself create the conditions for the next upturn, or the

 recovery may be accelerated by stimulative policies.

        What   matters   primarily, then, is not the passage of calendar time but

 that which happens over time in and to the economy in motion. It is the

 historical and psychological time filled with events and processes,

 perceptions and actions. This is, of course, generally so in human affairs.

 There is a simple corollary: knowledge of the current phase of the business

 cycle and its age can help but must not be used in isolation. Its proper role

 is to assist in the interpretation of the contemporaneous movements of the

economy by enabling us to compare systematically the present with the

historical patterns of the indicators.

6.     Predictability    and Costs

        Business cycle turning points, particularly peaks, tend to be associated

with unusually large forecasting errors (Zarnowitz 1979, 1986). If the

durations of expansions and contractions had been highly stable over extended

periods, forecasters (and indeed economically active and observant people in

general) should have long learned how to predict the timing of these phases

with considerable accuracy. The fact that economic downturns and to a lesser
                                      52



extent upturns cause much surprise is therefore a strong prima facie argument

against the hypothesis that business cycles are periodic.   Since major

slowdowns and recessions produce individual losses and social distress, there

are surely major incentives to improve the related forecasts and decisions.

Moreover, in the presence of continuing and recognizable periodicities, ways

would presumably be found to reduce cyclical instability or so to adjust to it

that it did relatively little harm to the economy at large.

     Indeed, no grave and persistent economic and social problems are caused

by seasonal fluctuations despite their broad diffusion and large quantitative

importance. This is so because the seasonal cycles are generally close to

being periodic and predictable. Businessmen, workers, and consumers possess

much accumulated knowledge of how to cope with this type of anticipated

instability, and there exist various institutional and market arrangements to

help. True, seasonal variations have stochastic components that can be a

source of significant forecasting and decision errors, but these are properly

matters of private concern. In contrast, recurrent slumps that generate

declines in sales, production, and incomes along with rises in unemployment

clearly belong to the sphere of public interest, and so do recurrent

inflationary or speculative booms.

     It is certainly possible to conceive of causes of highly periodic,

persistent, and costly cycles in total output and employment. They would have

to be exogenous, inevitable, and themselves periodic. The classic case here

is the weather cycle, whether due to variations in sunspot intensity or other

factors (Jevons 188L1; Henry Moore 191Z). But today such explanations lack all

plausibility. Moreover, the effects of such hypothetical externally imposed

cycles would resemble seasonal fluctuations much more than business cycles.15

     In short, the consideration of predictability and costs argue against the
                                         53



  idea that business cycles are strongly and stably periodic. The existence of

  limited and variable periodicities, however, cannot be excluded.



                           IV.   Summary and Conclusions



      The historical chronologies of business cycles provide evidence that is

 on the whole inconsistent with the hypothesis of strong overall
                                                                    periodicity,
 according to which these fluctuations tend tobe of constant length.       True,
 over long stretches of time similar average durations are obtained for the

 principal economies (about four years in the United States, five years in

 Great Britain), and most cycles fall within the ranges of       year around these

 means. But the dispersion measures for all cycle durations are large in

 absolute and relative terms everywhere. There is a sharp contrast in this

 respect between business cycles and the almost strictly periodic seasonal

 fluctuations.

      Nevertheless, examples of approximate periodicity limited in time exist

and deserve attention. Thus for Britain 1958-82 turning point comparisons,

autocorrelations, spectral analysis, and autoregressions all support the

statement that "The appearance of the trade cycle ...   is   unusually, although
not uniquely, periodic" (Britton 1986, p. 52). But a major (and fully

recognized) difficulty with these results is that twenty-five years of data is

a slender basis for determining cycles whose typical length may    be   five

years. Yet over longer periods the structure of the economy is likely to

change in ways that would alter the periodicity.17



171n fact, Britton's results for earlier periods in the modern history of the
United Kingdom and for the United States since 1960 differ and depend greatly
on methods of estimation. Unlike for Britain, the evidence for the United
States (based on unemployment data) is found to be "relatively weak and
                                       514




     Spectral analysis indicates a relative concentration of power around

frequencies corresponding to the average duration of business cycles (near 14

years). Since these techniques are applied to trendless or detrended series,

the average growth-cycle duration (about 3 years) may be more relevant here,

and spectral peaks that approximate it are found as well. These estimates,

however, are of uncertain significance, and the approach also suggests other

periodicities, including some that are clearly outside the range of observed

nonseasonal fluctuations.

     These observations suggest that business cycles defy simple

characterizations, showing a strong tendency to recur and at times even near

periodicity, along with great diversity and evolution of phase durations. It

is difficult but necessary to recognize such phenomena in the theoretical work

on the subject.

     Periodic business cycles are represented in the theoretical literature by

a variety of models. The nonlinear accelerator-multiplier interactions can

produce a limit cycle. Where elections are periodic, a "political business

cycle" could conceivably have a parallel rhythm. These models have some

rather evident and serious problems, and it does not redound to their

advantage that they can generate periodicity which is more exact and general

than consistent with likelihood and observation. But this does not mean that

linearities may safely be neglected; on the contrary, they are probably

important and their empirical identification is much needed. In particular,

there are some indications of asymmetrical cyclical behavior. One set of

these is provided by historical trend-adjusted series whose downswings tend to

be steeper than upswings. Another consists of estimated durations of growth

cycle phases in the post-World War II period: for most countries surveyed,


doubtful" (op. cit., p. LJ4; for detail see chaps. 1 and 14).
                                        55




 the periods of above-average growth tend to be longer than the periods of

 below-average growth.

      The variability in length of business expansions and contractions is

sufficiently large for the timing of cyclical turning points (particularly

peaks) to be, demonstrably, very difficult to forecast. The age of a phase

alone Is not of much help in predicting the date of its end: what matters

more is the dynamics of the evolving business situation. The regularity of

business cycles manifests itself primarily in aspects of such dynamics -

persistent   comovements of specific indicators, the leads and lags involved,

etc. There is no evidence that close and lasting periodicities exist in the

recurrence of socially costly recessions here or abroad, and there are good

general reasons why they are not visible. Important hidden periodicitles may

well exist, although even they are not likely to be unique, well-defined, and

stable.
