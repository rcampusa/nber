               Unions and Efficiency in Private Sector Construction:
                                  Further Evidence



                                       ABSTRACT


     Previous studies using micro data to estimate the impact of unions on

productivity in construction in the early 1970's have found productivity to be

higher for union than nonunion contractors in the private sector. The validity

of these studies has been questioned in light of the declining market share of

union contractors. This study re-examines union-nonunion productivity

differences over a sample of retail stores and shopping centers built in the

late 1970's. It finds that square footage put in place per hour is 51 percent

greater for union than nonunion contractors.

     Lacking data on wage rates by occupation, the impact of unions on efficiency

can be gauged only by looking at how unions affect costs, profit rates, and

prices. This study finds no mean cost per square foot difference between union

and nonunion contractors and offers mixed econometric evidence on translog cost

functions. There is no difference in profit rates or prices between union and

nonunion contractors in this sample.

     Allen (1986a) estimated the impact of unions on productivity over two

samples of construction projects built in the early 1970' s.1 Productivity of

union contractors was at least 30 percent greater than productivity of nonunion

contractors in commercial office building construction, but there was no

difference in the productivity of union and nonunion contractors in school

construction.

     There are two puzzles which that study left unanswered: (1) why does the

impact of unionism on productivity vary across different types of construc-

tion and (2) do the results still hold in light of the declining percentage of

construction workers belonging to unions? This paper sheds new light on these

issues by examining the effect of unions on productivity over a sample of

retail stores and shopping centers built in the late 1970's. It also examines

a wider range of measures of economic efficiency, including costs, prices, and

profits in order to establish the robustness of the results.



                                    BACKGROUND

     The contrasting results for different types of construction obtained in

Allen (l986a) could be generated by misspecification of the empirical model,

heterogeneity in technology or building codes, or differences in the incentives

of the owners. To test the first possibility, Allen (1987) estimated translog

cost function systems and hedonic price equations and compared mean profit

rates for union and nonunion contractors in the office building and school

samples. In the cost system specification, where input prices rather than

input quantities are exogenous and there are relatively few econometric

restrictions, the results were quite comparable to those obtained with

production functions. Costs were nearly equal for union and nonunion

contractors in the office building sample (actually lower in large buildings
for union contractors), indicating that the cost of higher wage rates was

offset by greater productivity for union contractors, but costs were higher for

union than nonunion contractors in school construction in all size ranges. The

price results showed no union-nonunion price difference in office building

construction, but higher prices for schools built by union contractors. Profit

rates were the same for union and nonunion contractors within each sample.

The office building and school results are thus clearly robust across

alternative specifications.

     This suggests that the differences in union impact between the two samples

arise from differences in either technology or ownership. Allen (l986b)

tested this by examining the impact of unions on productivity over a sample of

public and private non-profit hospitals and nursing homes, all of which were

built under the Hill-Burton program. The productivity of union contractors

was 23 percent greater than that of nonunion contractors in private hospital

construction, but there was no union-nonunion productivity difference in

public hospital construction. Further, productivity of union contractors in

private hospital construction was 33 percent larger than in public hospital

construction. This evidence shows marked differences in union behavior

between public and private non-profit construction, despite identical technol-

ogies and building codes.

     There are still two legitimate questions about union impact on private

sector construction which all of these studies leave unanswered. First, the

hypothesis of no union-nonunion productivity difference in private hospital

construction could only be rejected at the 87 percent confidence level. This

means that except for the office building sample, there is no other solid

evidence from micro data of higher union productivity in private construction.


                                        2
Because of the small size of the office building sample (83 structures) and the

 tremendous diversity in the construction industry, it is natural to question

whether those results can be replicated for another sample of micro data.

      Second, it is difficult to reconcile the evidence of higher productivity

of union contractors and equal unit costs, prices, and profit rates for union

and nonunion contractors from the office building sample with the decline in

the percentage of construction workers belonging to unions. Allen (l986c)

shows that this percentage gradually declined from 46 to 41 percent between

1970 and 1977 and then dropped rapidly to 32 percent by 1983. Most of the

work for the projects in the sample studied here was done in 1977, which may

give some clues as to whether union contractors still have greater

productivity.



                                       DATA

     This paper examines a sample of 42 retail stores and shopping centers

which opened between October 1976 and March 1978. The sample comes from a

survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as part of its Labor and Materials

Requirements program. This was the last survey done under that program. A

random sample of 75 projects was originally selected from a population

stratified by location (four regions) and size (dollar amount). Sample

attrition results from projects turning out to be outside the scope of the

survey (e.g., most space used for offices or residences, renovation instead of

new construction, completion after March 1978) and from lack of contractor

cooperation. BLS does not possess any information about the union status of

the projects excluded from the sample, so no adjustments for attrition bias can

be made.


                                        3
     The general contractor for each project reported the type of construc-

tion, the total value of the contract, dates of construction, square footage,

and a variety of building characteristics. The general contractor and each

subcontractor reported expenditures on materials and equipment as well as

hours, earnings, and collective bargaining coverage. Out of the 42 projects

used in this study, in 30 cases most labor hours were generated by contractors

covered by a labor-management agreement. These will be referred to as union

projects below; all other projects will be referred to as nonunion. Complete

data on hours and earnings for detailed occupations on each project are not

available, making it impossible to construct a labor quality index. This

is unlikely to bias the results because in my previous studies such indexes

were uncorrelated with productivity and the other coefficients were not

sensitive to exclusion of the index from the model.

     Two key variables for the cost function analysis had to be imputed from

other sources. The price of capital equals the rate of return from the 1977

Census of Construction Industries (CCI) for the state in which the project was

located.2 The price of materials is derived from the 1978 Dodge Manual for

Building Construction Pricing and Scheduling. If the Dodge Manual reports a

materials price index for the SMSA in which the project was located, that value

is used as the price of materials. Otherwise the price of materials equals the

statewide employment-weighted mean of the materials price index.3

     The relative frequency distributions for all of the building characteristics

used in the results reported here are reported in Table 1. In most respects

the union and nonunion projects are quite similar. The key exceptions to this

general tendency are that union projects are more likely to have two or three

stories, more likely to have masonry exterior walls, less likely to have a


                                       4
vinyl floor covering, and less likely to have built-up roofs with steel decking

than nonunion projects. The net effect of these differences in building

characteristics on the results is difficult to predict. Failure to control for

such characteristics would tend to favor union contractors in two cases (number

of stories and type of roof) and favor nonunion contractors in the other two

cases (exterior wall and floor covering).



                              PRODUCTION FUNCTION RESULTS

     As in Allen (1986a,1986b), the production function is assumed to be

Cobb-Douglas. Two dependent variables are examined (value added per hour and

square footage per hour) in specifications which either contain or omit

building characteristics. The building characteristics dummies included in

column 4 of Table 2 were selected according to the same criteria as in the

earlier studies: their coefficients had to be consistent with the engin-

eering data in 1977 Dodge Construction Systems Costs, some of the coefficients

associated with a particular characteristic (e.g. there are three different

dummies for frame) had to be greater than their standard error, and the

characteristic had to be observed in more than one building. The same

characteristics are also used in column 2 to make the value added and square

footage results comparable.

     Square footage per hour is 51 percent (exp(.4l4)-l) greater for union than

nonunion contractors in store and shopping center construction in the

specification where building characteristics are included, but only 8 percent

greater when the building characteristics are excluded from the model. The

latter estimate is much smaller than its standard error.




                                          5
     Which estimate is to be believed? When no building characteristics are

included in the model, the joint null hypothesis for all of the coefficients in

the square feet per hour equation cannot be rejected. Not only is productivity

no different for union and nonunion projects in this specification, but also

productivity is uncorrelated with such conventional variables as capital

intensity, scale, and location. This can result only from extreme measurement

error, inadequate sample size, or failure to include critical omitted

variables. As the results in column 4 indicate, the latter possibility seems

most plausible. Once the building characteristics are added to the model, the

joint null hypothesis is strongly rejected and the conventional significant

correlation between capital intensity and productivity appears. Each of the

summary statistics shows that the building characteristics clearly "belong" in

the equation.

     The value added per hour results replicate the findings of earlier studies

by myself and others. With building characteristics excluded, this measure of

productivity is 32 percent greater for union than nonunion contractors; the

productivity advantage of union contractors widens to 48 percent when the

controls for building characteristics are added to the model. Given the

well-known problems in interpreting cross section productivity equations

using value added as an output measure, these results are not by themselves

definitive but they demonstrate the robustness of the square footage per hour

findings.

     These results imply that the finding in Allen (1986a) of higher union

productivity in commercial office building construction in 1972-73 cannot be

dismissed because it pertains only to a particular type of construction or to

a time period which is now of no more than historical interest. In spite of


                                       6
the small sample size, the results provide further evidence that the behavior

of unions in the construction industry varies dramatically between public and

private sector projects. Still, productivity is but one indicator of the

impact of unions on efficiency and, because detailed information on wages by

occupation in each project is not available in this case, it is quite possible

that despite higher productivity under unionism, total construction costs or

the price of the project might be greater for union contractors because of

higher union wages. To get a complete picture, other indicators of efficiency

must be examined.

                                      COST COMPARISONS

     In addition to testing the robustness of the production function results,

cost comparisons also provide the opportunity to replicate the main finding in

Allen (1987) - -   that   economies of scale in union construction allow union

contractors to build larger projects at lower costs than nonunion contrac-

tors. Summary statistics in Table 3 show that the mean value of cost per

square foot is about the same in union and nonunion projects, ignoring differ-

ences in project size. Looking across project size categories, costs per

square foot are lower for union projects of 100,000 square feet or more than

for smaller union projects. Ignoring one nonunion project of 2800 square

feet where cost per square foot was almost $54, there is no difference in mean

cost per square foot across different size categories for nonunion projects.

Within each size category, the hypothesis of no union-nonunion cost difference

cannot be rejected.

    A more rigorous test of union-nonunion cost differences is to determine

whether the coefficients of translog cost functions and share equations vary

Shephard's lemma states that aC/aPi                      X1. In logarithmic terms, this becomes

           8lnC/ 8lnP =      pX/C         Si,

where S is the share of factor i in total cost. If the cost function is (1),

the share equation for each factor is

   S =           + s8Yi mY +     E1   lnP.                                                         (2)


To take advantage of the additional information about the parameters appearing

in the share equations, (1) and (2) are jointly estimated below using iterated

seemingly unrelated regressions. One share equation must be omitted to prevent

the variance-covariance matrix of the error terms in (1) and (2) from being

singular. The additional information on factor shares increases degrees of

freedom to 80 in the union sample and 26 in the nonunion sample. Iterated

seemingly unrelated regression produces maximum likelihood estimates which are

invariant to the choice of which share equation is dropped. Six different


                                                           8
specifications of these systems of equations were estimated: (1) no

restrictions; (2) homotheticity (/3yi=°' all isoquants have the same slope along

a ray from the origin); (3) homotheticity and homogeneity of costs with respect

to output (/3y/3yyO); (4) unitary elasticities of substitution CBij=O); (5)

unitary elasticities of substitution and homotheticity                and (6)

unitary elasticities of substitution, homotheticity, and homogeneity

                   In the union sample none of the six sets of restrictions

could be rejected with a log likelihood ratio test, but sets 3 and 6 could be

rejected for the nonunion sample. This means that meaningful cost comparisons

can be made with specifications 1, 2, 4, and 5. As the last column of Table 4

shows, the hypothesis of equal union and nonunion coefficients can be rejected

only in specification 5. This makes this case the most logical one for cost

comparisons of union and nonunion contractors. The other three contain free

parameters which, although estimated with very little precision, could strongly

influence the cost comparisons.

     It turns out that the cost comparisons produce very different results

across these six different specifications. To provide a more complete picture

of the results, cost comparisons from specification 1 are also reported in

Tables 5 and 6.   Table 5 reports the translog coefficients and Table 6

summarizes the key results on cost comparisons and economies of scale.4 Union

(nonunion) means of input prices are used to compute the cost and economies of

scale results for union (nonunion) contractors in Table 6. Table 5 also

reports the results of estimating the cost function and share equations

over the pooled sample in a specification where the intercept of the cost

function is allowed to vary by union status. Holding factor prices and output

constant, this model shows that costs are 24 percent greater for nonunion


                                        9
contractors. However, the means for factor prices at the bottom of Table 5

show very clearly that the assumption of equal factor prices is untenable.

This assumption is removed in the tabulations in Table 6.

     The cost comparisons based on specification 5 replicate the results in

Allen (1987) for office buildings. Costs increase with output much more

rapidly and economies of scale vanish at much smaller output levels for

nonunion contractors. Union contractors produce buildings with more than

180,954 square feet at lower cost than nonunion contractors. The model also

indicates they produce buildings of less than 16,042 square feet at lower cost

than nonunion contractors, but this result is most likely attributable to one

small nonunion project. The hypothesis than lnC - lflCn = 0 is rejected at

the 95 percent confidence level for projects below 6,081 and above 477,347

square feet (ranges where union contractors have lower costs) and for projects

between 42,319 and 68,597 square feet (a range where nonunion contractors have

lower costs). At most observed output levels, union and nonunion contractors

compete on equal terms.

     When the cost comparisons are based on the least restrictive model, the

results for economies of scale are about the same, but nonunion costs tend to

be lower than union costs at almost all output levels. A careful comparison

of the cost functions in Table 6 and the translog coefficients in Table 5 shows

that the main reason for the difference in results is the change in the union

cost function. The nonunion cost function is almost identical in the two

specifications, whereas the intercept and ln Y terms of the union cost function

vary considerably even though the restrictions in specification 5 are not

rejected by the data.




                                       10
      What are we to make of the conflicting results in Tables 5 and 6? One

view is that the "best" specification shows that the costs of union and

nonunion contractors are nearly equal at most output levels, indicating that

greater productivity offsets the cost of higher wage rates for union

contractors. The other is that the data have delivered a split verdict

and that no firm conclusions can be drawn about cost differences between union

and nonunion contractors.



                            PRICE AND PROFIT COMPARISONS

     Given the evidence on costs, data on the price of projects and contractor

profits must be examined to obtain a complete picture of how unions affect

efficiency in store and shopping center construction. If costs are actually

higher for union contractors, one would also expect them to have either lower

profits, higher prices, or both. If costs are nearly equal on average for

union and nonunion contractors, then prices and profits should either be equal

or offsetting.

     Price comparisons are based on the union coefficient of hedonic price

functions in Table 7. In a model where the only other regressors are the

square footage of the project and three region dummies, the price of the

building is 4 percent higher for union than nonunion contractors. As in Allen

(1985), this very simple model explains almost 90 percent of the price

variation across the sample. When controls for building characteristics are

added to the model, the price of each project turns out to be 1.5 percent

lower for union than nonunion contractors. Because neither estimate is

significantly different from zero and both coefficients are quite small in




                                       11
absolute value, it seems safe to conclude that there is no price difference

between union and nonunion contractors in the sample.

     Profit comparisons are difficult to make because employee benefits and

off-site costs are not reported. To adjust for employee benefits, profit rates

are calculated under two assumptions in Table 8 --   no   employee benefits for

either union or nonunion contractors and no employee benefits for nonunion

contractors only. Employee benefits are imputed for union contractors using

the same technique as in Allen (1987). Under the first assumption, profits

have a 2.6 percentage point greater share of the project price for union

contractors; under the second assumption, a 1.1 percentage point lower share.

In neither case can the hypothesis of no profit share difference be rejected.

This evidence on profits and prices is consistent with costs being nearly

equal for union and nonunion contractors at most ranges of output.



                                    CONCLUSION

     This paper has compared productivity for union and nonunion contractors

in retail store and shopping center construction in 1977. The most reliable

estimates indicate that square footage put in place per hour is 51 percent

greater for union than nonunion contractors. Indirect support for this result

is also found in the cost, profit, and price comparisons. Taking higher wages

for union contractors as given, if productivity is really higher for union

than nonunion contractors in the sample, then one would expect to observe no

union-nonunion difference in unit costs, profit rates, and prices. This study

finds no mean cost difference between union and nonunion contractors and offers

mixed econometric evidence on cost functions. There is no difference in profit

rates or prices between union and nonunion contractors in this sample. On


                                       12
balance, both the direct evidence on productivity and the indirect inferences

about productivity obtained from studying costs, profits, and prices point to

the same conclusion --   despite   a moderate decline in market share, the

productivity of union contractors in retail construction in the late 1970's was

much greater than that of nonunion contractors. Whether this is still true

today, after a more rapid decline in market share, is an open question which

cannot be answered with available data.

     Viewing these results along with earlier findings based on public (schools,

hospitals) and private (office buildings, hospitals) construction, it seems

quite clear that the behavior of unions and union contractors varies

tremendously with the market environment. In each case where the

union-nonunion comparisons are made over a sample of privately owned

structures, the productivity of union contractors has turned out to be higher

than that of nonunion contractors and the productivity difference has been

large enough to offset the difference in wages, making unit costs comparable.

In each case where the comparisons are made over a sample of publicly owned

structures, there is no union-nonunion productivity difference and the greater

cost of union labor is passed on to the government. The most likely

explanations for this pattern of behavior are that government managers lack

adequate incentives to take steps which would change the behavior of unions and

unionized contractors and that prevailing wage laws prevent the market from

creating those incentives by effectively banning nonunion contractors from

public sector projects in many areas.

i-Other studies examining the effects of unions on productivity are summarized
 in Freeman and Medoff (1984). For a critique of these studies see Hirsch and
 Addison (1986).

2The price of capital is assumed equal to the average rate of return in the
 1977 CCI for all construction contractors in the state in which the project is
 located. The rate of return equals estimated profits divided by gross book
 value of capital at the end of the year. Estimated profits equal 35 percent
 of estimated profits and proprietary income. Estimated profits and
 proprietary income equal value added less wages and salaries, expenditures
 for employee benefits, depreciation, rental payments for capital, and
 estimated net interest and indirect business taxes (which is 19.9 percent of
 value added less wages, salaries, and benefits). The ratios used to estimate
 profits and net interest and indirect business taxes are obtained from the
 national income accounts for construction in 1977; details about how these
 ratios were constructed are available from the author upon request.

3me price of materials is derived from the 1978 Dodge Manual for Building
 Construction Pricing and Scheduling in the following manner. If the Dodge
 Manual reports a materials price index for the SMSA in which the project is
 located, then that value is used. Otherwise, a weighted average of the
 indexes for all SMSAs in the state with available data is used. The weights
 are 1977 employment in construction, as reported in Employment and Earnings,
 May 1978, pp. 124-133.

4Chrjstensen and Greene (1976) define economies of scale (EOS) as

       EOS   1 -    8lnC/   8lnY.

 In (1) this gives us

      EOS = 1   -
                    c'y - flyy   lnY -   By
                                         1
                                            lnPj.
Union-nonunion differences in EOS are calculated by estimating y, yy, and
Py separately for union and nonunion projects.
