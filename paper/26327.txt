Population Aging and Structural Transformation

                                          ABSTRACT

We propose and quantify a novel mechanism behind the structural transformation process: older
individuals devote a larger share of their expenditures to services, so the relative size of the
service sector grows as the population ages. In a large sample of countries, we document that
increases in population age are accompanied by the rise in the relative size of the service sector.
In household-level data from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey, the fraction of expenditures
devoted to services increases with household age. We use a shift-share decomposition and a
quantitative model to show that changes in the U.S. population age distribution accounted for
about a fifth of the observed increase in the share of services in consumption expenditures
between 1982 and 2016. The contribution of population aging to the rise in the service share is
about the same size as the contribution of real income growth, and about half as large as that of
changes in relative prices.

1    Introduction
Economic growth is accompanied by large reallocations of economic activity across broad
sectors, a phenomenon known as structural transformation (Kuznets, 1957). In advanced
economies, the structural transformation process is associated with a decline in the rel-
ative size of the Agriculture and Manufacturing sectors and a corresponding rise in the
Service sector. Traditional theories that attempt to rationalize this process have relied on
non-homothetic preferences with a high income elasticity for services (e.g. Kongsamut et
al., 2001), or on a technology-driven increase in the relative price of services coupled with
a low elasticity of substitution across sectors (Baumol, 1967; Ngai and Pissarides, 2007).
     This paper proposes, documents, and quantifies a novel mechanism behind the struc-
tural transformation process: if older individuals devote a larger share of their expendi-
tures to services, then the relative size of the service sector grows as the population ages.
We show that, across a large sample of countries, increases in population age are accom-
panied by a rise in the relative size of the service sector. Using household-level data for
the US, we document large differences in sectoral expenditure shares across households
of different ages, with older households spending relatively more on services. We then
use a shift-share decomposition and a quantitative model of structural change to quantify
how much of the rise in the relative size of the service sector in the US over the period
1982-2016 can be accounted for by changes in population age.
     To document how structural transformation is related to population aging across coun-
tries and time, we use multiple data sources following the Handbook chapter by Her-
rendorf et al. (2014). Across many countries and years, and several datasets, the service
shares of employment, value added, and consumption expenditures are positively related
to population aging. Importantly, this empirical regularity persists when controlling for
the (possibly nonlinear) relationship between the service shares and income per capita
that has been emphasized in the previous literature. After controlling for income, a 1 per-
centage point increase in the fraction of population that is over 65 is associated with a 1.5
p.p. increase in the service shares of value-added and employment, and a 1 p.p. increase
in the service share of consumption expenditures.
     We then use household-level data from the US Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES)
to document large differences in sectoral expenditure shares across households of differ-
ent ages. Our data cover the 1982-2016 period and have been widely used to study how
service expenditures vary with household income. Older households spend significantly
more on services, a pattern monotonic in household age throughout the age distribution.
Compared to households in their early 30s, the service expenditure shares of households


                                             1
in their early 60s (resp. over 80) are 8 (resp. 27) percentage points higher. These differ-
ences are stable over the sample period, and are equally large when controlling flexibly
for household income. The largest differences in expenditure patterns arise in Health,
Utilities, and Domestic Care and Childcare, which are intensively consumed by the old,
and in Vehicle Purchases, Leasing, and Gasoline and Motor Oil, which are intensively
consumed by the young.1
    We quantify the contribution of population aging to structural change in the US in
two complementary ways. First, we perform a simple within-between decomposition of
the change in the service expenditure share between 1982 and 2016 (the sample period
available in the CES). We write the change in the aggregate service expenditure share as
a sum of two terms, one capturing changes in the service share of expenditures within
each household-age group, and another capturing changes in the relative aggregate ex-
penditure of the age groups. This decomposition shows that changes in the age-structure
of the population accounted for 20% of the observed change in the service expenditure
share over this period.
    We then use our data along with a structural model to evaluate the relative contribu-
tions of changes in relative prices, real income, and the age distribution to the structural
change process. We use a two-sector model with heterogenous households whose pref-
erences over goods and services take the Price-Independent Generalized Linear (PIGL)
form, augmented with age-specific taste shifters. These preferences were introduced by
Muellbauer (1975, 1976), and recently applied to the analysis of structural change by Bop-
part (2014). In the model, the household-specific expenditure share on goods depends on
the relative price of goods vs. services, the household real expenditures, and the house-
hold taste shifter. An advantage of the PIGL preferences is that household-level expendi-
tures can be easily aggregated, so that the aggregate expenditure shares are a function of
relative prices, aggregate income per capita, and a weighted average of the taste shifters,
with weights that correspond to the relative importance of each age group in total expen-
ditures.
    The relative strengths of the mechanisms that determine structural change in the model
depend on the elasticity of substitution across sectors, the income elasticity of each sector,
and the relative size of the age-specific taste shifters. Following Boppart (2014), we use
   1 It
      is well-known that the CES only contains health expenditures paid directly by households (i.e., it
excludes payments made by Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance). According to the National Health
Expenditure Survey (NHES), out-of-pocket health expenses represent a similar fraction of total health ex-
penses across the age distribution, so the differences in health expenditures persist after adding non-out-
of-pocket expenditures. Appendix B.2 repeats our analysis after rescaling household-specific expenditure
shares in the CES to match the aggregate expenditures reported in National Accounts data.

the model's structural equations for the household-specific expenditure shares and cross-
sectional household data to estimate the sectoral income elasticities, and use the same
methodology to estimate age-specific taste shifters. We then use the structural equation
for the aggregate expenditure shares and aggregate data on expenditures and prices to es-
timate the parameter governing the elasticity of substitution between goods and services.
    Having estimated the preference parameters allows us to decompose the log change
in the services share additively into the components driven by aging, technology, real
income growth, and a residual which can be interpreted as arising from age- and income-
neutral changes in preferences over time. We find that population aging played a signifi-
cant role in the increase in the expenditure share of services during this period, accounting
for about 20 percent of the total. The increase in the relative price of services accounted
for about 40% of the overall change, the rise in the real incomes another 20%, and residual
taste changes the remaining 20%. Finally, we combine our estimates of age-specific taste
shifters for services with population estimates to project that the US service expenditure
share will increase by a further 10 log points between today and 2050. The impact of ag-
ing on structural transformation is set to become stronger in the future compared to its
past role.
    Our paper contributes to a large literature that attempts to rationalize the structural
transformation process (see the recent survey by Herrendorf et al., 2014). Most theories
focus on the non-homotheticity of the relative demand for services with respect to income
(e.g. Kongsamut et al., 2001), or on changes in relative prices driven by differential long-
growth rates of productivity (e.g. Ngai and Pissarides, 2007) or capital deepening and
factor intensity differences across sectors (Acemoglu and Guerrieri, 2008). Alternative
recent theories for the structural transformation process have also emphasized the roles
of international trade (Matsuyama, 2009; Uy et al., 2013; Cravino and Sotelo, 2019), home
production (Buera and Kaboski, 2012), and changes in the labor supply driven by changes
in schooling (Porzio and Santangelo, 2019). We contribute to this literature by proposing
a novel and complementary demand-side mechanism for the structural transformation
process.
    Our analysis is also related to the quantitative literature that combines the mechanisms
listed above to evaluate their relative importance. Herrendorf et al. (2013) show that the
relative strength of the income and substitution forces depend on whether expenditures
and prices are measured using expenditure or value-added data. Boppart (2014) and
Comin et al. (2015) introduce the PIGL and Generalized CES preferences, respectively,
and re-evaluate these mechanisms allowing for non-vanishing long-run income effects.
Swiecki (2017) uses a framework that allows for international trade across countries and


                                             3
shows that substitution effects are most important in developed countries, while income
effects are more important in accounting for the shift out of agriculture during the early
stages of the development process. We contribute to this body of work by showing that
expenditure patterns differ across the age distribution, and thus an important portion of
the structural change process may be driven by the population composition changes.
    Finally, our paper builds on the literature documenting the differences in consump-
tion patterns across the age distribution. Hobijn and Lagakos (2005) show that differ-
ences in spending patterns by age lead to differences in CPI inflation across age groups.
Like us, they find that the largest disparities are in health care expenditures (dispropor-
tionally consumed by the elderly) and gasoline prices (disproportionally consumed by
the young). Aguiar and Hurst (2013) analyze consumption expenditures on non-durable
goods, and find large differences in consumption patterns of young vs. old households
in food, nondurable transportation, and clothing and personal care. We contribute to this
literature by showing how these differences in consumption patterns affect the structural
transformation process.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the relationship
between population age and the share of services in the economy across countries, US
households, and time. Section 3 quantifies the contribution of the observed population
aging to structural change, and Section 4 concludes. The Appendix collects the robustness
results.


2     Population aging and structural transformation: Facts
This section presents new empirical evidence documenting that population aging is sys-
tematically related to a shift in economic activity from Agriculture and Manufacturing
sectors towards Service sectors. We organize our evidence in two sections, one show-
ing how structural transformation relates to population aging across countries and time
using aggregate data, and another showing how sectoral expenditure shares vary with
household age using micro-data for the US.


2.1   Cross-country evidence
We start by describing how population aging is related to structural transformation across
space and time. The empirical analysis follows the structure in the Handbook chapter by
Herrendorf et al. (2014), who document how economic activity reallocates across Agri-
culture, Manufacturing, and Services as income per capita rises. We use the same data


                                            4
sources and empirical strategy to document how this reallocation is related to population
aging. In particular, we start by studying changes in sectoral value-added and employ-
ment shares for a broad set of developed countries using data from EU KLEMS. We then
study changes in sectoral consumption shares using data from the OECD. Appendix A.2
shows that our findings extend to a broader set of countries using data from the World
Development Indicators (WDI) for employment or the United Nations (UN) for value
added.


2.1.1   Changes in sectoral employment and value-added shares

Our main data source on sectoral employment and value-added shares is EU KLEMS,
which is compiled by the Groningen Growth and Development Center. The database re-
ports hours worked and value added by sector for a sample of 20 developed countries
over the 1970-2007 period. The advantage of these data relative to the WDI and the UN
data presented in Appendix A.2 is that employment is reported in terms of number of
hours worked rather than in terms of the number of employed workers, and that the
value-added data have been constructed from the national accounts of individual coun-
tries following a harmonized procedure that facilitates cross-country comparability. The
disadvantage is that the data only cover 20 countries, which is why we repeat our analysis
with a broader set of countries using the WDI and the UN data in the Appendix.
    We conduct our analysis using two alternative measures of population age. First, we
use the share of the population that is 65 or older, taken from the WDI. Alternatively,
we use the average age in the country, computed from the World Bank's "Population
estimates and projection" database. This database divides a country's population into 5-
year age brackets. To compute the average age, we multiply the midpoint of each bracket
(e.g. 2 in the 0-4 years old bracket) times its population, then add across age groups, and
finally divide this by the total population.
    The left panel of Figure 1 reports the sectoral shares of hours worked and the share
of population over 65, for each country-year in EU KLEMS. The share of hours in Agri-
culture decreases as population ages, while the share of hours in Services increases. The
employment share in Manufacturing is somewhat hump-shaped. The right panel in the
figure shows that the same pattern emerges if we use sectoral value added instead of
sectoral hours worked shares. These figures indicate that economic activity reallocates
towards the service sector as the population ages. Appendix Figure A1 shows that these
patterns persist if we use the average age in the population instead of the the share of
population over 65 as our age measure.

Controlling for income: We now evaluate whether the correlation in Figure 1 is simply
due to the fact that a country's population on average gets older as the country get richer.
To do so, we establish whether the patterns in Figure 1 prevail after controlling for income
per capita. With this in mind, we estimate the following regressions:

                              j          j                                 j
                            i,t = i +  j Agei,t +  j gdp_ pci,t +  i,t .                             (1)

        j                                                                                            j
Here, i,t is the share of employment or value-added in sector j in country i in year t, i is
a country fixed effect, gdp_ pci,t is the log of GDP per capita in country i year t, and Agei,t
is population age in country i in year t, measured either by the share of population that is
over 65 or by the average age in the country. We cluster standard errors by country.

   Table 1 reports the results of separately estimating equation (1) for each sector. Both
the shares of hours worked and of value added are decreasing in income per capita in
the Agriculture and Manufacturing sectors, but increasing in the Service sector, in line
with the evidence surveyed by Herrendorf et al. (2014). The coefficient of interest  j is
negative for Agriculture and Manufacturing, and positive for Services, indicating that
indeed aging is associated with a reallocation of economic activity towards services, even

                                                        7
after controlling for changes in income. These findings are robust to measuring shares
both in terms of value-added or employment, and to using either of our two measures of
population age.
    The patterns that underlie these results can be visualized in Figure 2. The y-axis plots
the residuals of the regressions of the employment and value added shares on the log of
GDP per capita and country fixed effects. The x-axis shows the residuals of the share of
population that is over 65 on those same variables. The changes in sectoral shares that are
orthogonal to the changes in income per capita are strongly correlated to the changes in
population age that are orthogonal to income per capita. Appendix Figure A2 shows that
these patterns are robust to using the average age in the population instead of the share
of population over 65 as our age measure. In addition, Appendix Table A1 shows that we
obtain very similar findings if we also control for potential non-linear effects of income
per capita.

2.1.2   Changes in consumption shares

This section documents how population aging relates to changes in sectoral consump-
tion shares using data from the OECD Statistics. Consumption shares can differ from
value added and employment shares since they do not include investment nor exports,
and they do include imports. OECD statistics report consumption for 11 countries in 16
expenditure categories for the 1970-2007 period. We follow Herrendorf et al. (2014) and
classify Food Consumption as Agriculture, Semi-, Durable-, and Non-Durable Goods mi-
nus Food Consumption as Manufacturing, and the remaining categories as Services.
    The left panel in Figure 3 plots the sectoral consumption shares and share of popula-
tion over 65 for each country-year pair in our sample. The right panel in the figure shows
the residualized shares from a regression that controls for income per capita and coun-
try fixed effects, analogous to those in Figure 2. The figures show that consumption in
Agriculture and Manufacturing products decline with population age, while the share of
Service consumption increases with population age. This is true also after controlling for
income (right panel). Appendix Table A2 reports the underlying regression coefficients.
Appendix Figure A3 shows that the results are virtually unchanged if we use average
age.

2.2    Household-level evidence
We now show how sectoral expenditure shares vary with household age using micro-data
for the US. Our data come from the US Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) and cover
the 1982-2016 period. We use the Interview Module of the CES, which surveys about
12,000 households per year. The Interview Module collects households' responses about
their purchases across 350 distinct expenditure categories, as well as other demographic
information. Each household is interviewed for up to 4 consecutive quarters, and the ex-
penditure data are collected at the household level. We use the average age of household
members as the measure of age for our baseline analysis. Appendix B.1 shows that our
results are robust to using the reference person's age, i.e. age of the household head.
    For the bulk of our analysis, we aggregate expenditures into goods and services fol-
lowing Aguiar and Bils (2015) and Comin et al. (2015).2 We focus on how the share of
non-housing service expenditures to the overall non-housing expenditures changes with
household age. We do not include housing in expenditure because in the CES the rental
value of owner-occupied housing is self-reported and thus may not be directly compara-
ble to rent payments for renters. Since home ownership rates change substantially over
the life cycle, the switches between owner-occupied implicit rent value and actual paid
rent may complicate the comparison across age groups. Appendix B.1 reports results in-
cluding housing in the analysis and shows that the treatment of housing does not alter
the main conclusions.
    Figure 4 plots the cumulative change in the aggregate expenditure share on services
in the CES data. Consistent with the aggregate evidence on structural transformation,
the service expenditure share rises in the CES, by about 18 log points over this period.
Appendix Table A5 reports the trends in broad service expenditure categories. The rise
in the healthcare is the main, but not the only, driver of the upward trend in the service
expenditure. Other categories showing substantial proportional increases are Cash Con-
tributions and Education. Food Away From Home, Utilities, and Domestic Services and
Childcare also rise.
    Figure 5 plots the expenditure share on services across households of different ages.
Each line represents a different period for the data we work with. There is a clear positive
monotonic relationship between the service expenditure share and the average age of the
household members. The differences are large: service expenditure shares of households
in their 60s are about 25 percent larger than for the households in their 30s (0.5 vs. 0.4).
   2 SeeAppendix Table A5 for the breakdown. We divide the sectors "Personal care" and "Other vehicle
expenses" into their service and goods components. For instance, "Gasoline and motor oil" is considered a
good, and "Public transport" and "Car maintenance, repairs and insurance" are considered services.

Notes: This figure displays the cumulative log change in the aggregate expenditure share on services in the
CES.


Households in their 80s have expenditure shares in services that are almost 70% higher
than those in their 30s (0.68 vs 0.40). These patterns are very stable over time. While later
periods tend to feature higher service expenditure shares overall, the cross-age differences
are pronounced in all time periods.


Controlling for income A potential caveat with the evidence in Figure 5 is that these
patterns may arise from income differences across age groups. This section shows that
this is not the case. Figure 6 plots the age-service expenditure share relationships sepa-
rately for each quartile of the income distribution. It is clear that the relationship is about
equally strong within broad income groups. Appendix Figure A6 shows a similar pattern
if we group households by income deciles instead of quartiles.
    To control for income more systematically, we estimate a regression that projects the
service expenditure shares on age dummies, income decile dummies, and region-time
fixed effects:

       s, h
Here t      is the service expenditure share of household h at time t,  a are household age
group dummies and inc are income decile dummies. Xrt     h are demographics dummies for

the number of household members (2, 3-4, 5+) and dummies for the number of household
earners (1, 2+). These are typically used in the literature (e.g. Aguiar and Bils, 2015).
Following Comin et al. (2015) we also control for differences in household-specific prices
by including region-time dummies, r,t . The implicit assumption behind this control is
that households within a region face the same prices.
   We estimate equation (2) separately for each decade for which the CES data are avail-
able. Figure 7 plots the age group dummies, which measure differences in service ex-
penditure shares of the age group relative to age group 25-30. The 95% confidence bands
based on standard errors clustered by household are depicted around the point estimates.

Notes: This figure displays the average household-level expenditure shares on services in the CES by age
group (x-axis), for 3 time periods, and each income quartile.


The figure shows large differences in service expenditures across households of different
ages, even conditioning on income and prices. These conditional differences are nearly
as large as the unconditional ones reported in Figure 5. As in the raw data, households
in their 60s have service expenditure shares 10-12 percentage points higher than house-
holds in their 30s, and households in their 80s' service expenditure shares are more than
20 points higher. The age dummies are precisely estimated, and quite stable over time.
Appendix Figures A7 and A9 reproduce Figures 5 and 7 using the age of the reference
person (i.e. household head) instead of average age in the household, and shows that the
results are virtually unchanged. Additionally, Appendix Figures A8 and A10 replicate
Figures 5 and 7 adding housing as part of the overall consumption and services.


Decomposing consumption differences Table 2 shows the differences in expenditure
shares across young and old households for the main consumption categories. The table
reports the difference in expenditure shares for each category for the 25-30 vs. the age

Notes: Each dot represents the point estimate of the age dummies in Equation (2) for a particular decade

groups starting at 60-65. Unsurprisingly, the largest disparity arises in health expendi-
tures, where the consumption expenditure share of the 60-65 (80+) age group is 5.6 (15.3)
percentage points larger than that of the 25-30 age group. The table shows that the elderly
also spend relatively more on Cash Contributions, Domestic Services and Childcare, and
Utilities. In contrast, for Vehicle Purchasing and Leasing, the expenditure share of the
60-65 (80+) age group is 3.8 (11.24) percentage points smaller than that of the 25-30 age
group.

Notes: This table reports the differences in expenditure shares across the major consumption categories
between age groups starting at 60-65 and households aged 25-30 in the CES.


Structural change within the service sector The rise in service expenditures has been
concentrated in categories that are disproportionally consumed by older households. Fig-
ure 8 divides service categories into two groups: one for the categories that are dispro-
portionally consumed by the old (Health, Utilities and Domestic Services and Childcare),
and one for the remaining categories. The figure shows a dramatic increase in the ag-
gregate expenditure share for Health, Utilities and Domestic Services and Childcare, the
combined expenditure share in these categories goes from 21 to over 28 percent over our
period. In contrast, there is no change in the expenditure share in the remaining service
categories. Figure A17 shows that a similar pattern emerges in the Personal Consump-

                                                  17
tion Expenditure data from the BEA: the increase in service consumption is concentrated
among those categories that are disproportionally consumed by the old.

Accounting for differences between CES and National Accounts data It is well known
that the aggregated expenditure shares in the CES do not match those in the Personal Con-
sumption Expenditure module of the National Income and Product Accounts compiled
by the BEA. One reason for this discrepancy is that the CES only reports out-of-pocket ex-
penses by private households, which may differ from economy-wide aggregate consump-
tion and misrepresent expenditure differences across households. This may be especially
salient in healthcare, since the CES data do not include spending by Medicaid, Medicare,
and private insurance for services rendered to the household. Appendix Table A9 reports
the shares of out-of-pocket expenditures in total health expenditures in National Health
Expenditure Survey (NHES) in the first and last year available in that survey, by broad


                                                                     18
age groups. Out-of-pocket expenditures represent a similar fraction of the total health ex-
penditures across the age distribution. Thus, the relative health expenditure differences
across the age distribution would persist after adding the non-out-of-pocket expenses.
   To map our analysis to the National Accounts data, we augment the CES data with
data from the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) from the BEA. In particular, we
rescale the expenditures in each consumption category to match aggregate consumption
expenditures by category in the National Accounts (PCE BEA) data. These rescaled data
reproduce the aggregate sectoral expenditure shares in the BEA, while preserving the
heterogeneity across households present in the CES. Appendix B.2 details this procedure
and replicates the results in this section and Section 3 using the rescaled dataset.3


3     Accounting for structural change in the US
This section quantifies the contribution of observed changes in the age distribution to the
observed changes in sectoral consumption shares in the US between 1982 and 2016. We
conduct this exercise using two alternative methodologies. The first is a shift-share de-
composition of the increase in the share of services in total consumption into the part that
arises from reallocation of expenditures between age groups vs. changes in expenditures
within age groups. The second is a quantitative model of structural transformation that
allows us to compare the contribution of population aging to the contributions of the in-
come and price effects that have been the focus of most of the structural transformation
literature.


3.1     Within-between decomposition
We start with a decomposition of the observed rise in the share of services in total con-
sumption in the CES between 1982 and 2016. We can write the share of services in aggre-
gate consumption as:
                                                 s, a
                                              a et
                                   s
                                   t =
                                             a  j et
                                                     j, a   =     ts,a × sta ,                         (3)
                                                                 a
    3 Rescaling the CES data using NHES is challenging because the expenditure categories in the CES do not

map readily into those in NHES, as the former presents the expenses from the perspective of the household,
whereas the latter records the sources of revenue of the healthcare provider. In addition, NHES by age
group only goes back to 2002.

is the share of age group a in aggregate expenditures. Letting  x  x1 - x0 and x 
[ x1 + x0 ] /2 denote the change and the average of a variable across periods t = 1 and
t = 0 we can write:



                                    s =         s, a · s a +   s, a ·  s a .                          (4)

                                                  Within            Between

Equation (4) expresses the change in the service share of expenditures as the sum of two
terms. The term labeled 'Within' captures changes in the age-specific expenditure shares,
 s,a , while the term labeled 'Between' captures changes in the share of age group a in
aggregate expenditures, s a .
    We take equation (4) to the data by breaking the US population into the 13 age groups
as in Section 2.2, measuring age both by the average age of all household members and by
                                                            s, a      a in equation (3) for each
the age of the household head. Table 3 reports the terms t       and st
age group in 1982 vs. 2016. As already documented in Figure 5, older households allocate
a significantly larger fraction of their expenditures towards services than younger ones:
both in 1982 and 2016, the share of expenditure in services is more than 50% higher for
households over 80 than for those aged 25-30. In addition, the table shows a large increase
in the share of expenditures that is accounted for by older households: households 65 and
older accounted for 10.4 percent of total expenditures in 1982, and 17.1 percent in 2016,
a 64% increase. The share of expenditures that goes to households 80 and older nearly
tripled, going from 1.2 to 3.4 percent. The counterpart of this increase is the decline in the
share of expenditures that goes to households 30 and younger, from 47.3 to 31.6 percent.

    Table 4 reports the results of the decomposition in equation (4). The share of services
in total expenditures increased by 8.5 percentage points during the 1982-2016 period. The
table shows that 1.85 percentage points, about a fifth of the increase, are attributed to
between age group changes in expenditures. The remainder is attributed to changes in
expenditure shares within groups. The table shows that the numbers are similar if we
instead measure household age by the age of the household head. Appendix Table A6
shows that the results are somewhat smaller though still economically significant if we
count housing as part of service expenditures.

3.2   Structural model
This section sets up a model to quantify the contribution of changes in population age,
income, and relative prices to the structural transformation process in the US. We study
an economy populated by Nt households indexed by h that are heterogeneous in their
preferences and their expenditure levels et h . Households consume goods ( g) and services

(s). The indirect utility of household h takes the form:

    We follow Boppart (2014) and proceed in two steps. First we use the cross-section of
households from the CES and estimate equation (6) in logs. The estimating equation is:

                                     g, h                 h
                             ln t           =  0 +  1 ln et + D a + r,t + h
                                                                          t,                                        (8)

                                       g 
where  0 + r,t = ln ( Pts ) - Pt ,  1 = - , and h             h 5          a
                                                      t = ln µt . Da = ln µ is an age dummy
that captures the taste shifter of the age group relative to an omitted age group. Without
loss of generality we normalize µ a = 1 for age group [25,30). Using these estimates for
  and µ a , we can construct the time series of µ ¯ t and t . We can then obtain the price
elasticity  from a regression of equation (7) in logs:

                                 g                     g
                            ln t = b1 ln Pt + b2 ln Pts + b3 Xt + ln t ,                                            (9)

                 -
where Xt  ln et     ¯ t t , b1 = , and the other coefficients satisfy the restrictions b3 = 1,
                    µ
and b2 = - b1 .
    Columns 1 and 2 in Table 5 report the results of estimating (8) with OLS. To address
measurement error in CES expenditure data, Columns 3 and 4 report the results of IV es-
timation with expenditure instrumented by income, as is customary in the literature (see,
e.g. Boppart, 2014; Aguiar and Bils, 2015). Table 5 shows an income elasticity of = 0.12,
   4 This   assumes that within age groups income and idiosyncratic preferences are uncorrelated,

      µt  | a = 0.
            t
   5 In
      practice our estimation controls for price effects with region-time dummies r,t rather than time
dummies, to absorb regional variation in relative prices of services. Allowing for region-specific price
changes has almost no effect on the estimates of µ a or .

which is somewhat smaller than the = 0.2 found by Boppart (2014). Appendix Table
A7 displays the estimates for the age dummies, and shows that our results are robust to
using the age of the reference person. Appendix Table A8 shows that the results for are
only slightly different even when considering housing as part of service consumption.
The age dummies are relatively large and statistically different from zero, and decrease
monotonically with age, indicating that older households spend relatively less on goods
after controlling for real income.
                                                                                  g
    Table 6 reports the estimation results for (9). To estimate it, we construct Pt and Pts by
aggregating category-specific price series from NIPA Table 2.4.4, using the expenditure
shares for each category within either goods or services. Our estimate for the  is 0.15.
Both  and are precisely estimated and significantly different from zero, and satisfy the
restriction  > > 0.

denote the log change in the aggregate price index. Equation (10) shows that log-changes
in the aggregate expenditure share of goods are additively separable into the effects of
changes in 'Income', 'Substitution', 'Aging', and a residual.7 This decomposition is plot-
ted in Figure 9. The expenditure share in services grew by about 20 log points between
1982 and 2016 in the CES data. The contribution of population aging µ     ^
                                                                          ¯ t was nearly 5 log
points, about a fifth of the total change. About 40% of the total was due to the rise in
the relative price of services (labeled 'Substitution'), and another 20% due to the income
effect. The residual accounted for remaining roughly 5 log points. Appendix Figure A11
shows that the results are unchanged when using the age of the reference person as the
household age variable. Appendix Figure A12 shows that the absolute contribution of
aging stays unchanged when considering housing as part of service consumption.


Projected changes in expenditure shares: To further illustrate the potential strength
of aging as a driver of structural transformation, we compute the contribution of the
projected changes in population structure to structural transformation in the future. To
do this, we use the US population projections to the year 2050 from the World Bank's
"Population estimates and projection" database. Because our estimates of the age taste
shifters µ a are at the household level, while the population projections are for population
shares by age group, we fit the following regression to map population shares ( PopSht     a)

into household age shares:

                  Nta           a             a 2
                      =  1 PopSht +  2 ( PopSht ) + t                 for t = 1982, ..., 2016.

                                           s  t . See the Appendix B.3 for the derivation.

     7 The residual includes both the change in the inequality measure    ^ t and the unexplained shifts in taste
^t . In the data, the changes in the inequality term have a negligible effect on the aggregate service share the

    Figure 10 reports the results. It turns out that the contribution of aging to structural
change over the past 35 years is relatively modest compared to its projected future con-
tribution. The service expenditure share will increase by a further 10 log points under the
current population aging projections to 2050, even with price of services and real income
held constant at today's values.


4    Conclusion
This paper proposed and quantified a novel mechanism behind the structural transforma-
tion process: older individuals devote a larger share of their expenditures to services, so
the relative size of the service sector grows as the population ages. We show that, across
a large sample of countries, the rise in the relative size of the service sector has coincided

with an increase in population age. We document large differences in sectoral expendi-
ture shares across households of different ages in the US CES data, with older households
spending relatively more on services. We then use a shift-share decomposition and a
quantitative model to show that changes in the US population age accounted for about a
fifth of the increase in the consumption share of service expenditures observed between
1982 and 2016. In our quantitative model, the contribution of population aging to the
observed structural change in the US during this period is similar to the contribution of
real income growth. Projections for the changes in the service expenditure share due to
aging in the US suggest that the future impact of aging on structural transformation is, if
anything, larger than its role to date.

A.2   Evidence from the WDI and the UN Statistics Division
This section complements the evidence from Section 2.1 using employment data from the
WDI and value-added data from the UN. Relative to the data presented in the main text,
these sources cover a much broader sample of both developed and developing countries.
On the other hand, unlike the the EU-KLEMS data, the WDI only reports number of em-
ployed persons as opposed to number of hours worked, and the value-added data from
the UN are obtained from country-specific sources that are not necessarily harmonized.
The data presents a balanced panel of countries that are covered for the 1970-2007 pe-
riod. We follow Herrendorf et al. (2014) and restrict our sample to countries with average
population above 1 million, exclude former communist countries, and exclude countries
where the average ratio of oil rents to GDP is above 20 percent. This leaves a sample of
99 countries.
    We replicate the fact reported in Section 2.1 using these alternative data. Table A3
and Figure A4 summarize the results from a regression analogous to Equation (1) that is
estimated on the WDI data. They show that, after controlling for income, there is a clear
negative relation between population age and the employment shares in Agriculture and
Manufacturing, and a strong positive relation between population age and the share of
employment in the Service sector. These relations are observed for each of our population
age variables.
    Figure A5 and Table A4 corroborate that the same patterns described in Section 2.1 are
also present in the value-added data from the UN. After controlling for income, there is a
clear negative relation between population age and the employment shares in Agriculture
and Manufacturing, and a strong positive relation between population age and the share
of employment in the service sector.

Notes: Each dot represents the point estimate of the age dummies in modified Equation (2)for a particu-
lar decade in the CES data. The modified equation considers housing as a part of service consumption.
The omitted dummy is that of age group 25-30. The bands report the 95% confidence intervals based on
standard errors clustered at the household level.

B.2        Rescaling CES expenditure data to aggregate data
Rescaling procedure This section rescales the expenditure data in the Consumption
Expenditure Survey to match the aggregate Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE)
shares reported by the BEA. In principle, these data need not coincide, since they are col-
lected from different sources that use very different methodologies.8 After concording the
expenditure categories in the CES to PCE items in the BEA data, we compute total expen-
                     j,CES
ditures in the CES, et     , for each category j and year t. We then create the scaling factor
for each category that reflects the discrepancy in the aggregate expenditure between the
                       j     j, BEA     j,CES
CES and the BEA: Xt = et            / et      . Then, we rescale the consumption expenditure of
                                     j, h      j,h,CES    j
each household by this factor: et = et                 × Xt . In this way, the aggregate expenditure
on each category in each year in the CES in the rescaled data match the BEA aggregates
in every category and year.
                                                                                     j, h  j, h   j, h
    Using the rescaled expenditures, we compute the expenditure shares t  et /  j et ,
                                             h              j, h
and the total expenditures by household: et        j et . From this, we compute the new
 h
et /et . These steps give us all the elements of a new dataset, on which we repeat the
household-level estimation in Section 2.2 and the quantitative analysis of Section 3.
    This approach is valid under the assumption that the micro variation across house-
holds in the CES is an accurate reflection of the differences in spending patterns by age
group, and only the aggregate shares are inaccurate.

Replication of main results using rescaled data Figure A13 plots the cumulative log
change in the aggregate expenditure share on services in the BEA PCE data. These data
show a somewhat larger change than the CES, with the expenditure share of services ris-
ing by 24 log points. Figure A14 shows the service expenditure shares for households
of different ages, and the three time periods. The magnitudes of the differences across
households are similar to the baseline analysis. Figure A15 breaks down by income quar-
tile, while Figure A16 reports the age dummies controlling for income, as in equation (2).
The results are quite similar to the baseline.
   8 TheCES collects expenditures from households surveys, while the BEA final sales made by businesses
in a way that is consistent with the consistent with the National Income and Product Accounts.

Notes: Each dot represents the point estimate of the age dummies in Equation (2) for a particular decade
in the CES data. The omitted dummy is that of age group 25-30. The bands report the 95% confidence
intervals based on standard errors clustered at the household level.

    Table A10 reports the differences in consumption expenditures by category for older
households, expressed as a difference relative to the households aged 25-30. While the
ranking of categories according to young-old expenditure share differences is similar, the
BEA-rescaled data show larger absolute differences in Healthcare.
    Moving on to the replication of the results in Section 3, Tables A11-A12 report the
changes in the services expenditure shares and income shares, and the within-between
decomposition. In the BEA-rescaled data, the absolute size of the between effect due to
population aging is slightly larger than in the baseline. However, because the change
in the aggregate service expenditure share is also larger in the BEA, the between effect
represents 14.3% of the total rise in the service expenditure share.

    Tables A13-A14 re-estimate the model parameters on the BEA-rescaled data, while
Figure A18 reports the decomposition of the US structural change. The income effect
plays a higher role compared to the baseline results, but none of the substantive conclu-
sions change when using these data. Population aging still contributes about 5 log points
to the change in the service share since 1982, same as in the baseline. This absolute con-
tribution is smaller as a proportion of the total, since the aggregate service share rises by
more in the BEA than the CES..

B.3   Derivation of equation (10)
We are interested in computing the elasticity of the expenditure share on goods with
                                                        g
                                                   Pt                                                  h to obtain
respect to the relative price of goods             Pts .        To compute this elasticity, solve for et
the expenditure function associated with the utility level V h :
                                                                        g    
                   1    h
                       et             h                           Pt                     1             th
                                             h
                                 = V + t                                          +          -
                       Pts                                        Pts                                  
                                                                                                                              1
                                                                                           g       
                              h                                             th           Pt                    1         th
                             et = Pts                       Vh +                                        +            -            .
                                                                                         Pts                             

By Roy's identity, the demand for goods is:
                                                            g                                      g            h
                                                       Pt             1                         Pt             et
                                             th        Pts             g             th         Pts              g
                                  g, h                               Pt                                        Pt
                                 ct      =                      -1
                                                                              =                  h
                                                                                                                     ,
                                                  h
                                                 et                  1                          et
                                                 Pts                 Pts                        Pts


and therefore the goods spending share is:
                                                                                         g      
                                                                                     Pt
                                                                         th          Pts
                               g, h
                             t           =                                           g                                   .
                                                                     h            Pt                               h
                                                                     t                                  1          t
                                                       Vh       +                 Pts           + -                

                                                                     g
                                                                  Pt
The elasticity of this share with respect to                      Pts       is:

                                                                              g, h
                                                             - t .

Then at the household level, the substitution effect is defined as
                                                                 g, h         ^g - P
                                                                                   ^s
                                              - t                             P t    t .

    As Muellbauer (1975, 1976) shows, this economy admits a representative agent, de-
fined as the household that exhibits the aggregate expenditure shares. In our framework,
                                                  rep                                              1
this is the household with income et  et (µ     ¯ t t t )- . This allows us to define the ag-
gregate substitution effect as just the substitution effect of the representative consumer,
or:
                                            g    ^g - P ^s
                                      - t P        t     t .                            (B.1)
   The log change in the aggregate expenditure share (7) is:




                                                                     61

                  t  - s
                                 ^s
                                 P t -e
                                            ^g - P
                                      ^t +  P    ^s   ^
                                                      ¯t + 
                                                   t +µ

                      82                      t


The first two terms, P   ^s - e
                              ^t +  P^g - P
                                          ^ s can be thought of as capturing the sum total
                          t           t     t
of the income and substitution effects. They can be combined with (B.1) to isolate the two
effects separately, leading to (10).
