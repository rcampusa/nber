       This paper provides a critical survey of the literature on politico-institutional determinants

of the government budget. We organize our discussion around two questions: Why did certain

OECD countries, but not others, accumulate large public debts? Why did these fiscal imbalances

appear in the last twenty years rather than before? We begin by discussing the "tax smoothing"

model and conclude that this approach alone cannot provide complete answers to these questions.

We will then proceed to a discussion of political economy models, which we organize in six

groups: i) Models based upon opportunistic policy makers and naive voters with "fiscal illusion";

ii) Models of intergenerational redistributions; iii) Models of debt as a strategic variable, linking

the current government with the next one; iv) Models of coalition governments; v) Models of

geographically dispersed interests; vi) Models emphasizing the effects of budgetary institutions.

1.   Introduction

     Several, but not all, OECD economies have accumulated large government

debts in the last 20 years. Why      did it happen? Why certain     countries, but

not others, have experienced large budget deficits for several years? What

explains these large cross-country differences?

     Figures   1 and   2 highlight the dimension of this problem. Figure 1

shows the debt to CNP    ratios   in seven countries where this measure sharply

increased in the last twenty years. In three of these countries (Belgium,

Ireland and Italy) this ratio is beyond 100       per   cent. Figure 2. instead,

shows the debt to CP ratio in seven countries where this measure appears

relatively stable, compared to the countries of Figure 1. The United States

is included in Figure 2, but even in this country the increase in the debt

to CNP ratio in the eighties has caused much concern. Figure 3 plots the

debt to GNP ratio of the United States: the downward trend which started at

the end of the second world war, reversed in the last decade.

     The difference between the debt to CNP ratios amongst this group of

countries in the nineties is very large: from more than 100 per cent in

Belgium and Italy, to less than 30 per cent in Australia and Germany, even

leaving aside Japan.

      It is difficult to explain these large cross country differences using

economic arguments alone: these countries are all advanced industrial

democracies, all members of the OECD,      all   at very high levels of per capita

 income.   We believe, instead, that politico-institutional factors are
 crucial for understanding budget deficits in particular, and fiscal policy

in general. While the economies in the OECD group of countries are

relatively similar, their institutions (such as     electoral   laws, party

structure, budget laws, Central sank laws, degree of decentralization,

political stability and social polarization, etc.) are quite different.

     The purpose of this paper is to discuss how the political economy

literature can answer the two crucial questions sketched above:

i)   why do we observe large and persistent deficits in peace time and why

     now?

ii) why do we observe large debts in certain countries and not in others?

Any explanation that can answer the first, but not the second question is

not entirely convincing. For instance, any theory which implies that

democracies are always in fiscal deficits is incomplete if it does not

explain why certain democracies, but not others have experienced fiscal

imbalances.

     The    literature   on the political economy of fiscal policy is very large

and dates back to the nineteen century with the "Italian school" to public

finance. We do not attempt to cover systematically all of this literature;

instead we remain focused on the two questions highlighted above and we

emphasize recent research, for two reasons. First, recent contributions are

generally less well known. Second, in the last five or six years the

political economy literature has shown a renewed impetus: the new

political economy is. in fact, one of the most active fields in economics.

     We begin our discussion with a review of the tax smoothing" theory of

the government budget (Barro (1979), Lucas and Stokey (1983)). This

approach serves as a normative benchmark from which political economy models
                                       .5-


depart: in fact most of the recent political models are "positive"

explanations of observed deviations from tax    smoothing.   Furthermore, the

proponents of this theory (for instance Barro (1985, 1986, 1987)) view it

not only as "normative", but also as "positlve, that is as a description of

actual fiscal policy.

     We will then proceed to a discussion of political economy models, which

we organize in six groups: i) Models based upon opportunistic policy

makers and naïve voters with "fiscal illusion"; ii) Models of

intergenerational redistributions; iii) Models of debt as a strategic

variable, linking the current government with the next one; iv) Models of

distributional conflicts within social groups and/or political parties in

coalition governments; v) Models of geographically dispersed interests;

vi) Models emphasizing the effects of budgetary institutions.

     Our   review   will be critical and opinionated: we do not   believe   that

all of these models have the same explanatory power, and we will make it

clear. After this review we briefly discuss the policy implications of this

research, for institutional reforms.

2.   Optimal BudEet    Policy

     The "tax   smoothing"   theory of the government budget considers a closed

economy without capital in which a representative agent consumes, works and

saves.   The government is a "benevolent social planner" who maximizes the

utility of the representative agent. Both the representative agent and the

government have the same time horizon, which, for simplicity is infinite.

The theory abstracts from intergenerational aspects and from finite terms of

office for governments.
                                     .6-

       The government needs to finance a certain amount of spending in every
period by means of taxes on labor income, which are distortionary sthce they

affect labor supply. The representative agent's utility function depends

upon private consumption and   leisure;   but not on the amount of public good,

which we can, for simplicity, define as      defense   spending".lJ The crucial

result (Earro (1979), Lucas and   Stokey   (1983)) is that the social planner

should keep the tax rate constant. The level of taxes       is   determined by the

intertemporal   budget constraint, which implies that the present value of

spending (which is exogenously given) has to be equal to the present value

of taxes. Therefore, budget deficits and surpluses are       used   as   a   buffer;

deficits occur when spending is   temporarily   high and surpluses when it is

low.

       These results directly follow from the concavity of the individual

utility function. Suppose that government spending has to be Thigh" today

and "low tomorrow. A balanced budget policy implies high tax rates today

and low tax rates tomorrow. The tax smoothing policy, instead, prescribes

constant tax rates, a deficit today and a surplus tomorrow which (in presert

value terms) compensates for today's deficit. The second policy dominates

because the additional tax distortions today more than compensate (in

utility terms) for the welfare gains of the lower tax rates of tomorrow, due

to decreasing marginal utilities.

        This simple principle has far reaching implications for fiscal policy,

which a few examples highlight.

Exanrnle 1: Suppose that government spending is constant, throughout the

planning horizon. The optimal policy prescribes a balanced budget every

period.
Examole 2: Suppose that from period zero to period t government spending is

constant, and   is   expected to be constant forever. In period t an unexpected

'war3J occurs and the war' is known      to   last until period (t+n). The

optimal policy implies a balanced budget until period t, a small permanent

tax increase at t, a deficit between t and (t+n), and a surplus afterward.

Figure 4A illustrates the implications of this policy.

ExaTnole 3: Suppose that at time t government spending unexpectedly

increases forever. The optimal policy implies a balanced budget in every

period with a permanent increase in taxes at time t.

Exarnr'le 4: Suppose that at time t government spending unexpectedly

increases temporarily, then at (t+n) falls permanently below the original

level, so that in present value terms we have a reduction of the total

a.mount of spending. (That is, the permanent reduction after (t+n) more than

compensates the temporary increase). The optimal policy implies a reduction

of taxes at time t, a deficit between t and (t+n), and a surplus after

(t+n). Figure 4B illustrates.

     The principle of tax     smoothing is quite clear: budget deficits and
surpluses are used optimally to minimize the distortionary effects of

taxation, given a certain path of spending.2.J


  J The tern uwar is used as a short-cut for a period of temporary high
level of government spending.
  21 The theory becomes formally more complex if government spending is
sthocastic, but the basic principles of tax smoothing are unchanged (Lucas
and Stokey (1983)).
                                        -8-


     An important extension of this model concerns the cyclical fluctuations

of tax   revenues   due to the business cycle. For essentially the same    reasons
discussed above, the principle of tax     smoothing   implies that tax rates

should be constant over the business cycle; therefore, one should observe

deficits during recessions compensated by surpluses in expansions.

Therefore, the case of example 1 extended to a model with cyclical

fluctuations of output, implies a cyclicallY adjusted, balance budget rule:

the budget should be balanced over the business cycle, but not every fiscal

year. In this model, there is no role for a Keynesian stabilization policy,

since output is not demand-determined. In a model with stabilization

policies, cyclical fluctuations of the budget should be even more

pronounced.

     In summary, the key punch line is that budget deficits should be

observed during "wars" and recessions.

     As a normative theory,    the   tax smoothing model is extremely valuable.

Any positive   model of fiscal policy has to take the tax smoothing as a

benchmark. As a "positive" theory of budget deficits, this model is

insufficient to answer our two questions.

     Barro (1985, 1986, 1987) has tested the tax smoothing model on two

hundred years of American and British data. Figures 3 and 5 show that

Barro's exercise is, up to a point, quite successful. Both the American and

British experiences are, broadly speaking, consistent with the basic

principles of tax smoothing: the debt to CNP ratios increase during wars,

decrease in peacetime and fluctuate with the business cycle. However, one

can identify periods in which fiscal policy appears inconsistent with this
GNP   nominal to debt nominal of ratio

theory. For example, the sharp      increase   in the debt/CNP ratio in the

eighties in the United States ii, at least at first sight, inconsistent with

the tax   smoothing   model.

     To be lure, the tax smoothing theory could explain even this decade

(Barro (1991)). Suppose that in the early eighties it became known          that,
with a temporary increase in military spending, the 'cold war' could have

been won and, by the nineties, military spending could be cut below the

initial level in 1980. This is essentially the example 4 given above: the

optimal policy in this case is to cut taxes and increase military spending

in l980s, run deficits in the eighties, and surpluses in the 1990s.

     This explanation is not entirely convincing because it relies too

heavily on specific assumptions about expectations held in 1980. In some

sense, in    fiscal   policy can be rationalized from a tax smoothing

perspective, if expectations are a 'free' variable. If one takes this

argument to the extreme, it becomes impossible to reject empirically the tax

smoothing model.

     More generally, this model does not provide totally convincing answers

to our two   questions   on OECD economies. First, why now?       The tax smoothing

model can certainly explain why debt/GP ratios started to increase as a

result of the 1973.74 recession. One        can   also argue that policy makers

underestimated the need for a     fiscal   adjustment, since the rates of growth

in the decade that followed (1974-1984) were generally lower than in the

previous decade. However, it is hard to imagine that these miscalculations

alone can explain the skyrocketing debt/CNP ratios observed, for instance,

in belgium, Ireland and Italy.
                                              10 -




     Second, the tax sioothing theory has very         little   to say in response to

the second question: why         in certain   countries the debt/GNP ratios

increased, but not in others? Certainly, different countries ay have been

hit differently by different ihocks and their expectations of future

spending sight have been different, but with shocks and predictability of

revenues and expenditures we find it quite difficult to .xplain the variance

in the data displayed by Figures 1 and 2.

         Therefore, we now move to politico-institutional approaches.

3.       Fiscal illusion

         The "public choice" school which flourished with the work of Buchanan,

Tullok and associates, has made the discussion of excessive deficits and

lack of fiscal discipline in modern democracies one of its central

themes .11

         It   goes beyond the scope (and the space constraints) of the present

paper to provide a detailed analytical survey          of   this literature; instead we

emphasize two       crucial   ideas that underlay much of the work of this school.

i) "Fiscal illusion"

ii) Asyxnetric stabilization policies.

         In a nutshell, the idea of fiscal illusion is that the voters do not

understand the intertemporal budget constraint of the governrent. When

offered a deficit financed expenditure progra., they overestimate the

benefits of current expenditures and underestimate future tax burden.




     J Buchanan (1959) in an iportartt paper acknowledges the intellectual
 connection between the "public choice" school and the Italian school of
 public finance of the nineteen century. On this intellectual connection see
 also Alesina and Tabellini (1992).
                                        - 11   -




Opportunistic   politicians who want to be reelected take advantage of this

confusion by raising spending more than taxes in order to please the

•fiscally illuded" voters. One     of   the most forceful discussion of the

concept of "fiscal illusion" and its crucial rol. for the "public choice"

approach i* in Buchanan and Wagner (l977).,J

    According to this school, Keynesianism has also contributed to

excessive deficits and the abandonment of the "responsible" budget balance

rule. Keynesian stabilization policies become asymmetric: politicians are

always willing to run   deficits   in recessions, but never willing to run

surpluses when recessions are over. The "fiscally illuded" voters do not

punish this behavior.V

     These explanations of budget deficits are not totally convincing for

several theoretical and empirical reasons. First, they crucially rely on

the notion of "fiscal illusion"; without it, we do not have a theory of

persistent deficits. The problem is that this notion goes well beyond the

reasonable idea that it is very difficult for the electorate to understand

the complexity of the government budget. There is a crucial difference

between "errors" and "illusions". If voters make uncorrelated errors, on

average they do not overestimate or underestimate the costs and benefits of

taxes and spending. An "illusion" implies a systematic bias in these

errors. While it is uncontroversial that voters make mistakes and are

imperfectly informed, it is not at all obvious why the mistakes should be



  L' For an early treatment of fiscal illusion see Puviani (1903). See
also Wagner (1976).

Rowley and Tollison (1986).

biased in a certain direction, i.e. underestimation of the tax burden

relative to the benefits of spending.

     Second1 this theory does not adequately answer the question of why

now?'. The deficit problem in the countries of Figure 1 appeared after the

early seventies and in the United States in the early eighties; Rou.bini and

Sachs (1989 a,b) argue that, up to that point, the post war experience of

the OECD countries does not reveal significant deviations from a 'tax

smoothing' policy. So, why does the 'fiscal illusion' create problems

starting in the seventies but not before?J

     Third, how do we explain cross country differences? Are voters more

 illuded" in certain countries than in others? Are politicians more

opportunistic in certain countries than in others?

     Buchanan and Wagner (1977) suggest that different tax structures and

fiscal institutions may lead to more or less fiscal illusion. For instance.

they argue that a more complicated tax structure sends noisier signals to

the tax payers concerning the true level of the tax burden.2J However, we

are not aware of comparative studies of OECD tax structures which

establishes a link between the size of public debt and the amount   of   fiscal

illusion created by different institutions. Moreover, a recent empirical

paper by Peltzman (1991) casts some doubts on the argument that the American

voter rewards administrators who are big spenders.




   1/ Note that Keynesian stabilization policies were more in vogue in the
 Sixties than in the Eighties.
   2.1 Actually, it is not a priori obvious why a noisier signal implies a
 systematic bias downward in the perception of the true tax burden.
                                          13




          An argument somewhat related to the •fiscal illusion" approach is put

forward in the "political business cycle" model by Nordhaus (1975). The

idea is that in election years politicians follow expansionary policies.

The voters reward the politicians without understanding (nor learning from

the past) that pre-electoral expansionary policies will have to be "paid" by

post-electoral recessions. Even though the Nordhaus' model is developed in

terms of an inflation unemployment trade-off, it can be easily applied to

budget deficits.

          The literature on "political business cycles" is large and would

deserve a separate treatment.2.J The point which concerns us is that

political business cycles models are not well equipped to explain long run

trends in the debt to GNP ratios, while they can explain short term

fluctuations of spending and taxes around elections. For instance, Alesina,

Cohen and Roubini (1992, 1993) find electoral cycles on the budget in a

sample of OECD democracies. However, their magnitude is small and cannot

explain the pattern of debt/CNP ratios shown in Figure 1.

4.        Interzenerational redistributions

          The intertexsporal nature of fiscal decisions create links across

generations. However, if each generation cares enough about its offspring,

the finite horizon of each generation is iaterial. In particular, the

"Ricardian equivalence" result (Barro (1974)) implies that, given enough

intergenerational altruism, the choice of how to finance a given level of

spending is irrelevant.2J In particular, the distribution of tax burden




     11    For a recent survey of this literature see Alesina (1993)
     21    Taxes are non distortionary in this model.
                                          14




across generation is not influenced by the size of the debt: changes in

public debt are coicpertsated by changes in private bequests.

        In ode1s where the Ricardian equivalence does not hold, public debt

ay instead generate intergenerational redistributions, if the generation

that is alive today leaves the burden of the debt to future generations.

There is a critical difference between the current generation and future

generations (including children currently alive): only the current one

votes. Thus, in principle, a selfish generation could vote for policies

which shift the burden of taxation to the future. An obvious limit to this

behavior, is given by intergenerational altruism: parents do care about

their children.

        Cukierman and Meltzer (1989) propose an interesting political model of

intergenerational redistributions. Their crucial idea can be summarized

briefly as follows. Suppose that in the current generation we have rich"

and poor parents: The former are individuals who plan to leave positive
bequests to their offsprings and for whom Ricardian equivalence holds:

they are indifferent to the debt policy since they can compensate any change

in current taxes and deficits with adjustments in their bequests.,J The

 poor are individual who would like to leave negative bequests. Since,

however, the latter are not permitted (one cannot borrow from his

offsprings), the upoorN would like to run government deficits: as a result,

they indirectly borrow from future generations. Therefore, one group of

agents (the rich") is indifferent to any debt policy, the other group (the

 poor) favors public debt. Therefore, the social choice is likely to lead

                                          - 15   -




to   debt. Although Cukierman and Meltzer (1989) emphasize a social choice

reached by majority rule, even a benevolent social planner would choose to

issue debt4J

       The idea that public debt redistributes in favor of the current

generation of voters, while future voters have no voice" is, in principle,

quite powerful. However, a closer inspection of it reveals that            it is   not

sufficient   to provide a complete answer to our two      questions.
       First, why now? Why     these   intergenerational redistributions through

the government    budget   have increased so sharply in the last twenty     years    and

not before?j/ Second, why in certain countries and not in Others?             Is
intergenerational altruism stronger in certain countries than in others?

Third, high public debts have often been accumulated and sharply reduced

within the lifetime of one generation (Alesina (1988)).

       Fourth, why future generations (i.e. the children of today) should

honor public debt obligations rather        than default? This point is

particularly relevant for Cukierman and Meltzer (1989), since they assume

that   negative   private bequests are not enforceable, while the public

 negative    bequest (i.e.    public   debt) is enforceable, i.e. the public debt

cannot be defaulted.

       Tabellini (1991) answers    this   last criticism by arguing that

intergenerational redistributions interplay with intragenerational


  LI In fact, one group of agents is indifferent to debt, while the other
benefits from it, since it removes the non negativity constraint on private
bequests.
  21 Note that if growth is increasing, then it might make sense for the
current generation to shift the tax burden to the next one. However, grovth
has been, if anything, decreasing in OECD countries in the last twenty years

redistributions. A choice of default redistributes from debt holders to tax

payers, i.e., from the 'old to the •young and from the 'rich (who hold

the debt) to the poor who do not. A •rich, young taxpayer may dislike

default, although he does not hold any debt, because he cares about the

welfare of his oldu and rich father. Thus, the uantidefault coalition

includes some of the young non debt holders because of intergenerational

altruism. Tabellini (1991) shows that, under certain conditions, the

political equilibrium implies issuing debt, which is then honored.

     The interesting contribution of this paper is its emphasis on

intragenerational distribution. We shall argue below, particularly in

Section 6, that the answers to our two questions have more to do with

irttr.generational conflicts over distribution rather than with

intergenerational conflicts. However, even this paper cannot anwer the two

crucial questions: why now? and why in certain countries only?

5.   Debt as a comnitment: The Strategic Role of Debt

     The stock of debt links past policies to future policies. The current

policy maker can affect the state of the word" inherited by his successors

through his fiscal choices which determine the size of the debt.

     Alesina and Tabellini (1990) argue that a government can take advantage

of this strategic possibility and show that this political game between

governments   in   office at different points in time can lead to an

accumulation of government debt beyond what prescribed by the tax

smoothing" model. The simplest illustration of this idea is as follows:

consider a two     party system   where the two parties have different preferences

over the composition of public spending. For concreteness, one party likes
                                     - 17   -




"defense" the other likes "social welfare". The two       parties   are

ideological, that is they represent the interests of different

constituencies: the parties want to hold office in order to implement the

desired policies.1,J Suppose that the party     that   likes "defense" ii   in
office today, and the result of the next election is uncertain, because of

shocks   to the electorate preferences: a fraction of the electorate

oscillate between the party of "defense' and the party of "social welfare'.

     The "defense" party, in office today, spends on defense and issues debt

so that if the 'social welfare" party will be in office tomorrow, it will

have to service the debt and won't be able to spend much on welfare. By

committing future tax revenues to debt service, today's government can

reduce spending of future governments. In       other words, if the current
government   does not like the spending choices of its opponent, it can

increase the utility of its constituency by issuing debt. This strategic

interaction leads to deficits even though a social planner who maximizes the

weighted average of utilities of the two groups would choose to balance the

budget   in every period.
     The amount of borrowing of today's government is larger:         i) the

larger is the disagreement between the two parties, that is the more

polarized are their preferences on the composition of government spending;

ii) the more unlikely it is that today's government will be reappointed

tomorrow. Therefore, polarization of party positions and government

fragility explain debt accumulation.

Rosenthal (1994) for discussions of voting models with ideological parties.

       Perason and Svensson (1989) provide a   related ode1   in which the two

parties disagree not about the composition of government spending, but its

level: they consider a 'big spender' and a 'low spender'. An important

difference between the two uodels is that while Alesin.a and Tabellini (1990)

predict that every party would issue debt, Persson and Svensson (1989) do

not: only the 'low spender' does. The intuition is that by lowering taxes

and issuing debt, the low spender constrains future spending. On the other

hand, by creating surpluses the high spender encourages future spending.,J

The model by Persson and Svensson (1989) is symmetric: one party creates

deficits, the other one surpluses.

       Tabellini and Alesina (1991) develop a more precise relationship

between deficits and polarization of individual preferences, rather than

party preferences. They consider a model where decisions are taken by

majority rule, and any proposal can be made and voted upon in pairwise

comparisons. Under these conditions, the 'median voter theorem" implies

that the policy adopted is the one most preferred by the median voter. 21

With uncertainty about the preferences of future majorities over the

composition of spending, the current median voter prefer to issue debt to

tilt the future composition of spending in his favor. Tabellini and Alesina

(1990) show that the amount   of   debt issued is increasing in the dispersion




  J Perason and Svensson's results differ according to how 'extreme' the
 twoparties are in their preferences.
  2.1 This model is equivalent to one in which two parties compete for
office and only care about winning. Both parties converge to the policy
preferred by the 'median voter'; this is the 'median voter theorem" (Black
 (1958), Downs (1957)).
                                         19 -




of   voters' preferences: the more concentrated toward the extreme are the

electorate's preferences, the larger is the debt.

       This class of models suffers from the same problem we pointed out in

models of intergenerational redistributions: public debt does not commit

future governments if the latter can default. Alesina and Tabellirti (1989)

address this problem in a model of an     open   economy where the costs of

default are modelled (quite roughly) as     an   output loss. The costs of

default imply a constraint on the current government's ability to issue

debt: at most, today's government can issue an amount        of   debt which makes

the next government indifferent between defaulting and servicing the debt.

This principle is quite general and should not depend on the specific

assumptions concerning the costs of default.

       In all the models reviewed thus far in this section, the strategic role

of debts consist of creating facts for future governments, but the level

of debt does not influence the electoral result. Aghion and Bolton (1990),

Milesi-Ferretti (1993), and Milesi-Ferretti and Spolaore (1994) argue that

incumbent governments can use strategically public debt to influence the

election outcome, by influencing the preferences of the electorate. For

example, suppose that the party of the left is expected to be more prone to

default, since the upper class holds the largest fraction of the public

debt. Aghion and    Bolton    (1990) show that right wing governments would

choose to issue debt in order to make a larger fraction of the population a

debt-holder, As   a result,   the left, that favors default, loses support.

Milesi-Ferretti (1993) shows that the composition of debt between nominal

and indexed can be used strategically along the same lines, if the left wing
                                     - 20


party is more inflationary than the right wing one. Milesi-Ferretti and

Spolaore (1993), (1994) investigate in this context the general problem of

 atrategic inefficiencies, namely when it is in the interest of a rational

incumbent to create inefficiencies on purpose and by doing so increase the

probability of reelection.

     How do these strategic models face the facts? L.et us begin with the

question uwhy flOW?u.   As we have seen, Alesina and Tabellini (1989, 1990)

and Tabellini and Alesina (1990) argue that political polarization and

frequent government changes should be associated with larger debts.J The

seventies and eighties have witnessed much more frequent changes of

governments from left to right and vice versa than the previous two decades.

In the period 1960 to 1972 (up to the first oil shock), in the OECD

economies one observes a 'significant" government change on average about

once every 10.5 years; from 1973 to 1987 about every 6.5 years. L/ Thus,

in the post 1972 period governments have been less certain of their

reappointment than the previous decades.

     The OECD economies have also become much less stable in the post 1973

period: political and economic instability are likely to be strictly


  LI The frequency of government changes can be taken as a very rough
indicator of uncertainty. Countries and time periods in which the same
government is repeatedly and routinely reappointed are probably cases of
relative stable and certain preferences relative to cases of frequent
changes.
  21 A government change is de.fined as'significant' when it involves a
change in the party in office or a substantial change in the coalition (for
fnstance the enlargement of a centrist coalition to a socialist party with
non-trivial size). A minor coalition reshuffling, such as those often
occurring in three-four or five party center left coalition in Italy is not
considered significant. Data are from Alt (1985) and Alesina and Roubini
(1992) who also provide more precise definitions, and the list of 18 OECD
economies included in the sample used for these calculations.
                                        - 21


interconnected and feed upon each other (Alesina, Ozier, Roubini and Swagel

(1992) and Alesina and Perotti (1993)).

      Why   public   debts accumulate in certain countries and not in others?

The theory implies that high debt countries should have more polarized

political parties and a more polarized electorate with strong 'extreme

groups. Alestha (1989) constructs *       very   rough index of political stability

for OECD countries for the seventies and eighties based on several politico

institutional characteristics.1/ The index is increasing in instability,

and the average value for the countries in Figure 1 is 3.3; the average

value for countries in Figure 2 is -0.1. This difference is large since the

highest value of the index for the countries included in the two figures is

6 and the lowest is -3.2]

      The models reviewed in this section have also been used to explain

several specific episodes of debt accumulation. For instance. Alesina and

Tabellini (1990) interpret Reagan's deficits as a manoeuvre to constrain

future Democratic administrations' spending on social welfare.J

  It is quite certain that President Clinton's budget would have been more

generous on domestic spending, if he had to face a lower interest bill.



  ),,J These are: whether or not the country has experienced one transition
from dictatorship to democracy; whether in the country one find significant
extreme right wing parties and communist parties; a measure of frequency of
government changes; whether or not the country has linguistic or regional
conflicts; whether elections can be called by the executive, or their timing
is fixed by the constitution; the average size of coalitions.
  V    Ireland is not included in these calculations because the instability
index is not available for this country.
       On January 25, 1987 in an op-ed article of the New York Times one
could read that Nthe deficit is not a despised orphan. It is President
Reagan's child, and secretly he loves it, as David Stockman has explained:
the deficit rigorously discourages any idea of spending another dime on
social we1fare.
                                       - 22   -




Fersson and Svensson (1989) have argued that their model explain the

Reagan's   deficits   and the Swedish experience of the conservative government

of 1976.82. Aghion and golton's (1990) model can also      explain   episodes   of
deficits under conservative governments.

     In auary, the class of models reviewed in this section suggests a

relationship between the nature of party competition, polarization of

preferences and electoral uncertainty. These are variables which can be

measured and do vary across countries and time periods. Therefore, these

models are testable and, in principle, can provide answers to the question

of "why now?" and "why in certain countries?". However, the empirical work

based upon these models has, thus far, been sketchy, and at most, suggestive

rather than conclusive. Nevertheless, these fragments of evidence suggest

that these models may in fact go in the right direction.

6.   Distributional conflicts and wars of attrition

     The models discussed in the previous section emphasize a strategic

interaction between political parties in office at different points in time.

In this section we review models in which deficits are the results of

strategic conflicts between political parties or social groups that have an

influence at the same time on policy decisions. For instance, while before

we focused on the conflict and the ideological polarization between parties

which alternate in single-party governments, here we are concerned with the

polarization of parties members of the same coalition government.

     Alesina and Drazen (1991) propose a war of attrition model of delayed

fiscal adjustments in which different socio-political groups fight about the

distribution of the fiscal burden. The model assumes that a permanent shock
                                         - 23


perturbs the government budget, so that at the existing tax rates, a deficit

appears and the debt begins to accumulate. A social planner would react

immediately to this shock and raise tax revenues in order to keep a        balanced
budget.].J The point of the model ii      that   the distributional struggle

amongst social groups delays the adoption of the efficient policy of

balancing the budget.

       More specifically, when the deficit appears, it is financed partly by

external debt accumulation          and partly by some form of highly

distortionary taxation, for instance seignorage. A stabilization is defined

as a change of policy which stabilizes the debt/CNP ratio and substitutes

the pre-stabilization taxation with a less distortionary regular form of

taxation.

       Suppose that two   groups   have to decide on how to share the fiscal

burden of the stabilization.j The longer they wait the higher are the

costs, for two reasons: the pre-stabilization fiscal distortions persist

over time; the debt accumulates, so that higher taxes are needed to service

it after the stabilization. An immediate agreement on how to share the

fiscal burden of stabilization makes both groups better off relative to the

same agreement reached with delay. However, rational delays occurs under

two   conditions:   1) the proposed stabilization is aunequitablew, namely one

group has to bear a disproportionate share of the fiscal burden; 2) the two




  jj  For simplicity and clarity of exposition, this model implies that the
optimal tax smoothing policy implies a permanently balanced budget.
  21 With some modification in the notation and in the model construction,
the analysis can be applied to the case of domestic debt.
  J   With some complications, the model can be extended to more than two
groups.
                                   - 24   -




groups are not informed about the other's strengths; that is, each group
does not know how costly it is for the other to postpone the

stab ilization .2/

     These costs can be interpreted in two non mutually exclusive ways: one

emphasizes the economic costs of the pre-stabilization distortions, the

other emphasizes the political costs of preventing the other group from

imposing an undesirable fiscal plan. Political costs include lobbying cost,

or costs of direct political action.

     The looser' is the group which will have to pay the larger share of

the fiscal stabilization; the Mwinner is the other one. Generally, both

groups will not accept to be the looser immediately: they hope that the

other group will concede first. The optimal concession time is determined

by equating the marginal cost of waiting with the marginal benefit of

waiting. The marginal cost is the utility cost of living another instant in

the unstable and distorted economy. The marginal benefit is given by the

conditional probability that the other group will concede in the next

instant multiplied by the difference in utility between being the winner"

and the looseru, i.e. between paying the lower or the higher share of the

fiscal burden.

           The more unequal is the distribution of the stabilization coSts,

the later is the expected time of stabilization. The intuition is clear:

the more unequal is the burden of stabilization. ceteris Daribus the higher

are the benefits from holding in". Furthermore, the lower are the costs of


   .J The original model of war of attrition in a biological context was
 formalized by Riley (1980). Bliss and Nalebuff (1984) further developed it.
 For applications of this model to labor strike see Kerman and Wilson (1989).
                                     - 25


living in an unstable economy. ceteris paribus, the later is the

stabilization. This result has two   interpretations:   first it suggests that

.conomic mechanisms, such as indexation clauses, which reduce the cost of

macroeconomic instability tend to postpone adjustments; second, political

mechanisms which make it easier and less costly to exercise a veto power and

"block" proposed stabilization plans, delay stabilization.

     Drazen and Crilli (1993) extend this model by showing that an economic

crisis may anticipate the stabilization by forcing a "solution" to the war

of attrition. The idea is that an increase in the pre-stabilization costs

due to a crisis makes it so costly to continue the war of attrition, that

one group concedes. Thus, an economic emergency can, in the end, be

socially beneficial: on the one hand it causes an economic crisis with its

costs; on the other hand it shortens the delay in the adoption of the

necessary stabilization.L/

     Spolaore (1993) applies war of attrition models to coalition

governments. He considers fiscal shocks which create budget deficits. Given

these shocks, a social planner would follow the optimal policy which is

modelled as a function of the costs of adjustment and the persistence of the

shock. Spolaore (1993) takes this optimal policy as a benchmark and shows

that a coalition government delays adjustment, while a single party

government reacts "tOo much", relative to what a social planner would do.

This result arises because different parties represent the interest of

different constituencies and each of them would like to be spared from


  21 Drazen and Grilli (1993) note that Hirschman (1985) made a similar
argument informally, but their paper is the first rigorous formalization of
these ideas.
                                      - 26   -




taxes.     A coalition government delays the fiscal adjustment until the veto

power game amongst coalition members is resolved;J as     a result,   a

coalition government does not adjust as often and as much   as   a social

planner would do. On the contrary, a single party government overreact to

the fiscal shock, since it underestimates the social costs of adjustment.

In fact, its constituency can be protectedN so that it does not bear any

cost. Spolaore (1993) also shows that the inefficiencies in policy

reactions in a coalition government is increasing in the number of coalition

members.

     In summary, this line of research relates the accumulation of public

debt to the fragmentation of governments and to the degree of political

cohesion. Lass cohesion implies more difficulties in achieving an agreement

on an equitable distribution of the costs of fiscal adjustment. and,

therefore, to longer delays in stopping the growth of debt. Furthermore,

political institutions and electoral laws leading to the formation of

coalition governments, should be associated with higher deficits than single

party governments.

     How do these models answer our two questions? First, the question of

why now? War of attrition models explain why countries delay adjustments to

shock, and, therefore, can explain the procrastination of fiscal

adjustments. However, these models do not explain the cause of the original

shock which perturbated he fiscal balance. Roubini and Sachs (1989 a,b)

show that until the first oil shock, by and large the OECD economies had



  21 Unlike Alesina and Drazen (1991) Spo].aore (1993) does not rely on
asymmetric information but on randomization to obtain delays.
                                        27 -




followed   fiscal policies empirically undistinguishable from the ta.x

smoothing" model. After the oil shock, certain countries let their

government debt explode by delaying the adjustment. Von Ragen (1992) also

notes that the cross country variability of fiscal performance greatly

increased after the first oil shock, relative to the previous decade. Thus,

these results suggest that different institutions have to explain different

responses to a common shock, rather than the shock itself.

     Why   certain   countries and not others? Weak coalition governments have

typically postponed fiscal adjustments and have accumulated debt. Roubini

and Sachs (1989 a,b) construct a political indicator which assume increasing

values as government fragmentation increases. They show that, after

controlling for several economic determinants of budget deficits, (suggested

by the "tax smoothing" model) their political variable is highly

significant: the higher the number of parties in a coalition government,

the higher is public debt.

     Crilli, Masciandaro and Tabellini (1991) also show that budget deficits

are correlated with government durability: longer lived governments have

smaller deficits. This finding is consistent with the previous one, since

coalition governments typically have shorter lives than single party

governments.

     The nature of party systems and of government structure depends on the

electoral system. For instance, proportional, representational electoral

systems typically create multiparty systems and coalition governments; on

the contrary, majoritarian systems lead to single party governments, as

shown in Figure 6. Furthermore, government durability is lower in

representational systems characterized by coalition governments (Figure 7).

Therefore, one can suggest a relationship between the type of electoral

system and the level of debt. This observation certainly fits the cases of

Belgium, Ireland, and Italy, the three countries with the largest debt/CNP

ratios in the OECD.

      The American version of coalition government is the relatively common

situation of divided government, i.e. the case in which the same party does

not hold the Presidency and a majority in the House and in the Senate 4J

      A widely held view, both in the popular press and in academia

is that   divided   government in the Eighties was responsible for the build up

of American deficits.V The problem with this argument is that divided

government is not a novelty of the Eighties: it ocurred often in the past.

On the other hand, the Eighties are a rather unique example of peacetime,

non recessionary build up of debt. In other words, why divided government

in previous decades did not create the same deficits as in the Eighties?J

Furthermore, the root of the American deficits are in the 1981/1982 fiscal

policies: these were the two years with the most unified Republican control

of the decade.




  11 For a more extended discussion of similarities and differences between
divided government in the United States and coalition governments in Europe
see Alesina and Rosenthal (1994), Chapter 10, Fiorina (1991) and Layer and
Shepsle (1991).

  J   Mc Cubbins (1991) argues that what matters is not the division between
the President of one party and a Congress with a majority of the other
party, but division between Senate and House. The latter case, which
occurred from 1.981 to 1986 is much less common. However, Mc Cubbins'
argument still relies essentially on one observation.

       Poterba (1992) and Alt and Lowry (1992) present evidence on the effect
of divided government by looking at Arerican states. They consider the

policy response to fiscal shocks and find that the adjustment is slower in

states   with   divided control than in states with unified control. Their

results are remarkably similar to those by Roubini and Sachs (1989 sb) on

OECD economies: in both cases coalition or divided government do not create

budget deficits, but procrastinate the adjustment to shocks.

       In summary, the models surveyed   in   the section are quite successful at

establishing links between institutional features and party structure and

budget deficits. The empirical evidence is quite encouraging for these

models, perhaps more than for the somewhat related approach of the previous

section. Finally, note that institutions such as electoral systems, are

themselves endogenous. They do change overtime, although infrequentlyiJ.

and are chosen as     a result of socio.political conflicts of interests. Thus,
the researcher faces a challenging questions: to what extent can we take

institutions as exogenous in explaining deficit biases?

7.     Ceorathica11v disDersed interests

       A large literature in political science has studied how the

organization of legislatures lead to inefficient fiscal decisions.2J

Although this research focuses on the United States Congress. its

implications are broader: for the purpose of our paper, we focus on models




     J New Zealand and Italy are, for instance, in the midst of sweeping
electoral reforms.
  21 See for instance Ferejohn (1974), Fiorina and Noll (1978), Shepsle and
Weingast (1981), Weingast, Shepsie and .Johnsen (1981), Baron and Ferejohn
(1989).
                                          30 -




where the   geographic   base of metbers of congress leads to "excessive"


spending.

      Weingast, Shepsle and Johnsen (1981) argue that representatives with a

geographically based constituency overestimate the benefits           of public

projects in their districts, relative to the costs of financing it, which

ar. distributed nationwide. The aggregate effect of rational

representatives facing these incentives is an oversupply of geographically

based public projects. Specifically, the size of the budget is larger with

N legislators elected in N districts than with a single legislator elected

nationwide and the budget size is increasing in N, the number           of districts.
The key intuition is that the voters of district I receive benefits equal to

E for     a project but have to pay 1/N   of   the total costs, if taxes are

equally distributed amongst districts. A geographically based

representative does not internalize the effect of its proposals on the tax

burden of the nation.

     These    models typically explain the size of budget, in particular of

expenditures on "pork barrel" projects: therefore they do not directly

address the problem of budget deficits. However, these models can

potentially be very useful for our questions as well, if they are extended

 in two   ioportant   directions.

      First, they should become dynamic,         in   order to be capable of addressing

 not only the issue of the j.j of the budget, but also its balance.               Is it

 the case that geographically elected representatives have an incentive to

 run deficits relative to representatives elected nationwide?            The second

 issue to be reconsidered is that the share of OECD country budgets devoted
                                     31




to pork barrel projects is shrinking, relative to the share of transfer

programs and entitlements. To be sure, some of the transfer programs have

geographically based constituencies. For example, Florida has a   high
concentration of old age pensions; invalidity pensions have been used as a

transfer system from Northern to Southern Italy.j/ These are cases in

which income redistribution and geographical redistribution become highly

interconnected. However, strictly defined pork barrel projects are only a

relatively small part of current budget problems in OECD economies. It is

hard to imagine that substantial fiscal adjustment programs in OECD

economies can take place without affecting transfer and social security

programs. Models of geographically dispersed interests are not well equipped

at handling these issues.

     The crucial insight of this literature is, nevertheless, important:

the geographical distribution of costs, benefits, and decision power can

make much difference for the aggregate budget. In particular, one can think

of an analogy between some issues of fiscal federalism and the model by

Weingast, Shepsle and Johnsen (1981). Suppose that spending decisions are

taken at the local level, and are financed with transfers by the national

government that raises taxes. The same mechanism operates in this case, as

for the case of geographically elected representatives. The local

authorities do not fully internalize the effects of their spending decisions

over the overall budget for the same reasons why the geographically elected

representatives don't. Clearly, the incentives for the local authorities


  ),j Emerson (1988) reports that in 1984 the ratio of invalidity pensions
over old age pensions in Italy was about 40 per cent and it was 250% in
Southern Italy and 669% in the Sicilian province of Enna.
                                            32




are different if they are responsible for both taxing i spening

decisions.),!

       The di.cussion of federalis has           recently   picked up ooentu,   both   in


the United States and Europe.2.J Fiscal arrangerents linking the center to

local authorities vary greatly across countries. Furtherore, Hughes and

Smith (1991) suggest that from 1975 to the late eighties on can detect an

increase in the fiscal responsibilities of local authorities. Whether or

not this cross country        and temporal variation of federalist arrangeoents can
explain budget deficits is still an open question.V This is an important

topic for future research.

B.        Budetar'q institutions

          Budgetary institutions are all the rules and regulations according to

which budgets are drafted, approved and           ipletented.     These rules greatly

vary      across   countries, thus they can potentially explain cross country

variations         in deficits and debts.

          Budget institutions have an effect on fiscal policy outcomes if two

conditions         hold.

 i)       Budget institutions are more difficult      to change (de iure or ude

factow) than the budget law itself.

 ii) Budget institutions influence the final vote and the ip1eentation of

 the budget.


   ),j Different federalist arrangements can have important implication for
 fiscal redistributions (Perotti (1992)) and fiscal stabilizations (Perason
 and Tabellini (1993)).
   Z/ See the recent survey by Hughes and Smith (c9l) and the references
 cited therein.
      JFor a fragment of evidence along this line see the comments by
 Tabellini on Hughes and Smith (1991).
                                    - 33


     Both conditions are met in the world, at least up to a point. Budget

institutions change rater infrequently; even though they £ifl be changed when

they do not satisfy the needs of a community. L/     The crucial issue,

however, is that budget institutions cannot be changed as easily and

frequently as the budget itself: otherwise they would be totally

ineffective.

      Whether or not institutions actually affect the final outcome of a

legislative vote (and its implementation) is a major outcome in the research

agenda of modern political science. Shepsie (1979 a,b) shows that the

 structure" imposed by certain procedural institutions helps solving the

Arrow's impossibility problem in legislatures.2J For instance, a key

issue is who holds the agenda setting power and what types of a.mendiLents are

adzissible in the legislature floor: generally speaking, the theory

suggests that procedural rules which limit universalism and reciprocity are

conducive to fiscal restraint. "Universalism" is defined as the property of

a budget to include something for everybody. Reciprocity" is an agreement

not to oppose another representative's proposal in exchange for the sane

favor in return. As for the case of the models of the previous section,

research in this area has an American focus, and virtually all the formal

models are more directly applicable to explain the         of the budget.




  11 The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 in the United States is an
exaple of a major reform of budgetary institutions.
  21 For more specific application to the budget process see Ferejohn and
Krehbiel (1987), Ferejohn, Fiorina and MeKelvey (1987), Baron and Ferejohn
(1989), Baron (1991), and Weingast and Marshall (1985).

rather   than the intertemporal allocation of spending and taxation (i.e. the

budget balance) .1.1

     A recent paper by Von Hagen (1992) uses this approach to answer our two

questions   concerning budget deficits, by focusing on the budgetary

institutions of the twelve members of the EEC. He tests an interesting

ustructural hypothesis, namely that: 'budget procedures lead to greater

fiscal discipline if they give strong prerogative to the prime minister or

the finance minister, if they limit universalism, reciprocity and

parliamentary amendments and facilitate strict execution of the budget law".

     Von Hagen consturcts indices which summarize several budgetary

institutions. The most comprehensive index used in this study includes

classifications of countries as a function of: i) the strength of the

position of the prime minister (or finance minister) in intra-government

negotiations; ii) the limits (or lack thereof) to parliamentary amendments;

iii) the type of parliamentary votes (item by item, global etc.); iv) the

timing of parliamentary votes; v) the degree of transparency of the budget;

vi) the amount of flexibility in the implementation process.

     The classification of countries according to these criteria inevitably

requires some judgment calls, particularly since the author attempts to

capture "de facto" procedures, beyond the letter of the law. Nevertheless,

the strong support which be finds for the structural hypothesis" is

convincing. In particular, he finds that several related indices of

budgetary institution are significant explanatory variable for cross country



  2,1 For a more comparative approach see Wildavsky (1986) and the reference
cited therein.
                                       35 -




differences   in the debt/CNP ratios and budget deficits in the eighties in

the EEC; the •structural hypothesis' receives rather strong support.

     Von Hagen's institutional data are quite rich and worth further

exploration. For instance, these aggregate indices, 'squeeze In' many

institutional differences. A comparison between two fiscally responsible'

countries, France and C.rmany, illustrates the point. France has a very

high indexj/ due to its voting rules and the role of the Prime Minister.

Germany's voting rules are actually amongst the least compatible (at least

on paper) with fiscal responsibility, however Germany also has a high index

because of budget transparency and inflexibility in the implementation.2/

That is, one find much variability of institutional arrangements, even

within countries with the same aggregate index.J

    American states are a second example on which one can test the idea

that 'budgetary institutions matter". American states have a variety of

different arrangements concerning their budget; in addition to different

procedures for budget formation, some states have "hard" budget balance

rules, other have 'soft" budget balance rules and a few have no such rules.

It is commonly argued that state legislatures find more or less 'creative"

ways to circumvent these rulesJ; however, three recent quantitative


  L/ The indices are defined as increasing with the structural hypothesis.
  21 In fact, in variations of the basic index in which these two
characteristics are not considered, Germany's rank drops a few position.
  J Von Hagen (1992) also tests less successfully another hypothesis,
focusing on the existence of long term (i.e. multi year) budget plans. This
hypothesis is harder to test and the proposed indices probably relies too
heavily on the existence of long term budget proposals which are not truly
binding. See Tanzi (1991) for a discussion of the perverse effect of non
credible long term budget plans.
  J For a recent discussion of this point see Alt and Lowry (1992) and
Poterba (1992).
                                         36




empirical papers make the point that budget rules do make some difference,

even though, probably not as much as    the   letter of the law   would   imply.

Von Ragen (1991), concludes that budget rules have some affect on the level

and composition of state debts.      Alt and Lowry (1992) and Poterba (1992)

argue that Anerican states with Tharder" balance budget rules react more

promptly and more energetically to negative revenue shocks or positive

spending shocks.

     In sunmary,   the   crucial message of this research is that budgetary

institutions influence fiscal policies. Does this insight contribute to

answer our two questions? Institutional differences can certainly

contribute to answer our second question: why in certain countries and not

in others?

     As for the first question, (why now?) there might be more of a problem.

As Von Hagen (1992) notes, budgetary institutions are relatively stable over

time. Thus, how can we explain the sharp increase in the cross country

variance of fiscal performances in the seventies and eighties, relative to

the two previous decades?

     One possible answer is to consider the effect of economic shocks in

different budgetary institutions, along the same line of "var of attrition

models. Perhaps the consequences of budgetary institutions not adequate to

enforce fiscal responsibility have a particularly negative impact in periods

in which fiscal adjustments are needed. In our view, this is a very

promising avenue to explore further with careful comparative empirical work.

9.      Policy imDlieations

        The policy implications of the political economy literature are

particularly relevant for institutional reforms. If policy outcomes are

influenced by politico-institutional variables1 then in order to improve

policy making one has to intervene at           the   institutional level. Several OECD

economies are struggling with fiscal adjustment programs and fiscal

reforms. Former planned economies are in the process of building new fiscal

institutions, and      the   policy advisor has to deal with institutional

questions .J.J

        One can think of two types of institutional reforms: 1) changes in the

legislation directly regulating the budget formation; 2) more general

institutional reforms, such as        changes    in electoral laws.

        8.1 The budget formation

               1) 3alanced budget

        One of the most commonly advocated reforms of the budget process is the

introduction of a balanced budget law, or more generally, of regulations

which    limit   the discretionality of each government in running       deficits.V
The "tax smoothing" theory implies that, in general, a balanced budget

policy is suboptimal. However, we have also argued that this theory is not

a    completely accurate description of actual fiscal policies. Thus, two

questions arise:

a)    is a   sub-optimal budget balanced policy superior or inferior to the sub-

optimal policy obtained without the balanced budget law?



     21 On this point see Tanzi (1992, l993b).
     21 For instance, Euchanan and Wagner (1977).
                                           - 38



b) How can one make a      balanced   budget law enforceable?

The first question is difficult, since it involves comparisons of •second

best" outcomes. Generally, the larger are the "politically induced"

inefficiencies, the more attractive is the option of a balanced budget law.

For instance, if it is true that proportional electoral systems with

coalition governments are more likely to procrastinate budget adjustments,

than a balanced budget law is particularly appropriate in these systems.

       The costs of a balanced budget law are the loss of fiscal

stabilizations over the cycle, and the loss of flexibility in reacting to

shocks on expenditure or revenues. In theory, these problems could be

overcome by a "contingent" rule; for instance a "cyclically adjusted"

balance budget rule. However, the more complicated is the rule,    the harder
it is to enforce it.J

       Balanced budget laws may also be more or less desirable at different

"levels" of the public administrations. For instance, most American states

have some form of a balanced budget rule, and, as argued above, these rules

are somewhat effective in enforcing fiscal adjustments (Poterba (1992)). On

the contrary, no such rules exist at the Federal level. Restrictions on

public borrowing probably came about as a response to the 19th century

defaults (Ratchford (1941)); however, this asymmetry between the state level

and the Federal level can be rationalized by a higher value of discretion at

the federal level: expenditures and revenue at the state level may be

easier to predict than those of the federal level. On the other hand, it is




  L'    For   a   discussion   of this point see Tanzi (1993a).
                                               39 -




an open question at what level one should conduct stabilization

policies .1/

      The question of enforceability of a balanced budget law is also quite

cowplex. Any law can be changed by a           sovereign,   even though certain laws

are more difficult to change than others. For instance, a constitutional

amendment   is    typically the most difficult law to change, since it requires

the most complex procedures and the highest qualified majorities in the

legislature. This is why the most enthusiastic supporters of balanced

budget rules favor this institutional solution.

      The procedural choice runs        into   the usual trade-off between commitments

and flexibility: by making it very difficult to change the law, one makes

commitments more credible, but reduces the possibility of reacting to

unforeseen shocks. Tabellini and Alesina (1990) show that in their model

even though behind a veil of ignorance" everybody would favor a balanced

budget rule, the same rule is not enforceable if it can be changed by simple

majority rule, after the "veil of ignorance" is removed. The idea is that

when a certain government, expression of a certain majority, is in office,

it has an incentive to break the balanced budget rule and impose it on

future governments. By doing so, the current government achieves the

flexibility needed to favor its constituency and leaves the costs of debt

    the constraint of the balance budget law on its successor. Thus, if the

balance budget rule can be broken by simple majority and the government

commands this majority, than the rule is not credible.




 1/   On   this   point   see   Persson and Tabellini (1993).
                                         40




      By increasing the size   of   the majority needed to break the rule,     one

gains credibility but loses flexibility. A challenging normative problem is

to   decide what ii the optimal qualified majority that has to be required to

abandon the balanced budget. This majority requirement should be increasing

with the politico-economic forces which increase      the   incentive to run

deficits. (as discussed in the previous sections), increasing in the

predictability of expenditures and revenues,      and decreasing in the benefits

of fiscal stabilizations.

            ii) Procedures for budeet avDroval

       War of attrition models suggest that by limiting the uveto powerN of

players involved in the budget fornation. one      reduces   delays in fiscal

adjustments and enforces fiscal responsibility.

       A first war of attrition" may be played within the government a.mongst

spending ministers at the stage of budget formulation; this is most likely

to happen in coalition governments where different ministers belong to

different parties, but it may also happen otherwise. Spending ministers are

more likely to be sensitive to special interest pressures than the        Prime

Minister or the Finance Minister: the latter are (or should be) more

sensitive to the overall size and financing of the budget. The effect of

intergovernmental wars of attrition are reduced if either the Prime

Minister, (or the Finance Minister has a "strong" role in the budget

formation process. Procedures which make a Prime Minister "strong" are

those that limit the "veto power" of spending ministers.

       A second stage where "wars of attrition" may take place and special

interests can endanger fiscal responsibility is in the process of
                                               41



legislative       approval of the budget. Procedures that: i) limit the type               of
sdissible aisendents; ii) impose first a              vote   on the size of total

spending and .th a        discussion   of specific items, are more likely to limit

deficits.L/ By voting first on the overall size of the budget and                 the
balance,       one avoids the likely outcome of a reconciliation of conflicting

spending       needs with an increase in the deficits.



                iii) Central Bank indet'endence

        Several    authors have highlighted     the   superior achievements of

independent       Central Banks on   the inflation front.j/ Independent Central

Banks    ay also enforce     fiscal responsibility by limiting the governments'

access to seignorage as a       core or less hidden" tax.J
        With an independent Central Bank, deficits have           to be bond   financed;
this    leads to an increase in      the   debt/CNP ratio and, possibly, higher

interest       rates. In other words,      the government faces a "harder" budget

constrain.

        8.2.    Electoral reforms

        New Zealand is moving toward a more proportional electoral system,

while Italy is moving in the opposite direction. Eastern European countries

and former soviet republics had to choose (or are in the process of

choosing)       electoral laws. These decisions may have important fiscal




  L/ The empirical results of Von Hagen (1992) bring support to these
views. For more theoretical discussion see, however, Ferejohn and Krehbiel
(1987).
  21     For instance, Alesina and Summers (1993), Cukierman, Webb and Neyapti
           and Crilli, Masciandaro and Tabellini (1991).

consequences, and in some    cases   (e.e. Italy) fiscal imbalances are one of

the motivations that lead to widespread dissatisfaction with the existing

law.

       As almost always in economics one faces a trade-off. Proportional

electoral systems lead to coalitions and fiscal deadlocks which delays

stabilizations. Majoritarian systems, by concentrating power in a single

party, avoid deadlocks but may create excessive variability of policies,

since the party in office is not "moderated" by coalition partners .1/

       How should one choose on this trade-off? The literature reviewed here

provides some partial answers to this question. For instance, countries

with a very polarized distribution of preferences, (perhaps related to

income distribution) may need more proportional electoral systems to avoid

extreme policy variability, due to changes in governments with "extreme"

positions. On the other hand, in periods of economic crisis or transition

coalition governments may be an obstacle to the much needed swift policy

action.

       Clearly, electoral laws cannot be changed very frequently, thus

countries have to make a relatively "permanent" choice over this trade off.

Generally speaking, choices towards the "extremes" of this trade off are

unlikely to be optimal. As for the budget deficits, a mistake towards

excessive   proportional   representation is likely to have more negative

consequences that the opposite mistake. This is       particularly   true if
