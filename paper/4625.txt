                                            ABSTRACT

       We provide a unified discussion of the relations among flows of workers, changes in
employment and changes in the number of jobs at the level of the firm. Using the only available
set of data (a nationally representative sample of Dutch firms in 1988 and 1990) we discover
that: 1) Nearly half of all hiring is by firms where employment is not growing; 2) Over half of
all firing is by firms that are not contracting; 3) Most firing is by finns that are also bin    4)
flows of workers within firms are small compared to flows into and out of firms; and 5)
Accounting for simultaneous creation and destruction of jobs within firms adds roughly 15
percent to estimates of economywide job creation and destruction. The results imply that
macroeconomk fluctuations can have substantial effects beyond those indicated by net
employment changes at the firm level, and that studies of dynamic factor demand must account
for variations in gross flows of workers.

I. Introduction

         Various terms have been used to describe, summarize and analyze the

macroeconomic dynamics of labor demand,                      including     "job

creation/destruction," "employment growth/decline," and "hiring/firing.' Our

purposes here are to sort out differences in these terms and examine how the

concepts should be viewed from the perspective of the individual firm. The

discussion alone should demonstrate that great care is required in using the

various terms, as they mean very different things and have different

implications for analyzing labor—market adjustment and the impact of policies.

We demonstrate some aspects of their importance using the first available data

set that allows comprehensive measures of job creation and types of labor

mobility.

II. Alternative Concepts of Demand Dynamics

         Underlying the entire discussion are two fundamental issues: 1) What

patterns of changes in staffing at the firm level might be generating
macroeconomic fluctuations? and 2) What microeconomic forces produce

these changes? The latter issue has been analyzed in the considerable literature

dealing with the nature and size of adjustment costs. Substantial interesting

work has recently gone beyond standard models of convex adjustment costs to

analyze the possible existence of lumpy costs at the micro level (Hamermesh,

1989; Caballero et a!, 1993) and their usefulness in explaining aggregate



                                       1
fluctuations (Caballero and Engel, 1993). Other research has attempted to

infer what generates these costs (Hamermesh, 1993b).

         We do not consider the second issue. Our interest here is not in

explanation but rather in illustrating and clari'ing what occurs at the

finn/establishment level. Are job creation, hiring and employment growth

interchangeable terms for the same phenomenon? Are job destruction, firing

and employment decline interchangeable? What do we mean by job creation?

         The terms job creation and destruction have been applied recently in

the macroeconomic literature (e.g., Davis and Haltiwanger, 1990). Though

it does not use the term, what this literature really discusses are simultaneous

positive and negative firm— (or plant—) level net employment changes.

Substantial empirical work (e.g., Leonard, 1987; Dunne et al, 1989; and

Davis and Haltiwanger, 1992) demonstrates that employment falls (rises) in a

large fraction of the micro units within a narrowly defined aggregate where the

net change in employment is positive (negative).1          That interfirm (or

interplant) reallocation is important within an aggregate is useful for

demonstrating how changes in the dispersion of demand shocks can affect

macroeconomic adjustment.

        Even assuming that labor is homogeneous, concentration on net

employment changes ignores much of the potentially important adjustment


             1See Hamermesh (l993a, Chapter 4) for a summary and
        critical discussion of this literature.

                                      2
costs that might be generated by demand shocks. One can easily imagine a

firm where there is no net change in employment over some period, but

where, for example, all five assistant professors of economics quit and five

new ones are hired to replace them. Net employment change is zero; the

measured interfirm reallocation is zero; and no jobs are destroyed or created.

Yet clearly the costs to the firm are nonzero; and the costs to society are also

much different from those that would have arisen if no quits had occurred.

The net change in employment in an establishment can be decomposed in great

detail as:

(l)ENHi-R+TI—Q—F—D—TO,
where NH are new hires; R are rehires; TI are transfers from other plants in

the firm; Q   are   quits; F are fires (layoffs in American terminology); D are

discharges for cause; and TO are transfers to other plants in the firm.2

         Some attention has been given to (1). Burgess and Nickell (1990)

examined aggregates of accessions (the first three terms) and separations (the

last four terms); and Hamermesh (1993b) considered the pattern of hires, quits

and net employment change for several establishments. We do not know,

though, the extent to which establishments or firms can be classified using (1)

into those that are growing and hiring, and declining and firing; or whether



              2This is essentially the decomposition used in the
         establishment data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor
         Statistics from 1958 through 1981.

                                        3
 hiring andlor firing are activities that are only loosely related to net

 employment changes. That is, does growth in employment mean that the finn

 is in a "hiring regime" (Lockwood and Manning, 1993)? Does a drop in

 employment imply a "firing regime?" The first specific question we examine

 is what net changes in employment in a firm or establishment imply about the

 type and extent of flows of workers into and out of it.

             These distinctions are important because the assumptions underlying

 theories of the dynamics of labor demand equate expansion with hiring (and

 contraction with firing). The locus classicus in this area (Sargent, 1978)

 presents a rational—expectations approach to the firm's net change in

 employment. The vast subsequent literature in macroeconomics essentially

 ignores the possibility that negative net changes in employment may not only

 occur when firms fire workers, but may instead reflect substantial hiring. The

 "European approach" (e.g., Nickell, 1986) does treat the firm's decision in

 terms of some of the gross flows in (1). But this approach has had little

impact on the discussion in macroeconomics, perhaps because data on these
• flows
          are very difficult to obtain.

            With heterogeneous workers and jobs the distinction between job

creation/destmction and hiring/firing/employment changes is essential. If, for

example, the firm fires five assistant professors of sociology and replacesthem

with five assistant professors of economics, its costs differ from those in the

example above, where economists who quit were replaced by others. If the

                                          4
firm abolishes one vice—presidential position and transfers the incumbent to

a newly—created other such position, its costs will be greater than if no

changes occurred. Most important, in both of these cases jobs are created (and

an equal number are destroyed), even though there is no firm—level net

employment change.

        Figure 1 offers a complete taxonomy of the dynamics of labor demand

for a single—plant firm.3 Every worker in the firm fills a job. In Period t

there are J1jobs. Between times t and t+ 1 some jobs are destroyed, and some

workers whose jobs were not destroyed either separate or move internally to

existing or newly —created jobs. Some of the separated workers were fired,

either because of incompetence or because their jobs were destroyed. A flow

of newly—hired workers takes the remaining newly —created jobs or fills the

positions vacated by quitters.

         The simplest concept illustrated in Figure 1 is the same net

employment change, AE, as in (1), which by definition equals J.1 — k     The
second concept is the firm—level net employment change, àE + AETh

which measures the sum of all jobs created and destroyed (if one ignores shifts

of jobs within the firm). This is the now—standard calculation based on

observations on plants or firms between two time periods. The third measure,


             3The figure is simplified by omitting vacant jobs. It is
         based on people and jobs and necessarily ignores intensity of
         effort (including hours worked in each job and effort per
         hour).

                                      5
which we denote by F + jD (jobs created pius jobs destroyed) and call th

turnover, adds gross shifts in jobs within the firm to the second measure

Thus just as AE + E departs from AE by adding interfirm gross job
creation and destruction within an aggregate of firms, F + jD departs from

AE + AE by adding intrafirm gross job creation and destruction in the

aggregate of jobs within individual firms.

         All three of these measures ignore the identity of the workers. All,

including the third one which is novel here, are based on positions, not

people. The fourth measure is labor turnover, based on total hires H and

separations X. The relations among the four terms are:

(2)

Obviously, net employment change is the same no matter on which concept it

is based:.

(3)      AEE+_EeJC_JDeH_ x.
         It is difficult to do justice to the complexity of Figure 1 in theoretical

or empirical research. Even what we have called the European approach

assumes that the firm is never hiring when it is firing workers, and vice —

versa. That assumption is required by profit maximization in the presence of

the homogeneous work force that the models always assume. In a world of

heterogeneous labor simultaneous hiring and firing is possible in response to

relative demand or cost shocks. Whether this simultaneity is empirically

important is the second specific question investigated in the next section. We

                                        6
analyze both the simultaneity of hiring and firing and the extent to which

heterogeneity causes jC + jD to exceed AE+ +      AE.
        The possible coexistence of hiring and firing in a firm has
implications for macroeconomic adjustment. The employment reallocation

generated by macroeconomic shocks may greatly exceed the interfirm (or

interplant) reallocation that has been the focus of so much recent research.

The greater intrafirm and intraplant reallocation are, the greater are the

implicit costs of changing output levels. The cost to the finn of a negative

macroeconomic shock is indicated not by the loss in employment, but by the

costs of hiring and firing that may accompany the shock. Because hiring and

firing may occur simultaneously, these costs cannot be inferred simply by

summing up hires in firms that are only hiring, and fires in those that are only

firing. The subtleties of analyzing employment fluctuations at the macro level

are even greater than moving from aggregating firms' net employment changes

to aggregating their gross changes would suggest.

UI. Estimates of the Component Flows of Labor Demand

        In this Section we show that the distinctions between gross and net

flows are important empirically and should condition how we discuss labor—

market dynamics. We make no attempt to model the determinants of these

flows or their interrelationships. Rather, using the first broad—based random

sample that allows the analysis of net employment and job changes and flows



                                       7
of workers at the firm level, we inquire about the definitional and conceptual

issues raised in the previous section.

         This data set, whose inclusion of information on types of flows of

workers and on internal mobility makes it unique for any industrialized

economy, is based on two surveys by the Organization for Labor Market

Research (OSA) of the Netherlands.4 The surveys are of organizations,

which we refer to as firms, and are representative of all industries (including

government and education) in the Netherlands in 1988 and 1990. The samples

are stratified according to area of economic activity and size of the firm (10—

49, 50—99, and 100+ employees), with firms of fewer than 10 employees

excluded. While the data are representative only of one small economy, the

Netherlands is highly advanced and typical in its mix of industries. Moreover,

this data set, unlike many of those used to study factor—demand dynamics that

are restricted to the small and decreasingly important manufacturing sector,

covers the entire economy.

        Each survey uses two questionnaires. The first, which is administered

by enumerators, concerns qualitative characteristics and financial data; the


            4Two studies (Cramer and Koller, 1988; Lane      1993)
        have used establishment data to examine employment changes
        and worker flows (though none has accounted for internal
        mobility, and none has information on types of flows of
        workers). There have also been efforts to draw inferences
        from the longitudinal panels of establishments in conjunction
        with data on workers from household surveys (e.g., Boeri,
        1992).

                                      S
second concerns administrative information. The mail responses to this second

questionnaire come some time after the first questionnaire is answered and

have a nonresponse rate of 20—25 percent. In 1988 the sample consists of

2041 finns, in 1990 of 2017 firms. The firms included in each survey contain

roughly 3 percent of total employment in the Netherlands. The surveys were

set up as a panel, but a large number of the 1988 firms did not cooperate in

1990, had a substantial change in activities or merged. 1190 firms responded

in both years.

        Removing those firms that lack essential information (for example,

answers on the second questionnaire) leaves a sample of 1159 firms from the

1988 survey and 1045 firms from the 1990 survey. The results in Tables 1—4

and Figures 2 are based on the pooled sample of these 2204 observations; the

panel of 558 firms with complete responses is the basis for Table 5; while

Tables 6 and 7 (illustrating Figure 1) are based only on the data for 1990.

Other than in Tables 6 and 7 the information we present is weighted by sector

and firm size to be representative of the entire Dutch economy. Definitjons

of the main variables are presented in Appendix A. Employees with

temporary contracts shorter than one year are excluded.

A. Net Employment Changes and Flows of Workers

        Table 1 presents summary statistics for the pooled sample. The

average annual hiring. rate is 12.4 percent. The outflow rate is 11.8 percent,

of which the firing rate is 1.5 percent and the quit rate is 8 percent (and the

                                      9
 rest miscellaneous outflows). The average annual internal mobility rate is 3.3

 percent.

            Table 1 divides the pooled sample into firms with growing, stable and

declining employment.           Unsurprisingly, the hiring rate decreases as

employment growth moves from positive to negative. Still, hiring rates in

firms with declining employment average 5.9 percent. Most important,

calculations based on the table show that only 58 percent of all hires occur in

firms that are expanding. The firing rate where employment is declining is

higher than where it is increasing or stable.            Firms with expanding

employment still fire 1.1 percent of their workers each year, though; and only

40 percent of all fires occur in firms that are contracting.

            Quit rates in firms with increasing employment are somewhat less

than in firms with decreasing or stable employment, but the differences in

these average are quite small. The quit rate seems relatively unaffected by

conditions within the firm (presumably responding more to general labor—

market conditions). Internal mobility rates are highest among growing firms,

suggesting that the expansion of employment does lead to greater opportunities

for incumbent employees.

            Figure 2 presents more detail about the relationships between rates of

flows of workers and employment growth. Firms are classified into growth

categories ranging in steps of two percentage points from —28 percent to +28

percent. The left— and right—most bars represent the average rates from the

                                         10
tails and contain 0.6 percent and 1.5 percent of the (employment—weighted)

firms respectively. Figure 2a shows that hires occur even at large negative

employment growth. The hiring rate is roughly stable at 5 to 8 percent where

employment is declining, regardless of the size of the decline. Among

expanding firms there is a clear positive correlation between employment

growth and the hiring rate.

        Figure 2b shows that the relationship between the firing rate and

employment growth is the mirror image of Figure 2a. The firing rate is quite

stable at about 1 percent where employment is growing. Where employment

is declining, the firing rate is greater the larger is the drop in employment.

         Figure 2c graphs the quit rate by employment change. As was
obvious in Table 1, there is no strong correlation between the two. Figure 2d

shows that the average internal mobility rate also does not vary much with

employment growth. If internal mobility were important in the reshuffling of

employment, we would see a U—shaped relationship between it and

employment growth. Figure 2d gives at most onlya very slight hint of this.

Where employment is growing very rapidly,.though, reshuffling is substantial:

The internal mobility rate is highest among firms growing at least 24 percent

per year.

         Table 1 and Figure 2 demonstrate the well—known fact that there is

substantial turnover of workers atthe firm level. They also produce several

novel conclusions. 1) Most important, these flows are large even in firms

                                       11
where net employment changes are small. 2) Hiring is not restricted to firms

with expanding employment (mostly because of the very high rate of quitting).

3) Firing is not restricted to firms with declining employment. 4) Internal

mobility is low, below the average hiring rate, even in firms with declining

employment. Most workers enter their jobs directly from outside the firm,

while internal mobility chains (movements along Dunlopian, 1957, job
ladders) are relatively few.

         Consider these issues in more detail. Table 2 groups firms according

to hiring and firing status and whether employment is growing, stable and

declining. The table shows that one quarter of the firms in our sample did not

alter employment in a given year. The fractions of firms with decreasing or

increasing employment are about the same. Most of the firms (83 percent) are

hiring, either with (21.6 percent) or without (61.3 percent) firing. Together

with the observation that only 2.6 percent of firms fire without hiring, this

demonstrates that most firing is done by firms that are also hiring.

         Table 3 details the relationships among hires, fires and quits. The

four possible combinations of hiring and firing are related to the presence or

absence of quits. To what extent is the combination of firing and hiring

related to the existence of quits? Are fires 'really' necessary, or could a cut

in employment also have been accomplished by quits? Since Table I showed

that Q and ,SE are very weakly correlated, it is reasonable to interpret the

results as more than a reflection of the relation between E and hires. Quits

                                      12
occur in 78.5 percent of firms. The combination of hiring and firing without

quits occurs in only 2.9 percent of the sample. We observe simultaneous

hiring and firing in the presence of quits in 18.7 percent of the firms; and,

unsurprisingly, there is a positive relation between quits and the propensity to

hire. While large rates of quitting allow firing rates to be kept far below

hiring rates, in some firms shocks are sufficiently large that they cannot be

met solely by reliance on quits.

B. Heterogeneous Workers and Finns, and Job Creation

         Table 4 examines whether simultaneous hiring and firing can be

attributed to one source of heterogeneity in the work force, the distinctiofi

between white—collar (WC) and blue—collar (BC) workers. If, for example,

employment declines among white—collar workers, while quitters are blue—

collar workers who must be replaced, we would observe both hiring and firing

at the firm level. Consistent with Table 2, 78.4 percent of finns are in the top

row or first column, either hiring and not firing, or vice—versa. Among the

21.6 percent of firms that are hiring and firing, only 1.1 percent of all firms

are firing only one type of worker and hiring only the other. By far the most

common pattern among this 21.6 percent of firms is hiring and firing of blue —

collar workers (13.4 percent of firms).         Table 4 shows clearly that

heterogeneity across broadly—defined occupation accounts for only a small

part of the surprisingly common hiring in the presence of firing.



                                      13
          Table 5 examines the extent that firms can be classified as remaining

 in the same regime over time (e.g., expanding and hiring, declining and

hiring, etc.) by presenting data describing the panel of firms. Roughly 14

percent of firms are declining in both years; and another 14 percent are

growing in both years. A large majority, though, are growing in one year and

stable or declining two years later. Probably most interesting is the relative

lack of persistence in hiring. Firms with stable employment in both years that

are hiring in the first year have only a .54 probability of hiring in the second

year. Similarly, hiring behavior among firms that are declining in both years

is quite variable over time. While there is some persistence in hiring among

continuously growing and stable firms, even they vaiy their hiring greatly.

The implied on —off behavior may reflect the existence of nonconvex costs of

hiring.

          Table 6 presents estimates of the flows in Figure 1. For each firm

the survey provides information on the last worker in the flow of hires, in the

outflow and in the internal flow. The firms are asked whether the worker

obtained a newly—created job (for hires and internal flows) and whether the

worker left a job that was not refilled (for outflows and internal flows).

Aggregation of workers over the sample yields estimates of the hiring rates Hi

and H2 (to newly —created and existing jobs), estimates of outflow rates Xi

and X2 (from existing and destroyed jobs) and of the internal mobility rates

IM 1 through 1M4 (from existing/destroyed to existing/newly —created jobs).

                                     14
The information is not weighted, because weighting would bias the estimates

of the fractions.5 For this reason and because the data cover only 1990 the

estimates do not correspond to their counterparts in Table 1.

         The distinction between existing and newly—created jobs in this

taxonomy generates several interesting observations. Most important, the very

large majority of mobility is to and from existing jobs. Most outflows,

inflows and internal flows represent reshuffling of people into and out of

positions whose existence continues.

        The most important use of the taxonomy in Figure 1 is its illustration

of the inequalities in (2). This is presented in Table 7, again with unweighted

data. As in all other studies firm—level net employment change dwarfs

average net employment change (6.2 versus 1.8 percent). Including intrafirm

gross job creation and destruction to allow the calculation of j< + jD raises

the estimate ofjob turnover to 7.0 percent, roughly 15 percent above what the

standard measure, àE + E, would suggest. This is important; but it is

small enough that the existence of simultaneous creation and destruction of

jobs within firms should not greatly alter our views about the relative




             5The raw estimates imply jC — jD    =   2.6 percent, which
        does not satisfy the identity (3). To obtain the identity we
        adjusted HI and X2 by adding respectively 61H1 and 62X2.
        The optimal weights ö are those that minimize the quardratic
        loss function b + ô, subject to [1+51]HI — [l+½]X2 =
        H-X+1M3-IM4.
                                       15
magnitudes of aggregate employment change and firm—level net employment

change.

           How can we rationalize this Subsection's finding that simultaneous

creation and destruction of jobs within the firm is small with the result of the

previous Subsection that most of the firms that are firing are also hiring? One

possibility consistent with the data is that most of the jobs that are vacated by

fired workers are filled by workers who are hired to replace them in jobs that

continue. With a 1.5 percent firing rate in the pooled data, and with W        —


         = .4, one might infer that roughly a third of workers who are fired

vacate jobs that disappear, while two—thirds of fired workers are replaced by

hires.

IV. Conclusions

            We    have   investigated    whether     using    the terms job
creation/destruction and hiring/firing interchangeably makes sense in light of

the first available set of establishment data on employment levels and worker

flows by type to, from and within firms. The terms are definitely not

interchangeable. Hiring is not restricted to firms with expanding employment;

over 40 percent of hiring is done by firms that are not growing. Firing is not

restricted to firms with declining employment; the majority of firing is done

by firms that are not declining. It is clear that jobs are being destroyed by

firms doing substantial hiring, and that they are being created by firms that are



                                        16
firing. This result cannot be explained by heterogeneity arising from the
presence of blue— and white—collar workers.

         The huge difference between aggregate net employment change and

firm—level net employment change that has been noted frequently in the recent

literature is enlarged only somewhat when simultaneous job creation and

destruction within firms is accounted for. Obviously this conclusion depends

on how one defines jobs: We could easily count any slight change in duties

(e.g., switching from teaching two courses and doing research to one course

and somewhat more research) as the creation and destruction of jobs.

Nonetheless, using the job classifications that employers themselves use, our

results suggest that ignoring the heterogeneity arising from job
creation/destruction within firms does not detract greatly from our ability to

analyze macroeconomic fluctuations that are related to interfirm heterogeneity.

        That hiring and firing occur simultaneously within the same firm

suggests that a fundamental problem exists with all studies of dynamic labor

demand based on homogeneous labor. The heterogeneity of jobs implied by

•this simultaneity means that we cannot infer adjustment costs by examining

patterns of adjustment of aggregates of all workers. Even if employment is

unchanged (in the context of models based on levels), and even if we observe

hiring (in the context of the models based on flows of workers), we must take

into account the frequently simultaneous existence of employer—initiated

layoffs that themselves add to adjustment costs.

                                      17
        The demonstration over the last decade that heterogeneity in

employment growth among firms and establishments within narrowly—defined

industries is immense has been a fundamental contribution to our
understanding of the microeconomic bases of macroeconomic change. Here

we have demonstrated that there is a concomitant heterogeneity in flows of

workers into and out of the firm, and through and between jobs, among firms

whose employment is changing at identical rates. Moreover, these flows are

substantial. These facts suggest that an important step will be to analyze how

the two types of interfirm heterogeneity interact to alter macroeconomic

outcomes.

Appendix A. Definition of Variables

       "How many workers were employed in your organization in
       December 1988 (1990) (no temporary workers). This
       concerns the number of employees irrespective of the
       number of hours worked". In the 1988 wave E is observed
       for 1988 and 1986. Employment for December 1987 and
       December 1989 are constructed by means of the hires (H)
       and the outflow (X) of employees in the next year: E1 =
       E—H+X.
I-I:   "How many employees entered your organization in 1988
       (1990), including employees with a probationary period,
       excluding employees with a temporary contract shorter than
       one year?"

X:     "How many employees left your organization in 1988
       (1990), excluding employees with a temporary contract
       shorter than one year. • X is divided into the number of
       employees who left the organization for the following
       reasons:
       —
           pension, early retirement, death;
       —   outflow because of disability;
       —
           firing;
       —
           quit;
       —   end of temporary contract with a duration > one year.

IM:    "How many employees changed function and/or changed
       department within the organization?"
