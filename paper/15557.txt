Distance, Trade, and Income – The 1967 to 1975 Closing of the Suez Canal as a Natural Experiment

                                              ABSTRACT

The negative effect of distance on bilateral trade is one of the most robust findings in international
trade. However, the underlying causes of this negative relationship are less well understood. This
paper exploits a temporary shock to distance, the closing of the Suez canal in 1967 and its reopening
in 1975, to examine the effect of distance on trade and the effect of trade on income. Time series variation
in sea distance allows for the inclusion of pair effects which account for static differences in tastes
and culture between countries. The distance effects estimated in this paper are therefore more clearly
about transportation costs in the trade of goods than typical gravity model estimates. Distance is found
to have a significant impact on trade with an elasticity that is about half as large as estimates from
typical cross sectional estimates. Since the shock to trade is exogenous for most countries, predicted
trade volume from the shock can be used to identify the effect of trade on income. Trade is found
to have a significant impact on income. The time series dimension allows for country fixed effects
which control for all long run income differences. Because identification is through changes in sea
distance, the effect is coming entirely through trade in goods and not through alternative channels
such as technology transfer, tourism, or foreign direct investment.

Introduction
The distance between countries has a substantial impact on the volume of trade
between them.1 Why should distance matter? The most obvious answer is that
trade is a function of transportation costs (which rise with distance). However, a
calculation by Grossman (1998) suggests that transportation costs can only account
for a fraction of the elasticity estimated by typical gravity regressions.
    Gravity model estimates of the effect of distance on trade are likely to capture
more than just transport costs. If tastes and cultural characteristics diverge with
increasing distance, trade may decrease with distance even if transportation was
costless.2 While some cultural aspects of bilateral relationships like common lan-
guages or colonial status can be controlled for, one can never completely eliminate
missing variable bias in a cross section. For this reason, the distance coefficient
in typical gravity regressions reflects many other aspects of distance beyond pure
differences in transportation costs.
    This paper estimates a gravity model of trade using novel variation that directly
targets transportation costs – an exogenous time series shock to distance. On June
5, 1967, at the beginning of the Six Day War, Egypt closed the Suez canal. The canal
remained closed for exactly eight years, reopening on June 5, 1975. The Suez Canal
provides the shortest sea route between Asia and Europe and currently handles
roughly 7.5 percent of world trade. The closure of the canal was a substantial
unexpected shock to world trade. For most countries in the world, the closure of
the Canal can be seen as an exogenous event. The reopening of the canal provides
a similar shock in the opposite direction.
   This paper will exploit these shocks to identify the effect of distance on trade
and further to examine the effect of trade on output. Because there is time series
variation, time and bilateral pair controls can be used to ensure that all identifica-
tion comes from the change in distance due to the closure of the Suez Canal. By
using variation caused by changes in sea distance, the estimates in this paper are
much more closely focused on the pure impact of transportation costs compared to
standard gravity estimates. The distance elasticities found in this paper are about
half of those typically found in the literature. This suggests that less than half of

the conventional estimates of distance on trade are working through transportation
costs with the remainder reflecting other factors correlated with distance. The exo-
geneity of the shocks also makes it possible to estimate the time path of trade after
the shock. Trade takes roughly three years to adjust to the shock.
   The second part of the paper uses the exogenous variation in trade generated
by the Suez shocks to identify the effect of trade on income. The effect of trade
on income is of obvious interest and has been explored in numerous papers, but
identification has been difficult due to reverse causality.3 This paper approaches the
identification problem in a manner similar to Frankel and Romer (1999), who use
the distance between countries to predict bilateral trade volumes. The concern with
their approach is that proximity may be acting through channels other than trade.4
This paper is similar in the use of geography as an instrument for trade, but with the
addition of time series variation provided by the Suez Canal shocks. This variation
allows for the inclusion of country dummies in the second stage, controlling for all
time invariant income differences.
   This is similar to Feyrer (2009), where the identifying variation comes from the
technological improvement in air transport. The income results in this paper differ
in two important ways. First, Feyrer (2009) examines changes in trade that are
slower moving and occur over decades. This paper exploits a short run shock to
trade and is therefore more suited to thinking about events and policies that impact
trade over the course of years, not decades. The short run nature of the shocks also
allows for examining the time path of adjustment to the shocks.
   The second important difference is that the variation in distance by sea generated
by the closing of Suez is almost certainly identifying the effect of trade in goods.
The approach of Feyrer (2009) may be picking up bilateral relationships fostered
by inexpensive air travel such as foreign direct investment and trade in services
that come from easier movement of people around the globe. These results can
   3
     Sachs and Warner (1995), Frankel and Romer (1999), Dollar (1992), and Edwards (1998) are
some of the more prominent papers finding a positive relationship between trade (or being open
to trade) and income. Rodriguez and Rodrik (2000) conclude that none of these papers establish
a robust and well identified relationship between trade restrictions and growth. The key difficulty
faced in this literature is the lack of exogenous variation in trade or trade policies. Though some
papers attempt to use instrumental variables, the instruments tend to violate exclusion restrictions.
   4
     Rodriguez and Rodrik (2000) and others show that Frankel and Romer (1999)’s results are
not robust to the inclusion of geographic controls in the second stage. For example, proximity to
the equator is associated with low incomes. The Frankel and Romer (1999) instruments may be
picking up this effect rather than trade. See also Rodrik, Subramanian and Trebbi (2004) and
Irwin and Terviö (2002).

                                                 3
therefore be seen as capturing the overall effect of globalization on income. Because
the variation in this paper relies on sea distance, the effects must be coming through
bilateral relationships that change when the distance by sea changes. Trade in goods
is the main relationship that fits this description. This paper therefore can more
clearly identify the relationship between trade in goods and output separately from
other relationships that tend to move with trade.
    The trade movements caused by the closing of the Suez Canal significantly change
income with an elasticity of roughly one quarter. This is about half the value found
in Feyrer (2009). This suggests that about half of positive impact of globalization
is the result of trade in goods and half is due to other aspects of increased integra-
tion such as FDI or technology transfers caused by movements of people between
countries.
    Because of the unique identification in this paper, the results are more directly
related to trade in goods than other gravity estimates. These results are therefore
particularly useful for thinking about policies designed to decrease trade costs.


1    The Six Day War and the Closure of the Suez
     Canal
The Six Day War was fought between Israel and Egypt, Syria, and Jordan between
June 5 and June 10 in 1967. In March of 1967 Egypt expelled the United Nations
Emergency Force (UNEF). This force had been stationed on the Egypt-Israel border
enforcing the armistice agreement that ended the Suez Crisis of 1956. The war began
on June 5, as Israel launched surprise air strikes which destroyed the majority of
the Egyptian Air Forces on the ground. At the end of the war Israel had greatly
enlarged the territories under its control. The additions included the Sinai Peninsula
and the Gaza strip from Egypt, the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan,
and the Golan Heights from Syria.
   The canal was closed by Egypt at the outbreak of hostilities. Though tensions
had been high in the region since the Suez Crisis of 1956, the actual outbreak of war
was a surprise and the closing of the canal was not anticipated in advance. When the
canal closed, fifteen cargo ships known as “The Yellow Fleet” were trapped inside.
They remained in the canal during the entire eight years of the closure. Since it
takes less than a day to transit the canal, this suggests that there was very little

                                          4
anticipation of the closing beforehand. At the end of the war, the canal was the
cease fire line, with Israeli troops on one side and Egyptian troops on the other.
These troops remained for the next eight years and there was little prospect of the
canal reopening during most of this period.5
    In October of 1973, the Yom Kippur War was fought between Israel, Syria, and
Egypt (Jordan did not take part). Egyptian forces crossed the Suez and attacked
Israeli positions in the Sinai Peninsula. Syria staged a simultaneous offensive in the
Golan Heights. After taking losses during the first few days, the Israelis counter
attacked, retaking the Golan Heights on the northern front and splitting the Egyp-
tian forces in the Sinai, pushing across the Canal. At the time of the UN brokered
cease fire Israeli forces were on the west side of the canal and Egyptian forces were
on the east side of the Canal.
    The peace negotiations that followed involved reopening the canal. Agreement
to reopen the canal was tentatively reached in early 1974. By March 5, 1974, the
last of the Israeli troops had withdrawn from the west side of the canal. After fixing
war damage and removing mines and munitions the canal reopened on June 5, 1975,
eight years to the day of the closure. Unlike the closing, there was roughly a year
of advance notice that the canal was to reopen.
    The closure of the Canal provides a perfect natural experiment for examining the
impact of distance on trade. For most pairs of countries the shock was unanticipated,
sudden, and unimportant except through the effect on shipping costs. The nature
of the shocks also makes it possible to identify the effect of trade on income.


2       The Gravity Model
The gravity model has been widely used for almost half a century. The basic idea
that trade decreases with the distance between two countries is intuitive and holds up
well empirically. This application of the gravity model is particularly straightforward
since the nature of the shock is directly to distance. This allows for identifying the
effect of distance in a panel of bilateral trade. The inclusion of bilateral pair dummies
means that all identification comes from the change in distance caused by the closing
    5
    The bleak prospects for reopening the canal during this period were confirmed by economist
Joseph Zeira, who served as an Israeli army officer stationed along the canal during this time.
Small skirmishes between the Israelis and Egyptians were common.

of the Suez canal.6
    Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) develop a theoretical model to derive the
gravity model. The basic gravity relationship is
                                                                !1−σ

                                               ywt      Pi Pj

where tradeijt is bilateral trade between country i and country j, yit yjt and ywt are
the incomes of country i, country j and the world, τijt is a bilateral resistance term,
and Pi and Pj are country specific multilateral resistance terms. Taking logs,

         ln(xij ) = ln(yi ) + ln(yj ) − ln(yw ) + (1 − σ)(ln(τijt ) + ln(Pi ) + ln(Pj )).       (2)

    The bilateral resistance term, τijt , in Equation (2) encompasses all pair specific
barriers to trade such as distance, common language, a shared border, colonial ties,
etc. The effect of distance is assumed to be log-linear. The majority of these
determinants of bilateral resistance are time invariant and will be controlled for
using bilateral pair dummies. The exception is, of course, the change in distance
by sea caused by the closing and opening of the Suez Canal. The P and y terms
will also be controlled for using bilateral pair dummies.7 The estimation equation
is therefore


                      ln(tradeijt ) = α + γij + γt + βln(seadistij ) + ǫ.                       (3)

       The pair dummies (made possible through the time variation in distance) control
perfectly for all long run determinants of bilateral trade such as common colonial
heritage, shared tastes, etc.
   6
      The distance measures that are commonly used in estimating gravity models are point to point
great circle distances. Feyrer (2009) is the first to use sea distance in estimating a gravity model
using comprehensive world trade data. While sea distance occasionally appears in gravity models,
it has tended to be in the context of single country or regional studies. Disdier and Head (2008)
conduct a meta study of gravity model results and cite the use of sea distance as one differentiator
between papers. However the use of sea distance is rare and seems to be limited to regional work.
Coulibalya and Fontagne (2005) consider sea distance in an examination of African trade.
    7
      The individual income terms are time varying and will not be perfectly controlled for using
the pair dummies. However, since the shock is exogenous to any particular countries income
(except perhaps for the combatants and their neighbors, who are excluded) this should not bias
the results. While it is possible to include a full set of country by year fixed effects, this would
make the estimations invalid for constructing instruments for income.

2.1    Data
Trade data were provided by Glick and Taylor (2008) who in turn are using the IMF
Direction of Trade (DOT) data. For each bilateral pair in the DOT data there are
potentially four observations in each year – imports and exports are reported from
both sides of the pair. An average of these four values is used, except in the case
where none of the four is reported. These values are taken as missing.
   Bilateral sea distances were created by the author using raw geographic data.
The globe was first split into a matrix of 1x1 degree squares. The points representing
points on land were identified using gridded geographic data from CIESIN.8 The time
needed to travel from any oceanic point on the grid to each of its neighbors was
calculated assuming a ship speed of 20 knots and adding (or subtracting) the speed
of the average ocean current along the path. Average ocean current data are from
the National Center for Atmospheric Research.9 The result of these calculations is
a complete grid of the water of the globe with information on travel time between
any two adjacent points. The grid can be constructed both including and excluding
the Suez canal as a valid path. Given any two points in a network of points, the
shortest travel time can be found using standard graph theory algorithms.10 After
identifying a primary port for each country all pairwise minimum travel times were
calculated from networks with and without the Suez canal as a valid path. For
country pairs where the Suez canal is not the shortest path, these two travel times
are identical. For country pairs including the Suez canal in the shortest path, the
shortest alternative path is calculated. The distance between countries used in the
regression is the number of days to make a round trip.
   Identifying the location for the primary port for the vast majority of coun-
tries was straightforward and for most countries choosing any point along the coast
would not change the results. The major potential exceptions to this are the US
and Canada, with significant populations on both coasts and massive differences
in distance depending on which coast is chosen. For simplicity (and because the
east-west distribution of economic activity in the US and Canada can be seen as
an outcome) the trade of the US and Canada with all partners was split with 80
percent attributed to the east coast and 20 to the west coast for all years. This

is roughly based on the US east-west population distribution for 1970, the middle
of the sample. In effect, the US and Canada are each split in two with regards to
the trade regressions, with each country in the world trading with each coast in-
dependently based on appropriate sea distances. When generating predicted trade
shares for the US and Canada, the trade with both halves are summed. Choosing
just the east coast sea distances, changing the relative east-west weights, or even
removing all observations including the US and Canada has no significant effect on
the results.
    Because countries need to abut the sea in order to be located on the oceanic
grid, the sample excludes landlocked countries. Oil exporters were also left out of
the sample because they have atypical trade patterns and have an almost mechanical
relationship between the value of trade and income. Because of their involvement
in the conflict all combatants and their immediate neighbors are excluded from the
regressions. This eliminates Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Lebanon,
and Turkey. For most of these countries, their exclusion is not important for the
results since they have ports on the Mediterranean side of the canal and most of
their trade was unaffected by the closure. This is not true for Jordan and Sudan.
In both cases, the shock to trade from the Suez closure was two to three times
as big as for the next most affected nation in the data. Including Jordan would
unambiguously strengthen the results for both trade and income. Including Sudan
strengthens the trade results, but weakens the income results. In either case, their
shocks are large enough that they have an exaggerated impact on the results when
included.
    The trade panel is unbalanced and only pairs that have at least one data point
in the periods before, during, and after the closing of the canal are included in the
analysis. There is some ambiguity as to whether missing values in the data are truly
missing or represent zero trade. In order to check that this is not driving the results,
balanced panel regressions will also be reported. Using a balanced panel of country
pairs reduces the sample size by nearly one half (from 2,605 pairs to 1,294 pairs).
Using just the balanced panel does not change the results significantly and leads to
more precise estimates.
  Data for income are GDP per capita measured in constant 2000 US$ taken from
the World Development Indicators. Johnson, Larson, Papageorgiou and Subrama-
nian (2009) find that the Penn World Tables are inconsistent for high frequency


                                           8
applications and recommend the use of the World Development Indicators.11
   For all the results that follow the sample will be comprised of trade for the years
1958 through 1984. The closure occurred over 9 calendar years so this provides
for 9 full years before the closing and 9 full years after the reopening. For the
income results, the initial period starts in 1960 because income data from the World
Development Indicators are unavailable before 1960.
   To present the results graphically, I will collapse the data into three periods, 1)
1960-1966 (before the closure), 2) 1970-1974 (during the closure), and 3) 1978-1984
(after the reopening). The shock year and two subsequent years are excluded from
the analysis. As will be shown in the trade results, it takes trade about 3 years to
fully adjust to the shock, so these windows are designed to capture the variables
of interest after adjustment has taken place. The formal regressions will include
results with and without including these transition periods.


3      Did the Closure of the Suez Canal Reduce Trade?
Figure 1 shows the average of residuals of log bilateral trade grouped by the size of
the distance shock caused by the closure of Suez. The residuals are from a regression
of the natural log of bilateral trade against a full set of time and bilateral pair
dummies. For these graphs the sample is limited to country pairs with continuous
data from 1958 to 1984. The vertical lines represent the closing and opening of the
Suez Canal. There is a clear drop in trade during the closure for the groups with
distance shocks of 10 percent or larger. The fall is larger for the groups with more
extreme shocks. The modal country pair experiences no change in distance from
the closing of the Canal. The shape of these graphs suggests that the impact of the
closure on trade takes several years to reach its peak. In later sections, this time
dynamic will be explored more formally.
    Figure 2 is a scatter plot analogous to the gravity model estimation described
in the previous section. On the x-axis is the log change in distance by sea when
Suez is closed and reopened. Points to the right of the origin represent the closing
of the canal (distance increases) and to the left the reopening (distance decreases).
Country pairs whose shortest sea routes do not use the Suez Canal (and therefore

experience no shock) are omitted from this graph for clarity. About 23 percent of
bilateral pairs representing 10 percent of the trade in the sample have the Suez canal
as the shortest sea route. The y-axis is the change in log trade over two intervals.
First, the change in average trade for years before the closure to years during the
closure. Second, the change in average trade for years during the closure to years
after the reopening. These averages are taken excluding the years of the opening
and closing and the two years after these events. As will be shown later, omitting
these years from the averages removes the transition period and better captures the
long run effect.
   Larger shocks to distance are associated with slower trade growth after the clo-
sure and more rapid trade growth after the reopening. An OLS regression matching
the scatter generates a slope of -0.3 and it is significant at the one percent level.
The distribution of shocks is skewed, with a small set of countries in the Indian
Ocean and the Arabian Sea having the largest shocks. All pairs with a log distance
increase of over one include one of the following countries on the Arabian Sea side
of the canal: Djibouti, Pakistan, India, Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania and Sri Lanka.
These are also the countries that experience the largest aggregate shocks, though
Djibouti, Somalia, and Tanzania do not appear in the income regressions due to

lack of data. Excluding all pairs with a log distance change of over one does not
significantly change the estimates, so these large shocks are not driving the results.
    Table 1 shows the results of running panel regression of log trade against sea
distance (estimating equation 3). All the regressions include a full set of bilateral
pair and year dummies. The bilateral dummies control for the time invariant factors
that are typically included in gravity regressions such as common borders, colonial
relationships, etc. All identification of the effect of distance on trade is coming from
the change in sea distance caused by the closing (and reopening) of the Suez canal.
Table 1 also includes regressions where the opening of Suez and the closing of Suez
are treated as different shocks. It may be possible that the two shocks had different
effects.
    The results presented in Table 1 show that the average elasticity of trade with
respect to sea distance is between 0.15 and 0.46 when the shocks are assumed to
be symmetric. The even numbered columns exclude the transition years from the
analysis and should better reflect the long run effect of the shock. Estimates that
exclude the transition period are uniformly larger in absolute value. Moving to a
balanced panel also tends to increase the absolute value of the point estimates.
   Breaking the shock into two separate shocks suggests that the opening and the

   closing of the canal were not completely symmetric events. The elasticity of trade
   with respect to the shock is larger when estimated on the closure compared to
   the reopening, though the difference is only significant in estimations including
   the transition years. There are several reasons why they may be different. The
   reopening of the canal was anticipated for over a year, possibly muting the response,
   particularly during the transition. The closure was a complete surprise, leaving
   shippers scrambling to adjust shipping schedules. By the reopening, world trade
   had readjusted to a world without the canal. It is not unreasonable to think that
   shipping is more elastic to negative shocks than to positive ones given capacity that
   is fixed in the short run. A final reason for the smaller response is that the elasticity
   of trade with respect to sea distance may have fallen during this period in response
   to a growing volume of trade being carried by air.12
       An estimated elasticity of trade with respect to distance of 0.2 - 0.5 is smaller
   compared to standard gravity model estimates. In an extensive meta study of 103
   gravity model studies Disdier and Head (2008) find an average elasticity of about
   0.9.
       For comparison, Table 2 shows the results of more conventional gravity model
   estimation on the same data set used for Table 1. The distances used in this table
   do not change over time and the sea distance is the distance with the Suez Canal

available. Because there is no time series variation in distance the regressions in
this table include individual country dummies, not country pair dummies. The
identification is entirely from the cross section as in conventional gravity estimates.
The distance measure labeled “air distance” in these regressions is the point to
point distance typically used in gravity estimations.13 The results are near the
center of the results collected in Disdier and Head (2008). The lower coefficients
found in Table 1 are therefore being driven by the use of time series variation and
not anything inherent in the data set.
   There are reasons to think that the traditional estimates are overstated. Typical
gravity model regressions are run in a cross section with controls for characteristics
of the pair such as a shared border, a shared language, or a colonial relationship.
Obviously no set of controls can account for all the potential causes of bilateral
resistance to trade and the coefficient on distance in such a regression may suffer
from missing variable bias if distance is correlated with the missing variables.


3.1       Impulse Response Functions
Figure 1 suggests that trade took about 3 years to reach its low point after the closing
and a similar amount of time to reach a new high after the reopening. Since the
regressions from Table 1 are essentially comparing means of log trade from the three
  13
   Specifically, I use the population weighted great circle distances between countries from the
CEPII, http://www.cepii.fr/anglaisgraph/bdd/distances.htm. See Mayer and Zignago (2006) for
a more complete description. Head and Mayer (2002) develop the methodology for the weighted
measures.

different periods, the full effect will only be reflected in the coefficient estimates if
there is no adjustment path. The estimates from regressions omitting the transition
years tend to be larger, implying that this is an important problem.
   The time series nature of the data allows for looking at the time path of trade
after the shock. Because the shock is exogenous, the estimation of the time path
can be accomplished by including a series of lags of the shock in the regression. The
basic specification is:

                                  M
                                  X
            ∆ln(trade)ijt = α +         βk ∆ln(sea distanceij,t−k ) + γt + ǫijt      (4)
                                  k=0


where ∆ln(trade)ijt is the change in log trade, M is the number of lags, γt is a set
of year dummies, and ǫijt is an error term. The change in sea distance between
countries i and j in year t − k, ∆sea distanceij,t−k , takes on a positive value in 1967
and a negative value in 1975 for countries pairs with shortest routes through the
Suez Canal. A full set of country dummies can also be included, giving each country
an individual trend. Doing so does not change the results in any significant way.
Standard errors are clustered at the country level in all regressions.
   The impulse response functions shown in the rest of the paper are constructed
by summing the β coefficients from estimating equation (10). The response in the
contemporaneous period is β0 , for the second period β0 + β1 , and so on up to the
total number of estimated lags.

                                                  t
                                                  X
                                  responset =           βk                           (5)
                                                  k=0


In each case the standard error of the sum is calculated. All impulse response
function graphs include bands of two standard errors.
    Figure 3 plots the time path of trade after a permanent shock to sea distance
for both the full sample and the balanced panel. The magnitude is analogous to
the elasticity estimates from Table 1. The response function suggests that it takes
roughly three years for the shock to have its full impact with a long run elasticity of
about -0.5, which is very similar to the sea distance results of column (3) in Table
2 and larger than the Table 1 regressions that include the transition years.
    Figure 4 shows separate impulse response functions for the opening and closing
of Suez. They are both drawn representing a positive shock to distance for com-

parative purposes. The opening and closing of the canal do not appear to generate
substantially different time paths for trade. Both the up and down shocks generate
an elasticity of roughly 0.5 when the full effect is in place though the impact of
reopening is modestly smaller. This is similar to the earlier regressions. The largest
differences between the opening and closing were found when the transition years
were included. The long run impacts are much closer together and this can be seen
in the impulse responses.
    The closure and reopening of the Suez Canal appear to be useful shocks for
thinking about changes in the costs of trade between nations. The long run elasticity
of trade with respect to sea distance is roughly 0.5, with the adjustment process
taking about three years. The response to the reopening of the Suez Canal appears
to be roughly the same in magnitude and time path as the closing of the canal.
Since the closing was caused by the outbreak of war and the closing was caused by
a peace agreement the similarity suggests that the true effect of transport costs on
trade is being identified and not some indirect effect of the Six Day War.


4     Trade and Income
The previous section establishes that the closing and reopening of the Suez Canal
affected bilateral trade between partners whose shortest sea route is through the
Suez Canal. For any individual country these changes in distance were exogenous
and generated entirely through differences in geography. Different countries were
differentially effected depending on their geography and pre-existing trade patterns.
These shocks to trade can therefore be used to identify the impact of changes in
trade on income at the aggregate country level.


4.1    Predicting Aggregate Trade
The coefficients reported in Table 1 can be used to construct predicted values for
bilateral trade for each pair of countries for each year. The predicted values are
derived from equation (3) and are comprised of a time effect, a bilateral pair effect
and the distance effect. These predicted trade volumes can be summed in order to
arrive at a prediction for aggregate trade in each country for each year. I can also

predictions have the advantage of plotting the change in trade over time rather than
just portraying the shock as a single event.
   These predictions can be made out of sample. As long as there is a single
observation of bilateral trade between two countries, an estimate for the bilateral
pair can be generated in every year since distance is always available. This has the
advantage of keeping the set of bilateral pairs constant over time for the predicted
trade, avoiding the problem of changes to aggregate trade driven by the appearance
and disappearance of trade data for a particular pair.
   Because the goal is to instrument the trade volumes with predicted trade in a
regression of trade on per capita GDP, these out of sample predictions create some
difficulties because there are observations where there is a predicted trade value, but
not an actual trade value. This matters because the instruments and observations
of trade volumes need to be matched for the IV regressions. To deal with this
the missing values of trade are imputed using a full set of country pair and time
dummies. These imputations are based entirely on information that is controlled
for in the second stage and should not affect the results. They are only necessary
to keep the scaling of the actual changes in trade consistent.
    Following Frankel and Romer (1999), unlogged versions of these bilateral rela-
tionships are summed to obtain a prediction for total trade for each country. The
actual trade figures are similarly summed to arrive at a value for total trade.

The country pair effects act as weights in an average of distances. Because the coun-
try level regressions will include country and time fixed effects, all the identification
will be from the within country variation over time. None of the identifying time
variation is generated from the bilateral or time effects.
    The predictions based on the impulse response regressions are similar but require
a transformation to generate useful predictions for the level of trade. Because the
estimates are from differenced trade, two modifications are needed. First, there is
no need to include the time controls since these will be controlled for in the second
stage. Second, the summed change in trade needs to be scaled by average trade over
the sample for each pair. The result is identical to equation (6) with the single sea

  Additionally, I can construct a simpler and somewhat more transparent instru-
ment. A weighted average of the distance change across all trading partners (using
the average trade over the whole sample as the weight) will give me the average log
distance change per unit of trade for each country. If I run a regression using this
average log distance change over the change in log aggregate trade I should get a
coefficient that is approximately equal to the β from the bilateral level regression.
For the panel regressions the instrument has value zero when the canal is open and
the value of the shock when the canal is closed.

Table 3 lists the countries in the income sample in order of the size of their shock
to distance as calculated by equation 8. The list is obviously very regional, with
Pakistan and India experiencing about a 30 percent increase in average distance.
Many East Asian countries experience a shock in the 10 percent range. Several East
African countries also experience large shocks.14
   Both the predicted trade from the trade regressions and the weighted average of
the changes in distance derive all of their idiosyncratic variation from the opening
and the closing of the Suez Canal. Since the Suez canal shocks are exogenous with
respect to individual countries in the sample (the combatants and neighbors are
excluded), this variation should provide a useful instrument for investigating the
impact of trade on GDP.

Trade and GDP are highly correlated in the time series. Figure 5 shows a scatter
plot of changes in trade versus changes in GDP per capita over the three major
periods of this investigation. Both variables have been demeaned by country and

     Because this list is restricted to countries with income data for the second stage and excludes
combatants and neighbors, several countries experiencing large shocks are not on this list. Jordan
and Sudan experienced by far the largest distance shocks. Most other East African Countries also
experienced large shocks.

time so this is a visual representation of a regression in differences with the inclusion
of both time dummies and individual country time trends. There are two points
for each country on the graph; one for the change in average trade from the period
before the closure (1960-1966) to during the closure (1970-1974) and a second for
the change in average trade from the period during the closure (1970-1974) to after
the Canal reopened (1978-1984).
   Table 4 shows the results of regressing trade on GDP per capita in a regression
with a set of country and time dummies. The estimating equation is

where the dependent variable is real per capita income from the World Develop-
ment Indicators and the independent variable is the volume of trade from the DOT
database described earlier summed at the country level. Column 1 is the full sample
and column 2 omits the transition years. There is obviously a strong and significant
relationship between trade and income with an elasticity of about 0.30.
    The OLS regressions are, of course, unidentified since we do not know the di-
rection of causality. In the next sections, instruments based on the shock to trade

4.3     IV regressions
Table 5 presents the results of IV regression of income on trade. There are several
variations presented. Three different instruments are used. The first instrument
is the simple aggregate shock from equation (8). This instrument has the value of
simplicity and transparency. The second instrument is derived from predicted values
of trade from equation (6) using estimates from column (2) of Table 1.15 The third
instrument is derived from the impulse response function of Figure 3 summed using
equation (7). Unlike the other two instruments, which have two changes occurring in
1967 and 1975, this instrument captures the complete dynamic response to the canal
closure and reopening. The other variation in Table 5 is between regressions that
omit the transition years and those that include them. For the static instruments,
the inclusion of the transition years should bias the coefficient estimates downward
by averaging in years with partial adjustment. It should make no difference for the
dynamic instrument since it already incorporates the transition.
    The first stage results suggest that the instruments are powerful. In each case
they are significant at the one percent level with F-stats above the standard thresh-
old of 10 suggested by Staiger and Stock (1997). For the static instruments, the first

    For the IV regressions, it doesn’t matter which of the first four columns is used since it just
rescales the size of the shock. It does affect the magnitude of the reduced form regressions, but
not their significance levels.

stage is stronger when the transition years are omitted. For the dynamic instru-
ment the opposite is true. Unsurprisingly, using the dynamic instrument with the
full set of years generates the strongest first stage. Figure 6 shows a scatter plot of
actual trade changes versus the average distance change caused by the closure and
reopening of Suez. Countries experiencing a larger shock see larger swings in trade
during the closure of the canal.
   Figure 7 shows a scatter plot of the log change in GDP per capita versus the
average distance change caused by the closure and reopening of Suez. Table 5
shows the same reduced form relationship in regressions on the full panel of data.
The coefficients are all significant (though some are only marginally so) and the
precision of the estimates improves in logical ways across estimates. For the two
static instruments, the precision improves when the transition years are omitted. For
the dynamic instrument the opposite is true. The strongest instrument (dynamic
predictions on the full set of years) generates the most precise reduced form.
   Table 5 shows the results of IV regression where actual trade is instrumented
with the predicted values of trade derived earlier and the average distance change
caused by the closing and opening of Suez. The elasticity of trade with respect to
income is between 0.15 and 0.25 and the estimates are significantly away from zero
in all cases.
    These magnitudes are less than half the values found in Feyrer (2009) which relies
on the rise in the relative importance of air travel for identification.16 This compari-
son is interesting because the use of air travel allows for things other than trade such
as movements of people to play a role. Because the identification is coming from the
change in sea distance, these estimates are much more clearly identifying the effect
of trade in goods and not integration or globalization in general. The comparison of
the two provides an estimate of how much of the former paper’s results are driven by
pure trade in goods and how much is other features of globalization. These results
suggest about half from trade and half from other aspects of globalization.

The same exercise is possible for the aggregated country level data. The advantage

   The elasticities are much smaller than Frankel and Romer (1999), which finds a coefficient of
almost 2 on trade shares versus income.

of this approach is that I can draw the time path of the shocks on output as well as
trade. The estimating equation is

where ∆ln(y)it is the change in log per capita income (or trade), M is the number of
lags, γt is a set of year dummies, and ǫijt is an error term. The key right hand side
variable, ln(Xit ), will take on the value of trade or one of the instruments depending
on the specification. The impulse response function is generated by summing the β ′ s
as described in equation (5). All response functions are drawn with a surrounding
band of two standard errors.
   Figure 8 shows the impulse response function of country level trade to the shock
of closing Suez, where the shock is measured as the trade weighted average of the
increase in distance caused by the closing of Suez described in equation (8). Figure
9 shows the impulse response functions of trade when the shock is separated into
the opening and closing.
   These response functions are roughly the same shape as the pair level response
functions in Figures 3 and 4. This is unsurprising since they are an aggregation of
the bilateral data. The first stage results from Table 5 show that the closure of the

canal had a significant impact on aggregate trade. Adjustment after the shock takes
three to four years.
    Identifying the effect on the shock on GDP is somewhat more difficult as there
are two levels of adjustment. First, the shock of closing the canal moves trade with
some lag. Trade may then move GDP with its own lag structure.

                SUEZ SHOCK ⇒ lag ⇒ TRADE ⇒ lag ⇒ GDP

     Estimating reduced form impulse response functions of the static instruments
on GDP will generate the combination of these lag structures. Using the dynamic
predictions for trade will isolate the second lag structure. Using IV regressions to
estimate the impulse response function can also be used to isolate this second lag
structure. The basic idea is to estimate equation (10) using the trade predictions
and lags as instruments.
    Figure 10 shows nine impulse response functions. Each column represents a
different instrument. The first is the simple shock as calculated in equation (8).
The second is the static predictions from the gravity estimations. The third is the
dynamic predictions from the disaggregated trade impulse response functions. The
three rows are first stage, reduced form and IV responses to the instruments.
    The first row is the impulse response of trade on each of the instruments. This is
essentially the first stage of the IV regressions. The shock has a significant impact on
trade with adjustment occurring over three to four years. In all cases, the response
is significantly away from zero at the one percent level by the second year. The

dynamic instrument has a flatter curve, consistent with the instrument already
incorporating the dynamic response to the shock.
   The second row is the reduced form effect of the instruments on income per
capita. For the first two columns the static instruments will capture the combined
lag structure of the Suez shock to trade and trade to GDP. For the dynamic instru-
ment the response function represents just the lag structure from trade to GDP.
Consistent with this, the impulse response functions for the static instruments rise
later and are significantly away from zero only in the sixth year. The response con-
tinues to rise in year six. The response from the dynamic instrument captures only
the lag from trade to GDP and rises faster and is significantly away from zero after
the third year. Income appears to take four to five years to adjust to a trade shock.
   All three IV impulse response functions isolate the lag structure from trade to
GDP. These results also have the advantage of magnitudes that are interpretable as
elasticities of income on trade. For all three instruments the response rises over time
with a peak somewhere near the fourth year. Consistent with the regression results
the peak of the response function is between 0.2 and 0.4 for all three cases. The
response is significantly away from zero in the fourth year in all three cases and in
all the later years for the dynamic instrument. Figure 11 compares the IV impulse
response from the dynamic instrument to the OLS impulse response from using
actual trade (and lags) as the right hand side variable. The shape and magnitude
are similar.
   The use of shocks to trade generated by the closing and reopening of the Suez
Canal provide clean identification on the impact of trade on income. The results


                                            28
suggest that increases in trade volumes generated by decreases in trade costs gener-
ate higher income per capita. The elasticity of income with respect to trade appears
to be about one quarter, with an adjustment period of three to four years. Lags in
the effect on GDP of decreasing trade costs are closer to five years adding in the
response of trade volumes to trade costs.


5    Conclusions
This paper uses the shock provided by the temporary closure of the Suez Canal
as a natural experiment. The movements in trade costs generated by closing Suez
can be usefully thought of as an exogenous shock effecting most countries in the
world. This shock is useful for identifying the impact of trade costs on trade and
furthermore the effect of trade on income. To summarize, the Suez Canal had a
significant and robust affect on bilateral trade patterns. Aggregating these changes
to trade suggests that trade has a significant affect on output.
    The nature of the canal shock makes it unique. First, the shock was sudden and
short term. We have precise dates when the shocks took place. Second, the shocks
are very precisely targeted at trade by sea. Generally when we consider instruments
for trade, they can potentially act through channels that go beyond trade. Since
the variation in this paper is being provided by the Suez closure, any channels other
than trade need to involve bilateral relationships between countries that involve
travel by sea. It is hard to imagine anything other than trade in goods than fits this
description.
   The ability to get clean identification on the effect of trade in goods on output
is potentially useful when considering the effect of policies designed to reduce trade
costs between nations. This paper suggests that while activities that are related
to trade such as foreign direct investment and multinational participation may be
important, simple increases in the raw volume of trade increase income. This may
be useful in evaluating policies intended to increase trade such as tariff reductions.
