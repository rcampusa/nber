The exodus of Soviet Jews to Israel in the 1990s was a unique event. The extraordinary
experience of Israel, which has received migrants from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) at the rate
of 17 percent of its population, within a short time, is also relevant for the current debate about
migration and globalization. The immigration wave was distinctive for its large high skilled
cohort, and its quick integration into the domestic labor market. Among various ethnic groups
the FSU immigrants ranked at the top of intergenerational upward mobility. Immigration also
changed the entire economic landscape: it raised productivity, underpinning technological
prowess, and had significant impact on income inequality and the level of redistribution in
Israel’s welfare state.

                                         Abstract


The exodus of Soviet Jews to Israel in the 1990s was a unique event. The extraordinary

experience of Israel, which has received three quarter million migrants from the Former

Soviet Union within a short time, is also relevant for the current debate about globalization.

The immigration wave was distinctive for its large high skilled cohort, and its quick

integration into the domestic labor market. Immigration also changed the entire economic

landscape: it raised productivity, underpinning technological prowess, and had significant

impact on income inequality and the level of redistribution in Israel’s welfare state.


     1. Background


Immigration has far-reaching economic and social consequences. These include the labor

market, international trade, economic growth, the social and political structure, etc. (see, e.g.,

Lucas (2014) for a recent treatise), as has long been known. Between 1990 and 2012 almost

20m people moved from Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe to richer countries in

Western Europe, about 8 percent of the population of Europe. This east-west migration

accelerated after 2004 when eight eastern European countries, including Poland, the Czech

Republic and Hungary, joined the EU. At the same time Israel received almost 1m
immigrants, about 20 percent of Israel’s population. In both episodes migration borders

restrictions were eased. Both in the Israeli case and within the EU’s borders is the free

movement of people tied to the free movement of trade and capital. However, key differences

between the two episodes, in addition to the relative size of the flow of migrants, are in the

skill levels of the immigrants and the migrant-absorption policies that the receiving countries

embraced.


The unique experience of Israel is vastly different for continuing of the globalization effort,

not only from the recent experience in Europe, but also from the US experience. The core of

the “wall-building” coalition in the US is white males with low educational attainment. Low

income British were far more likely to support Brexit in the UK. The call for a “points based”

immigration system from the Brexit campaign was an explicit call to increase the skill

composition of UK immigrants. How does one explain the recent anti-immigration sentiment

by a simple argument based on first principles? Low-skilled immigrants compete for low skill

native-born jobs, and depress their wages. Furthermore, low-skilled immigrants are also more

likely to be net beneficiaries from the typically generous welfare state; the burden of which

low-skilled workers share. In contrast, high-skill immigrants may increase the productivity of

the low-skilled population and are net fiscal contributors, making them a more attractive form

of immigration. Low-skill segment of the destination-country established population.

Therefore, net fiscal burden involves the discontents with immigration, and would push to tilt

the composition of immigration toward high-skilled workers. Other groups are more likely to

gain from low-skilled immigration. They increase the wages of high-skill workers and do not

necessarily impose a fiscal burden on retirees, who no longer fund the welfare state.

Therefore high skill workers support the globalization course that advanced economies have

taken until the more recent wave of anti-immigration sentiment. In Israel, as we will see, the

political-economy major effect of the 1990s-early 2000s migration wave is on income

1
inequality through the downsizing of the welfare state. But, partly because of successful

integration, no significant anti-migration sentiments emerged.


        The exodus of Soviet Jews to Israel in the 1990s, especially its impacts on income inequality

and the political balance of power vivifies Lucas’s findings.1 Israel is already well known for the

unique ways it absorbs immigrants; who in turn tend to arrive in waves triggered by external shocks.

Each wave has its unique origin, distribution of skills, and often socio-economic characteristics. Thus,

the exodus of Soviet Jews in the 1990s adds useful insights into this ongoing experiment.


        The importance of the Soviet Jewish exodus is perhaps best appreciated in historical

perspective. Immigration to the pre-state Palestine and to the state of Israel came in waves

from the late 19th century onwards.2 During the pre-state era (prior to 1948), immigration

was at times controlled by the British rulers.3 However, immigration was free, and even

encouraged, under the umbrella of the “Law of Return”. Table 2.1 suggests that immigration

at times, especially in the nascent statehood and in the last wave from the Former Soviet

Union (FSU) constitutes about 20% of the established population.

Soviet-Jew immigration of the 1990s stands out from previous waves both because of its

sheer volume and because the economic motivation. The choice, albeit limited by

immigration restrictions of the advanced countries in the West: Australia, Canada, Germany,

was between Israel and the rest, and US. In fact for a portion of would be immigrants, Israel

was a second- choice.


          2. Migration-Pull Forces


The disunion of the Soviet Union and the destruction of communism in the USSR 1987-1991

triggered the recent wave of Soviet Jews (Figure 2.1) to various parts of the world, including

Israel.

All the migrant-destinations were controlled by the migration policies of the receiving
countries; except Israel. Immigration into Israel is free by the Law of Return.

The primary driver of Jewish exodus from Russia 1990-1996 was the Soviet Union’s and

subsequently Russia’s economic collapse, often-dubbed “katastroika”. The Jewish

community sensed the pain, anticipated the danger and fled for this compelling reason, but

also due to the twin threats of a military coup d’tat and civil war. Both the demise of the

Soviet Union and the following exodus in a macroeconomic jargon is a supply side shock,

which triggers sizeable migration flows. The communist regime inaugurated a liberalization

campaign in the political (“demokratizatsiya”), economic (“perestroika”), social and

international spheres (“novoe myshlenie”) that expanded opportunities of many, including the




4
Soviet Jews to increase their welfare.4 However, they were legally barred from leaving the

country until the complete demise of the regime. The prospect of brighter tomorrows in more

stable and advanced , reinforced by mounting political, social and economic turmoil which

raised the risk of civil war, created the specter of a military coup d'etat, threatened economic

collapse.


The Soviet-Union economy ceased growing in 1989 and then plummeted nearly 10 percent in

1990 as enterprise managers focused on privatizing state assets to themselves (“spontaneous

privatization”), liquidating them and transferring balances abroad instead of dedicating them

to current operations.5 Inter-industrial supplies, the backbone of modern economies were

shattered because managers ignored their contractual obligations to intermediate input users.


This was shock therapy in action without Sachs’s conditionality.6 In theory, Soviet managers

who had no experience designing and marketing products to satisfy consumer demand were

expected to transform themselves into efficient competitors under duress. However, they could

not do it. The reality was an economic depression that caused GDP to fall between 37 and 50

percent between 1989 and 1998.7 Full economic recovery was not achieved until 2006.


The Soviet Union’s crumbling sphere of influence in Central Europe and East Germany,

together with the successful secession of the Baltic States alerted the Russian Jewish

community to the wisdom of carpe diem. A window of opportunity had opened, and Jewish

emigres of the 1990s chose to seize the day. Migration waves and growth: bird’s eye



4
  The first hint came in the enterprise reform law of January 1988, which allowed state enterprise managers to
use company funds at their discretion instead of complying strictly with central plans (“tekhpromfinplans”).
Soon thereafter, central plans ceased being obligatory. The stated intention of the enterprise reform law was to
give managers more latitude in dealing with day-to-day operations, but the opportunity to divert funds from
operations and investment to personal consumption and round-a-about insider privatization was not missed
(“kleptostroika”).

considered to be an exogenous variable; a migration-push factor triggered by forces in the origin country. .See

Table 2.3 indicates that the Alyiah produced massive investments, both in residential structures

and in non-residential capital. These investments were so substantial that they increased the

capital to labor ratio and facilitated economic growth. In some cases further aided by the

remarkable human capital brought by the olim. Except for the olim who came during the major

wave of Aliyah immediately after the birth of the state of Israel, the education level of the olim

generally exceeded that of the established population and thus contributed remarkably to

overall productivity. It is also noteworthy that in general the massive investments in physical

capital and infrastructures were financed by capital imports (reflected in persistent current

account deficit), as the olim themselves fled their former homes almost penniless and credit

constrained so that they hardly saved. Table 2.3 shows, for instance, that during the years 1922-

31, when the number of olim each year was about 9.5 percent of the established population,

output increased at the whopping rate of about 16.4% per annum, so that output per capita

increased by a remarkable 7.8 % per annum. Similarly, during the years 1950-51, when the

percentage of olim each year amounted to about 26.1% of the established population, output

increased by about 10% per annum. During the years 1952-63, when the percentage of olim

each year amounted to about 19.4%, output growth was steady, 4.9 percent per anuum. In this

period, capital stock growth rate was 12.8 % and housing stock by 11.6 percent-- a whopping

investment boom. In contrast, during the years 1972-82, when the percentage of olim each year

amounted to about 7.6 output per capita rose by the meager rate of 0.8 % per annum (obviously,

the oil price shock cum Yom Kippur War depressed output growth). In the later years, output

growth was a declining trend the percentage of olim each year amounted to 16.5%, output

growth was meager 2.5 percent per anuum.

Obviously, Table 2.3 is only suggestive for the role played by immigration and the massive

investment, which accompanied its big waves, in growing the economy. Evidently, the

statistics in Table 2.3 reflect the effects of business cycle fluctuations, external shocks, military

conflicts, and the like, in addition to the migration waves.




    3. Migrant Characteristics


The professional, social, attitudinal and behavioral characteristics of the 1990s Jewish exodus

cohort proved to be distinctive. Immigrants came mostly from urban areas, with advanced

education systems. Their skill (education) composition is heavily skewed towards high

education levels; skewness in their relatively higher labor income (see Table 2.2). Their share

in the population was sizable - 14.5%. Their average family size (2.32 standard persons) was

lower than the national average (2.64 standard persons). This indicates fewer dependents. Most

important was their higher education level and consequently their higher labor income. The

average number of schooling years of the new immigrants was 14.0, compared to the national

average of only 13.3.

41.1% among the new immigrants, compared to a national average of just 29.5%. The higher

education level and the lower family size can presumably explain the income gap: the average

labor income per standard person of the new immigrants was NIS 4,351, compared to a national

average of only NIS 4,139. Noteworthy, this gap existed even though the new immigrants had

lower work seniority than the established population.


The educational achievement figures of the immigrants from the FSU are impressive compared

to the EU-15. Relying on data from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and

the OECD, Razin and Sadka (2014) report that only 18% of the stock of immigrants in the EU-

15 in 1990 and 24% in 2000 had tertiary education.

Cohen and Hsieh (2000) show that average effective wages of native Israelis fell and the return

to capital increased during the height of the influx in 1990 and 1991. By 1997 however, both

average wages and the return to capital had returned to pre-immigration levels due to an

investment boom induced by the initial increase in the return to capital. As predicted by the

standard intertemporal model of the current account10, the investment boom was largely

financed by external borrowing. Furthermore, despite the high educational levels of the Russian

immigrants, the Russian influx did not lower the skill-premium of native Israelis. They explain

this effect by the rise in Total Factor Productivity during the 1990s relative to stunningly low

productivity increase through much of the 1970s and 1980s. Eckstein and Weiss (2004)

develop a descriptive methodology for the analysis of wage growth of immigrants that is based

on human capital theory. The sources of the wage growth are (1) the rise of the return to

imported human capital, (2) the impact of accumulated experience in the host country, and (3)

the mobility up the occupational ladder in the host country. Using data on established Israelis

and immigrants from the former Soviet Union of Israel, they estimate Mincer-type wage

equations jointly for the two groups. They find that in the ten years following arrival, wages of

highly skilled immigrants grow at 8 percent a year. Rising return to skills, occupational

transitions, accumulated experience in Israel, and an economy-wide rise in wages account for

3.4, 1.1, 1.5, and 1.5 percent each. They do not reject the hypothesis that the return for

experience converges to that of natives and that immigrants receive a higher return for their

unmeasured skills. We find that there is some downgrading in the occupational distribution of

immigrants relative to that of the established work force.

     5. Upward Intergenerational Mobility and Income Inequality


The second generation of Jews, whose parents immigrated from the former Soviet Union

(FSU), experienced significantly higher upward mobility than all other ethnic groups. As

documented by Aloni (2017), although the general association with parents' incomes within

the FSU group is not very different compared to the population, their mobility relative to the

national distribution is high, and the second generation finds its way even to the top percentiles.

Table 3.1 shows the estimated probability of second generation outranking first generation in

the full sample, and the groups’ relative income rank convergence rates. Having higher

probability to outrank parents highly depends on the relative income position of the group in

the population’s income distribution, thus, for example, Ethiopian and Arab children exhibit

high upward mobility. But, controlling for their initial position, former Soviet Union (FSU)

immigrants to Israel experienced the highest pace of upward mobility, while other groups

converged to the mean slower.

Upward mobility is also indicated in Figure 3.1. The Figure shows the distribution of children

of parents from the bottom decile. Comparing the FSU immigrants and the general population,
11

dispersing more evenly across the deciles.

These documented facts that the FSU group has higher upward mobility, along with the fact

that the Israeli-Arab group experienced slower upward mobility, may increase inequality. This

is because the FSU first generation immigrants’ income is high compared to the population,

while Israeli-Arab families have a lower income mean. Israel’s fast development, facilitated

by the integration into the world economy, and the inflow of high skill immigrants, came at a

cost of growing income inequality, measured by both as market-based and redistribution-based

Gini coefficients. Currently, Israel, along with the US and UK are at the top of market-forces

generated inequality; and they do less than other OECD countries to reduce the inequality

through the redistribution of income.11 See Figure 3.3.

To gauge the size of income redistribution one can subtract the market based Gini coefficient

from the disposable income Gini coefficient. Israel’s relatively high market-based inequality

coefficient, shown in Figure 3.3 , is driven by the large, and increasing, share of two relatively

poor minority groups in the population: Ultra-orthodox Israeli Jews (primarily males), and the

Israeli Arabs (primarily females12), stay out of the labor force. The rise in the share of these



premium”, the gap between the incomes of college-educated workers and those without a college
degree. What we know, however, is that rising inequality is not mainly about the rising skill premium.
Only around a third of the rise in US inequality over the past generation is associated with a rising
premium for education. Economic estimates indicate that the widening of the skill premium itself is
more a result of “skill-biased technological change”, a growing demand for highly educated workers
due to the rising importance of information technology, than a result of globalization.


12
   Yashiv and Kasir (2011) write: “The most prominent phenomenon among Arab women is the high
level of variation in the rate of participation. Its source apparently lies in the differences between “modern” and
“traditional” women from the point of view of education, family status, number of children and proficiency in
various skills (such as knowledge of English and the use of a computer). There appears to be a dichotomy or
some type of dual market, in which “traditional” women almost never participate. This can explain the low rate

14
groups in the total population is because the fertility rates among these minorities are much

higher than the other groups in the population13 In addition, the emergence of highly educated,

economically active large group of Israelis, reinforced by the high skill immigration of Soviet

Jews, made the upper tail of the distribution thicker. Israel is not an outlier in the OECD

countries with respect to the market-driven (pre-tax-cum-transfer) income inequality.

However, Figure 3.4 indicates the time dimension of inequality. Disposable-income inequality

in Israel, was roughly stable until the beginning of the 1990s, rose sharply thereafter, even

though no such change occurs with respect to the market-generated inequality. Israel’s level

of redistribution of income falls short of many other OECD countries. A partial resolution of

the issue, proposed by Razin, Sadka, and Swagel (2002), hinges on the political-economy

effects of a rise in the dependency ratio. On the one hand, a higher dependency ratio means a

larger pro-tax coalition, as the low income groups are net-beneficiary of the transfers from

those who actively participate in the labor market. On the other, a higher dependency ratio puts

a higher tax burden on the people around the median voter, as it is necessary to ﬁnance transfers

to a larger share of the population. People for whom the costs of higher taxes outweigh beneﬁts

shift to the anti-tax coalition. Hence, the second factor dominates in many of other rich

countries. That is, the political-economy equilibrium-tax rate declines when the dependency

ratio rises. This would be the case until society ages enough so that the median voter is retired,

at which point there is a discontinuous jump up in the tax rate and corresponding increase in

the share of transfers. In other words, the increased share of the fiscal net-beneficiaries in the




of participation in comparison to other countries. “Modern” women have quite a high rate of participation,
which also explains the simultaneous increase in participation and levels of education over time, together with
additional cultural changes. The finding that participation rates among Arab women are very different from
those observed in Western countries and among
Jewish women in Israel, though not significantly different from rates in Moslem countries”.

13
   Dahan (2007) explores the main factors behind the steep decline in the participation rate of Israeli men. He
observes four factors responsible for the decline in participation rate between 1980 and 2001: increases in the
population of students (21%), the ultra-Orthodox (21%), the disabled (32%), and discouraged workers (25%).

15
population may have two opposing effects on redistribution policies. On the one hand, the

political influence gained by low-income groups is persistently on the rise. This means that the

median voter preferences shift over time in the direction of more generous welfare state.14 On

the other hand, if the median voter, plausibly, does not belong the low-skill and non-working

groups (as is probably also the case in Israel) then the increased share of the non-working and

low-skill in the population may well lead policy-makers to lower taxes and transfers. Because,

the increased fiscal burden which results for the large share of “net beneficiaries” adversely

affect the median voter (she is a net contributor to the welfare system). The later affect

dominates in Israel. Consequently, the entire redistribution system contracts.

  About the voting right franchise in the US in the 1930s, Meltzer and Richard (1981) conclude: “In recent
years, the proportion of voters receiving social security has increased, raising the number of voters favoring
taxes on wage and salary income to ﬁnance redistribution. In our analysis the increase in social security
recipients has an eﬀect similar to an extension of the franchise.”

        6. Immigrants and the Political System


        Immigrants may also shift the balance of politics among ethnic groups, economic

classes, or age groups, or may generate a massive political backlash. In Israel the political

backlash have been moderate, whereas the change in political balance was substantial.

Israel’s Law of Return grants returnees immediate citizenship and consequently voting rights.

An early study by Avner (1975) finds that the voting turnout rate of new immigrants had been

markedly lower than that of the established population. This means that immigrants did not

fully exercise their voting rights and did not therefore influence the political economy

equilibrium in Israel as much as the established population.



18
           A similar migrant low voting turnout pattern is reported also by Messina (2007) and

Bird (2011) for Western Europe. However, a later study about voting turnout pattern of new

immigrants to Israel in the 2001 elections, conducted by Arian and Shamir (2002) reverse this

finding for 2001. The new immigrants in this study are pre-dominantly from the FSU. Arian

and Shamir (2002) find no marked difference in the voting turnout rates between these new

immigrants and the established population. This is indeed a unique feature of the 1989-2001

immigration waves from the FSU. Relatedly,

Migration differs from the movement of other factor inputs (such as capital flows) in one

fundamental way. Migrants become part of the society of the receiving country, including its

evolving culture and politics. (The Swiss writer Max Frisch ironically declared: “We asked

for workers. We got people instead.”) In Highly developed social welfare system in the

receiving country may greatly complicate matters, as emphasized by Razin, Sadka, and

Suwankiri (2011). While high-skilled and therefore high-wage migrants may be net

contributors to the fiscal system, low-skilled migrants are likely to be net recipients, thereby

imposing an indirect tax on the taxpayers of the destination country. Sooner or later, migrants

may shift the balance of politics among ethnic groups, economic classes, or age groups, or

may generate a massive political backlash. Migrants may change the nature of social

interactions, with shifts in religion, ethnicity, and cultural practices.



        7. Political-Economy Theory16




           To understand better the balance of the political-economic forces at play, one has to

analyze the political-economy forces at play in a general-equilibrium setup. Razin and Sadka

     Based on Razin and Sadka (2017).

19
(2017) provide such a stylized general equilibrium model with free migration, where wages are

endogenous and redistribution policy is determined by (endogenously determined) majority

voting.17 They address the issue of how migration can reshape the political balance of power,

especially between skilled and unskilled and between native-born and migrants, and

consequently to political-economic equilibrium redistribution policy of the welfare state. The

general equilibrium model could provide insights as to how in a “natural experiment” manner,

an external supply-side shock triggers a wave of skilled migration. The shock then can change

wages, migration flows, and political coalitions, so as to reshape the political-economy balance

and the redistributive policies.

            7.1 Human Capital Investment

            There are just two types of workers: “skilled” (with a symbol ) and “unskilled” (with
the symbol ). The wage per unit of labor of a skilled worker is , whereas an unskilled worker
earns a wage of            per unit of labor, where,            1. All native-born ( ) are initially unskilled.
However, a native-born can acquire education at some cost ( ) and becomes skilled. Individuals
differ from one another through their cost of education: there is a continuum of native-born
individuals, distinguished only by their cost of education. For notational simplicity, we
normalize the number of native-born individuals to one. An individual is identified by her cost
of education, so that an individual with a cost of                   is termed a c-individual. We assume for
simplicity that the cost of education is uniformly distributed over the interval , ̅ .

            All native-born individuals are endowed with                 units of a composite good, the single
good in this economy. All individual in elastically supply one unit of labor. If a c-individual
acquires education and becomes skilled, her income18 is (denoted by                    )

                                         1                              1                                .




17
     The model is based on Razin, Sadka and Swagel (2001a,b)
18
     Note that this specification assumes that capital does not depreciate at all.

20
           , where is a flat wage tax rate19;             is a uniform (lump-sum) per capita social benefit;
and is the interest rate – the return to capital. If a c-individual decides not to acquire education
and remain unskilled, her income (denoted by                     ) is

                      1                              1   (3.1)                                                      .

           (Note that                  depends on , whereas           does not)

           Thus, there is a cutoff level of cost, ∗ , so that all c-individuals with                     ∗
                                                                                                             will choose
to become skilled, and all the others (with                      ∗
                                                                     ) will remain unskilled. This   ∗
                                                                                                         is defined by

                                                 ∗
                  1                                  1        1                           1    .                        .

           Upon some re-arrangement, the cutoff level of the cost of education, ∗ , becomes:

                                         1           1           ∗
                                                                      1         .                                       .

           That is,        ∗
                               is solved from the equality between the return to education and its cost. A
 ∗
     -individual is just indifferent between acquiring education (and thereby becoming skilled) or
staying unskilled. Upon further re-arrangement,                       ∗
                                                                          is defined by

              ∗
                                       . (3.2)                                                                          .

           Note that           ∗
                                   may well exceed , which means that those c-individuals with below but
close to      ∗
                  (which is endogenous) actually borrow in order to acquire education. Naturally, the
payoff in terms of the higher wage would more than offset the borrowing cost. For those
individuals                    is negative.

           Also, note that we are employing a static framework within which all economic and
political processes occur simultaneously with no time dimension.20 For instance, we do not
distinguish between the time in which the education is acquired, and the time when the earnings
occur. Similarly, capital earns its return at the same time it is employed.

                                                                          ∗
           The number of c-individuals with                                   is the number of native-born skilled
individuals. Denoting this number by , it follows that
                      ∗

                      ̅
                          . (3.3)                                                                                   .

19
     In an unpublished version razin and Sadka extended the tax to apply to capital income as well.
20
     Such a framework is akin to a steady state in a dynamic model with rational expectations.

21
         Then, the number of native-born unskilled individuals,                           , is thus given by

                 1                . (3.4)                                                                             .

         Aggregate investment in human capital (education), denoted by , and is then given by
                     ∗                      ∗
                         ⋅    ̅                 ̅
                                                    . (3.5)                                                               .

         Therefore, the aggregate stock of physical capital, , is equal to

                             . (3.6)                                                                                  .

         There are also two types of migrants: the skilled who can earn a wage                                 in the host
country, and the unskilled who earn a wage of                              in the host country. None of them has any
initial endowment. The migrants come to the host country after they have already made and
implemented the decision whether to acquire or not acquire education. Thus, it is exogenously
given who is skilled and who is unskilled. In other words, the economy benefits from the skilled
migrants because it does not have to pay for the cost of investment.

          7.2 Income Groups

         The income of skilled and unskilled migrants, respectively, is:

                  1                         (3.7)                                                                         .

, and

                  1                         . (3.8)
                                                                                                                          .


         The income of the native-born as a function of                             is depicted in Figure 3.4. Note that
        declines in a straight line until it reaches                  ∗
                                                                          , where

             ∗                                                ∗
                         1                                        1           1                     1             .

                 The labor income of the unskilled native-born and the unskilled migrants is the
same, but the total income of an unskilled migrant which is 1                                        is definitely below
the income of an unskilled native-born, the difference being the capital income enjoyed by the
unskilled native-born, namely                         1       . The total income of a skilled migrant is definitely
higher than the total income of the unskilled migrant, because of the higher wage earned by the

22
skilled, whereas both have no other income. The income of the skilled migrants exceeds the
income of the skilled native-born with               , but falls short of the income of the skilled native-
born with                 .

The income of a skilled migrant is                   1            , whereas the income of a skilled -
individual is 1                              1       . Therefore, as long as          is positive (i.e. the
 -individual does not borrow in order to invest in human capital), then                       . However,
if                0 (i.e. the individual borrows in order to invest in human capital), then the income
of the skilled migrant (         ) is greater than the income of the skilled native-born (      ). In sum,
we have the following ranking of incomes:

                                  ∗
                                                                                        .

          3.2.3 Supply of Immigrants

          Recall that the country employs an unrestricted migration policy. We envisage an
economy that allows any migrants to come. Thus, the decision whether to immigrate or no rests
solely with the migrant. Each potential migrant has some reservation income, so that she will
migrate if and only if she will be accorded a higher income in the destination country.



23
                 Due to various factors (such as skill, family ties, age, etc.) this reservation
income is not the same, but there is rather a continuum of such reservation incomes.
Distinguishing between the two skills groups, we then assume that there is an upward sloping
supply function for each skill group, depending on the income accorded to immigrants in the
destination country. Denoting the number of skilled migrants by           , the supply function of
skilled migrants is given by an iso-elastic function:

                              (3.9)                                                               .

       , where       and         are some positive parameters. Similarly, the supply function of
unskilled migrants is given by

                               (3.10)

       , where        is the number of unskilled migrants and          and      are some positive
parameters.

       7.3 Production and Factor Prices

       We employ a Cobb-Douglas production function

                         ,        0, 0       1 (3.11)                                             .

       , where      is gross domestic product,     is a total factor productivity (TFP) parameter,
and    is the capital-share parameter (and (1           ) is the labor-share parameter). Symbol
indicates the total labor supply in efficiency units and is given by

                                                         (3.12)                                   .

                 The competitive wage per efficiency unit of labor ( ) and the competitive
interest rate ( ) are given by the marginal productivity conditions

               1                   (3.13)                                                         .

       , and

                             , (3.14)                                                             .



       , where we assume for simplicity that capital does not depreciate.


24
        The model exhibits the standard gains from trade argument. (see the appendix, which
remind us who are gainers and losers from the flow of skilled migrants).




        7.4 Income - Redistribution System

        We employ a very simple system of redistribution. Wages are taxed at a flat rate of .
The revenues are distribution by a uniform per-capita transfer, .

        We assume that the migrants qualify for all the benefits of the welfare state, and they
are naturally subject to the state taxes. Therefore, the government budget constraint is as
follows:

                     1                  (3.15)                                                              .

        , assuming that the government has no other revenue needs, except for redistribution.21
Note that it follows from equation (16) that and             must be of the same sign. A positive wage
tax ( ) allows the government to accord a positive transfer ( ) to all. A subsidy to wages
(namely, a negative ) requires the government to impose a lump-sum tax (negative- ) on all.
When and         are positive, the tax-transfer system is progressive. When they are negative, the
system is regressive.

        With unrestricted migration the flows of migrants                 and       are determined by the
migrants themselves according to their reservation incomes (embedded in the supply functions,
(11) and (12)), and the income accorded to them in the host country. There are therefore only
two policy variables – the tax rate, and the social benefit . However, as the government is
constrained by a balanced budget (condition (16)), it follows that there is essentially only one
policy variables; once          is chosen, all the other economic variables are determined in
equilibrium, including the tax revenue (             ), the number of migrants (           , and     ), and .
Alternatively, alternatively, once        is chosen, all the other economic variables are determined
in equilibrium.




21
  One may wonder why there is no tax on the initial endowment ( ). In a distortive. However, in a dynamic
setting which we mimic in a static framework, represents accumulated savings, and taxing it will be distortive.
Furthermore, because all native-born possess the same initial endowment, taxing it in our static model does not
distribute income across native-born income groups; but taxing amounts to transferring income from the
native-born to the migrants static model such a tax is not.

25
           Choosing        as the single policy variable, we note that there remain 15 endogenous
variables

                                          ∗
                                  , , ,       ,   ,     ,   ,   ,   ,   ,    , , , , .

           There are also 15 equations in the model – (2)-(9) and (10)-(16) - from which the
endogenous variables are to be solved22.

           The policy variable is chosen by some natural and plausible version of a majority
voting, as described below.

           Upon observation, we can see from equations (3.2) and (3.33) that the direct effect of
the tax-transfer policy on the incomes of the unskilled native-born and the unskilled migrants
is the same, and works through the net wage income 1                                 . For the unskilled migrant
this is the only effect of the tax-transfer system. However, for unskilled native-born, there is
also an indirect effect through capital income                      1       (note that   depends on ); but this
indirect effect is of a second-order magnitude compared to the direct effect.

           Similarly, the direct effect of the tax-transfer policy on the incomes of the skilled native-
born and the skilled migrants is the same and works through the net wage income 1
     . Here again, there is also and indirect effect on the income of the skilled native-born (but not
on the income of the skilled migrants) through the capital income                           1      . Here again
the indirect effect is of second-order magnitude.

           Thus, all unskilled (both native-born and migrants) are affected by the tax-transfer
policy mainly through 1                               , whereas all skilled (both native-born and migrants) are
affected mainly by 1                       . It is therefore natural that all the unskilled whose wage is
only          would rather prefer to tax wage income and take advantage of all the skilled whose
wage is higher –          . Thus, the most preferred policy of the unskilled entails a positive tax and
a positive transfer. Therefore, if the unskilled (both native-born and migrants) constitute a
majority, then the political economy equilibrium tax and transfer will be positive – a
progressive tax-transfer system. However, due to the indirect effect, which applies only to the
unskilled native born, the most-preferred tax and transfer policy is not necessarily the same for
the unskilled native-born and the unskilled migrants. We then postulate that when the unskilled



22

form a majority, then the tax-transfer policy chosen is the most-preferred policy by the larger
of the two sub-groups (the unskilled native-born or the unskilled migrants).

       Similarly, the skilled (both native-born and migrants whose wage is higher than the
unskilled) would opt to grant a subsidy to the wage, financed by a lump-sum tax. That is, they
opt for negative     and    – a regressive tax-transfer policy. In this case too, there is also an
indirect effect which applies only the skilled native-born. Thus, the most-preferred tax-transfer
policy is not the same for the two sub-groups of skilled native-born and skilled migrants. In
this case, too we postulate that the political-economy tax-transfer policy is the most-preferred
policy of the larger sub-group.

       Note that indirect effect of the tax-transfer policy, which works through the capital
income, E     c 1          is not the same for all members of the skilled native-born sub-group
(because it depends on ). In this case, we assume that the median voter within this group
prevails.

If we keep all other parameter values constant and increase only the parameter value of       , we
can isolate the effect of a supply side shock. That is, we give a positive shock to the supply of
skilled migrants. We find that number of skilled migrants (           ) rises sharply. The skilled
constitute now the majority                            . As predicted, the political-economy tax-
transfer policy becomes now regressive: and        are negative. That is, there is a wage subsidy
financed by a lump sum tax. In addition, the skilled migrants form the larger of the two skilled
sub-groups, (i.e.          ) and their most-preferred tax-transfer policy becomes now the
political-equilibrium tax-transfer policy. Furthermore, the politically dominant sub-group of
skilled migrants drives out all unskilled migrants (         0), by according them zero disposable
income (       0).
Noteworthy, the unskilled native-born were initially the politically dominant sub-group and
dictated their most-preferred progressive tax-transfer. Following the supply-side stock of
skilled migration, the unskilled native-born lose their dominance to the skilled migrants who
are now dictating their most-preferred regressive tax-transfer policy. Nevertheless, the
unskilled native-born are better off, because the return to their capital income (namely, ) rises
sharply (in unit of the all-purpose composite good). Even though the wage per efficiency unit
falls, the sharp rise in the rate of interest (from 1.55 to 2.94) more than compensates the native-
born unskilled for the wage decline. For the same reason, the skilled (native-born and migrants)



27
are all better off. Thus, except for the unskilled migrants, who are driven out, all other income
groups gain from the skilled-migration supply shock.
Note that the influx of skilled labor raises overall productivity of the labor force; consequently,
it does also raise the tax revenue needed for shouldering the pre-existing redistribution policy.
This force works towards more generous-redistribution, because it is fiscally less burdensome.
Counteracting this pro-distribution force, however, is the rebalancing of the political coalition
triggered by the increased share of higher-income skilled in the voting population. The result
is that the emerging decisive voter reverses the pre-existing redistribution regime.23
It is worth explaining the model specific forces that totally drive out the unskilled migrants in
the wake of the skilled-migration supply shock. The model assumes perfect substitutability
between skilled and unskilled labor in production: each unit of time of an unskilled worker is
equivalent to          units of time of a skilled worker. Thus, unskilled migrants provide no
productivity benefits to the skilled. At the same time, they constitute a fiscal burden Therefore,
the new skilled-dominant coalition drive them out altogether by pushing their disposable
income all the way to zero. The assumed perfect substitutability in production does serve to
highlight the anti-unskilled-migration forces within the ruling skilled coalition.

           7.5 Implications




           The model attempt to rationalize the sharp rise in income inequality following the

Soviet-Jew Exodus shock. It allows us to explore how migration supply side shock alters

immigration patterns and, at the same time, reshapes the political-economy balance we

develop a stylized political-economy model with free migration. Important political-economy

mechanisms are at work: First, the influx of skill-immigrants depresses the incentives for

unskilled migrants to flow in, though they are still free to do so. Second, the fiscal burden of

redistribution policies diminishes from the viewpoint of the decisive voter. That is, the influx

of skilled labor raises overall productivity of the labor force; consequently, it also raises the

tax revenue needed for shouldering a redistribution policy. However, counteracting this pro-

28
distribution force is the rebalancing of the political coalition, because the share of the

increase in the skilled in the population. Therefore, the emerging decisive voter reverses pre-

existing the redistribution regime, notwithstanding the fall in the fiscal burden. Third,

nonetheless, the unskilled native-born may well become well off, even though they lose their

political influence. To sum up, the model prediction are as follows. First, the shock depresses

the incentives for unskilled migrants to flow in, though they are still free to do so. Second,

tax-transfer system becomes less progressive. Third, the unskilled native-born may well

become well off, though they lose their political influence, which they had before the

migration wave. All other native born income groups are also made better off. The positive

economics predictions seem to consistent with data. The model helps interpret these result in

a normative fashion.


       The chapter describes a unique experience of Israel. Within a short time period in the

early 1990s Israel received scores of migrants from the Former Soviet Union (FSU). Its

distinctive feature was the migrants’ high labor skill. It caused a sharp new upward trend of

disposable income inequality but without a parallel change in market income inequality. That

is, the welfare state took a sharp regressive turn. This underscores the role played by the post

migration political balance, which triggered less redistribution.


       Appendix A: Gains to Native-born from Migration

Like international trade in goods, there are gains and losses from the opening of national

borders to labor mobility. A simple figure (Figure 3A.1) can serve to illustrate the gains from

migration in our model. For concreteness, we illustrate the gains to the native-born from low-

skilled migration. For simplicity, we assume that there are no taxes and benefits.

The down slopping curve in this figure is the marginal product of low-skilled labor. This

curve is also the demand for this type of labor.


29
There are S native-born high-skill labor. Free-migration number of high skilled immigrants is

     .


In a closed economy with no migration, the equilibrium high-skilled wage is           .

GDP is equal to the area OGAD, of which the area HGA goes to the high-skill native-born

and the area OHAD goes to the low-skill native-born.

Suppose the high-skill migrants face a reservation wage of            in their countries of origin,

which is below the threshold       . If we allow for a free migration then       high-skilled

migrants will come. The equilibrium wage will be:             . GDP increases to OGCF (to both

native-born and migrants).

An increase measured by the area DACF.

A part of this increase (the area DKCF) goes to the low-skilled migrants, so that the total

gains to all the native-born is the area AKC. Note, however, that not all native-born gain. The


30
income of High -skill native-born drops to the area ORKD, so that they lose the area HAKR.

On the other hand, the income of the high-skill native-born exceeds the loss to the low-skill

native-born.

Therefore, with a perfect, non-distortionary system of redistribution (via lump sums), the

high-skilled native-born can more than compensate the low-skilled native-born, so that all

native-born can gain from migration.

Note also that if the migration of high skill trigger either productivity gains (through external

effects) or an increase in infrastructure investment (through policy effects) the marginal

productivity curve would shift outwardly. Therefore, the wage of high skill under free

migration need not fall.

Because a redistribution system (via wage taxation) is distortionary, the compensation

possibilities are limited. It is not always the case that all native-born gain from migration. A

similar conclusion holds in the case of high-skilled migration.

A striking result in Chapter 2 is that the migration supply shock benefit all income groups

despite of the distortionary redistribution system and driven by political-economy forces.



Appendix B: Numerical simulation of the Migration-Inequality Model

The migration-inequality model, motivated by the Israeli experience with the wave of skilled

migration from the FSU, simulates the effects of a supply shock of skilled migration on the

political economy equilibrium tax-transfer policy.

We start with parameter values that entail the unskilled (both native-born and migrants) as a

majority:                       . This case is described in the first row in Table 3. As

predicted, the political-economy tax-transfer policy is progressive: and      are positive. Also,

the unskilled native-born form a majority of the unskilled:            .

          Since the income of the native skilled population is not constant but a linear function of an individual’s , we report

      this group’s average income. Notice that since the minimal income of a skilled native is equal to that of an unskilled

      native, we have that the income of the skilled immigrants lies in between them.

The political-economy tax-transfer policy is the most-preferred policy by the unskilled native-

born.

We now keep all other parameter values constant and increase the parameter value of         . This

supply-side sock triggers a wave of skilled migration. The results are shown in the second row of

Table 3. The number of migrants (      ) rose sharply from 0.14 to 1.11. The skilled constitute now

the majority:                       . As predicted, the political-economy tax-transfer policy

becomes now regressive: and        are negative. Also, the skilled migrants form the larger of the

two skilled sub-groups, (i.e.         ) and their most-preferred tax-transfer becomes now the

political-equilibrium tax-transfer policy. Furthermore, as can be seen from the second row of

Table 3, the politically dominant sub-group of skilled migrants drives out all unskilled migrants

(        0), by according their zero income (      0). Noteworthy, the unskilled native-born were

initially the politically dominant sub-group and dictated their most-preferred progressive tax-

transfer. Following the supply-side stock of skilled migration, the unskilled native-born lose their

dominance to the skilled migrants who are now dictating their most-preferred regressive tax-

transfer policy. Nevertheless, the unskilled native-born are better off, because the return to their

capital income (namely, ) rises sharply from 1.55 to 2.94 (in unit of the all-purpose composite

good).
