                                            ABSTRACT

Countries around the world differ substantially in the relative importance of their banks and capital

markets in providing investment financing. This paper examines one potential explanation for the

cross-country differences in the importance of banks and capital market financing of investment. It

is our contention that much of the variation across countries in the depth and breadth of capital

markets can be explained by a combination of the existence of deposit insurance and the extent to

which a country's banking system is state owned. We provide both an equilibrium model predicting

and empirical evidence showing that countries with explicit deposit insurance and a high degree of

state-owned bank assets have smaller equity markets, a lower number of publicly traded firms and

a smaller amount of bank credit to the private sector. Finally, our results suggest that the effects of

deposit guarantees are more important than the origins of national legal systems.

1         Introduction

Capital markets serve an essential purpose in the growth and development of modern economies.

They provide for the eﬃcient channeling of funds from savers to investors. There are two

basic methods for financing capital investment: primary issuance of equity or bonds, and

securing of bank loans. Looking around the world, we see that countries diﬀer substantially

in the relative importance of banks and capital markets in providing investment financing.

Equity market capitalization currently ranges from close to zero in countries like Austria,

Argentina and Greece to nearly 2 times GDP in the UK, South Africa and Malaysia. The

importance of bank loan financing is essentially the mirror image of this. What accounts

for the cross-country diﬀerences in the importance of banks and capital market financing of

investment?

        The purpose of this paper is to address this question directly. It is our contention that

much of the variation across countries in the depth and breadth of capital markets can be

explained by a combination of the existence of deposit insurance and the extent to which a

country’s banking system is state owned.

        Because of the importance of financial intermediation, and the diﬃculties associated with

potential bank failures, governments in most countries have established a set of institutional

structures to insure the stability of their banking systems. Primary among these is the

creation of deposit insurance. By insuring deposits, banks’ liability holders are significantly

less likely to request the return of callable deposits, reducing the chances of bank runs. But

at the same time, deposit insurance subsidizes bank risk-taking activities and allows the

payment of lower interest rates to depositors.1 This channels money through banks, and
    1
    See Demirgüç-Kunt and Huizinga (2004) who use a cross-country sample to show that deposit insurance
decreases rates of return paid by banks, reduces market discipline faced by banks and their managers, and
increases banks’ risk taking. Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache (2002) and Demirgüç-Kunt and Kane (2002)
extend this analysis, finding that deposit insurance increases the probability of banking crises and financial

away from financial markets. Direct state bank ownership has a similar impact.2

    We present a simple, three sector model, in which the economy is composed of firms,

banks and households. The firms require operating capital and can obtain it either through

equity issuance or from bank loans. Banks take deposits from households and make loans to

firms, while households both allocate their wealth and purchase the firms’ output. The model

allows us to show how increases in deposit insurance (or the percentage of the banking system

that is state owned) both reduces the size of the capital market and shrinks the amount of

bank credit to the private sector, and may decrease the number of firms seeking equity

financing.

    In order to examine the predictions of the model, we study a data set composed of

49 countries. Of these, 33 currently have explicit deposit insurance and 42 have some state

ownership of banks, ranging from less than 2 percent to almost 90 percent. The data confirm

the predictions of the model. An increase in either state bank ownership or presence of

deposit insurance both decreases the size of capital markets and the extent of bank lending.

For example, we would predict that decreasing the percentage of the banking system that

is state owned from 36%, as it is in Italy, to zero would increase in the size of the capital

market from less than 10 percent to over 30 percent of GDP and a raise in the level of bank

lending from 57 percent to close to 90 percent of GDP.

    Our conclusions are in contrast with those in La Porta, López-de-Silanes, Shleifer and

Vishny (1997), who study the relationship between law and finance. La Porta, et. al note the

importance of the countries’ legal system in determining the structure of the financial system.

In particular, they point out that investors provide capital to firms only if they believe they

will get their money back. For equity holders, this means that they must be able to vote
instability. Finally, Cull, Senbet and Sorge (2004) find that generous deposit insurance may lead to financial
instability in lax regulatory environments.

out directors and managers who do not pay them. For creditors and holders of bonds, this

means that they must have authority to repossess collateral. Furthermore, these nominal

legal rights must be accompanied by confidence that the laws will be enforced. La Porta,

et. al go on to show that the depth of financial markets depends crucially on the degree of

law enforcement in a country and the origin of a countries legal system, which they divide

into four families: English, German, Scandinavian and French. The results we present below

suggest that the extent of state bank ownership and nature of deposit insurance are more

important than the form of legal organization in determining a country’s financial structure.

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The model developed in the section

2 allows us to study the impact of an increase in the level of deposit indemnity in a country.

These implications are tested in section 3 where we provide empirical evidence that deposit

insurance has a detrimental eﬀect on the development of both external capital and private

credit markets. We also find that, once explicit deposit insurance and state-owned bank

assets are introduced into the analysis, the legal family origin variables lose importance

in explaining the diﬀerences between countries in the development of the external capital

markets. Section 4 concludes.



2     The Model

We begin by developing an equilibrium model to study the eﬀects of explicit deposit insurance

and state ownership of banks on equity markets and financial intermediation. Specifically,

the model shows that an increase in depositors’ protection leads households to shift their

assets out of capital markets and into banks, reducing their equity holdings. Furthermore,

an increase in bank deposit insurance also results in (i) a reduction in the amount of bank

credit to firms; and (ii) possibly a lower number of publicly traded firms.

                                              3
   The economy consists of three sectors: manufacturing firms, banks and households. The

production sector is represented by n monopolistic competitors, each of which produces an

imperfectly substitutable good. Firms transform inputs into output, and their knowledge

of this technology is summarized by a parameter we call Ai , and they diﬀer in both their

Ai and their output price, Pi . All agents in the economy are uncertain as to whether the

productivity will be high (Ai ) or low (Ai ) for an individual firm. Each firm’s objective is to

maximize expected profits by choosing either of two sources of external finance -bank loans

or equity issuance- in order to purchase the factors of production.

   In addition to firms, there is a competitive financial sector composed of a representative

bank. The bank has zero expected profits, but may go bankrupt. In the case of bankruptcy

households recover their deposits (or a fraction thereof) depending on the extent to which

the bank is insured.

      Finally, a representative household makes bank and equity investment decisions in order

to maximize expected utility from consumption across diﬀerent states of nature, taking

into account the (known) probabilities of high and low productivity and bankruptcy. The

household’s budget is given by its net returns on assets, which is state-dependent.



2.1      Production

Turning to the specifics of the model, each firm faces a decreasing returns to scale technology

for production and it uses either of the two perfectly substitutable means of financing, exter-

nal capital or bank loans, in order to purchase the inputs for production, before uncertainty

about productivity is revealed. Since the only diﬀerence is the state-dependent productivity




                                               4
Ai , the production function of an individual firm i can be written as:


                                      Y i = Ai (Si + Li )θ                                      (1)

                                      Y i = Ai (Si + Li )θ


where Y i and Y i represent firm i’s production in the high (Ai ) and low (Ai ) productivity

states, respectively (with Ai < Ai ), and 0 < θ < 1. π S is the probability of the low

productivity state (π S = Pr(Ai = Ai )), which is common for all firms.

   We define P (Ai ) as the price of firm i’s commodity, conditional on the state of nature Ai .

Li is the amount of bank loans demanded by the firm and rL its gross interest rate, which is

honored by the firm regardless of whether the productivity level is high or low.

   Moving to the financing decision, we define Si as the equity issued by the firm, and

assume that it pays a required gross return rS and rS to the stock holders in the high and

low productivity states, respectively. F (S) is the fixed cost all firms must incur in order to

issue equity, and this must be paid before the productivity state is revealed. F (S) takes a

value of F if the firm issues stock and 0 otherwise.

   Each firm’s objective is to maximize expected profits:


      (1 − πS )[P (Ai )Y i − rL Li − rS Si − F (S)] + πS [P (Ai )Y i − rL Li − rS Si − F (S)]   (2)


subject to the technology in equation (1).

   For simplicity, we assume that in the low productivity state all firms’ revenues are suﬃ-

ciently low that, in equilibrium, they pay a gross rate equal to zero to the residual claimants




                                                5
(equity holders). This normalization implies:


                                          rS = rS , rS = 0


   Given the nature of the production function each firm will choose to finance its purchases

of inputs exclusively through either equity financing or bank loans, depending on which

source is least expensive. If a firm i decides to finance production through equity issuance,

its expected profits are:

                                                   1     θ        1                    −θ
            [π S P (Ai )Ai + (1 − π S )P (Ai )Ai ] 1−θ (θ 1−θ − θ 1−θ )[(1 − πS )rS ] 1−θ − F   (3)


On the other hand, if the firm chooses to use bank loans, expected profits are given by:


                                                             1    θ       1      −θ
                    [π S P (Ai )Ai + (1 − πS )P (Ai )Ai ] 1−θ (θ 1−θ − θ 1−θ )rL 1−θ            (4)


   Firms choose their means of financing to maximize their profits. It can be easily shown

that firms will choose bank loan financing whenever the gross interest rates is lower than the

expected return they have to pay the share-holders (rL ≤ (1 − π S )rS ).

   If the gross interest rate exceeds the expected gross equity payment (rL > (1−π S )rS ), the

choice between loan and equity financing will depend on the size of the fixed cost of issuing

shares. Combining equations (3) and (4), we can see that the firm will finance production

through equity issuance whenever the following condition holds:

                                     n                −θ       −θ
                                                                   o−(1−θ)

      ei ≡ π S P (Ai )Ai + (1 − π S )P (Ai )Ai and K(θ) ≡ θ−θ (1 − θ)−(1−θ) .

   In those instances in which the inequality in equation (5) fails to hold, firms will obtain

loans to finance their production. We assume that, as a result, k firms choose equity financing

while n − k firms obtain financing from banks. This separating equilibrium, characterized

by the profit maximizing factor demands, is given by:

                            "               # 1−θ

                                 θB
                    Si   =                          , Li = 0, i ∈ {i1 , ..., ik }          (6)

                             θBei 1−θ
                    Li   =             ,                Si = 0, i ∈ {ik+1 , ..., in }
                              rL


   This solution allows us to study the impact of changes in the required rate of return on

firms’ financing decision. In particular, we note that an increase in equity rate of return

rS has two separate eﬀects. First, as rS increases, each firm’s individual demand for equity

falls. And second, a higher rS may lead some firms to shift from equity to loan financing,

thereby reducing k.



2.2    Financial Intermediation

Turning to financial intermediation, we assume the presence of a representative financial

institution, a fraction φ ∈ [0, 1] of which is owned by the government, and the remaining

(1 − φ) is owned by the private sector. The bank has deposit liabilities on which it pays a

gross rate of return rD , that it takes as given. Furthermore, the bank faces a probability

π D of bankruptcy. We make the simplifying assumption that bankruptcy only occurs in the

low productivity state [P rob(Ai = Ai |bankruptcy) = 1] and that in this state households

recover only the fraction of deposits that is covered by insurance. We also assume there

are no reserve requirements, but allow the representative bank to hold excess reserves. This

implies that at all times the total level of deposits (D) exceeds the quantity of loans (L)


                                                    7
                                  P
made by the bank. That is, D ≥      i∈{ik+1 ,...,in }   Li ≡ L.

   The state-owned portion of the representative financial intermediary is backed entirely

by the government. Therefore, in the event of a bank failure the government will step in and

return principal and interest to this fraction of depositors. Assuming that the government

makes zero expected profits from this insurance policy, and that the state-owned portion of

the bank has a (constant) management cost per unit of deposits c1 , the bank’s cost per unit

of deposits is:

                                       cG = c1 + π D rD                                   (7)

where the term π D rD equals the premium rate that the state-owned banks must to pay to

the government.

   For the privately-owned part of the bank there exists the option of acquiring privately

supplied explicit deposit insurance, which insures a fraction λ ∈ (0, 1) of deposits. The

fraction λ captures the fact that not all bank deposits are covered by insurance, and this

coverage may vary substantially across countries. Assuming that this scheme breaks even as

well, the costs for privately owned banks per unit of deposits are:


                                    cP = c2 + λ(I)π D rD                                  (8)


where c2 is the per unit of deposits management costs of private banks, and λ(I) is an

indicator variable which takes the value of λ if the explicit scheme is adopted and 0 other-

wise. Here, the term λ(I)π D rD represents the premium rate per unit of deposits for explicit

insurance purchased by a privately-owned banks.

   The zero profit assumption implies that the gross return on loans must be equal to the




                                                  8
sum of the expected gross payoﬀ to depositors and the intermediation costs:


                           rL L = [(1 − πD )rD + φcG + (1 − φ)cP ]D                         (9)


   Substituting equations (8) and (9) into the right-hand side of equation (10) and dividing

through by L, we obtain an expression for the gross loan rate charged by the financial

institution:
                                                                      D
                            rL = [(1 − π ∗D )rD + φc1 + (1 − φ)c2 ]                        (10)
                                                                      L

where π ∗D = π D (1 − φ)[1 − λ(I)] is the actual probability that asset holders will not receive

their bank deposits back. Clearly, π ∗D is lower when there is explicit deposit insurance and

when a higher proportion of the bank is state owned, as both of these reduce the probability

that the bank will default on its deposit liabilities.



2.3    Households

The representative household’s objective is to maximize expected utility from the consump-

tion of the n commodities produced by the firms. Income is provided by the net return on

assets, which will depend on the particular state of nature. There are three possible outcomes

that concern the household. In the first, when there is a high productivity state, the house-

hold receives returns on their equity investments as well as having its bank deposits returned

safely. In this case, which occurs with probability (1 − π S ), income is (rS − 1)S + (rD − 1)D.

The second possibility, which occurs with probability (πS − π ∗D ), is that productivity is in

the low state, and so equities return nothing, but bank deposits are returned. This leads to

an income of (rD − 1)D. Finally, with probability π ∗D equities return nothing and banks are

bankrupt without insurance, and so income is zero.



                                                9
      Assuming that households have power utility, they will maximize:

                                             1                          1

subject to the budget constraints:

                                P (A)C(A) = (rD − 1)D                                    (13)

      W is the agent’s total wealth (which we assume fixed), γ is the inverse of the coeﬃcient

of relative risk aversion, α is the elasticity of substitution between goods in utility and πS

and π∗D (as defined in subsections 2.1 and 2.2) are the positive probabilities faced by the

household of losing its entire investment in stock shares and bank deposits, respectively.

      It is straightforward to verify that the household’s demand for each asset will depend

directly on the asset’s own rate and inversely on the probability of default by the issuer.3

2.4       Comparative Statics and Testable Implications

       We are interested in using the model to study the impact of both the introduction of

an explicit deposit insurance system and an increase in the share of the banking system

owned by the state on firm financing. In particular, we study how each of these institutional

changes aﬀects the number of firms issuing equity, the extent of issuance and the amount of

bank credit extended.

       In the model, explicit deposit insurance exists when the variable λ(I) in equation (8) is

greater than zero. We study this in three steps. First, we examine the impact on the house-

hold’s asset allocation decision, second we look at the consequence of the firm’s financing

decision, and finally we ask about the eﬀect on bank lending activity.

       Looking at the household, we see that an increase in λ(I) lowers π ∗D , the probability that

banks will not return depositor balances. Keeping k, the number of firms issuing equity,

fixed,5 reduces π ∗D by π D (1 − φ)λ, causing the asset holder to shift wealth away from equity

towards bank deposits. For a given rD , equity market equilibrium will require a higher yield

on stocks and a lower issuance of equity by individual firms.

       By changing the required rate of return on equity, the introduction of deposit insurance

will also change the firm’s financing decision. This is ambiguous, and we do not know whether

fewer firms will issue equity following the change. To see why, consider the marginal equity

issuing firm as defined by the condition in equation (5). This firm faces an increase in the

required return on equity that it would issue, but may also face an increase in the interest rate
   4
      The reader is referred to Blanchard and Kiyotaki (1987) for an analogous derivation of the equilibrium
in the goods market.
    5
      The model described in Section 3 does not give us an unambiguous answer as to whether or not k remains
fixed. However, we assume for the comparative staics exercise that k remains unchanged to facilitate the
analysis.


                                                    11
charged by the bank for a loan. If the increase in the expected return on equity, (1 − π S )rS ,

is larger than the increase in the loan rate, rL , then the marginal firm will turn from equity

to loan financing.

    Turning to the bank, we see that implementation of a deposit insurance system creates

an increase in the demand for bank deposits by the households, lowering π ∗D . As a result,

the loan rate rL will increase for a given k, thereby reducing bank loans to the representative

firm.

    Increasing the share of bank assets owned by the state is analogous to the introduction

of explicit deposit insurance. To see why, consider an increase in the parameter φ. Again,

π ∗D falls, raising the level of bank deposits and increasing the loan rate charged to firms. The

impact of the representative firm’s decision to issue equity is still ambiguous, although those

that do issue, reduce the amount.

    These comparative statics results provide us with three testable hypotheses. Looking

across countries, we expect to see that those with either explicit deposit insurance or high

levels of state-bank ownership should have less equity issuance, a lower level of bank loan

financing, and possibly fewer publicly traded firms. We now take these predictions to the

data.



3       Empirical Results

We now proceed to examine the impact of deposit insurance and state-bank ownership on

financial markets using a cross-sectional data set composed of 49 countries. Our data sources

are described in the data appendix. Our empirical tests are based on regressions of the size of

external capital markets, the number of firms issuing equity and the extent of bank lending

on measures of the extent of state ownership of banks and the presence of explicit deposit

                                               12
insurance. We also include a set of controls, including measures of the growth and level of

GDP. As noted by La Porta, López de Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny (1997), these variables are

likely to contribute to the degree of development of equity and debt markets in an economy.

Because of the linkage between law enforcement and the degree of external finance, we also

include the LLSV’s index measuring the “Rule of Law.”

   We are interested in explaining variation in the ratio of (publicly held) stock mar-

ket capitalization to gross national product (External Capital/GNP), the ratio of bank

credit extended to the private sector to gross domestic product (Private Credit/GDP) and

the ratio of domestic firms listed in a given country to its population (Listed Domestic

Firms/Population). For each of these, we look at three sets of explanatory variables. In our

baseline specification, we regress each one of the variables of interest on the controls, the

share of state-owned bank assets (as the proxy for implicit insurance) and a zero-one dummy

variable to account for the presence of explicit deposit insurance. This provides our baseline

set of results.

   Next, we study the relative importance of deposit insurance and state ownership on the

one hand and legal origin on the other. To do this, we first look at regression including only

the legal origin dummy variables (French, German and Scandinavian), and the controls. To

this we then add the deposit insurance measures.



3.1     Equity Market Size

Table 1 displays our results using External Capital as a ratio to GNP as the dependent

variable. If we only consider deposit insurance and state-owned bank assets (jointly with

the control variables) as regressors (labeled “Specification 1”), the results are as predicted

by the model. Both explicit deposit insurance and state ownership are negatively correlated

with on the ratio of the stock market capitalization to gross national product, although only

the coeﬃcient on the latter is statistically significantly diﬀerent from zero (at the 1% level).

Looking at the Specification 3, we see that this result is robust to including the legal origin

dummy variables; the coeﬃcient of state owned banks slightly changes from -0.676 to -0.602,

but it remains significant at the 1% level.

   Another important observation is that the legal origin variables lose explanatory power

when deposit insurance and state-owned bank assets are incorporated into the model. In the


                                                       14
absence of the insurance variables, all of the legal origin dummies are significantly diﬀerent

from zero at the 5% level (with “French” being significant at the 1% level). When deposit

insurance and state-bank ownership are included in the estimation, only the coeﬃcient of

French legal origin remains significantly diﬀerent from zero at the 10% level. In fact, in

Specification 3 we cannot reject the null hypothesis that all of the legal origin coeﬃcients

are jointly equal to zero (using a chi-squared test with heteroskedastic consistent errors) at

the 10% level. This suggests that the cross-country variation in the size of external capital

markets is better explained by the presence or absence of explicit or implicit deposit insurance

than it is by the origin of legal systems.

   What are the quantitative implications of these results? In tables 2.A and 2.B we examine

two subsamples of countries: the Euro Area and Latin America. For the countries in each

subgroup, we present an estimate of the amount of the potential change in the external

capital/GNP ratio if these countries were to reduce their level of state-ownership of banks

to a benchmark level. For the Euro Area the benchmark is the percentage of state-owned

bank assets of the United Kingdom, whereas for the Latin American countries we use Chile

as the comparison.

   The results in these tables suggest that most Euro Area countries (especially Austria,

Italy, Germany, Portugal and Belgium) would experience significant increases in the ratio

of external capital markets to GNP if they were to privatize their banking systems. For

example, we predict that if Italy were to privatize its banks, the external capital/GNP ratio

would move from 0.08 to 0.30. Similarly, all of the Latin American countries in the sample

(primarily Argentina, Venezuela and Colombia), could experience a rise in the size of their

external capital markets if they would move closer to Chile. By our estimates, Argentina

and Venezuela would sustain increases similar to those of Italy.



3.2    Credit to the Private Sector

Table 3 presents the results of the three specifications of the model using the Private Credit-

GNP as the dependent variable. As predicted by our model, we see that Private Credit/GNP

is lower in countries with explicit deposit insurance and a high proportion of state-owned

banks. The results reported in Specification 1 show that both coeﬃcients of interests are

negative and statistically significantly diﬀerent from zero at the 5% level. Once again, the

results are robust to incorporating the legal origin dummy variables.

   As in the previous case, the significance of the legal origin variables is sensitive to the

inclusion of the deposit insurance variables. Introducing the explicit insurance and state-

owned bank assets regressors causes the German legal origin variable to become significantly

positive at the 5% level (the wrong sign), whereas the Scandinavian legal origin variable is

no longer diﬀerent from zero at the 1% level.

   To gauge quantitative importance, we again compare the Euro Area and Latin American

countries to the U.K. and Chile, respectively. In addition, we combine this eﬀect with the


                                                       17
elimination of the explicit deposit insurance scheme to get approximate ranges for the po-

tential levels of the Private Credit/GDP ratio. Again, we find sizeable eﬀects, with increases

in overall private credit by the order of 30% of GDP for many of the countries.

   These results are consistent with the findings of Demirgüç-Kunt and Huizinga (1999) and

Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache (1999) who conclude that explicit deposit insurance has a

demonstrably detrimental eﬀect on financial intermediation. They are also consistent with

evidence that less developed financial markets tend to exhibit a higher government ownership

of banks, as presented by Barth, Caprio Jr. and Levine (1999), La Porta, López de Silanes,

Shleifer and Vishny (2000) and others.



3.3    Number of Firms Financed Through Equity Market

Table 5 presents the results of the three specifications, using Listed Domestic Firms per one

million inhabitants as the dependent variable. Our model yields no clear prediction on the

sign of the likely aﬀect. What we find is that considering only explicit deposit insurance

and state-owned bank assets as regressors, the coeﬃcients of both variables are negative and

deposit insurance has a statistically significant (at the 5% level) eﬀect on Listed Domestic

Firms/Population. This latter result is robust to including the legal origin dummy variables

in specification 3. The coeﬃcient of the explicit deposit insurance variable is equal to -

22.4 in the absence of the legal origin dummies and it changes to -18.4 once these variables

are included in the regression, but it still remains significant at the 5% level. Controlling

for income, growth and law enforcement, countries that have an explicit deposit insurance

system have, on average, between 18 and 22 less publicly traded firms per million inhabitants

than they would otherwise.

   Again, the legal origin variables lose their explanatory power when incorporating deposit

insurance and state-owned bank assets into the model. Once the latter variables are included

in the regression, the French and German legal origin dummies are no longer significant at

the 1% level (although they stay significant at the 5% level), whereas the Scandinavian legal

origin variable is no longer significant at the 10% level. The null hypothesis of all legal origin

coeﬃcients being jointly equal to zero fails to be rejected for the 5% significance level, but

it is rejected for a 10% level.

3.4       Testing for endogeneity

Summarizing the results of the previous three subsections, we find there is evidence sup-

porting the hypothesis of an adverse eﬀect of both explicit and implicit deposit insurance

(controlling for GNP, growth and law enforcement) on the development of external finance.

In particular, the presence of deposit insurance schemes is associated with a less developed

equity market, a lower number of domestic firms per capita, and smaller amount of bank

loans extended to the private sector.

   In this last subsection we examine if countries with more restrictions to the capital

market exhibit a larger degree of participation by the government in bank asset holdings.

Specifically, we run the regression of state ownership of banks on three indices: antidirector

rights, creditor rights and one share-one vote rules, all of which we normalize to be between

0 and 1. These indices give information about the level of investor protection in each country

and were obtained from Tables 2 and 4 of La Porta, López de Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny

(1998).

   The estimation yields the following outcome (p-values are in parenthesis):

   SBA = 0.462 - 0.447ADR + 0.023SV + 0.146CR

            (0.00) (0.01)         (0.80)      (0.15)               R2 = 0.144

   where SBA stands for state-owned bank assets; ADR for anti-director or shareholders’

rights; SV for one-share one-vote and CR for creditors’ rights.

   The results are mixed: the evidence suggests that countries with a higher level of share-

holder protection exhibit a significantly smaller participation of the government in financial

intermediation, whereas this participation is larger in countries with a higher degree of pro-

tection of creditor rights, although it is only significant at the 15% level.

   We also test the null hypothesis that the sum of all coeﬃcients of the indices is signifi-



                                               21
cantly diﬀerent than zero, and we fail to reject it at the 10% level. Hence, we cannot conclude

that, overall, a higher degree of investor protection is associated with higher state-ownership

of bank assets.

    From this exercise, we find that the data does not significantly suggest that countries

with higher degree of capital market restrictions exhibit larger holdings of bank assets by

the government. Hence, there is little evidence of the presence of simultaneity bias in the

estimates.



4     Conclusions

The provision of a government safety net to bank depositors through either explicit deposit

insurance or implicitly through state ownership of bank assets has both costs and benefits.

In this paper we examine the impact of deposit guarantees on the development of external

financing, such as equity issuance and bank credit to the private sector. We begin with an

equilibrium model in which firms finance production either through equity issuance or bank

loans, households allocate wealth between equity and bank deposits, and banks have deposit

liability and make loans. The model predicts that an increase in deposit insurance, either

implicit or explicit, will reduce both equity issuance and bank financing of firms, and may

reduce the number of firms issuing equity. The reason for this is straightforward. Increasing

depositor’s protection makes bank deposits more attractive than the (riskier) equity shares,

requiring higher rates for the latter and resulting in a lower issuance of stocks. Bank credit

extended to the private sector will also fall in the presence of either explicit or implicit deposit

insurance, as a consequence of a less eﬃcient intermediation process (higher intermediation

costs).

    We provide empirical results based on a cross section of 49 countries. The data are


                                                22
consistent with the predictions of the model, as we find that countries with more extensive

bank deposit insurance tend to have smaller capital and financial markets and a lower number

of publicly traded firms per capita. In contrast to previous work by La Porta, López-de-

Silanes, Vishny and Shleifer, we suggest that these eﬀects are more important than the

origins of a country’s legal system.



Technical Appendix

The comparative statics analysis performed in subsection 2.4 relies on the fact that the rep-

resentative household’s demand for bank deposits and equity rises with their own return rate

and decreases with the probability of default by banks and equity issuing firms, respectively.

In this appendix we show that the household’s demand for bank deposits will depend directly

on the deposit rate and inversely on the probability of default by the banks. An analogous

proof can be performed to show that equity demand depends directly on the equity return

rate and inversely on the probability of default by the firms.

Rearranging terms yields:

     µ            ¶                                    µ      ¶ ∗

             +Ψ −1     = Ψ (rS − rD ) + (rD − 1)     −                                (A5)
         1−γ        rD                             D     1 − γ π∗D


   Since γ > 1, Ψ−1 > 0, and assuming rS > rD in order to achieve a non-zero demand for

equity in equilibrium, we have:


              −2γ                                                −γ
                  + Ψ−1 − 1 > 0 ; Ψ−1 (rS − rD ) + rD − 1 > 0 ;     >0
              1−γ                                               1−γ


which implies:
                                     dD      dD
                                         >0;       <0
                                     drD     dπ ∗D

   Hence, demand for bank deposits depends directly on its own return rate and inversely

on the probability that asset holders will not receive their bank deposits back.

Data Appendix

The data for Explicit Deposit Insurance comes from Table I of Demirgüç-Kunt and De-

tragiache (2002), Table I of Demirgüç-Kunt and Huizinga (2004) and the Data Appendix

from Cull, Senbet and Sorge (2004). A value of ‘1’ is assigned to countries who had an

explicit deposit insurance system in place in 1994. The Index of the share of assets of

the top 10 banks owned or controlled by the government is obtained from Table 2 of La

Porta, López-de-Silanes and Shleifer (2000). For this variable, we considered their measure

for government ownership of banks, which is defined as the percentage share of the assets

of the top 10 banks in a given country owned by the government of that country in 1995,

divided by 100.

   P rivate Credit is the ratio of bank debt held by the private sector to GDP, measured for

1996 (except for the case of Nigeria, where the data is from 1994. This ratio was obtained

from the International Financial Statistics Yearbook, edited by the IMF by dividing the sum

of entries 32d-g by entry 99b.

   The remaining information was obtained from Table II of LLSV (1997). External Capital

is the ratio of the stock market capitalization held by minorities to gross national product,

for 1994. Domestic F irms stands for the ratio of domestic firms listed in a given country

to its population (in millions), for 1994.

   Legal F amily identifies the legal origin or Commercial Law of each country, where ‘1’

stands for English, ‘2’ for French, ‘3’ for German and ‘4’ for Scandinavian origin. Rule of

Law is an index of the assessment of law and order tradition in a country (average between

1982 and 1995). GDP growth is the average annual growth of gross domestic product

between 1970 and 1993 and Log GNP is the logarithm of gross national product for 1994.
