                                               ABSTRACT

         This paper contains a review of the burgeoning research that has been designed to shed light on
how the art auction system actually works and what it indicates about price formation. First, we find that
in recent years returns on art assets appear to be little different from returns on other assets. In addition,
some researchers have found that because of the weak correlation between art asset returns with other
returns, there may be a case for the inclusion of art assets in a diversified portfolio. Second, we find
evidence of several anomalies in art market pricing. The evidence clearly suggests that, contrary to the
view of the art trade, "masterpieces" underperform the market. In addition, there is considerable evidence
that there are fairly long periods in which art prices may diverge across geographic areas and even auction
houses. Third, we review the public record of the criminal trial of Sotheby's former Chairman, who was
accused of price fixing, to show how the collusion with Christie's, the other great public auction house,
was actually engineered. Contrary to the way the proceeds from the settlement of the civil suit in this case
were distributed, we show that buyers were almost certainly not injured by the collusion, but that sellers
were. In addition, based on the public record of settlement, it appears that the plaintiffs in the civil suit
were very handsomely repaid for their injury. Finally, we review the extensive research on the effects of
the auction institution on price formation. There is now considerable theoretical research on strategic
behavior in auctions, much of it in response to empirical findings, and we review three key findings.
First, the evidence suggests that art experts provide extremely accurate predictions of market prices, but
that these predictions do not optimally process the publicly available information. Second, high reserve
prices, and the resulting high unsold ("buy-in") rates are best explained as optimal search in the face of
stochastic demand. Third, extensive research has documented that the prices of identical objects are more
likely to decline than to increase when multiple units are sold, and this has led to considerable theoretical
research. Subsequent empirical research has tended to document declining demand prices even when the
objects are imperfect substitutes.

   The value of most important works of art is established by public auction, either

directly, by an actual sale, or indirectly, by reference to other sales. How the auction

system works is thus a critical determinant of how the public’s preferences are

translated into the evaluation of artistic work. The auction system is thus central in

the determination of the incentives for artistic work, and the efficiency of the auction

system is a key determinant of the cost of creating and distributing works of art.

   This paper contains a review of the burgeoning new research of the last decade

that has been designed to shed light on how the art auction system actually works,

what it indicates about price formation, and how well it performs. We begin the paper

with a description of the mechanics of the auction system. We organize the remainder

of our discussion around four major topics. First, we review what the data have

shown about movements of art asset prices over time. Art objects are generally

unique, so that measuring time-series movements in their prices requires careful

measurement and extensive data. A primary goal of the measurement of time-series

movements in art prices is to evaluate the benefits of including art assets in a balanced

investment portfolio, and we review the key findings on this topic next. We find that

in recent years returns on art assets appear to be little different from returns on other

assets. In addition, some researchers have recently found that because of the weak

correlation between art asset returns with other returns, there may be a case for the

inclusion of art assets in a diversified portfolio. Since the key parameters for making

this decision are difficult to estimate, this issue deserves far more research.

   A second primary topic is the study of potential anomalies in art market pricing.

The evidence clearly suggests that, contrary to the view of the art trade,

“masterpieces” underperform the market, although the precise interpretation of this

finding is still open for study. In addition, there is considerable evidence that there


                                                                                            3
are fairly long periods in which art prices may diverge across geographic areas and

even auction houses.

   A third area of research, where public interest has been particularly great in the

past few years, is the role of the competitive behavior of the auction houses in the

determination of prices. We review the public record of the criminal trial of

Sotheby’s former Chairman, who was accused of price fixing, to show how the

collusion with Christie’s, the other great public auction house, was actually

engineered. Contrary to the way the proceeds from the settlement of the civil suit in

this case were distributed, we show that buyers were almost certainly not injured by

the collusion, but that sellers were. In addition, based on the public record of

settlement, it appears that the plaintiffs in the civil suit were very handsomely repaid

for their injury by the auction houses.

   Finally, we review the extensive research on the effects of the auction institution

on price formation. There is now considerable theoretical research on strategic

behavior in auctions, much of it in response to empirical findings, and we review

three key findings. First, the evidence suggests that art experts provide extremely

accurate predictions of market prices, but that these predictions do not optimally

process the publicly available information. Second, high reserve prices, and the

resulting high unsold (“buy-in”) rates are best explained as optimal search in the face

of stochastic demand. Third, extensive research has documented that the prices of

identical objects are more likely to decline than to increase when multiple units are

sold, and this has led to considerable theoretical research. Subsequent empirical

research has tended to document declining demand prices even when the objects are

imperfect substitutes, although the empirical analysis required in this case must be

much more sophisticated.

1. The Mechanics of Art Auctions

       Historically, the major auctioneers of art have been the English houses of

Sotheby’s and Christie’s. These houses, along with other smaller houses such as

Phillips in England and regional auction houses elsewhere, such as Butterfields in

California, have invented and refined the rules of what have now come to be called

“English” or “ascending price” auctions. Almost all art is auctioned in this ascending

price format. Bidding starts low, and the auctioneer subsequently calls out higher

and higher prices.1 When the bidding stops, the item is said to be “knocked down” or

“hammered down”, and the final price is the “hammer price.”

       Not all items that have been put up for sale and “knocked down” have been

sold. Sellers of individual items will set a secret reserve price, and if the bidding does

not reach this level, the items will go unsold. Auctioneers say that an unsold item has

been “bought-in.” As we show below, sale rates vary tremendously across time and

across different types of auctions

       An item that has not been sold is rarely, if ever, actually bought by the auction

house. It may be put up for sale at a later auction, sold elsewhere, or taken off the

market. It is a part of the auctioneer’s art to “get the bidding started,” and this may

involve accepting fictitious bids (“off the chandelier” or “from the order book”) so

long as the bidding has not exceeded the reserve price. Legally, the auctioneer is

bidding on behalf of the seller when this occurs, but must refrain from accepting

further bids on behalf of the seller once the bidding exceeds the reserve price.

       Auction houses differ with respect to whether they announce during the sale

whether an item has been “sold” or is merely “knocked down” and is unsold. In New

York, all the auction houses have been compelled by law since the early 1980s to




                                                                                          5
announce whether the bidding has resulted in a sale. The practice elsewhere varies by

location and auction house, but there has clearly been a slow movement toward

adopting the practice originally enacted by law in New York. While difficult, it is

sometimes possible during an auction, if one listens carefully, to determine whether

an item has been sold or “bought in.”

        Prior to an auction, it is common for a pre-sale catalogue to be published with

information on the individual items coming up for sale. Included in the pre-sale

catalogue is information on the title of a painting, the artist, the size of the painting,

and the medium. The auction houses also publish a low- and a high-price estimate for

the work. The auction house does not publish, and indeed is very secretive about, the

seller's reserve price for the work of art. The auction houses do commonly observe an

unwritten rule of setting the secret reserve price at or below the low estimate, but the

auctioneer is very careful about revealing anything about the reserve price during the

bidding process.

        Auction houses earn income primarily from commissions charged to buyers

and sellers. The commission charged to buyers is called the “buyer’s premium.” The

total sale price to the buyer is thus the sum of the “hammer price” and the buyer’s

premium. In recent years published buyer’s premiums have typically hovered around

10% to 17.5% of the hammer price of an object, but they are often lower for large

purchasers. Although buyers may attempt to negotiate special arrangements

regarding buyer’s premiums, it is our impression that the typical buyer purchases such

a small fraction of the objects on sale at a particular auction house that special terms

for buyers are unusual.

 What is called an English auction is, in fact, Roman. The word auction comes from the Latin
“auctio,” which means to ascend.


                                                                                               6
       Sellers also pay a commission to the auction house called the ”seller’s

commission.” Although the seller’s commission is often stated as a percentage of the

hammer price (typically 10%), it is our impression that actual seller’s commissions

are often negotiated arrangements that differ by seller. In some cases, sellers pay no

commission and may even be guaranteed a minimum sale price. Some key issues

related to the negotiation of seller’s commissions, and the extent of competition and

collusion in the setting of commission rates have recently surfaced in the trial of

Alfred Taubman, former Chairman of Sotheby’s, who was convicted of price fixing.

We discuss issues related to competition among auction houses in more detail below.

2. Art Price Indices

               A key feature of art auctions is that the items on sale are typically

unique, or nearly so. The result is that there will be some ambiguity in the

construction of a single index of the movement of prices over time. One concern

about simply using average prices is that price rises may be exacerbated during booms

as “better” paintings may come up for sale. For example, Wynne Kramarsky, whose

family formerly owned Van Gogh’s “Portrait of Dr. Gachet,” said of the London

market prior to the poor sale of May 15, 1990: “’I did not think that London was poor

in terms of performance; I thought that the pictures were not up to it.’” (Watson,

1992, p.10) In general average prices will indicate variability over time in art prices

that is better described as movements in the heterogeneity of the quality of the objects

offered rather than movements in prices.

       The extent of heterogeneity, and thus the ambiguity in the construction of

auction price indices, differs across the items typically offered for sale by auction.

Identical prints may be offered for sale monthly, while identical Impressionist




                                                                                          7
paintings, such as the “Portrait of Dr. Gachet” may not be offered at all in a single

decade.

        Most art auction indices are based on a model where the price of the ith object

sold in time period t is

                                       pit=pi+pt+εit,

where pi is the fixed component of the price that reflects the unique and fixed

character (or “quality”) of the object, pt reflects the index of aggregate movements in

prices, and the remainder is an idiosyncratic error term. The key distinction in the

construction of price indices is whether the fixed component is treated as determined

by a small number of hedonic characteristics, x, that may be controlled by regression,

or whether it is treated as a parameter that must be controlled explicitly.

        “Hedonic models” control for the fixed effect pi with the assumption that

pi=βxi + εi, where εi is an error term independent of the pt’s, and estimate

                                    pit=βxi+pt+ εi + εit

Alternatively, “repeat sale” models include a dummy variable for each painting.

        The great attraction of hedonic models is that all the data may be used in the

estimation, including data on objects that are only offered for sale once in the sample

period. The disadvantage of these models is the strong assumption that a (typically

small) set of x variables captures much of the variability in the fixed components of

price (important if the estimates of the time effects are to be precise) and that the

characteristics of the objects offered do not vary systematically over time (important

for unbiased estimates of the time effects). Although the repeat sale method

overcomes the primary disadvantages of the hedonic model, it does so at the cost of

discarding much data. There must be at least two observations on a painting’s price

or it provides no information to help identify the time index. Indeed, depending on the



                                                                                          8
frequency at which repeat sales occur, it may not be possible to identify all the time

effects in the model. For example, in our own data on Impressionist and Modern

paintings, our hedonic model incorporates as many as 8792 observations, while the

repeat sale estimates are based on only 474 observations.

       Comparisons of the results from repeat sale and hedonic models have been

reported by Chanel, Gerard-Varet, and Ginsburgh (1996). The overall results

indicate that both hedonic and repeat sales regressions yield estimates of real rates of

return in art assets over long intervals that are the same magnitude. In some cases the

hedonic model may also provide adequate estimates of time-series movements in

aggregate prices. The danger remains that systematic movements in the unobserved

characteristics of the objects being offered for sale may bias the results.

       The nature of possible systematic movements is made clear when we do a

detailed comparison using our data on Impressionist and Modern Art. When yearly

price indices are constructed, the two types of indices at first appearance are very

similar. Figure 1 presents a graph of the hedonic and repeat sales price indices for

Impressionist and Modern art from 1980 to 1991. The correlation between the two

estimates is .9559, the standard deviation of the hedonic price index is 1.024, and the

standard deviation of the repeat sales index is 1.166. However, because of

movements in the very last year, the two indices give very different internal rates of

return. The hedonic index gives a real return of about 4%, while the repeat sales price

index results in a real return of about 9%! Which is correct? For 1991, our data ends

in May. The “major” impressionist sales are generally held in October. One

explanation is that the hedonic index has underestimated the returns for this short

period of time, because it was unable to correct for quality differences that occur

during sales in the early part of the year. An alternative explanation is that because



                                                                                           9
the repeat-sales index is based on such a small number of paintings during that period,

these paintings were unrepresentative (i.e. their price held up better in poor market

conditions) of the market as a whole.

       One can also measure the extent to which one type of index deviates from the

other. Suppose, for example, that the repeat sales index, x, is the true index, and x* is

a measured hedonic index, where

                                            x*=x+v*

If x were not measured with error then a regression of x* on x would give a slope of

unity. If not, the difference from unity provides an estimate of the measurement error

as a fraction of the total variance in the hedonic index. (A more complex model

would have x measured with error, but uncorrelated with v*, say as a result of

sampling error.) Computing the above regression, we find that x has a coefficient of

.8400, and a standard error of .086, thus indicating statistically significant

measurement error. The implication is that about 16% of the variance in the hedonic

measure of prices is measurement error.

time frames, the returns can vary. The variation reflects differences in data, along

with differences in method. It is difficult to come to any broad conclusions about the

differences in estimates when using repeat-sales or hedonic indices. Anderson (1974)

finds a real return of 2.6% using hedonic indices and 3.0% using repeat sales on art

data from 1780-1960, and Chanel et. al. (1996) find real returns of 4.9% and 5.0% for

hedonic and repeat sales indices, respectively, for the period 1855-1969.

3. Art as an Investment

           A primary concern of many of these papers is whether art outperforms or

underperforms stocks and bonds and the correlation of art investment returns with

other investment portfolios. Once a rate of return on art assets is calculated based on

one of the price indices above, it is possible to use this return to decide whether it may

be sensible to include art investments in a diversified portfolio. Generally, art

investments are more attractive as investments (using the standard capital asset

pricing model) the greater is their return relative to the return on a risk free asset and

the weaker the correlation (or beta) between art investment returns and the return on

other assets. Pesando (1993) has used the standard market model to assess these two

characteristics of art investments in the case of modern prints. Pesando estimates the

model:

                                           RtP-rf,t=α+β(Rm,t-rf,t)+ut

where RtP denotes the return on the print portfolio, Rm,t denotes the return on the

market portfolio (Pesando uses the S&P 500 stock index), and rf,t denotes the risk free

rate (Pesando uses 180-day Treasury Bills). Pesando estimates a β for the entire print

2
    For example, Goetzmann (1996) (not included in Table 1) estimates real returns from 1907-1977 on



                                                                                                  13
portfolio of .315 and estimates negative, but insignificant, risk adjusted returns. This

implies that print investments tend to reduce the riskiness of a portfolio comprised of

stocks only.

         Determining whether art outperforms or underperforms a market portfolio is

not an easy question to address. First of all, as Goetzmann (1993) points out, there

are many problems with the calculation of the returns to art, beginning with selection

bias in the data. As all of the sales prices are drawn from auction records, only

paintings that have been re-auctioned are included. This excludes both the high end

and the low end of the return distribution. Paintings that fall drastically in value or

are not generally in demand are generally not resold at auction; in addition, paintings

that are donated to museums do not reappear. Furthermore, whether or not an owner

decides to sell a painting at auction may be determined by whether or not the painting

has increased in value. Other problems with estimating returns are that transaction

costs are excluded and in contrast to stocks and bonds, as we noted above, these can

be quite high (as much as 25% of the value of the object considering both buyer’s

premiums and seller’s premiums). Finally, there is significant theft and fire risk (and

hence insurance costs) and cleaning costs involved in investing in art.

         On the other hand, unlike stocks and bonds, art also pays some dividends in

the form of the pleasure the viewer (and owner) receives. In principle, the value of

these dividends could be measured by the rental cost of similar art assets, but we are

unaware of any study that has attempted to do this. Moreover, it seems unlikely that

these returns would be significant for a large, diversified art portfolio that is not

displayed.




auction data to be 13.3%, and even after correcting for survivorship problems, the returns remain at
5%.


                                                                                                       14
         Baumol (1986) and Goetzmann (1993) tend to concur that art is dominated as

an investment vehicle. Goetzmann writes “While returns to art investment have

exceeded inflation for long periods, and returns in the second half of the 20th century

have rivalled the stock market, they are no higher than would be justified by the

extraordinary risks they represent.” Goetzmann (1993) does not formally estimate a

CAPM, but simply reports correlations of art returns with inflation, the Bank of

England Rate, consol bond returns, and the London Stock Exchange.

         Although their estimates of the return to art are not significantly different from

previous estimates, Mei and Moses (2001) take a different view. They argue that “a

diversified portfolio of artworks may play a somewhat more important role in

portfolio diversification than discovered in earlier research.” They base their

conclusions on their finding that their art price index has lower volatility and a much

lower correlation with other asset classes than reported in previous research. They

report that these differences are partly due to sample selection and partly due to a

different time frame studied. Although Mei and Moses (2001) estimate a more

sophisticated form of CAPM than has previously been estimated for art, they

primarily base their conclusions on their estimates of the art index and simple

correlations with bond and stock portfolios.3

         Thus, it appears that different views about the financial benefits of investments

in art assets are primarily based on empirical issues that revolve, in part, around the

temporal instability and sensitivity of the estimates of key parameters related to the


         3
             For the CAPM, Mei and Moses follow Campbell (1987) and estimate

                                   r i,t+1=Et[ri,t+1] + ∑k=1K βik f k,t+1 + εi,t+1,

where r i,t+1 is the excess return on asset I held from time t to time t+1. Et[ri,t+1] is the conditional
expected return on asset, conditional on information known to market participants at the end of time
period t. It is allowed to vary over time (see Mei and Moses (2001) for details). f k,t+1 are excess
returns on k different asset classes.


                                                                                                            15
market performance of art investments. This suggests that an important area for

additional research is the development of a more general empirical model that will

provide an explanation for temporal instability and thus lead to better-informed

decisions.

           Some authors have looked at the financial returns to holding other collectible

items. For example, Ross and Zondervan (1989) estimate the real returns to holding

Stradivari Violins between 1803 and 1987 to be 2.2%, and Graeser (1993) estimates

returns to holding antique furniture between 1967 and 1986 to be 7%. For a very

good survey of papers calculating the rate of returns in various markets, see Frey and

Eichenberger (1995).

4. The Masterpiece Effect

           Pesando (1993) describes the “Masterpiece Effect” by quoting art dealer

Edward Merrin: “`…it’s always better to buy one $10,000 object than ten $1,000

objects, or one $100,000 object --- if that is what you can afford---than ten $10,000

ones.’”4 There have now been several authors who have tested for the masterpiece

effect.

           Pesando tests for the effect by constructing a portfolio of the top 10 or 20% of

prints by price, where price is determined during the first few years of his sample. If

the “art trade” view is correct, the estimated price indices for these “Masterpieces”

should uniformly outperform the general portfolio. He finds no support for this view

and in fact finds that in part of his sample, masterpieces provide the lowest

cumulative return. Mei and Moses (2001) find a similar negative effect for

masterpieces, and in fact find this effect to be uniform across American, Impressionist

and Old Master samples.

                                                                                         16
       Using our data on Impressionist and Contemporary Art, we find that it does

appear that “Masterpieces” have underperformed in the Contemporary Art sample,

but not in the Impressionist Art sample. We construct our index by dividing each

sample into the top 20% of paintings sold by price, and the bottom 80% sold by price,

and then construct a hedonic index. Our index is charted in Figures 1 and 2. We find

similar results to Pesando and Mei and Moses in Contemporary Art, but find no

effects in Impressionist Art. For Contemporary Art, “Masterpieces” underperform the

lower-valued paintings by about 5% on average per year, which is quite significant.

There does not appear to be a difference for the Impressionist Art dataset. The latter

result may not be inconsistent with the findings of others as the Impressionist Art data

consists of paintings that have already been pre-selected to represent the Impressionist

artists that show up most at auction. These are among the best known painters of all

time and it may be that virtually all of their paintings are considered masterpieces.

       Pesando provides no explanation for the “Masterpiece Effect.” Mei and Moses

(2001) speculate that it may be due to overbidding and then mean reversion. This

explanation appears quite reasonable given the way that various studies above have

defined “Masterpieces” as the highest price paintings that were sold. If a

“Masterpiece” is defined purely by price, there may be some paintings in the


                                                                                           18
“Masterpiece” sample that randomly commanded a higher price, perhaps because two

or more bidders had high private valuations for the paintings. At a later auction, the

prices on these paintings revert to the mean, thus resulting in a negative

“Masterpiece” effect.

         A different explanation for the negative “Masterpiece Effect” may be what

Goetzmann (1996) terms “survivorship bias.” It is likely that the more expensive

paintings remained in the sample throughout, even if they decreased in value, whereas

less expensive paintings have dropped out of the sample. Hence it may appear that

“Masterpieces” have underperformed in the sampled data, but in actuality less

expensive paintings that have underperformed are no longer in the sample. The result

that our sample shows a “Masterpiece” effect for Contemporary Art but no

“Masterpiece” effect for Impressionist art tends to support the “survivorship bias”

explanation, due to the way the two samples were constructed. A summary of papers

estimating a “Masterpiece Effect” is presented in Table 2 below.

5. Is There Evidence that Paintings are “Burned?”

         As Ashenfelter (1989) noted, it is often claimed that when an advertised item

goes unsold at auction, its future value will be affected. Such items are said to have

been “burned.” There has been surprisingly little work testing this proposition.




                                                                                         19
       Using our repeat sales data on impressionist art, we present summary statistics

of artworks that appear twice in the data. We have looked at whether there appear to

be any differences in prices and estimates for paintings that came to auction and did

not sell during their first appearance at auction, but sold during their second

appearance at auction (unsold-sold sample), vs. those that came to auction, sold

during their first appearance, and were resold again during their second appearance at

auction. We do this by comparing the ratio of the estimate a painting during its

second appearance at auction to the estimate of the same painting during its first

appearance at auction (estimate 2/estimate 1) and by comparing the ratio of the sale

price during the painting’s second appearance at auction to the estimate of the

painting during its first appearance at auction (sale price 2/estimate 1).   We average

these over the unsold-sold sample and the sold-sold sample. We do not correct for the

level of the art price index when the paintings came to market; hence, any results are

only suggestive.

       As reported in Table 3, we find a significant difference between the unsold-

sold sample and the sold-sold sample. We find that the sale price in the second sale is

on average 1.75 the estimate in the first sale, if the painting was unsold in the first

sale, and the sale price in the second sale is on average 3.77 the estimate in the first

sale, if the painting was sold in the first sale. Furthermore, it takes much longer for

paintings to reappear in the sample if they have been sold the first time around than if

they went unsold the first time around. These results do not necessarily indicate that

paintings that are bought-in are “burned,” and may simply indicate that paintings that

reappear in the sample tend to reappear because they have increased in value.

Nonetheless, the results are




                                                                                           20

6. Competition (or Collusion) Between Auction Houses

        Prior to 1995, Sotheby’s and Christie’s were in fierce competition for

consignments from sellers. At times, they would drastically cut commission rates

paid by sellers, in many cases to nothing, make donations to sellers’ favourite

charities, and even extend financial guarantees to the sellers. In March of 1995, this

competition abruptly ended. Christie’s announced that it would charge sellers a fixed

nonnegotiable sliding-scale commission on the sales price, and a month later

Sotheby’s announced the same policies. Detailed documents kept by Christopher

Davidge, Christie’s former chief executive, show that the abrupt change was due to a

price-fixing conspiracy. By admission, the conspiracy involved at least Christopher

Davidge and Diana Brooks, Sotheby’s chief executive, and it was alleged to have

involved Sir Anthony Tennant and A. Alfred Taubman, the chairmen of Christie’s and

Sotheby’s, respectively. In fact, after a lengthy criminal trial, Taubman, a U.S.

citizen, was convicted of price fixing, which is a felony in the U.S. Although



                                                                                         21
Tennant, a UK citizen, was also indicted in the U.S., price fixing is a civil offence in

the United Kingdom and thus he was not extradited or tried. Christopher Davidge

(and in some cases Sir Anthony Tennant) had kept detailed records describing the

conspiracy. A civil suit, which has been settled, also alleged that Christie’s and

Sotheby’s conspired since 1993 to fix buyer’s commissions. Because it ended in a

public trial, this lawsuit provides an extraordinary window for viewing the operation

of successful price conspirators.

       The case progressed as follows (see especially Stewart (2001) for a detailed

description). The Justice Department agreed in January of 2000 not to prosecute

Christie’s in return for its cooperation in the case. Diana Brooks, former president

and chief executive of Sotheby’s, pleaded guilty to one felony count of price-fixing on

October 5, 2000, and promised to cooperate fully in the government’s investigation.

In September of 2001, Sotheby’s agreed to plead guilty to conspiring with Christie’s

to fix sellers’ commissions, and agreed to pay a fine of forty-five million dollars over

five years. Sotheby’s maintains their innocence with respect to fixing buyer’s

premiums. Also in September of 2001, a civil suit was settled where Sotheby’s and

Christie’s agreed to each pay two hundred and fifty-six million dollars to the

plaintiffs. This class-action suit comprises anyone who had bought or sold items

through the auction houses since 1993.

       From an economist’s point of view, the settlement of the civil suit is

interesting, but appears to be misguided. Although Sotheby’s did not admit to fixing

buyer’s premiums in the criminal settlement of the case, both Christie’s and Sotheby’s

agreed to each pay $256M to both buyers and sellers. This amount was calculated

taking the price-fixing of buyer’s premiums into account. According to In Re Auction

Houses Antitrust Litigation (2001), “The proposed plan of allocation estimated the



                                                                                       22
overcharges to sellers as 1 percent of the hammer price, and those for buyers to be 5

percent of the hammer price up to and including hammer prices of $50,000, and

$2,500 for buyers at hammer prices exceeding $50,000. The net settlement fund

would be distributed to class members pro rata based upon each class member's

overcharges during the relevant period.”

       Even if Sotheby’s and Christie’s admitted to colluding on buyer’s premiums,

the usual theory of private value auctions implies that, to first order, buyers deserve

no compensation! The following is the reason why. When a buyer decides to bid in

an ascending price auction, his strategy should be to bid up to his reservation price, if

necessary. The price that the winning bidder has to pay is essentially (epsilon above)

the reservation price of the second highest bidder. When buyer’s commissions are

raised, each buyer should reduce his reservation price by an equivalent amount,

resulting in a reduction in revenue to the seller by the amount of the buyer’s

commission. Hence, the entire increase in buyers’ commissions should fall on the

seller. Thus, the standard model of private value auctions implies that the entire

settlement arrangement in the civil suit was misguided!

       The criminal trial of Alfred Taubman, previously Chairman of Sotheby’s

Board, in the fall of 2001 provided some dramatic revelations about the details

surrounding the price fixing. Many of these details were provided in the testimony of

Diana Brooks, previously President of Sotheby’s. First, although remarkably candid

about her role in the fixing of seller’s commissions, Ms. Brooks did not provide any

evidence of collusion with respect to buyer’s premiums. Second, Ms. Brooks

estimated that the collusion on seller’s commissions resulted in higher profits to

Sotheby’s of some $10 to $15 million per year. Assuming that Christie’s received the

same increased profits implies that total damages suffered by sellers would be on the



                                                                                          23
order of $20 to $30 million per year. Assuming the conspiracy lasted 5 years

(approximately the time period involved) suggests total damages of $100 to $150

million. Since price fixing damages are, by statute, tripled, it appears that the

plaintiffs were more than amply compensated for the harm they incurred.

       Finally, the details of the arrangement for price fixing revealed by Ms. Brooks

suggest that great care was ensured to keep virtually all other employees of the

auction houses from learning of the conspiracy. Taubman met solely with Tennant,

and Brooks solely with Davidge in arranging the details of the conspiracy. Indeed,

Brooks reported that at one point Taubman proposed that the auction houses collude

in providing clients with similar estimates of the value of their art. Brooks reported

that this was impossible because she could not simply tell Christie’s departmental

experts, who produce the estimates, to do a dishonest job.

7. The Law of One Price

       The effect of the changes in sellers’ commissions and buyers’ premiums that

occurred during the 1990’s may provide an interesting subject for study by

economists. Ashenfelter (1989) studied changes in buyers’ premiums on the final

price of wine at auction. In the spring of 1986, buyer’s premiums were 10% at

Sotheby’s London (and at other locations), but Christie’s in London had no buyer’s

premium. In the spring of 1986, prices at Sotheby’s in London were 12% less than

prices at Christie’s in London, likely reflecting the difference in buyers’ commissions.

In the fall of 1986, Christie’s had instituted a 10% buyer’s premium in the London

auctions. In auctions held in the fall of 1986, there was no difference in prices, while

in an auction held in the spring of 1987, prices at Sotheby’s in London were 5%

higher than at Christie’s, and in the fall of 1987, prices at Sotheby’s in London were




                                                                                         24
4% lower than at Christie’s. These results indicate that the incidence of the buyer’s

premium does tend to fall on the sellers.

         Other authors have looked at price differences between auction houses and

between different markets. Pesando (1993) focused on the sale of identical prints in

different markets which occur within 30 days of each other for the period 1977-1992.

For the entire period, he found that prices were 7% higher in New York than in

London, and 10% higher in New York than in Europe. However, the difference was

not statistically significant for the period 1977-1989, while it was statistically

significant at 11% and 17% in comparisons of New York and London and New York

and Europe, respectively, between 1989 and 1992. Pesando (1993) describes the

trade explanation as being the presence of Japanese buyers in the New York market

during that period, though one would expect any systematic price differences to

disappear when buyers respond to incentives. Pesando also finds significant

differences among auction houses. For the entire period, Pesando found that prices

average 14 percent higher in Sotheby’s in New York than at Christie’s in New York,

but there was no difference in the prices of prints at Sotheby’s and Christie’s in

London.

         Using a price index for all art, Mei and Moses (2001) find mixed evidence on

the law of one price. When they do find price differences, these differences tend to be

small. A summary of papers testing for the law of one price is presented in Table 4

8. Sales Rates and Reserve Prices

         As we noted above, items that are put up for sale at auction often go unsold

because the bidding in the auction does not meet the reserve price. Sale rates vary

tremendously over time and they also vary systematically across different types of

auctions. Table 5 shows sale rates in different departments at Christie’s in London in

1995 and 1996 along with average value of a lot sold. As can be seen from the table,

96% of items put up for sale in auctions of arms and armour were sold, 89% of wine

at auction was sold, and 71% of impressionist and modern art items were sold.

       Ashenfelter, Graddy and Stevens (2002) provide a study of sale rates across

time in art auctions and across different types of auctions. Based on the observation

that an item is bought-in if and only if it does not meet or exceed its reserve price,

they develop a model of optimal reserve prices. The seller of a painting faces the

following problem: if he participates in an auction the highest bid for the painting can


                                                                                           27
be regarded as a random draw from some price distribution. When a seller sets a

reserve price, he must decide at what price he would be indifferent between selling

now and waiting for the next auction. The optimal policy is to set a reserve price that

is a constant proportion of the current expected price. Sale rates can then be modelled

as being explained by price shocks and a constant, or “natural sale rate.” This natural

sale rate (which may vary across different types of auctions) depends only on the

variance of log prices and the seller’s discount rate. They estimate that the reserve

price is generally set to be about 70 to 80% of the auctioneer’s low estimate.

Although reserve prices are generally secret, the available evidence suggests that this

prediction is reasonably accurate.

       Genesove (1995) tests a related, but somewhat different theory in the context

of wholesale automobile auctions. He finds that on average sale rates in used auto

auctions are actually quite low; between about 58% and 68% of automobiles go

unsold. In his paper, he tests a result by Balvers (1990) that also states that an

increase in variance decreases the probability of sale. He finds that an increase in the

log-variance is associated with a lower probability of sale, and hence the “natural sale

rate” is again dependent on variance of log prices.

       Other authors have studied strategic reasons for setting reserve prices. For

example, in the classic article by Riley and Samuelson (1981), the reserve price serves

to extract a slightly higher price from the bidder with the highest valuation of the item

on offer. The theory of optimal auctions indicates why, for strategic reasons, a seller

should set a reserve price that is strictly higher than the minimum price for which they

would sell the object. However, these models predict that sale rates should approach

unity as the number of bidders increases and do not seem to be consistent with the low

and persistent sale rates actually observed.



                                                                                        28
       More recently, in a general auction model with affiliated signals, common

components to valuations, and endogenous entry (all characteristics which can be

applied to art auctions or other auctions of cultural objects), McAfee, Quan, and

Vincent (2000) derive a lower bound on the optimal reserve price. They apply their

computations to FDIC real estate auctions and find that the lower bound on the

optimal reserve price for real estate to be about 75% of the appraised value.

9. Why Secret Reserve Prices?

       In almost all auctions of cultural items, not only are there reserve prices, but

these reserve prices are secret. Auctioneers generally do not reveal the reserve price

and they make it as difficult as they can for bidders to infer it. A reserve price clearly

contains information about the seller’s valuation of an item; intuitively, revealing

information matters if the items contain a common value component among buyers.

While people buy art for enjoyment, there is an investment component to many

buyers’ motives; that investment component leads one to classify art as having

common-value components. Thus, the fact that auctioneers tend to keep reserve

prices secret has remained a puzzle since the publication of Milgrom and Weber’s

paper (1982), where it was shown that it is optimal for a seller of a good at a

common-value auction to reveal their valuation.

       One reason that has been suggested for secret reserve prices is that these may

be used to deter collusion. As Ashenfelter (1989) suggests, when the turnout is low,

some sellers may prefer that their goods be bought in and offered for sale at a later

date rather than risk a collusive ring bidding to depress the item’s price. If there is a

ring operating, a secret reserve price might encourage bidders to bid higher than they

would have otherwise.




                                                                                          29
        Vincent (1995) has cleverly built upon (and overturned) the intuition from

Milgrom and Weber’s (1982a) original result. His explanation is based upon the

inhibiting effect that the announcement of a reserve price may have on the

participation of bidders in a given auction. This announcement could discourage

some bidders from participating. As revelation of information is very important for

increasing revenues in a common value auction, the fact that these bidders are not

participating prevents their information from playing a part in the auction and may

lower overall bids. Hence, there is a trade-off between the reserve price revealing the

seller’s information, and a reserve price discouraging participating which lowers total

aggregation of information.

        Horstmann and LaCasse (1997) provide yet another reason for secret reserve

prices. If the seller in a common-value auction possesses information that cannot be

directly transmitted to the buyers, then a seller can either attempt to signal his

information via a reserve price announcement, or choose a secret reserve price. A

secret reserve price could result in delay in sale. If the true information about an item

is revealed over time, the delay in sale could be profitable for high value items, but

costly for low value items, and hence sellers of high-value items will not be tempted

to mimic sellers of low-value items. While this explanation may appear reasonable

for oil leases, it appears less applicable to art auctions, though sellers of art are given

access to professional valuation services provided by the auction house, which may

provide an asymmetry of information. A summary of papers relating to secret reserve

prices is presented in Table 6 below.

10. Role of Estimates and Experts

         Before an auction takes place, in their pre-auction catalogues, auction house

experts provide a low and a high price estimate for each item. Determining the

accuracy of these estimates raises some important questions for the study of the role

of expert opinion in economic decisions.5 Of especial interest is the motivation of the

auctioneer in choosing the high and low estimates. The theoretical literature stresses

that auctioneers should provide truthful information about the items being sold.

         Ashenfelter’s (1989) results generally show that auction houses are truthful;

the average of the auctioneer’s high and low estimate is very highly correlated with

the price actually received. Furthermore, Abowd and Ashenfelter (1988) find that

auctioneer’s price estimates are far better predictors of prices fetched than hedonic

price functions.

         While the regressions in Beggs and Graddy (1997) generally uphold these

results, they do find systematic under and over predictions. For example, they find

that for Contemporary Art, more recently executed artworks are overvalued and

longer and wider paintings are undervalued. For Impressionist and Modern art, they


5
  Ashenfelter (2000) defines expert opinion as efficient if it incorporates all of the publicly available
information that is useful in making predictions. He also provides one example of inefficient expert
opinion.


                                                                                                            31
find that wider, signed, and monogrammed paintings may be underestimated relative

to their value. One explanation for these findings may simply be that auction houses

are unwittingly overestimating consumer demand (and hence willingness to pay) for

recent Contemporary Art, and underestimating consumer demand for size! Many

people in the trade express surprise at the strong correlations that many economists

have found between size and price (see Anderson (1974) and Beggs and Graddy

(1997) for examples).

       Other authors have also found that ex-ante valuations cannot be considered

unbiased predictors of market prices, although it is our impression that biases are not

quantitatively large when they are precisely estimated. Bauwens and Ginsburgh

(2000) study 1600 lots of English silver sold between 1976 and 1991 by Christie’s

and Sotheby’s. They find that Christie’s has a tendency to underestimate

systematically, while Sotheby’s overvalues inexpensive pieces and undervalues

expensive ones. Chanel, Gerard-Varet, and Vincent (1996) studied jewellery

auctions, and found that experts have an ex-ante valuation that is lower than the

hammer price for all types of jewels, except for some watches. They speculate that

some strategic undervaluation is occurring. These results are interesting, in part

because, as Milgrom and Weber (1982a) show, in general, for auctioneers, “honesty is

the best policy.”

       If price estimates are biased, this raises some interesting questions about the

reason for the bias. One possibility is simply that the “experts” make systematic

errors because they are not as “efficient” as the linear predictors they are being tested

against. Evidence in favor of this hypothesis would be the finding that observed

biases are not stable and vary from one sample to another or from one time period to




                                                                                         32
another. Judging from the results reported above, there is certainly some evidence to

support this view.

       Another possibility is that auctioneers engage in systematic manipulation of

the estimates for strategic purposes. The testimony of Diana Brooks, formerly

President of Sotheby’s, in the trial of Alfred Taubman noted above provides some

anecdotal evidence on this issue. Her testimony suggests that, even when the two

leading auctioneers were engaging in price fixing, they did not attempt to influence

the art appraisers who worked for them to assist in the conspiracy.

       A related question is, “what motivates the auctioneers when they determine

the spread between the high and the low estimates that are published in the pre-sale

catalogues?” One explanation of how the spread is determined is by the auctioneer’s

estimate of the uncertainty or possible variance in the price of the painting. In this

case, the high estimate might reasonably be interpreted as the estimate of the mean

price plus a multiple of the estimated standard deviation (H=µ+rσ). Likewise, under

this interpretation, the low estimate would be the mean minus a multiple of the

standard deviation (L= µ-rσ). With this interpretation the high estimate minus the low

estimate divided by 2 is proportional to the estimated standard deviation ((H-L)/2= rσ)

and the average of the high estimate and the low estimate would be the estimated

mean ((H+L)/2=µ). A large difference in the high estimate and the low estimate

would therefore signal a high estimate of price variance or a lot of uncertainty.

However, as the seller’s secret reserve price, by convention, lies below the low

estimate, it is very likely that the spread between the high and low estimate is not

simply a reflection of the auctioneer’s uncertainty surrounding the possible price. If

the seller wishes to set a high reserve price, the auctioneer may increase the low

estimate. Ashenfelter, Graddy, and Stevens (2002) study the plausibility of these two

Ashenfelter (1989)             Auction houses are truthful

Chanel, et. al. (1996)         Undervalue most types of jewelry, with the exception of some watches

Beggs and Graddy (1997)        Art: Recently executed works tend to be overvalued; longer and wider
                               paintings are undervalued

Bauwens and Ginsburgh (2000) English silver: Christie's systematically underestimates;
                             Sotheby's overvalues inexpensive pieces and undervalues expensive pieces

Ashenfelter, et. al. (2002)    Examines whether spread between high and low estimate is indication
                               of auctioneer's uncertaintly or reflects seller's wish to set a high reserve price




11. The Declining Price Anomaly

         Since Ashenfelter (1989) showed that that prices are twice as likely to

decrease as to increase for identical bottles of wine sold in same lot sizes at auction,

there has been a tremendous amount of study of the declining price anomaly in many

types of auctions.

         Soon after publication of Ashenfelter’s (1989) article, there were many

theoretical papers written to explain declining prices. Black and deMeza (1992)

claimed it was no anomaly; declining prices in wine auctions exist primarily because

the winner of the first auction in a sequence has the option to buy the remaining

objects at the winning price. However, this theory is unable to explain why the


                                                                                                      34
anomaly continues to exist even where this option is not permitted. McAfee and

Vincent (1993) showed that risk aversion could create declining prices. One

unappealing feature of their explanation is that a pure-strategy equilibrium exists only

when there is nondecreasing absolute risk aversion, which is usually thought

implausible. Mixed strategy equilibria are ex-post inefficient, which is sometimes

also thought to be weakness of this theory, but which may nevertheless be a correct

characterization of the actual market. Von der Fehr (1994) shows that participation

costs could create declining prices through strategic bidding. Engelbrecht-Wiggans

(1994), Bernhardt and Scoones (1994), Gale and Hausch (1994), and Beggs and

Graddy (1997) relate the price decline to heterogeneity of the objects for sale,

Pezanis-Christou (2001) relates the price decline to heterogeneity among buyers, and

Ginsburgh (1998) shows that the presence of absentee bidders can generate declining

prices.

          The declining price anomaly has also been documented in a number of

different types of auctions with different auction structures. Buccola (1982) found it

occurring in livestock auctions, Milgrom and Weber (1982b) for transponder leases,

McAfee and Vincent (1993) and Di Vittorio and Ginsburgh (1994) confirmed

Ashenfelter’s (1989) wine findings, Thiel and Petry (1990) and Taylor(1991) in stamp

auctions, Ashenfelter and Genesove (1992) and Venderporten (1992a, 1992b) for

condominiums, Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Kahn (1992) for dairy cattle, Lusht (1994)

for commercial real estate, Chanel, Gerard-Varet, and Vincent (1996) for gold

jewellery; Pesando and Shum (1996) for Picasso prints; Beggs and Graddy (1997) for

Impressionist and Contemporary art; Thurston (1997) for mink pelts, Pezanis-

Christou (2001) for fish auctions, and van den Berg, van Ours and Pradhan (2001) for




                                                                                      35
Dutch flower auctions. Burns (1985) and Keser and Olson (1996) have set up

experiments that have reached the same conclusions.

        Several authors have also found increasing prices. Among them are Gandal

(1997) for Israeli cable television licenses, and Donald, Paarsch and Robert (1997) for

Siberian timber-export permits. Jones, Menezes and Vella (1996) found that prices

could increase or decrease in sequential auctions of wool, as did Chanel, Gerard-

Varet, and Vincent (1996) for watches; Milgrom and Weber (1982b) show

theoretically that if bidders’ valuations are affiliated, then prices will tend to rise over

time in a sequence of auctions of identical objects. Deltas and Kosmopoulou (2001)

find in a sale of library books that expected prices increase over the auction, but that

probability of sale decreases. Natzkoff (2001) provides an excellent survey of papers

on the declining price anomaly. A summary of papers addressing the declining price

anomaly is presented in Table 8 below.



Conclusion

        The empirical study of art auctions really has two purposes. On the one hand,

the auction mechanism provides a very public report on the prices of art objects. As

we have shown, because of the unique nature of many art objects, the interpretation of

market prices requires great care. Nevertheless, this information is the primary way

that art objects are valued and it provides us with our primary objective information

on preferences regarding art. Although the market is surely not all that is important in

the judgement of art and artists, it is certainly one of the key components of our

understanding of what is good and bad

        The empirical study of art auctions also has another purpose. Art auctions

provide data that may be used to test and refine strategic models of behavior. Here



                                                                                          36
the object of study is the economic mechanism and it makes very little difference

what object is for sale. It appears that a great deal of what we know about the

operation of auction mechanisms may also lead to the rather happy study of objects of

considerable interest in their own right.

       The empirical study of art auctions and the price of art assets has been a

growth field in the last decade and has resulted in an increasing sophistication in the

questions being asked and in the empirical methods being used. It seems likely that

this trend will continue into the future.
