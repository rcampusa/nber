      Government capital formation raises a number of issues important to

national economic well-being, yet the U.S., unlike most advanced

countries, does not account for capital in its formal budget documents.

We estimate depreciation of government capital using a methodology

developed by Hulten and Wykoff which is based on used asset price data.

We estimate a federal government net nonresidential capital stock of

over $800 billion in 1984, more than 20% higher than estimated by the

BEA. We also find much larger net federal investment since World War II

than the BEA. The behavior of military and civilian structures and

equipment is also examined.

     We analyze the potential importance of these results for measuring

the net national savings rate, national wealth, the trend in government

capital formation relative to private capital formation, and the

relationship between net investment and deficits.

 1.     Introduction

      In all countries, the public sector, as well as the private

sector, owns substantial amounts of capital, makes investment as well as

consumption-type expenditures and transfer payments, and experiences

depreciation in the value of its tangible capital. Most advanced

economies incorporate this in their formal budget documents, generating

separate capital and current services accounts. The United States is

the most conspicuous exception. Fortunately, the Bureau of Economic

Analysis (BEA) of the Commerce Department has generated substantial

information on federal, and state and local, government investment,

depreciation and capital stocks in the United States for the past 60

years. While one of the purposes of this paper is to generate

alternative estimates, and these differ somewhat from those of the BEA,

it is clear from even a cursory examination of the data that government

capital formation is substantial. The sum of the federal, state and

local government capital stocks is more than half as large as private

non-residential capital in the United States. In many other countries

it is a still larger fraction of the total national capital stock.

      Government capital formation raises a number of issues

important to national economic well-being. For example, government net

capital formation can be a major component of net national saving.

Also, it may be more appropriate to finance government capital formation

than government consumption by borrowing rather than taxing. Obviously,

some types of government capital formation are complementary to private

activity and enhance productivity. But government capital formation

does not have to meet the same kind of market test as private

investment and we do not have an analogue to the stock market to value

it. Thus, measures of government capital and investment may be



                                1
particularly useful information which cannot be inferred from other

data. Measures of the productivity of the government investment are

hard to come by. Further, because taxes are distortionary, the cost of

these distortions must be included in proper social cost-benefit

analyses and therefore the optimal public sector investment must have a

larger marginal product then that in the private sector.

     It may well be the case that government investment expenditures

have different impacts on the economy than transfer payments or

government consumption expenditures which add the same amounts to

traditionally measured deficits. Further, it is unclear that the

deficit on current account is the sole information one would want to

use, for example, in short-run macroeconomic analyses. Do we really

believe that shifting a dollar from government consumption to government

investment, thereby reducing the current services deficit by a dollar

has the same macroeconomic impact as a dollar decrease in spending

and/or a dollar increase in taxes? Still, separating out capital and

current expenditures, and generating sensible measures of depreciation

and net investment, can be important inputs into various kinds of

economic analyses, some examples of which are presented below.

     First, such an endeavor would enable us to have a more accurate

picture of how the government is really using the funds it raises.

Second, it could help us get better measures of the productivity of this

capital, by component or in the aggregate. Third, it is a necessary

input into comprehensive measures of national wealth. Fourth, it may be

valuable in establishing alternative budget procedures and/or in better

understanding and implementing various fiscal policies. Fifth, it is

also a necessary input in measures of net national saving, and indeed,




                                2
the United Nations system of national income accounts, implemented in

most OECD countries, expressly incorporates net government saving in the

measure of net national saving. Sixth, it can improve our understanding

of fiscal history and help highlight emerging fiscal issues, such as the

deterioration of the infrastructure or, alternatively, a rapid

government investment buildup (as appears to be happening in Japan at

the moment).

     The purpose of this paper is to provide alternative estimates of

federal government net investment and net capital stocks as potential

inputs into such studies. It also tests the sensitivity of alternative

approaches to depreciation in terms of their potential impact on

aggregate measures of net capital stock and investment in the federal

government sector of the United States, as we compare our numbers with

those of the BEA.     We estimate a federal government net

nonresidential capital stock 20 percent higher than that estimated by

the BEA's method, and hence, correspondingly higher government

consumption, national income, and when the changes in net capital stock

differ, net national saving. The results systematically differ with

respect to structures, but are quite comparable with respect to

equipment. A similar result was found using the same methodology for

the private capital stock by Hulten and Wykoff (1981). It is likely

that their pattern will be found for the state and local sector when we

present those results in a sequel to this paper.

     The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we briefly review

other attempts to create government investment and capital stock

estimates. These include the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) (and

several studies based on the BEA numbers), Goldsmith (1962) and

Kendrick (1976), as well as special studies of the Office of Management



                                3
and Budget and the special analyses of the Budget of the United States.

We describe each briefly, together with what we consider to be the

strength and weaknesses of each study.

     In Section 3, we present the methodology employed in this study for

measuring investment, depreciation, and net capital stocks. We discuss

various reasons why our approach to depreciation is likely to lead to

somewhat different results in the time pattern of accumulation and

depreciation, and also various strengths and weaknesses of the

methodology we employ (which follows the approximation to a used asset

price approach used by Hulten and Wykoff (1981)), relative to that of

the BEA or other options.

     Section 4 presents our principal results. Data are presented for

gross and net investment, depreciation, and net capital stocks annually

from 1927 to 1984 for all federal government capital using the BEA

method, our depreciation method, and also for the sake of comparison,

double declining balance. In aggregate we estimate a net capital stock

more than 20 percent larger than the BEA, over $800 billion of tangible

capital compared to their $650 billion in 1984.

     Various charts and tables decompose the aggregate numbers into

their components by type of capital and nature of its use. The focus is

primarily on the distinction between military and non-military capital,

and between equipment and structures. Interestingly, the bulk of the

difference is in the treatment of non-residential structures, as our

estimates are quite similar to the BEA for equipment in recent years.

     Section 5 presents a series of interpretations and implications of

our results. We analyse the potential importance of these results for

measuring the net national saving rate, national wealth, the trend in




                                4
government capital formation relative to private capital formation, the

relationship of net investment and traditionally measured government

deficits, etc. It is evident that for a wide range of issues, improved

measures of the government net capital stock, gross investment,

depreciation and net investment can be quite important.

     We conclude with some caveats, directions for future research, and

the hope that by presenting our estimates, and comparing them to those

of the BEA, we will stimulate further work on this potentially important

set of topics.

2. Literature Review

     The most noted early contributions to the estimation of the capital

stock of the government were made by Raymond Goldsmith. As part of his

project estimating national wealth for the period 1946-1958, Goldsmith

(1962) creates series for the military and civilian capital stock and

net investment by type of asset and level of government. The basic

methodology was the perpetual inventory method, cumulating gross

investment and subtracting estimated depreciation. For military

capital, a 1946 benchmark for the stock from Reeve (1950) was used and

depreciation was assumed to be geometric for the various components)

For federal civilian capital, Goldsmith took gross investment figures

dating back to the 19th century from his earlier (1955) study and

assumed straight-line depreciation over different service lives to

obtain a net capital stock series.2



1. Goldsmith (1962), Tables B-l69, B-175. Depreciation rates were assumed
to be 45 percent for aircraft, 15 percent for ships, 22.5 percent for
other equipment, and 7.5 percent for structures. With these rates,
depreciation is several times more rapid in the early years than that
assumed by the BEA (see Table 2).

2. Goldsmith (1962), Tables B-l58, B-159, B-l6l. Service lives used were



                               5
     Kendrick (1976) also estimated the tangible capital assets of the

government, though this was not the primary focus of his study. He also

used the perpetual inventory method, with Goldsmith's estimates as

benchmarks for the various components. Kendrick used different

investment series and depreciation assumptions,3 but does not report

separate series for the federal government.

     The Bureau of Economic Analysis (1982), using improved estimates of

current- and constant-dollar gross investment series in revisions of the

NIPAs, also developed estimates of government capital using the

perpetual inventory method. Gross investment figure for the various

components prior to 1929 were taken from Goldsmith, in order to obtain

the capital stock in 1925 and to estimate depreciation in later years.

The service lives and depreciation assumptions made by the BEA are

discussed in detail below. Goldsmith (1982) and Eisner and Pieper (1984)

use the BEA estimates of net government fixed capital stock in their

studies. A comparison between the net federal non-residential capital

stock estimates of Goldsmith (1962) and the BEA is given in Table 1.

     The Office of Management and Budget (0MB) has begun to include

estimates of federal investment in the Special Analyses section of the

Budget, as required by an act of Congress. These gross investment



30 years for highways and streets, 50 years for buildings, 80 years for
conservation and development structures, and 12 years for most civilian
equipment.

3. See Kendrick (1976), Bl-20 to Bl-29, for a detailed description of his
methodology.




                                6
figures are much larger than those of the BEA, as shown in Table l.

In addition, the 0MB also estimates investment based on a more

comprehensive measure, such as including of loan programs, research and

development and human capital investment.

       These differences demonstrate a fundamental underlying dilemma:

defining capital, and therefore estimating gross investment, raises

conceptual difficulties. We use the BEA figures though others might

prefer a more inclusive series. Further, the federal government

finances substantial investment which is owned by others, particularly

state and local governments. The BEA treats this as state and local

investment and capital, which is fine, but must be distinguished from

budget documents reporting the amount of investment financed by the

federal government.

       Since we differ from the BEA in our estimates of the depreciation

of government capital, a brief review of depreciation theory is in

order. The definition preferred by most economists, including

ourselves, is that economic depreciation is the decline in the value of

an asset through time.5 In equilibrium, the value of an asset is



4. Most of the discrepancy arises because the BEA does not include grants-
in-aid to state and local governments in investment, except for a
fraction of highway and street expenditures. This is only partially
offset by OMB's lower estimates for civilian equipment, which are
possibly due to OMB's restriction to acquisition of major equipment. In
addition, OMB's estimate for military investment in 1970 is more than
$10 billion larger than the BEA's. See 0MB (1985), particularly Table
D-2.

5. A competing definition of depreciation is advanced by Young and Musgrave
(1980). They state that depreciation as defined by the BEA in both its
capital stock estimates and in the NIPA is based on the concept of
productive efficiency. "NIPA depreciation" is the cost of the asset




                                 7
the discounted value of the services it is expected to provide net of

maintenance and repair plus its expected scrappage value.

     Replacement, as defined by Christensen and Jorgenson (1973), is

based on productive efficiency rather than economic value. It is the

level of investment necessary to maintain the productive efficiency of

the capital stock. If an asset provides equal services, net of

maintenance and repair, over its life -   like   a light bulb or one-hoss

shay -   replacement is zero until retirement, when it is equal to the
cost of the asset.

     An example may clarify these concepts. Consider a one-hoss shay

costing $100 which will become totally obsolete in two years, though

its physical life is three years, and suppose the real interest rate is

5 percent.     Since the one-hoss shay must be producing services worth

$51.22 each year in order to sell for $100, depreciation is $49.78 in

the first year and $51.22 in the second.6 Replacement is zero in


allocated over the service life in proportion to the services net of
maintenance and repair provided in a given year. Obsolescence is
reflected by a one-time charge when the asset is retired prior to the
end of its physical life, rather than spread over the economic life of
the asset.

There are two important distinctions between economic depreciation (the
definition used in the text) and "NIPA depreciation": the use of
discounting and the treatment of obsolescence. Under economic
depreciation, potential services from an asset after its retirement are
irrelevant, since they are worthless. Obsolescence affects the value of
the asset over its entire economic life, so there is no need for a
special charge. This tends to increase (while the use of discounting
reduces) economic depreciation in the early years of asset life relative
to the NIPA definition.

6. "NIPA depreciation" is $33.33 in the first year and $66.67 in the second
year, since the lost services of the third year are charged off at the
end of the second year.




                                  8
the first year and $100 at the end of the second.

     The appropriate definition of the capital stock depends on the use

of the measure, as emphasized by Christensen and Jorgenson (1973). For

questions of productivity and factor inputs, the appropriate capital

stock is cumulative investment less cumulative replacement, since that

gives the productive efficiency of the stock at any particular date.

For measuring national wealth, the capital stock should be measured as

cumulative investment less cumulative economic depreciation, since that

gives the remaining market value of capital.

     Replacement is equal to depreciation only when productive

efficiency declines geometrically as the asset ages.7 The two

measures -   value   and productive efficiency -   of   the capital stock are

equal in magnitude only when depreciation takes the form of a

declining-balance.

     The BEA, in its estimates of government capital stock, assumes

straight-line depreciation over the estimated economic service life of

the asset. This would be an accurate measure of economic depreciation

if the asset had no decline in productive efficiency as it aged (one-

hoss shay) and the discount rate were zero.8 The one-horse shay

assumption would mean that discards (retirements) measured by the BEA



7. See Jorgenson (1973) for a proof of this.

8. If, in addition to the one-hoss shay assumption, the physical service
life was equal to the economic service life, the BEA measure would equal
"NIPA depreciation". Since "NIPA depreciation" is appropriate for
neither production nor valuation measures of the capital stock, we shall
not consider it further.




                                    9
would equal replacement.

     The BEA defines the gross capital stock as cumulative investment

less discards, while the net stock subtracts depreciation from

investment. The BEA gross stock would be, therefore, the relevant

measure for productivity calculations under the one-hoss shay

assumption. Under the unrealistic additional assumption of a zero real

discount rate, the BEA net stock is the correct measure for national

wealth calculations.

     Hulten and Wykoff (1981) have found that the declining-balance

assumption for depreciation, in addition to being more convenient, is a

more accurate approximation to the decline in value of some private-

sector assets than the straight-line assumption. In the next section,

we discuss their methodology and our application of their estimates to

develop an alternative measure of the depreciation and replacement of

the fixed capital stock of the federal government.

3.   Methodology

     Our new estimates of the net Federal capital stock are in the

spirit of a used asset price approach.   They are based, however, on BRA

estimates of gross investment and economic service lives. We begin with

a discussion of the treatment of service lives. We then turn to our use

of the information obtained by analyzing used asset prices.

     The BRA takes two approaches to estimating economic service lives

for the federal sector. For some categories, mostly structures, the

approach is the same as that used in the private sector. The BRA

applies the bell-shaped "Winfrey" distribution to the investment,

assigning service lives varying from 45 to 155 percent of the central

value to various fractions of the investment for a given year. A




                               10
variety of sources are used for the central service lives, including

agency data and comparisons with the private sector.9

     For some categories, including all military equipment and much of

nonmilitary equipment, discards can be inferred from accounting records,

and so detailed service life estimates are available. These vary across

years, and can vary within a single year. For example, the service

lives of most types of military equipment are shortened during wartime.

Since any variation in service life is captured, a Winfrey distribution

is not used. We are able to reproduce military equipment estimates

exactly in recent years from detailed service life data kindly provided

by John Musgrave.

     To adjust for intersectoral transfers and for other possible
                             10
statistical discrepancies,        we added the difference between the

BEA's estimate of the net stock of a component and our attempt to

reproduce them to our estimates. The discrepancy peaks at three billion

1984 dollars in 1965 and drops to about 1.2 billion in 1984. The

results described in Section 4 use the actual BEA estimates, and our

figures are adjusted for the discrepancy.




9. For some categories, we were able to reproduce the depreciation and
capital stock estimates of the BEA from the gross investment figures.
Other categories, though, were slightly overestimated relative to the
BEA. John Musgrave of the BEA alerted us to the presence of
"intersectoral transfers" , that occur when Federal buildings are sold
to the private sector. Since the categories we reproduce exactly
include highways and dams, and those we overestimate include industrial
and office buildings, this seems a plausible explanation, and an
adjustment, described in the text, was made to our estimates to
compensate.

10. We were not able to reproduce BEA's estimates for nonmilitary equipment
exactly, possibly because more detailed service life information was
needed for these categories also.




                                  11
     We attempt to use the best available technique for estimating

economic depreciation, and apply it to the federal government. Young

and Musgrave (1980) argue that the BEA approach may be a good

approximation to the economic approach. It is our view, however, that

the used asset price approach is preferable, because it attempts to take

into account market data. The most well-known and, we believe, thorough

attempt to implement the used asset price approach in the private sector

is that of Hulten and Wykoff (1981), While not perfect, we feel that

the Hulten-Wykoff approach is the best available, and it forms the basis

for our estimates of the Federal capital stock.

     An important facet of the implementation of a used asset price

approach is the treatment of assets for which market information is not

available. Since we do not attempt to utilize new market information in

this study, we review the method of Hulten and Wykoff.

     The use of market data to arrive at estimates of economic

depreciation involves a number of econometric problems. Two problems

that Hulten and Wykoff address directly are those of functional form,

and the censored sample problem. As mentioned above, the question of

the "shape" of the depreciation path is a critical one, which can only

be settled empirically. In order to allow their market data sufficient

freedom to determine the shape of the depreciation path, they used a

Box-Cox transformation, which nests the major functional forms. They

found that all of the major forms, such as geometric or one-hoss-shay,

are rejected by the data. By visual inspection, however, they conclude

that for each case, the fit is "nearly" geometric, and proceed

accordingly.

     The censored sample problem is the an upward bias to used asset

values based on observed   prices, since only the prices of "survivors"



                               12
are available. To correct for this bias, the prices are adjusted to

take into explicit account the censoring problem by weighing the

observed price by the survival probability. These probabilities are

based on the BEA estimates of economic service lives and the Winfrey

distribution, which were discussed earlier.

     There are a number of additional potential problems with the used

asset price approach. Some critics of the used asset price approach

argue that most used asset markets will be dominated by lemons, biasing

the observed price downward. Hulten and Wykoff (1981) defend their

approach against the lemons critique by pointing out that the lemons

problem arises out of asymmetric information, and that in the market for

business assets that they study, most of the participants are

specialists, minimizing misinformation.

     A "shopping mall" problem can introduce a downward bias to

depreciation through an upward bias in the prices of structures. If it

is difficult to disentangle the value of land from the value of the

structures on the land, the value of a structure earmarked for

demolition, which may be zero, will be ascribed a positive value. This

is true even if a structure of the same vintage on another piece of land

still has many years of useful life in it.1 By ignoring this

source of bias, we are implicitly putting great confidence in the

ability to separate the value of land from that of structures.

     The existence of an investment tax credit can introduce an upward



11. DeLeeuw (1981) argues that the shopping mall problem introduces an
upward bias to depreciation, because still "useful" buildings are
counted as having no value. However, obsolete buildings, like obsolete
equipment, have no value, net of scrappage.




                               13
bias to depreciation rates to the extent that new investment goods are

treated more favorably than old ones. New goods will sell at a premium,

so that prices drop not because of a drop in productive efficiency, but

because actual costs to users are in post-tax prices. DeLeeuw (1981)

suggests adjusting new asset prices for the tax advantages as a

correction.

     Yet another concern of Hulten and Wykoff is that as real interest

rates and tax regimes vary, the pattern of used asset prices for a good

with a fixed pattern of services might vary. They find, however, that

for office buildings, time paths of prices do not vary significantly

over subsamples, suggesting that a single geometric rate is appropriate,

regardless of the prevailing tax regime or real interest rate. De Leeuw

(1981) points out that this is rather more distressing than consoling,

since we would expect market participants to take such information into

account. One factor in the stability that Hulten and Wykoff find may

have been the constancy of real interest rates over their sample.    This

suggests that their stability result may be sample-specific. On the

other hand, since the assets we are concerned with are governmental,

tax considerations are unimportant. Lacking a systematic guide for

deviating from them, we will accept Hulten and Wykoff's constant rates,

with the caveats here mentioned.

     Having concluded that used asset price behavior can be described by

a single geometric depreciation rate, Hulten and Wykoff turned to the

problem of what geometric depreciation rates are appropriate for assets

for which no resale data exists. They find the number R such that the

ratio of R to the BEA service life equals the depreciation rates

reflected in used asset prices (for the components for which they did




                               14
not have data), and to use the average value of R to find depreciation

rates for the other categories. For four categories of equipment, they

found an average R of 1.65; for two types of buildings, the average is

0.91.

        We have adopted this distillation of the relation between market

depreciation and BEA services lives in our calculations rather than

attempting to relate the categories for which market depreciation rates

exist to various government categories. We have used this approach

chiefly because private and government assets may differ in their

pattern of service flow, even when private-sector counterparts to

government assets appear to exist. This is suggested by the differences

in BEA service lives for various assets, depending on whether they are

held by the federal government or the private sector, as shown in Table

2. Rather than attempting to second-guess these comparisons, we have

followed the approach of Hulten and Wykoff and accepted the BEA

assessments of the appropriate service lives for various items, and used

these lives to infer depreciation rates. The depreciation rates we use

are those consistent with Hulten and Wykoff's approach for their

non-market data cases, namely, 1.65/BEA service life for equipment, and

0.91/BEA service life for structures. The service lives that Hulten and

Wykoff use for the private sector are the "central's ones, so that no

Winfrey retirement pattern is used. For those assets for which detailed

service lives are available, however, we have utilized this detail.

This allows our estimates, like those of the BEA, to account properly

for the rapid "depreciation" of military equipment in wartime and its

aftermath.12 These problems and approximations suggest that our




                                 15
results should be interpreted with some caution; they are a first step,

not definitive.

     The Hulten-Wykoff depreciation rates are consistent with

observations of Young and Musgrave (1981), and of Hulten and Wykoff

(1981) in summarizing earlier studies: Equipment depreciates faster

than straightline in the early years, and structures depreciate more

slowly. These depreciation rates are certainly significant topics for

future research.   We feel that they are the best depreciation

estimates available which are consistent with the spirit of the asset-

price approach.

4. Results

     Our estimates of the net investment and net stock of federal

non-residential capital in constant 1984 dollars are reported in Tables

3 and 4, which also include those of the BEA. Appendix Table 1 shows

the same results in current dollars.




12. One drawback of any geometric approach is that some of the investment of
any year is always present in the capital stock. For some items, this
may not be plausible. Following World War II, there was a large
overhang of Federal capital, mostly in military categories. Much of the
stock of Federal military structures of 1945, with a service life of
fifty years, is still remaining: 48 percent, comprising 6 percent of
the total 1984 Federal nonresidential capital stock. By the BEA's
measure, investment from the early 1940's retains less than 20 percent
of its value, contributing only about 1.4 percent to the 1984 total. The
equipment of that era, though, has long ceased to making a significant
contribution to the total. Aircraft of that era had service lives as
short as three years, and these have depreciated to less than one
billionth of their original value. Some equipment, though, has been
more long-lived, particularly ships, (eg, the New Jersey), so that
World War II era equipment constitutes about 0.3 percent of the total
1984 Federal nonresidential capital stock.




                               16
        We estimate that the net federal capital stock is at an all-time

high of more than $800 billion after growing steadily since 1950. The

broad trends in our estimates are roughly consistent with those of the

BEA -   with   a sharp peak during World War II and growth after 1950 -

which is not surprising given our use of BEA figures for gross
investment and service lives. Nevertheless, as shown in Figure 1, we

obtain a strikingly different level and pattern for the net federal

capital stock. Whereas our value is more than 17 percent below that of

the BEA at the end of World War II, our estimate is currently 20 percent

higher. The net stock of the federal government in 1984 is 10 percent

above the World War II peak according to our estimates, while the BEA's

1984 figure is still 13 percent below its 1945 value.

        We also estimated the net federal capital stock using a frequently-

used alternative to straight-line depreciation, double-declining

balance. This series is also shown in Table 3. The double-declining

balance assumption yields a net stock which is always below the

estimates of the BEA, by as much as a third in 1945, but 15-20 percent

for most of the postwar period. Clearly, it is not only the form -

declining-balance    or straight-line -   of   depreciation which matters, but

also the rate.

        Since we start with a much lower net stock but end substantially

higher, our estimates of net federal non-residential investment are, of

course, larger than the BEA's over the post-war period. As shown in

Figure 2, however, the two series track quite closely over the last

thirty years. Note that the BEA estimates that net investment was

negative in seven years in that period, while, according to our

estimates, there was net disinvestment only in 1957.

     Disaggregated net capital stock and investment series for military



                                   17
and civilian equipment and structures are presented in 1984 dollars in

Tables 5 through 8.13 Our estimate of the net stock of structures

is always above that of the BEA, as shown in Figure 3. Straight-line

depreciation is always greater than 0.91-declining balance depreciation.

The difference between our aggregate net stock estimates and those of

the BEA in recent years is almost completely the result of differences

in the stock of structures. This can be seen in Figure 4, which compare

the two estimates of the net stock of equipment. The two series are

quite close after 1950. The more rapid early depreciation of 165-

declining-balance relative to straight line is approximately balanced by

its thicker tail. The more rapid early depreciation of equipment during

World War II more than outweighs, however, the slower depreciation of

structures. Equipment, which had fallen to less than 40 percent of the

net stock during the mid-70's after being two-thirds in 1945, is now 46

percent of the net stock.

     Figure 5 pictures the division of the aggregate federal capital

stock between military and non-military. It is interesting that, until

the 1980's, most of the postwar surges in the net stock of military

capital have corresponded to similar increases in civilian capital.     We

estimate military capital comprised 56 percent of the net federal non-

residential capital stock in 1984.

5.   Interpretations and Implications

     The results reported above amply document an important fact of life

in the U.S. economy: the federal government's capital is large and




13. Appendix Tables 2-5 show these data in current dollars.




                               18
growing, and federal government investment is an important part of

national capital formation. While the investment and capital stock

series exhibit interesting trends and movements of their own, the facts

that the federal capital stock is large and net investment

quantitatively important, irrespective of depreciation methods, are

the most important findings of this paper. In order to highlight the

importance of improved measures of federal government investment, net

capital formation, and depreciation, let us try to put these estimates

in perspective.

     First, Figure 6 compares our estimate of federal government net

investment with the federal government budget deficit. Obviously, the

federal government fiscal deficits currently swamp both gross and net

investment. In more normal budgetary times, however, failure to

separate capital and current expenditure accounts not only can cause a

mis-statement of the deficit, but in fact reverse its sign. A cursory

examination of Figure 6 reveals that for the bulk of the post-war period

through 1970, with an occasional exception, federal government net

investment exceeded the size of the federal government budget deficit,

implying that a federal government current expenditures budget would

actually have been in surplus. Numerous other adjustments need to be

made to make sense of federal government budget deficit figures, such as

adjusting for the decline in the real value of the federal government's

previously issued debt, inclusion of a variety of items left out of the

official budget figures, etc.14 Thus, we do not propose merely to



14. See Boskin (1982) and Boskin (1986).




                               19
subtract federal government net investment expenditures from total

outlays in order to arrive at a final current expenditures budget

deficit figure, but it is one important component to more comprehensive

and accurate budget reporting.

          Second, various historical episodes are of interest in the

composition of federal government net investment. These are displayed

pictorially in Figure 7. Of particular interest is the substantial rate

of military investment in the late 1950s and early l960s, followed by a

rii,—

occasional                2 or 3 year exception) until the Jimmy        Carter    and Ronald

Reagan years. Beginning in 1977, net military investment increased

substantially, and really took off in 1981. Non-military investment

grew from the late 1950s to a peak in 1966, and then began a substantial

decline until a trough at a trivial level from the late 1960s through

1976. Net non-military investment then grew substantially until 1980,

but has since declined.

          Next, consider measures of national wealth. While it is not our

purpose here to discuss various measures of the private capital stock,

we report in Figure 8 the BEA estimates of federal and private tangible

nonresidential capital, together with our estimates of federal capital

along with the Hulten/Wykoff (1981) estimates of private capital through

1974, the last year for which their data are available. Whether one

takes the BEA estimates or ours combined with Hulten/Wykoff, it is clear

that federal government capital is a substantial fraction, approximately

one-quarter, of private tangible capital. If we unified accounts for

all levels of government, including state and local governments, which

have much larger capital stocks in the aggregate than does the federal




                                                  20
 government, the government share of total tangible capital in the United

 States would be substantially larger. Thus, our national wealth is

 seriously understated if we ignore federal capital and estimates of the

growth of this tangible capital can also be misleading when growth rates

differ between government and private capital, as appears to have been

the case from a cursory examination of Figure 8. Note that, by either

measure, the federal capital stock has been growing less rapidly than

the private. While this trend is noteworthy, we draw no normative

conclusions.

     A comparison of gross and net federal investment with federal

expenditures on goods and services is given in Table 9. Gross

investment has returned to the level of the early 1950's -- more than 20

percent of federal expenditures --   after   falling below 15 percent in the

late 1960's. It is interesting that the current share is approximately

the sanie as is gross private domestic investment in the private domestic

product.

     Finally, we note in Table 10 a comparison of net federal government

investment to the traditional NIPA net national saving figures as a

share of NNP. On average, from 1951 to 1980, total net national saving

averaged between 6 percent and 7 percent of NNP. That figure has

plununetted in the 1980s, falling below 2 percent in 1982 and 1983.

Thus, in these years when the net investment of the federal government

was 0.7 percent of NNP, the net national saving rate could be

underestimated by more than a third by excluding net investment in

federal government tangible capital. As mentioned earlier, most of the

net federal investment in the l980s has been military. On average, net

federal investment ran about 10 percent of NIPA net saving. Of course,

there are other problems with the NIPA measures of net saving. We



                               21
prefer to include consumer durables as saving, and the rental flow from

them as consumption; and we would also impute services to the tangible

capital of state and local governments as consumption, while adding net

investment of this sector as part of net saving.

     While federal government net investment is a relatively modest

share of NNP, it is a substantial share of our very low traditionally

measured net national saving rate. It has also been growing during this

period of substantial nominal budget deficits on combined current and

capital accounts.

     Finally, ignoring net federal government investment and tangible

capital, failing to impute a service flow to the consumption from the

large net capital stock, etc., lead to mismeasurements of net national

product, consumption, and net saving and investment. For example, a

federal government capital stock of $800 billion would imply a

consumption out of that capital stock at current real interest rates of

one percent of net national income and therefore a 1.5 percent

understatement of consumption.15

     It is clear that for a variety of purposes, from properly measuring

net national income, consumption, saving, and national wealth to

understanding the uses of government funds, improved estimates of

government investment, depreciation, and capital stocks are potentially

valuable information. We hope in this paper that we have helped to



15. Ideally, national product accounts would include an income imputation to
all forms of capital not currently counted, including consumer durables
and state and local government capital, as well as federal capital.
Since we do not present comparable estimates of the stock of state and
local capital or consumer durables, we do not attempt to make a partial
adjustment here.
elevate the discussion of these issues to a position of greater

prominence and have begun to provide some very preliminary answers to

these important questions.
