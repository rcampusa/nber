Capital Controls, Global Liquidity Traps and the International Policy Trilemma

                                             ABSTRACT

The 'International Policy Trilemma' refers to the constraint on independent monetary policy that is
forced on a country which remains open to international financial markets and simultaneously pursues
an exchange rate target. This paper shows that, in a global economy with open financial markets, the
problem of the zero bound introduces a new dimension to the international policy trilemma. International
financial market openness may render monetary policy ineffective, even within a system of fully flexible
exchange rates, because shocks that lead to a 'liquidity trap' in one country are propagated through
financial markets to other countries. But monetary policy effectiveness may be restored by the imposition
of capital controls, which inhibit the transmission of these shocks across countries. We derive an optimal
monetary policy response to a global liquidity trap in the presence of capital controls. We further
show that, even though capital controls may facilitate effective monetary policy, except in the case
where monetary policy is further constrained (beyond the zero lower bound constraint), capital controls
are not desirable in welfare terms.

1     Introduction
Following the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the monetary authorities of many countries si-
multaneously reduced policy interest rates to record low levels, or even zero. But these
aggressively accommodative monetary policies failed to o↵set substantial declines in GDP
and increases in unemployment. Many countries found themselves in a ‘liquidity trap’, where
the zero bound on interest rates exposed the limits of accommodative monetary policy. Un-
like previous experiences where monetary policy was constrained by a liquidity trap, most
notably Japan in the early 2000’s, in the more recent cases the liquidity trap phenomenon
took on a global character. In particular, countries tightly linked by trade and financial
markets, such as the US, the UK, Canada and the Eurozone, experienced simultaneous
downturns matched by declines in policy rates to near zero levels.
    This paper explores the characteristics of the zero lower bound on policy interest rates
within a multi-country model where shocks that precipitate a liquidity trap tend to be
propagated through international financial markets. In our model, open trade and financial
markets give rise to global liquidity traps. This introduces a new dimension to the classic
open economy policy ‘trilemma’. In the standard interpretation of this phenomenon, coun-
tries which attempt to peg their exchange rate cannot also have both e↵ective monetary
policy and open capital markets. We point out a new aspect of the policy trilemma that
is implied by the zero bound constraint. Even with flexible exchange rates, a country that
is fully open to international capital markets may find itself limited by constraints on ef-
fective monetary policy actions. This is because external shocks can cause the zero bound
constraint to apply domestically as well. In fact, in the simple model of this paper, with
fully open capital markets, all liquidity traps are global, independent of the source of the
shock. A large external shock which pushes down ‘natural interest rates’ (defined as the
interest rate which supports zero inflation and the flexible price level of GDP) in the global
economy exposes the limits of e↵ective monetary policy when interest rates are linked by
integrated financial markets. In this sense, the constraints on e↵ective policy actions are
implied by open capital markets rather than by the desire to influence exchange rates.
    We then explore the impact of introducing capital controls on policy independence.
In the classic open economy model, capital controls help to sustain monetary independence
despite a goal of exchange rate stability. In our model, where the key constraint on monetary


                                              2
independence relates to the zero bound, capital controls can act so as to sustain e↵ective
monetary independence, even without any exchange rate target. In the presence of capital
controls, natural interest rates diverge across countries and the zero bound constraint on
policy no longer applies simultaneously across all countries. This implies that monetary
policy e↵ectiveness can be sustained in the face of external shocks that would otherwise
push the monetary authority towards the zero bound constraint.
       We develop a model to explore the way in which capital controls may operate to insulate
a country from shocks which would precipitate a liquidity trap in the case of fully open
financial markets. We also characterize optimal monetary policy in the presence of capital
controls. We focus on optimal policy under discretion. A particular implication of our results
is that optimal monetary policy may involve raising interest rates, even when conventional
analysis would indicate that interest rates are stuck at the zero bound.1
       Given that capital controls can sustain e↵ective monetary independence, it might be
expected that some level of capital market restrictions would be desirable relative to a
situation of free and open capital mobility. Surprisingly, our results show that this is not
the case. Capital controls are always welfare reducing, when monetary policy is chosen
optimally, even though capital controls can support a situation where the monetary policy
(of one country) remains e↵ective. The intuition behind this result is quite simple. Capital
controls reduce risk sharing by driving a wedge between natural interest rates in the two
economies. By doing so, they break the perfect correlation between the incidence of the
zero-bound constraint in both countries. But in each country, the policy rate is chosen
optimally, conditional on the degree of capital controls. We show that there are two regimes
in which the zero lower bound is binding. When capital controls are absent or limited in
scope, both countries are constrained by the zero bound. With substantial capital controls,
one country remains constrained by the zero bound while the other, which is not, sets an
optimal positive policy interest rate. Within each regime, an increase in the severity of
capital controls will reduce risk sharing and reduce welfare. Since an increase in the severity
   1
     The logic for this is explained in Cook and Devereux (2013). In the absence of the zero bound constraint,
the optimal policy is clearly for both countries to set policy rates equal to their ‘natural interest rates’, defined
as the interest rate that would obtain in a flexible price, zero inflation equilibrium. But when one country is
more constrained by the zero bound than another, it may be the case that this country experiences a terms
of trade and exchange rate appreciation, leading to expenditure switching towards the other country. As a
result, it may be optimal for that other country to raise interest rates in order to dampen the depreciation
in the terms of trade and exchange rate a↵ecting its economy.

of capital controls can also lead to a shift from the first to the second regime, it might be
thought that this can increase overall welfare. But this shift from one regime to the other
happens endogenously, when one country optimally chooses to move away from the zero-
bound on policy rates as capital controls are tightened. At this threshold level of capital
controls, where the country chooses to raise its interest rate above zero, welfare is identical
across regimes. It follows that the welfare benefit from shifting from the first regime to
the second regime, which allows for e↵ective monetary policy independence, is always o↵set
by the direct costs in terms of reduced cross country risk-sharing associated with increased
capital controls. An equivalent perspective is to see the move from the zero bound regime to
the positive interest regime is in fact an endogenous response to the e↵ects of the tightening
of capital controls. This policy response can ameliorate the negative welfare costs, but
cannot reverse them.
   The paper is related to a recent literature on the economics of liquidity traps. In par-
ticular, with the experience of Japan in mind, Krugman (1998), Eggertsson and Woodford
(2003, 2006), Jung et al (2005), Svensson (2003), Auerbach and Obstfeld (2005) and many
other writers explore how monetary and fiscal policy could be usefully employed even when
the authorities have no further room to reduce short term nominal interest rates. Recently,
a number of authors have revived this literature in light of the very similar problems recently
encountered by the economies of Western Europe and North America. Papers by Christiano
et al (2011), Devereux (2010), Eggertsson (2010) and Cogan et al (2010) have explored the
possibility of using government fiscal expansions, tax cuts and monetary policy when the
economy is in a liquidity trap.
   A recent literature also addresses the international dimensions of optimal policy in a
liquidity trap. Bodenstein et al (2009) is one example of a fully specified two country DSGE
model used to examine the international transmission of standard business cycle shocks
when one country is in a liquidity trap. Jeanne (2009) examines whether either monetary
policy or fiscal policy can implement an efficient equilibrium in a global liquidity trap in a
model of one-period-ahead pricing similar to that of Krugman (1998). Fujiwara et al (2010)
use numerical results to describe optimal monetary policy responses to asymmetric interest
rate shocks. The present paper describes natural interest rates as a function of demand
shocks and characterizes optimal policies analytically. Nakajima (2008) and Fujiwara et al
(2011) examine optimal policy responses to technology shocks in a model with a zero bound

                                              4
constraint. We focus on the role of capital controls in creating asymmetries in optimal
policies amongst countries di↵erentially a↵ected by a demand contraction in the tradition
of Eggertsson (2010). Cook and Devereux (2011) and Fujiwara and Ueda (2013) examine
the fiscal policy multiplier in an open economy at the lower bound. Cook and Devereux
(2013) explore how home bias in preferences generates asymmetries in the optimal policy
response to liquidity trap shocks. In the model of the present paper, we abstract entirely
from home bias in preferences. This implies that, if there were no controls on capital flows,
all countries would be a↵ected equally by demand shocks.
   A related paper on capital controls is Farhi and Werning (2012). They argue that, in
a fixed exchange rate regime, instituting capital controls may be beneficial as a means of
ensuring monetary policy independence, for example in response to risk premium shocks. In
contrast, we focus on the case of a flexible exchange rate regime where the loss of monetary
policy independence is a result of the zero lower bound rather than a fixed exchange rate.
And, in that context, we find that capital controls are never optimal. The main di↵erences
between the two analyses are as follows. In our paper, capital controls are not state contin-
gent responses to shocks, but act directly as a tax on capital flows which reduces financial
openness across countries. So capital controls cannot act as a substitute for monetary pol-
icy. Secondly, in our model, monetary policy is chosen optimally with and without capital
controls and, as argued above, the negative risk-sharing e↵ects of capital controls always
dominate the endogenous response of monetary policy in welfare terms. Finally, our wel-
fare assessment is based on an optimal cooperative policy measure, rather than focusing on
welfare for a small open economy.
   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section develops the basic model
and defines the way in which capital controls restrict financial risk-sharing. Section 3 defines
natural interest rates and examines an equilibrium with sticky prices. Section 4 examines
the determination of optimal monetary policy subject to a zero bound constraint and the
role of capital controls in a↵ecting policy. Section 5 looks at the welfare e↵ects of capital
controls. Some conclusions are then o↵ered.

2     A two country model with preference shocks
We assume there are two countries in a general equilibrium economy. Households in each
country consume goods and supply labour. Firms hire labour and sell to households, but are
constrained by the inability to adjust prices instantaneously. The countries are called ‘home’
and ‘foreign’, with foreign variables marked with an asterisk. The population measure is one
in each country, and each country produces a range of di↵erentiated goods. Governments
have access to lump sum taxation.


2.1      Households
Utility of the infinitely lived home household evaluated from date 0 is:

                                      1
                                      X
                            Ut = E0         ( )t (U (Ct , ⇠t )   V (Nt )),                 (1)
                                      t=0


where U and V represent, respectively, the utility of the composite home consumption
bundle Ct , and disutility of labour supply Nt . We define ⇠t as a shock to preferences (or a
‘demand’ shock), and assume that U12 > 0. Hence, a temporary, positive, ⇠t shock implies
that agents in the home country have an increase in their valuation of today’s consumption
relative to future consumption. A negative ⇠t shock implies agents wish to defer consumption
to the future, and so will wish to increase their desired savings.
    Composite consumption is defined as:

                                           1 1/2 1/2
                                       Ct = CHt CF t .                                     (2)
                                           2

CH is the consumption of the home country composite good, and CF consumption of the
foreign composite good, by the home household. In this specification, we assume no home
bias in consumption preferences. This assumption could easily be relaxed without substan-
tial consequence to the results. The special case of identical preferences highlights the tight
links between natural interest rates and the occurrence of liquidity traps in the analysis
below.
    Consumption aggregates CH and CF are composites, defined over a range of home and
foreign di↵erentiated goods, with elasticity of substitution ✓ between goods. Price indices

   The household’s implicit labour supply at nominal wage Wt is:

   We make a special assumption on the existence of financial markets. We assume first
that there is a complete set of financial assets that can be traded between countries so that,
in principal, there can be complete cross-country risk sharing. But, in addition, we assume
that countries may tax the returns on these financial assets, e↵ectively meaning that the
returns to home and foreign consumers may di↵er. At this point, we take these taxes as
arbitrarily determined. In a later section we will investigate the welfare e↵ects of these
taxes. It is assumed that the revenue (cost) of the tax (or subsidy) is financed by lump-sum
transfers (taxes). In the presence of the tax, optimal risk sharing implies:

                                                          St Pt⇤

where tt represents the state contingent tax on securities. We assume without loss of gener-
ality that the tax (or transfer) is levied only by the home government. Since we focus only
on optimal cooperative policy outcomes, this assumption is without force.
   In what follows, we assume that the specification for the optimal tax on security returns

then there is a trade deficit in that state, and there is a positive tax on security returns

vary the equilibrium allocation between unrestricted security trade with complete markets

                                              Yt (i) = Nt (i).                                           (9)

Profits are written as ⇧t (i) = PHt (i)Yt (i) ( ✓ ✓ 1 )Wt Nt (i). This implicitly involves an optimal
subsidy, financed by lump-sum taxation, designed to eliminate steady-state first-order inef-
ficiencies. Each firm re-sets its price according to Calvo pricing with probability of adjusting
   2
    Our assumption is that the tax is imposed only by the home country and the proceeds are rebated in
a lump-sum fashion (or the cost of subsidies is raised by a lump-sum tax). This is sufficient to characterize
the impact of capital controls on optimal policy, since it is necessary to have only one country imposing
taxes in order to drive a wedge between natural interest rates across countries. Note that the paper does
not characterize a state contingent optimal tax schedule. If taxes were imposed by both countries and
chosen separately, then there would be a clear strategic interaction in tax setting, and the characterization
of equilibrium would be considerably more complex.

price index for the home good then follows:

                                                                                1

The behaviour of foreign firms and the foreign good price index is exactly analogous.


2.3    Monetary Policy
We characterize monetary policy as a targeting rule, where the rule represents the solution
to an optimal monetary policy problem described below. Operationally, optimal targeting
is achieved by adjustments in the policy interest rate, subject to the policy rate satisfying
the zero bound constraint. As we describe below, in some instances it is optimal for one or
both monetary authorities to set their policy rates to zero – the zero bound constraint – as
this is the best that discretionary monetary policy can do.

    An equilibrium with positive nominal interest rates is described by the equations (5),
(8), (10), (11) and (13) for the home country, and the analogous equations for the foreign
country. Together with (6), and for given values of Vt and Vt⇤ , given monetary rules (to be

3      The E↵ects of Demand Shocks
We now explore the impact of shocks which push one or both monetary authorities towards
the zero bound on interest rates. These are shocks which reduce the marginal utility of
today’s consumption, relative to the marginal utility of future consumption, leading to a
fall in equilibrium real interest rates. If real interest rates that would accommodate the
fall in current marginal utility for a given path of consumption fall below zero, then the
monetary authority may be constrained by the zero lower bound. As a short-hand, we refer
to these as demand or savings shocks.

in the home country, with an equivalent definition for the foreign country. A temporary
fall in ✏t will raise savings and reduce real interest rates. We assume that savings shocks
are independent across countries. In the analysis below, we make more specific assumptions
about the stochastic distributions of ✏t and ✏⇤t .


3.1      The flexible price allocation
To explore the nature of this special case, first focus on the flexible price allocation, ex-
pressed in terms of linear approximations around a steady state. A lower case variable
represents a log deviation from the steady state value, xt = ln(Xt /X̄). The home and for-
eign goods market clearing conditions (here ⌧ is the home terms of trade in terms of linear
approximation) are given by:

This expression represents a convex combination of the complete markets condition (first
expression in brackets) and the financial market autarky condition (final expression in brack-
ets). With       = 1 (0) we have complete markets (financial autarky). Note that financial
autarky doesn’t rule out goods trade, so the terms of trade still plays a role in the dynamics
of the model.
   Combining (5) with (10) in the case where  = 0, the flexible price equilibrium allocation,
gives optimal production for the home and foreign countries:

                       . So the values of output, the terms of trade and consumption under fully
flexible prices are linear combinations of their values under complete markets and under au-
tarky. With complete markets, output responses under flexible prices are identical across
countries. There are no terms-of-trade movements but, due to country-specific preference
shocks, consumption di↵ers between the home and foreign countries. With incomplete mar-


                                                          11
kets, the trade balance is zero in each country and output responses di↵er across countries:
a home demand shock causes a terms-of-trade deterioration, but consumption responses are
identical.3


3.2       Natural interest rates
Now we can work out the natural interest rates in our model. These are the real interest
rates that would hold with fully flexible prices. Natural interest rates are an object of
interest because, with an unrestricted monetary policy, setting policy rates equal to the
natural interest rate in both countries achieves a first-best allocation with zero inflation.
The question then arises of how policy rates should be set when natural interest rates dip
below zero, and policy rates cannot follow.
       The natural interest rate is given by r̃t = Et (ct+1                   ct )   Et (✏t+1   ✏t ) for the home
country, and similarly for the foreign country, when consumption is evaluated at the flexible
price equilibrium. In order to compute natural interest rates we assume for now that the
shocks ✏ and ✏⇤ can be characterized as Markov processes with continuation probability µ.
Specifically, given any shock ✏t , assume this shock continues with probability µ and goes
to zero with probability 1                 µ. We make the same assumption regarding ✏⇤ , and assume
that the home and foreign shocks are independent.4 Since there are no state variables in
the economy, this means that, with a shock ✏t 6= 0, all variables have expected persistence
given by µ.
       Using these assumptions, and substituting the solutions for consumption, gives the nat-
ural interest rates as:

                                    1 (1    µ) (✏t + ✏⇤t )             1 (1     µ)(( + 2 )✏t       ✏⇤t )
         r̃( , ✏t , ✏⇤t ) = ⇢ + !                          + (1   !)                                       ,   (24)
                                    2       ( + )                      2            ( + )
   3
      Note that even in the case of identical preferences and unit elasticity of substitution across home and
foreign goods, it is not true that financial autarky and complete markets support identical allocations, as
might be surmised from the well-known Cole and Obstfeld (1991) result. Cole and Obstfeld’s result applies
to productivity shocks. Here, the shocks are due to changes in e↵ective rates of time preference. In a
complete markets environment, these would not require any movement in the terms of trade. Thus, the
terms of trade cannot act as a proxy for establishing e↵ective risk-sharing, in contrast to Cole and Obstfeld.

where ⇢ = ln(           ) is the rate of time preference, which in this model equals the real interest
rate in a non-stochastic steady state.
   Note that for          = 1 we have ! = 1 and natural interest rates are equated. Despite the
presence of country specific preference shocks, because financial markets are fully integrated
and consumer price indices are identical, real interest rates must be equated. We might then
suspect that, with complete financial markets, countries will be simultaneously constrained
by the zero bound constraint on interest rates. Indeed, we show below that, with                        = 1, the
occurrence of a liquidity trap (where the monetary authorities set the policy rate to zero)
is always simultaneous in the two countries.
   On the other hand, for                 = 0, natural interest rates are negatively correlated. In
this case, home and foreign consumption respond to an ✏ shock identically. For a positive
home shock ✏, this implies that the foreign natural interest rate falls, because consumption
is expected to fall over time. But in the home country, the fall in expected consumption
growth is combined with a rise in e↵ective time preference, so that the home natural interest
rate rises overall.
   Given that natural interest rates are imperfectly correlated when                   < 1, it is no longer
necessarily the case that the zero bound on policy interest rates will occur simultaneously in
both countries. As we show below, the optimal monetary policy may involve optimal policy
rates deviating from one another. In e↵ect, the presence of imperfect financial markets
generates a degree of e↵ective monetary policy independence when monetary policy is chosen
as an optimal targeting policy.
   To illustrate the determination of natural interest rates, take the example where there
is a negative shock emanating from the home country alone, so that ✏t < 0 and ✏⇤t = 0.
Moreover, assume the shock is such that for = 1, r̃t = r̃t⇤ < 0. Then, from (24) and (25),
there must exist a value ¯ where 0 < ¯ < 1 such that, for  ¯ , r̃⇤ > 0. Figure 1 illustrates
                                                                                t

such a case. As    falls below 1, the home natural real interest rate declines, but the foreign
natural real interest rate rises. At ¯ , the foreign natural real interest rate is zero. We pursue
this as a leading example below, when we examine the determination of optimal monetary
policy.

3.3    Inflation and output gaps with sticky prices
Now we use the model of section 2 to derive the solution under sticky prices. Standard
linear approximations (see, for example, Cook and Devereux, 2011) allows us to derive the
following equations, which jointly determine the dynamics of inflation and output gaps in
the two countries when natural interest rates are governed by (24) and (25). We define PPI
inflation for the home (foreign) country as ⇡t (⇡t⇤ ). Then:

where x̂ represents the log deviation of x from its flexible price equilibrium value; hence x̂
represents a ‘gap’ term.
    If there were no constraints on interest rates then monetary authorities could close all
gaps by setting policy rates equal to natural interest rates and achieve zero output gaps and
zero inflation. This would achieve the ‘divine coincidence’ in an international setting, as
defined by Blanchard and Gali (2007). But this is not possible when nominal interest rates
are constrained by the zero bound, and at least one of r̃ and r̃⇤ is negative.
    How preference shocks impact on inflation and output gaps at the zero bound depends
not only on the degree of capital mobility, and the implied path of natural interest rates,
but also on the policy response. We now turn to the analysis of optimal policy.


4     Optimal monetary policy
We now characterize optimal monetary policy, where policy is chosen in a cooperative fashion
to maximize an equal weighted sum of home and foreign welfare. We focus on a discretionary
monetary policy environment. This means that policy-makers take all expectations of future
economic variables and future policy choices as given.5 Furthermore, in determining optimal



                                                         14
monetary policy, we explicitly take account of the zero bound on policy interest rates.
    Initially, we will take the value of     as given. The focus is then on how di↵erent degrees of
capital mobility a↵ect the optimal monetary policy response in a liquidity trap environment.
In a later section, we examine the e↵ects of         on welfare both directly and indirectly through
its influence on optimal monetary policy.


4.1     Welfare Approximation
In order to formulate optimal policy, we first have to determine the welfare function. Follow-
ing the literature on welfare approximations developed by Woodford (2003), Benigno and
Woodford (2012) and, for open economies, Benigno and Benigno (2006) and Engel (2011),
we can compute social welfare as a second order approximation to an equal weighted sum
of home and foreign utility.6 Unlike most of this literature, however, the relevant measure
of welfare is not simply a function of ‘gaps’, or deviations of the critical aggregate variables
from their flexible price equilibrium values. This is because the value of , representing the
degree of capital market integration, will a↵ect the distribution of flexible price equilibrium
variables. Thus, in determining the welfare e↵ects of , we cannot ignore the welfare approx-
imation of the flexible price equilibrium economy. While this is not a↵ected by monetary
policy, it is clearly dependent on the degree of capital market openness.
    Cook and Devereux (2011) describe the details involved in computing the welfare objec-
   5
     An optimal monetary policy with commitment, in face of the zero bound constraint, is defined and
explored by Eggertsson and Woodford (2003). This requires that the central bank engage in ‘forward
guidance’ by announcing a path of interest rates to hold in the aftermath of the liquidity trap. Without
credible commitment however, this policy is not time-consistent. Our focus on the case of discretionary
monetary policy can be defended on two grounds: a) this is the situation where the zero bound has the
greatest real e↵ects, as discussed in Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) and Adam and Billi (2007), and thus
the potential gains from escaping the zero bound are likely to be very high; and b) unlike the discretionary
case in the closed economy, where the central bank follows a passive zero-interest policy, in the global
context outlined here, it is shown that discretion allows for activism in monetary policy so long as some
capital controls are in place. Note that besides focusing on discretion, we also restrict ourselves to Markov
equilibria. By doing so, we only condition on current shocks and ignore their history. And because our
model has no (endogenous) state variables, we do not need to include the impact of current policy choices
on future policy choices. It is possible that better outcomes are possible if the central bank responds to
past shocks (as well as current shocks), even under discretion. We briefly discuss how commitment in policy
would a↵ect our results in the conclusions.
   6
     As in Engel (2011), we focus on cooperative monetary policy design. The non-cooperative monetary
policy setting involves a substantial increase in complexity, related to the point of approximation of the
welfare function, the initial conditions and the definition of strategy spaces – see, in particular, Benigno
and Benigno (2006).

tive. Taking a second-order approximation to an equal-weighted sum of home and foreign
utility around a non-stochastic steady state, we derive an approximate welfare function.
Since we focus on a discretionary policy equilibrium, only the contemporaneous terms in
the welfare function are relevant.7 These are given by:

Here VF t is the second order approximation to the social welfare function evaluated at the
fully flexible price equilibrium. Clearly, from (19)-(23), this will depend on the value of .
The other expressions indicate that welfare is a function of the squares and cross products
of output gaps and squares of inflation rates.
       The optimal cooperative monetary policy under discretion may be described as the
solution to the following problem:

    For this approach to a discretionary equilibrium, see for instance Clarida et al. (1999). By definition
in such a discretionary equilibrium policy-makers take future policy instruments and expectations of future
variables as given. Hence, the optimal discretionary policy can be described by focusing only on the
maximization of current period utility. In the case where the zero lower bound binds for both countries,
the optimal discretionary policy is simply to set nominal interest rates to zero for the period.



                                                                               16
i = 1..4, j = 1, 2, that maximizes (30) subject to (26)-(29) and the two non-negativity con-
straints on nominal interest rates, rt           0, rt⇤     0.
        The solution to this problem depends solely on the characteristics of the natural interest
rates, which in turn depend on the individual preference shocks and the capital mobility
parameter . If both r̃t and r̃t⇤ are greater than zero, then the solution is simply rt = r̃t and
rt⇤ = r̃t⇤ , and all gaps are closed. But we focus on the case where at least one of r̃t and r̃t⇤ are
less than zero. In this case, at least one of the non-negativity constraints will be binding.
        In the appendix, we show that the solution to problem (P1) may be reduced to two
conditions relating policy interest rates to natural interest rates, and the multipliers         1t   and
 2t .   These are:
                                              1                1
                                  rt = r̃t + (⌦ + ⌦)       1t + (⌦        ⌦)   2t ,                   (32)
                                              2                2
                                              1                1
                                  rt⇤ = r̃t⇤ + (⌦ + ⌦)     2t + (⌦        ⌦)   1t .                   (33)

These conditions must be combined with the comparative slackness conditions: a) rt                      0,
 1t       0 and rt   1t   = 0; and b) rt⇤   0,   2t   0 and rt⇤   2t   = 0. The expressions ⌦ and ⌦ are
defined in the appendix, and satisfy the conditions ⌦ > (=, <) ⌦ when                   > (=, <) 1, and
⌦ > 0, ⌦ > 0. Note that when                = 1, ⌦ = ⌦, and conditions (31) and (32) dichotomize
so that the solution is rt = max(0, r̃t ) and rt⇤ = max(0, r̃t⇤ ). But in general, rt and rt⇤ will be
simultaneously determined.
        First note that from (24) and (25) that when               = 1, so that there is complete risk
sharing, r̃t = r̃t⇤ . In this case, the only solution that is consistent with (32), (33) and the
comparative slackness conditions is rt = rt⇤ = max(0, r̃t ). Thus, without capital controls, if
one country is in a liquidity trap, then both must be so simultaneously.
        Now, to characterize the optimal monetary policy choice, we focus again on the example
of Figure 1 where r̃t < 0 and r̃t  r̃t⇤ . We can then use the solutions to (32) and (33) to
establish the following Proposition.


Proposition 1 When natural interest rates satisfy the conditions r̃t < 0 and r̃t  r̃t⇤ , the

optimal monetary policy is characterized by the conditions:

                                       a) rt = 0,
                                                                      ⌦  ⌦
                                       b) rt⇤ = max(0, r̃t⇤                r̃t ).
                                                                      ⌦ +⌦

Proof. There are four cases to consider: (i) rt > 0, rt⇤ > 0; (ii) rt > 0, rt⇤ = 0; (iii) rt = 0,
rt⇤ > 0; and (iv) rt = 0, rt⇤ = 0. We consider them in turn. In case (i), if both policy rates
are positive, then, since     1t   =    2t   = 0, we have rt = r̃t and rt⇤ = r̃t⇤ , which is a contradiction,
for at least rt . Case (ii) implies that            1t   = 0, so combining (32) and (33) we have:

                                                                       ⌦
                                            rt = r̃t     r̃t⇤    2            2t .
                                                                     ⌦ +⌦

Again, this is a contradiction, since the right hand side of this equation is negative, and
therefore rt > 0 cannot hold.
   In case (iii), solving (32) and (33), we get:

                                                                 ⌦  ⌦
                                                rt⇤ = r̃t⇤            r̃t .
                                                                 ⌦ +⌦

This is feasible so long at the right hand side is non-negative.
   In case (iv) we solve (32) and (33) to obtain:

                                                 r̃t (⌦ + ⌦) + r̃t⇤ (⌦               ⌦)
                                       1t   =                                             ,

   Proposition 1 has immediate implications for the e↵ect of capital controls on optimal
monetary policy. To illustrate the e↵ect of                     on the optimal choice of monetary policy, now
return to the example of Figure 1, where ✏t < 0 and ✏⇤t = 0, and assume ✏t is large enough in
absolute terms such that r̃t = r̃t⇤ < 0 when                    = 1. Then, Proposition 1 immediately implies


                                                                18
that the optimal discretionary interest rate rule is zero, for both countries, when                = 1. In
addition, from the analysis of Figure 1, it is clear that rt = 0 for all possible values of .
Thus, the home country is always constrained by the zero bound. But the analysis for the
foreign country depends on the value of . From Figure 1 we know that there exists a value
¯ such that r̃⇤ > 0 for < ¯ . But Proposition 1 says that the optimal foreign interest rate
                t

is not always equal to r̃t⇤ , even when r̃t⇤ > 0. The value of rt⇤ depends both on r̃t⇤ and the
parameter . Take first the case where                 > 1. Then from Proposition 1 it is clear that
rt⇤   r̃t⇤ . More generally, from Proposition 1 part (iii), it is clear that there exists a value of
  , denoted H , where H > ¯ , such that r⇤ > 0 for < H . Thus, for
                                                  t                               1, there is always
a value of     such that the foreign country is outside the liquidity trap zone. Moreover, in
this case, there is a range in which the foreign country chooses a positive interest rate, even
though its natural interest rate is negative.8
      In the special case of         = 1, then Proposition 1 implies that rt = max(0, r̃t⇤ ), and the
foreign policy rate is exactly as in a closed economy. It is still the case that the foreign
monetary policy response depends on the degree of capital mobility, with the foreign policy
rate above zero for all < ¯ .
      Finally, in the case     < 1, then from the optimal policy of Proposition 1 we cannot say
whether there exists any value of such that the foreign policy rate is positive. On the one
hand, for any < ¯ , the r̃⇤ component of the monetary rule of Proposition 1 is positive.
                                 t

But the second component is always negative since, for              < 1, ⌦ < ⌦.
      The situation with       > 1 is illustrated in Figure 2. The figure shows the case where
✏t < 0 and ✏⇤t = 0, and describes the value of r̃t⇤ , and the optimal foreign interest rate rt⇤ ,
for di↵erent values of . The general implication is that increasing capital controls reduces
the likelihood that the demand shock originating in the home country pushes the foreign
country into a liquidity trap. Equivalently, increasing capital controls preserves e↵ective
monetary independence in the sense that optimal monetary policy is not constrained by the
zero bound.
      The intuition for the link between capital controls and e↵ective monetary independence
is not a direct application of the well-known policy trilemma which says that, in the absence
of exchange rate adjustment, monetary independence can only be attained under the cover
   8
     A case similar to this (without capital controls but with home bias in preferences) is examined by Cook
and Devereux (2013).



                                                      19
of capital controls. In the present case, we have not imposed any restrictions at all on
exchange rate adjustment. Each country is assumed to have an independent interest rate
policy, and the exchange rate can therefore adjust freely. But interest rate adjustment can
be followed only so long as it does not violate the zero lower bound. The key feature of the
model is that, even under fully flexible exchange rates, optimal monetary adjustment to a
demand shock coming from the rest of the world may push the monetary policy authority
into a region where monetary policy is ine↵ective, and the best that can be done is to set a
zero interest rate. It is clearly an option to have a higher interest rate, but it is suboptimal.
When there is full capital mobility ( = 1), large negative demand shocks are propagated
world-wide because natural interest rates are equated across countries. These shocks, then,
lead to a global liquidity trap so that monetary policy is ine↵ective even though there is
no restriction on exchange rate adjustment. By contrast, the presence of capital controls
leads to a divergence among natural interest rates, and hence may restore e↵ective monetary
independence for a country reacting to an external shock.
      We noted from Figure 2 that the foreign country’s optimal response to an external shock
may be to raise the policy interest rate, even when its own natural interest rate is negative.
The logic behind this comes from (24) and (25). When                         < 1, natural interest rates are
more likely to be negatively correlated than positively correlated across countries. Then
a negative home demand shock may create an expansionary shock in the foreign country,
leading optimal monetary policy to be more contractionary than it would were it a closed
economy.9
      To see this more clearly, we may use conditions (26)-(29) and the solution to (14)-(16) to
track the response of the exchange rate to a demand shock originating in the home country,
when both countries are constrained by the zero bound on interest rates. By definition, the
exchange rate is equal to the terms of trade multiplied by the relative price of the home
good to the foreign good, PH /PF . Thus, we may describe the dynamics of the exchange
rate by:
                                   st    st   1   = ⌧t   ⌧t   1   + ⇡Ht   ⇡F t .                       (34)

Conditions (14)-(15) imply that, in all cases, the response of the terms of trade to a demand
shock is given by ⌧t = yt        yt⇤ . Using this, and the solutions to (26)-(29), we can show that,
  9
      In the closed economy, the optimal policy rate would always equal the natural interest rate.



                                                         20
when neither country’s interest rate responds to a home country shock ✏t , the unanticipated
response of the exchange rate is:

                                         (1    !)(1 µ)(1  µ + k(1 + ))✏t
                       st   E t 1 st =                                   .                       (35)
                                              (1   µ)(1 µ) kµ(1 + )

From (35) we see that, for a negative demand shock, the home country exchange rate
appreciates whenever ! < 1 (that is, whenever there are restrictions on capital markets).
As we saw, in the limit with completely free capital flows, natural interest rates are identical
and there is no relative price change at all. But with some restrictions on capital mobility, the
foreign natural interest rate falls by less than the home natural interest rate. Consequently
there is a greater decline in home output relative to foreign output, and a home terms-of-
trade appreciation, mirrored in an exchange rate appreciation. This implies that there is
expenditure switching away from the home country and towards the foreign country. At
the point   H    in Figure 2, the optimal monetary policy rule indicates that it is desirable to
raise interest rates in the foreign country, which acts to limit the degree of home country
appreciation (or foreign depreciation). Figure 3 illustrates the response of the nominal
exchange rate for a given value of the shock ✏t , for di↵erent values of : at lower values of
 , the home exchange rate appreciates more. For            <   H,   the exchange rate is still falling
in , but the degree of response is less, because declining           is matched by a rising foreign
interest rate.
   The importance of the inter-temporal elasticity of substitution in determining the foreign
policy response to a home country shock comes from the role of             in governing the interna-
tional transmission of shocks. When           > 1 then, ceteris paribus, a home output contraction
tends to be expansionary in the foreign country. Intuitively, this comes from the mixture of
wealth and substitution e↵ects on marginal cost. A fall in home output, given (17), leads
to a fall in home consumption and a decline in marginal cost. But, simultaneously, this is
countered by a real appreciation of the home terms of trade, which is a depreciation of the
foreign terms of trade, increasing marginal cost for the foreign country. When             = 1, these
two factors exactly balance out and the net e↵ect is zero. When               > 1, foreign marginal
cost tends to fall, leading the e↵ect to be expansionary. When            < 1, foreign marginal cost
rises, leading the e↵ect to be contractionary. This logic then translates into the transmis-
sion of demand shocks, when capital mobility is imperfect. When                 > 1 and     < 1, the


                                                   21
imperfect correlation of demand shocks tends to be associated with small or even negative
international transmission of the home ✏ shock to the foreign output gap. Whereas, when
    < 1, the demand shocks tend to foster positive transmission between output gaps across
countries. Consequently, the optimal monetary policy response in the foreign country to
a negative ✏ shock is more likely to be contractionary in the       > 1 case, as illustrated in
Figure 2.


5      Welfare e↵ects of capital controls
In the previous section, we showed that the introduction of capital controls could restore
e↵ective monetary independence. Without capital controls, large negative demand shocks
precipitated a uniform global liquidity trap in which neither country could gainfully employ
countercyclical monetary policy. But, in response to the same shock, with capital controls
such that     <   H,   a country will find it optimal to directly respond to external demand
shocks. The size of the policy response depends upon both the degree of capital market
restrictions and the value of .
     This raises the question of the welfare consequences of capital market restrictions. Absent
the zero bound on interest rates, monetary policy can be used independently in either
country: there is e↵ective monetary independence (assuming no other preconditions on
monetary policy, such as an exchange rate peg). In this case, capital controls would have
no compensating benefit in terms of allowing independent monetary policy, and so should
be unambiguously welfare reducing. But, in the case where shocks can be large enough to
push one or both countries into a liquidity trap, it might be anticipated that, by supporting
e↵ective monetary policy independence, some degree of capital market restrictions may be
welfare enhancing. We now investigate this proposition.
     Initially, however, we establish that in the absence of the zero lower bound, capital con-
trols as represented by    < 1 must always be welfare reducing. We can show this very easily
in the following proposition.


Proposition 2 When monetary policy is not constrained by the zero bound, capital controls
are welfare reducing.



                                               22
Proof. When shocks are such that neither country is ever constrained by the zero bound
in setting optimal monetary policy, then clearly the optimal monetary response for both
countries is to set the policy rate equal to their respective natural rates. Thus optimal
monetary policy is described by rt = r̃r and rt⇤ = r̃t⇤ . In this case, it is obvious from (26)-
(29) that all output gaps are zero, and each country’s inflation rate is zero. Then welfare
may be approximated by the second term in (30), which is VF t , the welfare approximation
under flexible prices.
     Under the assumption that ✏t and ✏⇤t are independent and have identical variance V ar✏ ,
we may show that

                           1     (  1)             (   + +               +1+ 2 )
             Et 1 VF t =                 V ar✏ + 2                               V ar✏ .   (36)
                           2 (1 + )( + )             ( + 1)(2              + 1)2

Then it is straightforward to show that

                      dEt 1 VF t        (    + +1+     +             )
                                   =2                                    V ar✏ > 0.        (37)
                                            ( + 1)(2       +   1)3



     Therefore, not surprisingly, a rise in , indicating increased risk-sharing, unambiguously
increases global welfare when monetary policy is unconstrained by the zero bound constraint.
     The more interesting case arises when capital controls may play a role in supporting
e↵ective monetary independence. Somewhat surprisingly, we can show that, even in this
case, capital controls still cannot be welfare-enhancing. While the presence of capital con-
trols may successfully protect a country from being pushed into a liquidity trap, the welfare
loss from decreased risk-sharing always dominates the welfare benefit from a more active
monetary policy.
     To see this, we proceed as follows. From (26)-(29) and (30), it is clear that, given
VF t , capital controls impact on welfare only by a↵ecting the natural interest rates (24) and
(25). Moreover, we have shown above that, absent the zero bound, capital controls can
a↵ect welfare only through the term VF t . Thus, to show the welfare consequence of capital
controls for given VF t , we have to focus on cases where the zero bound is binding for one or
both countries. We do this by examining welfare across the di↵erent segments of the value
of    which generate di↵erent degrees of monetary policy response.


                                                 23
       For ease of interpretation, we take the case where ✏t < 0 and ✏⇤t = 0 and ✏t+j = {✏t , 0},
with probability µ and 1            µ, respectively. so that, if capital controls can support e↵ective
monetary independence, they do so for the foreign country.10 Thus, from (24) and (25),
we have r( , ✏t , 0) < 0 and r( , ✏t , 0)  r⇤ ( , ✏t , 0). If capital controls do support e↵ective
monetary independence, then there exists a value of                       =     H   such that, for       H (<   H ),
                       ⌦ ⌦
rt⇤ = 0 (rt⇤ = r̃t⇤        r̃ ).
                       ⌦ +⌦ t
       Now, we can decompose welfare into two segments. First, for                               H,   we can solve
(25)-(28) to obtain inflation and output gaps when both countries are constrained by the
zero lower bound. We can then substitute these into (29) to obtain the following expression
for welfare as a function of natural interest rates:

                             V1t ( , ✏, 0) =   VF t    ⇤(r̃( , ✏t , 0)2 + r̃⇤ ( , ✏t , 0)2 )
                                                                                                                (38)
                                                         (r̃( , ✏t , 0) + r̃⇤ ( , ✏t , 0))2 ,

                1 (1+ )((1   µ)2 +✓k(1+ ))
where ⇤ =       2 (1 µ)((1   µ) µk(1+ ))
                                             > 0 and      > 0 is a function of the underlying parameter
values. How does V1t depend on ? Abstracting from the VF t term, take the third right-
hand-side term of (38). From (24) and (25), we see that:

                                                                          (1    µ)
                                 r̃( , ✏t , 0) + r̃⇤ ( , ✏t , 0) = 2⇢ +            ✏t .
                                                                               +

Hence, this term is independent of . While capital controls do a↵ect the response of each
country’s individual natural interest rate to a demand shock, they do not a↵ect the average
world response of the natural interest rate.
       Now turn to the second term on the right hand side. Define R2 ⌘ r̃( , ✏t , 0)2 +r̃⇤ ( , ✏t , 0)2 .
In general, this will be sensitive to the value of . Using (24) and (25), we may show that:

                                      dR2    (µ 1)2 (            1)2 ✏2
                                          =2                                   < 0.
                                       d       (2               + 1)3

This is decreasing in , which implies that the second term on the right hand side of (38)
is increasing in . Hence, starting at                 < 1, an increase in the degree of capital controls
  10
    This is for ease of exposition only. The argument presented below holds more generally, so long as
monetary policy can react optimally to changes in , as will be seen below. For simplicity also, we focus on
ex-post welfare, given an ✏t shock.



                                                          24
(fall in ) unambiguously reduces welfare when both countries are constrained by the zero
bound. This is not surprising since, when both countries are at the zero bound, capital
controls have no compensating e↵ect in facilitating e↵ective monetary independence.
   To see the potential benefit of capital controls, now take the case where                                <   H   so that
the foreign policy interest rate is given by part (iii) of Proposition 1. In this case, we may
show that:
                                V2t ( , ✏t , 0) =           VF t        1 r̃(   , ✏t , 0)2 ,                             (39)

where   1   > 0 is again a function of the underlying parameter values (and independent of
 ). Note that because       <      H,   Proposition 1, case (iii), applies and V2t is independent of
r̃t⇤ . The optimal foreign interest rate policy completely o↵sets any movements in the foreign
natural interest rate. So, in the region             <       H,    welfare depends on capital controls only to
the extent that    a↵ects the home country natural interest rate.
   How does (39) depend on ? Again, abstracting from the VF t term, which is common
to both (38) and (39), we have

                            dr̃( , ✏t , 0)2                                 (1        µ)✏t
                                            =        r̃( , ✏t , 0)                           .
                                 d                                     (2              + 1)2

This is negative when ✏t < 0, implying that a rise in                            raises welfare, conditional on VF t ,
from (38). So, again, more binding capital controls reduce welfare even when the capital
controls are supporting e↵ective monetary independence for the foreign country. Hence, a
tightening of capital controls reduces welfare whether policy is in the region of                                   H,   and
both countries are at the zero bound, or in the region                            <     H,     so that the foreign country
has e↵ective monetary independence.
   But is it possible that V2t > V1t , so that an increase in capital controls which pushes the
policy environment from the first region to the second region increases welfare? The answer
is no. The reason is straightforward. Because                      H   is defined by the condition

                                        V1t (   H , ✏, 0)   = V2t (     H , ✏, 0),



it must be that, at     =     H,   welfare in the first region is identical to that in the second
region. Hence, welfare must be continuously increasing in                              across both regions. So while a
tightening of capital controls acts so as to facilitate e↵ective monetary independence as we


                                                            25
move from region 1 to region 2, it cannot increase welfare.
      Putting all these arguments together, we can state the following proposition


Proposition 3 An increase in capital controls reduces welfare when one or both countries
are constrained by the zero lower bound, even if the increase leads one country to move out
of the zero lower bound region.

Proof. See above argument.

      The intuition behind this result is very clear. The zero bound constraint is not a physical
restriction on policy, but a policy choice. When            H,   each country could choose a positive
nominal interest rate but prefers not to, given their natural interest rates r̃t and r̃t⇤ . As
falls, so that capital controls become more binding, it can be advantageous for one country
to move out of the zero lower bound region. This leads welfare to be higher than it would
were it to maintain a zero interest rate. But, because it chooses interest rates optimally
for every value of , there is no discrete increase in welfare as policy moves out of the zero
interest rate region. Essentially, the tightening of capital controls leads to an optimal policy
which raises interest rates in the foreign country, precisely to o↵set the negative welfare
e↵ects of these controls. But the interest rate response can only ameliorate the negative
welfare e↵ect of the increased controls. It cannot overturn it. So while tightening capital
controls can help to increase the e↵ectiveness of monetary policy, any gain from this is more
than o↵set by the cost of reduced risk sharing.
      Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between     and welfare. Welfare is increasing in .
For      <   H,   the slope of the relationship becomes less steep because, in this region, the
foreign country is following an activist monetary rule given by case (iii) of Proposition 1.
But it is still the case that overall welfare is lower for all values of     <   H   than for   >   H.

Welfare is monotonically increasing in , for         < 1.


5.1      Suboptimal monetary policy and gains from capital controls
Is there any case in which an increase in capital controls is associated with higher welfare
due to the improved e↵ectiveness of monetary policy? Proposition 3 establishes that this
cannot be the case, so long as policy adjusts continuously to changes in                , for a given
demand shock ✏t . But it could be that monetary policy does not adjust continuously to

                                                26
the external environment. In particular, the optimal rule in Proposition 1 requires that
the foreign country follows a positive interest rate even in cases where its natural interest
rate is negative. From a communications perspective, this rule may be hard to implement.
Here, we briefly explore the implications of an alternative, suboptimal rule that represents
a variation of Proposition 1 but rules out an activist policy when r̃t⇤ is negative. Focusing
on the case where      > 1, consider the policy rule given by:

                                                             ⌦  ⌦
                                     rt⇤ = It (r̃t⇤    r̃t        );
                                                             ⌦ +⌦
                                      It = 1 if            r̃t⇤ > 0;                             (40)

                                      It = 0 otherwise.

Under this rule, the foreign policymaker follows an activist policy characterized by Propo-
sition 1, but only when the natural interest is positive.
    The e↵ect of this alternative rule is that the policy interest rate is no longer continuous
in the degree of capital mobility for a given ✏t shock. For < ¯ , the policy rate increases
discretely to the rate implied by Proposition 1. This has the implication that welfare can
be improved by a small decrease in in the region of ¯ . We can establish that using the
same example of Proposition 3, in the following proposition.


Proposition 4 If monetary policy follows rule (40) then there exists a value I , where
¯ < I < H , such that, for 2 ( ¯ , I ), a reduction in to ¯ will increase welfare.

Proof. For a given ✏t shock, rule (40) gives the same welfare as (38) in the region                 2
( ¯ , H ). Thus, for in this region, V1t ( , ✏t , 0)  V2t ( , ✏t , 0). In addition, since V1t and V2t
are continuous in , there must be a I such that V2t ( ¯ , ✏t , 0) = V1t ( I , ✏t , 0), where ¯ < I .
Because the policy rule (40) implies that (39) applies for  ¯ , and because V1t is increasing
in , it follows that there is a region of ( L , ¯ ), where L < ¯ , such that reducing           from
anywhere in the region ( ¯ , I ) to this region will increase welfare.

   Figure 5 illustrates this case. Unlike the optimal policy rule, rule (40) implies that the
policy rate stays zero until falls below ¯ . This means that welfare jumps discretely as
  moves from just above to just below ¯ . As a result, tightening capital controls in this
region may be welfare improving. Note that, even in this case, Proposition 4 cannot be an


                                                      27
unconditional argument for capital controls. Compared to unrestricted financial flows, the
policy given by rule (40) is still inferior. Rather, the case for capital controls is limited to
the argument that, for a given status quo for capital restrictions, if monetary policy is set
sub-optimally, increasing capital controls can be welfare improving.


6        Conclusions
The recent experience of simultaneous liquidity traps in many of the world’s major economies
has raised questions about ways in which monetary policy e↵ectiveness can be restored when
monetary authorities are faced with the problem of the zero lower bound. The zero bound
introduces an extra dimension to the classical policy trilemma in an open economy. This
paper focuses on the transmission of shocks that cause liquidity traps across countries, and
shows that the existence of capital controls can act so as to restore e↵ective monetary policy
independence when external shocks would otherwise push a country into a liquidity trap.
But, despite the e↵ectiveness of capital controls in this regard, in general they are not
desirable from a welfare criterion.
       We have assumed that monetary policy is purely discretionary. The e↵ectiveness of
precommitment in monetary policy at the zero bound has been an active area of debate in
times. Woodford (2012) discusses the e↵ectiveness of ‘forward guidance’ in US monetary
policy. In our model, optimal monetary policy with commitment would have a feature famil-
iar from Eggertsson and Woodford (2003). The worst hit country (in the presence of capital
controls) would promise to maintain a more expansionary monetary policy for a longer time
after the conditions leading to the zero bound in nominal interest rates have elapsed. In this
way, the e↵ects of future monetary commitments on expectations would ameliorate the im-
mediate appreciation of that country’s exchange rate. Nevertheless, because optimal policy
under a quadratic welfare objectives will trade o↵ losses across all times and states of the
world, in general it is not the case that the ability to credibly commit to future monetary
policy will completely remove the impact of contemporaneous shocks.11 As a result, the
qualitative features of the discretionary equilibrium solution would still obtain, even in the
case of monetary policy with credible commitment.
  11
    For instance, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) find that it is never optimal to use forward guidance to
the extent that it eliminates the contemporaneous zero bound constraint.



                                                   28
    Of course, the paper has abstracted away from many other reasons that capital controls
may play a role in policy-making in open economies. In particular, if there are other
distortions in financial markets that lead to excessive borrowing, capital controls may be
welfare enhancing (e.g. Bianchi and Mendoza (2011); Uribe and Schmitt-Grohe (2012)).
Combining these distortions with the additional problem of the zero bound on monetary
policy may be an interesting avenue for future research.
