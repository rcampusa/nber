                                            ABSTRACT

Realizing that their traditional instruments were inadequate for responding to the crisis that began
on 9 August 2007, Federal Reserve officials improvised. Beginning in mid-December 2007, they implemented
a series of changes directed at ensuring that liquidity would be distributed to those institutions that
needed it most. Conceptually, this meant America’s central bankers shifted from focusing solely on
the size of their balance sheet, which they use to keep the overnight interbank lending rate close to
their chosen target, to manipulating the composition of their assets as well. In this paper, I examine
the Federal Reserve’s conventional and unconventional responses to the financial crisis of 2007-2008.

In summer 2007, U.S. and global financial markets found themselves facing a potential financial
crisis, and the U.S. Federal Reserve found itself in a difficult situation. It was becoming clear
that banks and other financial institutions would ultimately lose tens or even hundreds of billions
of dollars from their exposure to subprime mortgage market loans. Bank lending is closely tied
to bank capital or net worth – specifically, bank regulators require that loans not exceed a
certain multiple of capital. Thus, the Federal Reserve faced the danger of a sharp contraction in
credit and bank lending in a way that threatened a deep recession or worse.

When something like this happens, the job of the central bank is to assure that financial
institutions have the necessary funds to conduct their daily business; that they have the
“liquidity” they need to make timely payments and transfers. Modern financial institutions need
to replenish their funding every day. In the United States alone, literally trillions of dollars are
transferred between banks each day to support the $50 trillion credit outstanding in the
economy as a whole. Commercial banks require funds to initiate the mortgages, auto loans,
and credit card debt they then sell into financial markets, while investment banks finance much
of their activity with daily borrowing.

In the early stages of the crisis, the situation often arose in which a well-capitalized bank was
forced to make sudden large loans based on previously committed lines of credit. In this
circumstance, central bank actions can ease liquidity constraints by supplying banks with the
funds they need in the short term. In fall 2007, the Federal Reserve provided short-term funding
liquidity by, in effect, allowing banks to exchange their holdings of Treasury securities for cash.
This policy enabled the banks to meet the credit line commitments they had outstanding.

However, it became clear in October and November 2007 that traditional central bank tools
were of limited use. Realizing these failings, Fed officials created innovative new lending
procedures in the form of the Term Auction Facility and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, as
well as changed their securities lending program creating the Term Securities Lending Facility. I
describe how these new systems work, how each is intended to inject liquidity into the financial
system providing some time for institutions and markets to stabilize.

But before getting into the details, it is important to understand that there is a limit to what these
central bank tools can accomplish. When losses erode bank capital to the point where
regulatory constraints become binding, private lending can only begin to grow again when
capital has been replenished. Return to normalcy requires that banks either raise new equity
from outside investors or receive a transfer from the fiscal authorities. Since the Fed is
fundamentally not in the business of making such transfers, its ability to ease capital constraints
is limited. However, as we will see, some of the less-traditional Fed actions taken during the
crisis had a fiscal flavor to them, and may be interpreted as an indirect attempt to subsidize
banks in need.

The paper begins with a discussion of the traditional tools of monetary policy and how they
work, using the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve as a tool for understanding the conduct of
monetary policy. We then turn to the crisis, including a description of the symptoms and
speculating about the causes, and lay out the policy responses used by the Federal Reserve.
While these policies may have helped in reducing the risk of a short-run financial crisis, Federal
Reserve policies have not been able to keep the problems in the financial system from having
an effect on real economic activity. This outcome is unsurprising. Financial intermediaries did in
fact incur substantial losses, and changes in central bank lending practices will not overturn this
fact.

The Federal Reserve Balance Sheet and Policy Tools

Monetary policymakers affect the quantity of funds available in the financial system by
manipulating the assets and liabilities held by the central bank, which in turn affects the price of
those funds – the interest rate. The Federal Reserve publishes balance sheet information
weekly on its website. Table 1 reports a stripped-down version of the Federal Reserve System’s
balance sheet in early July 2007, prior to the onset of the crisis. To highlight the changes that
occurred, we start with a whirl-wind tour of the liabilities and the assets as they existed before
the crisis began. The discussion then turns to basic principles of managing a balance sheet and
how they are related to tools of monetary policy like open-market operations and changes in
discount rates. In what follows, I will use the unqualified term “bank” to refer to a commercial
bank, rather than to the central bank or to an investment bank.

Liabilities: Currency and Reserves

Starting with the liability side of the balance sheet in Table 1, the amount of currency in
circulation represents roughly $2600 per U.S. resident. Even after accounting for the
underground economy and amounts of currency held by retailers, this total seems extremely
high. But as reported in U.S. Treasury (2006), one-half to two-thirds is held outside the country.

Because currency plays no role in the episode at hand, we move to the entry for commercial
bank reserve balances. Banks hold reserves at the Fed for three interrelated reasons: 1)
they are required to do so; 2) they need them to do business, so that they can meet
customer demands for withdrawals and make payments to other banks; and 3) it is prudent
to do so because reserves act as the bank’s emergency fund ready in case disaster strikes.

In July 2007, Table 1 shows that the level of reserve balances was $16.8 billion. This total is
relatively small – approximately one-tenth the level held by European banks in the national
central banks of the Eurosystem. U.S. banks keep reserve balances as low as possible
because they traditionally receive no interest on such reserves, while European banks are paid
something close to the overnight interbank lending rate.1

Two additional liabilities appear on the balance sheet in Table 1. The first concerns deposit
accounts that belong either to the U.S. Treasury or to foreign governments and central banks,
and the Federal Reserve offers this service. Finally, the very modest category of “other
liabilities” includes deposit balances of international organization like the International Monetary
Fund and the United Nations, as well as those of federal government agencies such as Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac.

Assets: Securities Holdings, Loans, and Foreign Exchange Reserves

Moving to the asset side of the balance sheet, the Fed holds securities both outright and as part
of repurchase agreements, or “repos” for short. Securities that the Fed owns directly are
composed entirely of U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. Before the financial crisis began,
these outright securities holdings comprised about 90 percent of the Fed’s assets.

In July 2007, repos accounted for $28 billion, or just 3 percent, of total Fed assets. However,
repurchase agreements are extremely important, because they are the method the Fed uses to
adjust the level of reserves in the banking system from day to day. For example, when you read
that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Open Market Desk put $38 billion into the banking
system on August 10, 2007, it was done with repurchase agreements.

A dictionary-style description of a repurchase agreement goes something like this: It is a short-
term collateralized loan in which a security is exchanged for cash, with the agreement that the
parties will reverse the transaction on a specific future date at an agreed upon price, as soon as
the next day. In more intuitive terms, perhaps the easiest way to think about a repo is as an
overnight mortgage (because a mortgage, like a repo, is fully collateralized). In the same way
that you pledge your house to the bank in exchange for a loan, a financial institution pledges a
bond to the Federal Reserve in exchange for funds—and also promises to reverse the
transaction and provide cash for the bond in the near future.

The Fed carries out these transactions through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Open
Market Desk. The Desk engages in repurchase agreements every morning (usually at 8:30am
or 9:40am). The quantities normally range from $2 billion to $20 billion dollars. The Desk sends
out a message to 19 “primary dealers,” most of whom are investment banks, stating the term of
the repo and the type of collateral that it will accept. The primary dealers, who are the only
parties qualified to participate in these daily operations, send their offers – quantities, prices,
and collateral – and then the New York Fed decides how much to accept. (For a current list of
the primary dealers see www.ny.frb.org/markets/pridealers_current.html). Three types of
collateral are allowed under law: U.S. Treasury Securities, U.S. agency securities (issued by
entities like Fannie Mae and the Small Business Administration), and AAA-rated and insured
mortgage-backed securities. The total quantity of securities offered (at all interest rates)
averages roughly five times what is accepted for Treasury securities, ten times for agency

  On October 13, 2006, the U.S. Congress passed the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 (Public Law
109-351) authorizing the Federal Reserve to pay interest on reserves beginning on October 1, 2011. The Federal
Reserve Board has not yet announced whether it will do so, but there is a strong suspicion it will.

securities, and 15 times for mortgage-backed securities. While most offers are overnight, it is
standard to engage in repos with maturities as long as 14 days.

By conducting repos on a daily basis the Fed accomplishes two things. First, it keeps a fraction
of its assets very short term, ensuring flexibility to expand and contract the quantity quickly. This
allows policymakers to add or drain reserves from the system immediately if the need arises.
Second, by operating every day the Fed is in contact with market participants on a regular
basis.. If short-term funding markets start to experience strains, the Fed will find out
immediately through the offers it receives from primary dealers in its daily operations.

Loans are the next entry on the asset side of the balance sheet. Historically, banks have been
extremely reluctant to borrow from the central bank. Prior to the start of the crisis, borrowings
averaged less than $200 million per day. Even for the first seven months of the crisis, from
August 2007 through mid-March 2008, the quantity of discount borrowing averaged just over $1
billion.

The stigma attached to borrowing from the Fed probably arises from several sources. Prior to
2003, banks could be admonished by the Fed for overuse of discount window borrowing, which
created a distinct disincentive. Over the years, the Fed has tried to emphasize that borrowing
from the central bank should be a normal part of business. Even so, banks continue to fear that
if they borrow from the central bank, other banks and financial institutions will draw negative
conclusions about their financial strength.. Artuç and Demirlap (2007) provide a useful overview
of the modest literature on discount window borrowing.

Continuing on the asset side, foreign exchange reserves are the next entry. As of June 30,
2007, the Fed held $13.1 billion in Euro-denominated assets and $7.7 billion in Japanese yen in
a combination of marketable securities and deposit accounts at foreign institutions. The Federal
Reserve holds half of the foreign exchange reserves of the United States, with the other half on
the balance sheet of the U.S. Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund. In the rare event of an
intervention in the foreign exchange market, the quantity is evenly split between the two.

The next entry is gold. This item represents the Treasury’s gold stock held in Fort Knox, which
carried on the books at a fixed value of $42.22 per troy ounce. Finally, the sizeable “other
assets” category includes a variety of items: the land, physical premises and operating
equipment of the Federal Reserve banks; special drawing rights certificates issued by the
International Monetary Fund; coins issued by the U.S. Treasury; accrued interest on U.S.
Treasury securities held outright; as well items in process of collection associated with the Fed’s
check clearing business.

Two General Principles of Balance Sheet Management

Two general principles are associated with the management of a central bank’s balance sheet.
First, policymakers control its size. If the Federal Reserve wishes, it can create liabilities to
purchase additional assets. Open market operations work in this way: To purchase a security,
the Fed creates a reserve liability, crediting the deposit account of a commercial bank. The
central bank can expand its liabilities without limit—although an expansion of liabilities will
reduce the price of those liabilities, which is the interest rate. In other words, a change in the
quantity of liabilities and assets can affect the level of the risk-free interest rate by altering the
quantity of reserves supplied to the banking system.

Second, the central bank controls the composition of the assets on its balance sheet. Given the
overall quantity of assets it wishes to hold, the Federal Reserve can decide whether it wants to
hold Treasury securities, foreign exchange reserves, or other assets. Changes in the
composition of central bank assets will not affect the risk-free interest rate, but it has the
potential to influence relative prices – one currency relative to another or one bond relative to
another – by changing the relative supply or desirability of holding one specific asset over
another. Within certain legal limits, the Fed can adjust the composition of its assets along
various dimensions like the maturity structure of its portfolio and the exact bonds that it owns.
Sterilized foreign exchange intervention, where a central bank sells a bond denominated in one
currency and uses the proceeds to buy a bond denominated in another currency, is a classic
example of a decision related to the composition, but not the quantity, of the assets that the
central bank holds.


Open Market Operations and Discount Rates

A textbook treatment of monetary policy focuses on three traditional tools, each of which is
based directly on actions related to the central bank’s balance sheet: open market operations,
balance sheet size and the federal funds interest rate target; lending to commercial banks, the
fraction of assets held as loans and the discount rate; and the level of commercial bank
reserves, the composition of liabilities and the reserve requirement. As Cecchetti (2008, p. 420)
describes, changes in reserve requirements are not a tool used by the Federal Reserve in the
twenty-first century, so we focus here on the other two tools. The descriptions that follow
describe as the state of the world before the financial crisis of 2007-2008.

In the case of open market operations, the Federal Reserve’s policymaking body, the Federal
Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets a target for the federal funds rate – the price of borrowing
reserves overnight. Then, through its daily adjustment in the combined securities holdings and
repurchase agreements on its balance sheet, the Open Market Desk, as the monopoly supplier
of bank reserves, works to keep the federal funds rate near its desired target.

Commercial banks can borrow from the Fed at what is technically called the “primary lending
rate” and is more commonly known as the “discount rate.” Each of the 12 Federal Reserve
banks has a standing offer to lend to the banks in their district that they deem to be sound (as
measured by supervisory ratings). Before 2003, the primary lending rate was set below the
target federal funds rate. From January 2003 up to the crisis in 2007, the primary lending rate
was one percentage point, or 100 basis points, above the target federal funds rate. As long as a
bank is financially sound and willing to pay the penalty interest rate, it can receive a loan. A
borrowing bank can re-lend the borrowed funds to another bank, if it wishes to do so.

Lending through the “discount window” is designed both to provide funds at the end of the day,
allowing banks to meet their payment obligations without overdrawing their reserve account,
and also to enable institutions to borrow against collateral that the market will not otherwise
finance. The second of these purposes is associated with the classic lender of last resort
function.

Discount borrowing is collateralized, which means that the borrowing bank must have assets of
sufficient value that in the event of default, the Federal Reserve will not suffer a loss. The
Federal Reserve will accept virtually anything as collateral. In one case in 1985, the Fed lent the
Bank of New York $23 billion and took the entire bank – buildings, furniture and all – as


                                             5
Cecchetti                           Crisis and Response                           June 2008


collateral (Cecchetti, 2008, p. 336). For details on the pledging and valuation of collateral, see
www.frbdiscountwindow.org/index.cfm.

Since both open market operations and discount lending involve changes in the Fed’s balance
sheet that result in expansion or contraction of commercial bank reserves, they are often
presented as different tools with identical effects. But there are two important practical
differences between them. First, any bank can borrow, while only 19 primary dealers can
participate in open market operations. Second, the Federal Reserve allows a discount loan to
be collateralized by a very broad range of assets, while only a narrow set of very high quality
securities qualify for repurchase in regular open market operations.


The Crisis Hits

A complete chronology of the recent financial crisis might start in February 2007, when several
large subprime mortgage lenders started to report losses. It might then describe of how spreads
between risky and risk-free bonds – “credit spreads” – began widening in July 2007. But the
definitive trigger came on August 9, 2007, when the large French bank BNP Paribas temporarily
halted redemptions from three of its funds because it could not reliably value the assets backed
by U.S. subprime mortgage debt held in those funds. When one major institution took such a
step, financial firms world-wide were encouraged to question the value of a variety of collateral
they had been accepting in their lending operations – and to worry about their own finances.
The result was a sudden hoarding of cash and cessation of inter-bank lending, which in turn led
to severe liquidity constraints on many financial institutions.

The contraction in the supply of short-term funds caused overnight interest rates in Europe to
shoot up, and the European Central Bank responded the same day with the largest short-term
liquidity injection in its nine-year history– €94.8 billion ($130 billion at the time) worth of
overnight repos. The following day, as these overnight repurchase agreements expired, the
operation to renew them was two-thirds the size – a still very large €61.1 billion. Meanwhile, the
Open Market Trading Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York used one-day repurchase
agreements to inject $24 billion in reserves into the U.S. banking system on Thursday; and
when those expired on Friday, the Desk upped the amount to $38 billion for the weekend.

Symptoms of the turmoil in financial markets that began in August 2007 are evident in a variety
of places. One place to look is the interbank lending market. U.S. commercial bank borrowing
exceeds $2 trillion. To remain flexible in adjusting the size and composition of assets they hold,
banks tend to keep most of this short term. As a result, if banks suddenly become unwilling to
lend, problems arise.

Distress in this market is evident from the behavior of the London Inter-Bank Borrow Rate.
LIBOR is the benchmark rate on interbank lending set by a group of 16 large banks each
morning. It is a key interest rate used to price various consumer and business loans, including
various kinds of mortgages.

LIBOR can be compared to the federal funds market because both involve uncollateralized
loans. Figure 1 plots the difference between the three-month fixed-rate LIBOR and the expected
interest rate that would accrue from repeatedly rolling over a loan at the overnight federal funds
rate for three months (known as an Overnight Indexed Swap or “OIS”). The divergence between
these two rates is typically less than 10 basis points. This small gap arises from an arbitrage
that allows a bank to borrow at LIBOR, lend for three months, and hedge the risk that the

overnight rate will move in the federal funds futures market, leaving only a small residual level of
credit and liquidity risk that accounts for the usually small spread,. But on August 9, 2007, the
difference between these two interest rates jumped to 40 basis points. The “LIBOR spread”
then fluctuated between 25 and 106 basis points through fall 2007.2

Source: LIBOR data are from the British Bankers’ Association www.bba.org. The expected federal funds
rate data are from Exhibit 2.10 of Greenlaw, Hatzius, Kashyap and Shin (2008). Note that because the
LIBOR rate is determined at 11am UK time, which is 5am Eastern US time, I plot the expected federal
funds rate on date t minus LIBOR at t-1. This avoids spurious spikes that would occur on dates with the
FOMC made unexpected, inter-meeting, changes in the target federal funds rate.

A second symptom of the financial crisis comes from looking at the average difference between
U.S. government agency securities – those issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the like –
and U.S. Treasury securities of equivalent maturity plotted in Figure 2. Normally the securities
from government agencies are viewed as only very slightly more risky and less liquid than
Treasury issues themselves. But again, starting in August 2007, the gap doubled from its
typical range of 15 to 25 basis points to more than 40 basis points. As the crisis intensified
through the fall and winter, the so-called “agency spread” exploded to more than 90 basis points

 This arbitrage is imperfect for an important reason that could explain at least a part of the increased spread. The
problem is that the federal funds futures market allows a potential lender to hedge movements in what is known as
the “effective” federal funds rate – that is, the quantity-weighted average of transactions in the overnight interbank
lending market during the day. A bank cannot, however, guarantee that it will be able to borrow at the effective rate.
Importantly, since August 9, 2007 the intra-day volatility of the federal funds rate has risen by a factor of four – from 5
to 20 basis points. As a result, the risk of financing a three-month loan by borrowing overnight for three months rose
substantially, suggesting that this “term spread” would rise as well.

institutions shunned everything but U.S. Treasury securities themselves.

In both of these examples – the LIBOR spread and the U.S. government agency spread – the
market threatened to become almost functionally illiquid. The banks that participate in what is
called “fixing” the LIBOR rate have no obligation to borrow or lend at those rates. No data exists
on the quantity of interbank lending, but anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that few loans
were actually occurring at these rates. Similarly, the market for securities of U.S. government
agencies threatened to become illiquid.

In one market, the market for commercial paper, data on both prices and quantities are
available. Figure 3 plots the behavior of 30-day commercial paper interest rates and quantities
outstanding beginning in June 2007. Panel A compares the evolution of the rate on high-grade,
AA-rated, nonfinancial commercial paper, issued by large corporations like General Electric and
Coca Cola, with asset-backed commercial paper (often abbreviated as “ABCP”). Asset-backed
commercial paper is issued by firms that hold things like the securities backed by mortgage
pools as assets—and thus can be viewed as a proxy for losses occurring in real estate markets.
By June and July 2007, asset-backed commercial paper was commanding a premium of 5 basis
points. In mid-August 2007, the premium on asset-backed commercial paper had risen to 86
basis points, and in early December 2007 it peaked at more than 100 basis points.

In terms of quantities, the amount of commercial paper grew at a nearly 10 percent average
annual rate from 2002 to 2007, reaching $2.2 trillion at the start of the crisis. Asset-backed
commercial paper accounted for more than half of this total in August 2007, peaking at nearly
$1.2 trillion. On any given day, more than two-thirds of all outstanding commercial paper has a
maturity of five business days or less. Starting in mid-August, borrowers had trouble rolling over
maturing issues. The quantity of commercial paper outstanding dropped precipitously, falling by
nearly $300 billion in the first two months of the crisis and a total of $400 billion by the end of
2007. Panel B of Figure 3 shows that the decline is entirely accounted for by the fall in asset-
backed commercial paper outstanding. To guard against short-term illiquidity of specific
institutions, issuers of commercial paper typically have backup lines of credit with banks
available to them. During the last five months of 2007, total commercial bank credit extended
rose by $575 billion (according to the Federal Reserve Board’s H8 statistical release, page 2,
line 5), more than offsetting the fall in commercial paper, as issuers called upon these bank
credit lines.

Finally, the market for repurchase agreements also exhibited symptoms of the financial crisis.
Large financial institutions that hold various types of assets use repos to finance their short-term
liquidity needs – and those needs have grown astronomically. For the 19 investment banks that
serve as primary dealers, repos outstanding rose by a factor of four over the last decade,
reaching $4 trillion at the dawn of the crisis in August of 2007. As the crisis moved into early
2008, this repo market began experiencing severe disruptions. The overnight rate on Treasury
securities plotted in Figure 4 illustrates the change. This interest rate is what a borrower has to
pay for an overnight loan collateralized by a U.S. Treasury security. Because a repo is
collateralized and a federal funds loan is not, the repo rate is normally between 5 and 10 basis
points below the federal funds interest rate. But at the end of February 2008, with the federal

Cecchetti                           Crisis and Response                            June 2008


funds rate target at 3 percent, the Treasury repo rate fell to 1.95 percent – a difference of 105
basis points. On March 19, 2008, investors and financial institutions became so desperate to get
their hands on U.S. Treasury securities that they were willing to hold them with virtually no
compensation at all, and the repo rate fell to 0.20 percent.

These pieces of evidence suggest a chronology: Starting in early August 2007 fear led to
hoarding of cash and a broad increase in risk premia. Matters then seemed to improve from late
September until the end of November, when it became clear that financial institutions were
experiencing large losses. A compilation of these losses from news reports in late 2007
suggested that commercial and investment bank losses in the subprime mortgage market had
surpassed a combined total of $150 billion, while estimates several months later exceeded $400
billion (Greenlaw et al., 2008). Risk spreads widened again in December 2007, and continued to
deteriorate with investors and institutions continued flight to safe securities into the winter of
2008.

Why did the interbank lending market dry up? There are two possible explanations for the
unwillingness to lend. One is that lenders perceived a substantial increase in credit risk – that is,
an increased risk that more borrowers will default. The alternative is that banks that normally
would have been willing to lend faced a combination of uncertainties and constraints related to
the size of their own balance sheets. This concern could have arisen from fears about both
involuntary lending that banks might be forced to make because of prior commitments on credit
lines, and fears of the declines in the value of assets that the banks were holding.

It is difficult to gauge the relative importance of these explanations. However, evidence in both
McAndrews, Sarkar and Wang (2008) and Bank of England (2008) suggest that through the end
of 2007 funding problems associated with concerns over bank capital were the dominant
concern, but that starting in early 2008 concerns over borrower creditworthiness were the cause
of the continued high risk premia.

Consistent with this conclusion is that through fall 2007, banks increased credit extensions
dramatically – from August 8 to December 26, 2007, bank credit rose $544 billion, or more than
6 percent. After that time, bank credit outstanding increased only $60 billion over the first eight
weeks of 2008. Although we only have anecdotal evidence to back this up, it is plausible that
the burst of lending in the fall of 2007 was associated with lines of credit that banks had
extended as insurance to the entities that had been issuing asset-backed commercial paper, but
who were not able to issue such paper because of a lack of buyers after August 9.

Added to the pattern of bank lending is the fact that by mid-2007, severe difficulties were arising
in valuing a broad array of complex securities. Subprime mortgages had been combined into
broader securities and then carved up into complex financial products. Investors had relied on
the ratings agencies such as Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s to certify that parts of resulting
asset pools had lower or higher risks. However, starting in fall 2007, rating agencies steadily
downgraded their views on the credit quality of these instruments. For example, on January 30,
2008, Standard and Poor’s issued a single report in which it downgraded over 8,000 securities
backed by assets of various kinds (at
www2.standardandpoors.com/spf/pdf/media/subprime_action_rmbs_cdo.pdf). This pattern of
uncertain and diminishing values is characteristic of a financial crisis, and it has important
consequences. Bankers that do not know the value of their own balance sheets are also unsure
of their lending capacity. In addition, increased volatility in markets drove up conventional
measures of risk, forcing banks to reduce move toward less risky assets and to contract the
overall size of their balance sheets.

Cecchetti                            Crisis and Response                           June 2008



As the financial crisis progressed into winter and spring 2008, previous lending commitments
must have eventually exhausted their limited lifetimes, hence the drop in bank credit growth. In
addition, problems with asset valuations must have been to some extent resolved—or at least
coming into clearer focus. Thus, at some point, the overriding consideration in the refusal of
banks to lend to one another must have become the concern over credit risk—that is, the risk
that borrowers would fail to repay.


Federal Reserve Interventions

Under the Federal Reserve Act (section 2A, at www.federalreserve.gov/GeneralInfo/fract/), “The
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee
shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the
economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of
maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” What tools did
Federal Reserve policymakers have to “maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit
aggregates” starting in fall 2007? Is there anything that the Fed can do to bring the LIBOR
spread down, or to help provide banks with term financing? Can officials prevent liquidity
constraints from causing asset sales that further depress prices and cause the crisis to broaden
and deepen?

Table 2 divides the policy actions taken by the Fed between August 9, 2007, and May 2, 2008,
into two groups: those that fit the conventional textbook definitions of aggressive monetary
policy and those that do not. The first group, listed in the top panel of the table, is comprised of
the seven cuts in the target federal funds rate totaling 3¼ percentage points. Each of these
comes with a cut in the primary (discount) lending rate.

It would seem that the standard monetary tools – the cut in the cost of discount borrowing and
the increase in the term of the loans announced on August 17, 2007, followed by cuts in the
federal funds rate target starting in mid-September 2007 – should have addressed the problem.
After all, offering discount loans of up to 30 days at an interest rate only 50 basis points above
the federal funds target should have given banks access to the liquidity they needed to carry on
their day-to-day operations. Lowering the federal funds rate should help banks profit from their
“maturity transformation” business of issuing short-term liabilities and making longer term loans.

While these steps may have aided banks a bit, there was no return to normalcy. Moreover, the
problems of risk and credit shortage – as illustrated by the rising spread between U.S. agency
and Treasury securities in Figure 2 – worsened through the late fall 2007 and early winter 2008.
Thus, Fed officials began a series of less conventional actions that are not in the current
textbook descriptions of monetary policy (although they will presumably be in future textbooks!).
These actions include reducing the premium on primary (discount) lending from 100 to 50 and
then to 25 basis points above the federal funds rate target, as well as an increase in the term of
the lending from overnight to 30 and then 90 days; the creation and then enlargement of the
Term Auction Facility (TAF); the extension of $24 billion in credit to the European Central Bank
and the Swiss National Bank, eventually raised to $62 billion; the change in the preexisting
securities lending program to initiate the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF); extension of
credit to primary dealers through the newly created Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF); and
the authorization of lending to support the JP Morgan Chase purchase of Bear Stearns. To
appreciate how each of these policies works, we need to link each one to the Fed’s balance
sheet and toolbox discussed earlier.

Term Auction Facility

By late 2007, it was clear that the changes in the discount lending policy put in place in mid-
August were not working. Banks continued to be unwilling to borrow from the Fed. As a result,
problems in the interbank funding market continued. Figure 1 showed that the through fall

2007, the spread between three-month LIBOR and the three-month expected federal funds rate
continued to rise.

As Federal Reserve officials searched for alternative mechanisms to inject funds into the
banking system, they found themselves reconsidering some procedures first discussed in 2001.
During 1999 and 2000, the annual federal budget was operating in surplus, reducing the
quantity of Treasury securities outstanding. Long-term forecasts at the time suggested that the
level of government debt might decline in a way that there would be an insufficient supply of
federal government securities to supply the assets of the Federal Reserve. Federal Reserve
System staff undertook a study of possible alternative operating procedures. One of the
suggestions was to supply reserves through an auction mechanism the (Federal Reserve
System Study Group on Alternative Instruments for System Operations, 2002, Chapter 3). In
December, this procedure was implemented in the form of the Term Auction Facility.

The idea behind the Term Auction Facility was to remove the stigma associated with discount
borrowing, and in that way to get reserves to banks that needed them. As the name suggests,
the TAF auctions funds for a certain term. Through it, the Fed started lending reserves in
substantial quantities for relatively long periods – initially $20 or $30 billion, then $50 billion, and
then $75 billion per auction for terms of 28 or 35 days. Importantly, as the Fed increased
lending, it reduced its outright securities holdings in equal measure, leaving the total size of the
Fed balance sheet unaffected.

Here is how the Term Auction Facility works: Any of the more than 7,000-plus commercial
banks in the country can bid in the auction, stating what interest rate it will pay for what quantity
of funds. The minimum bid rate is determined by the expected federal funds rate in the market
over the term of the auction. An individual bank’s bid cannot exceed 50 percent of the value of
the collateral that it has available for discount window borrowing. A bank receiving funds cannot
prepay, so if the loan turns out to be expensive because interest rates fall during the term of the
loan, the borrower is stuck with it (for a description, see
www.newyorkfed.org/markets/Understanding_Fed_Lending.html).

The procedures of the Term Auction Facility – including the choice of a uniform- or single-price
auction, the restriction that no bidder can be allocated more than 10 percent of the total being
auctioned and the fact that settlement occurs two days after the date of the auction – helps to
ensure anonymity for the banks and that the bidders will not be branded as being in desperate
need of immediate funds (Armantier, Kreiger and McAndrews, 2008). As a result, banks have
been willing to bid in the auction in a way that they have refused to use the more traditional
“discount window” or primary credit facility.

Starting in December 2007, the auctions were held twice a month, with total reserves supplied
rising to $150 billion by the beginning of May 2008. Between 52 and 93 banks participated in
the first dozen auctions and the total quantity bid was just less than twice the total quantity of
funds offered. With only a few exceptions, the interest rate paid was near or below the expected
primary lending rate.3

  The Federal Reserve’s weekly balance reports Term Auction Facility lending separately by Federal Reserve District.
Roughly two-thirds of the loans are going to banks in the New York district, the location of most U.S. subsidiaries of
foreign banks. This outcome is at least consistent with the possibility that the Term Auction Facility loans are going
primarily to European banks. See the line labeled “Term Auction Credit” in Table 3 of the H.4.1 weekly release.

There is some evidence that the Term Auction Facility helped at first to reduce the spread
shown in Figure 1. The Term Auction Facility started its auctions in mid-December. Figure 1
shows that the difference between the three-month LIBOR and the three-month Treasury bill
rate declines sharply from early December 2007 until mid-February 2008.

It may seem surprising that the Term Auction Facility would succeed, because all the auctions
do is change the composition of the Fed’s assets leaving the quantity unaffected. Specifically,
the Term Auction Facility involves a shift from securities held either outright or in repurchase
agreements, to loans. Such a shift carries no implication at all for the federal funds rate target
rate. A widespread belief, built on past experiences, has been that changes in the composition
of the Fed’s assets have little or no real effect.4 For example, during the early 1960s, the Fed
attempted to reduce the gap between short-term and long-term interest rates (that is, flatten the
yield curve) by selling short-term Treasury bills and buying long-term Treasury bonds in what
came to be called “Operation Twist.” As Volcker (2002) discusses, this seemed to have little or
no effect. Sterilized foreign exchange intervention, whereby the central bank sells securities
denominated in one currency and buys securities in another – something the United States has
not done since September 22, 2000 – is another example of a policy where there is a broad
consensus that such portfolio shifts in and of themselves have little or no effect.

But during fall 2007, central banks became aware of something on which they had not
previously focused. While well-established mechanisms existed for injecting reserves into a
country’s financial system, officials had no way to guarantee that the reserves will reach the
banks that need them. In the United States, standard open market operations can put reserves
into the hands of 19 primary dealers—but this does not mean that the funds will then be
distributed across the banking system. The problem turns out to be particularly acute when the
banks that are short dollar reserves are not American banks. This insight provide the rationale
for the foreign exchange swaps in which the Fed supplied the European Central Bank and
Swiss National Bank with dollars, which those two central banks went on to auction to their
banks. Thus, perhaps the Term Auction Facility operated to reduce the difficulties of specific
institutions that were having particularly acute problems.

But the Term Auction Facility does more than merely distribute funding to the banks that need it.
The rules of the Term Auction Facility allow banks to pledge collateral that might otherwise have
little market value. Under the rules of the auctions, TAF loans must be over-collateralized by at
least a factor of two, but in reality the Fed is taking collateral at a price that is almost surely
above its actual market price (Tett, 2008). The result is two-fold. First, liquidity reaches places
where it wasn’t going on its own, which helps to address potential liquidity constraints on
individual institutions; and second, banks gain the time they need to value the assets they have.
This action has a fiscal policy flavor, as it has the potential to provide a capital subsidy to
borrowing banks.

Recalling that the officials implemented the Term Auction Facility in the hopes of reducing the
gap the gap between the three-month LIBOR and the three-month expected federal funds, we
can see from Figure 1 that it had a limited impact. After the spread fell from over 100 basis
points in early December 2007 to less than 30 basis points in late January 2008, stress
increased again in February 2008. By March 2008, this spread once again exceeded 70 basis

4
 For a more skeptical view, Taylor and Williams (2008) do argue that the Term Auction Facility has been ineffective
as they find no impact on the LIBOR – expected federal funds rate spread on the day of banks bid. By contrast,
McAndrews, Sarkar and Wang (2008) suggest that there was an impact, but it was on the day of the auction
announcement.

points. The Federal Reserve then increased the size of the Term Auction Fund, but as of spring
2009, this particular spread remained elevated.

Term Securities Lending Facility

In winter 2008, a simmering problem hit the financial system with full force: U.S. Treasury
securities of all varieties became extremely scarce. The primary symptom of this is the dramatic
decline in the interest rate on repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities
plotted in Figure 4. As noted earlier, in mid-March 2008 this rate fell to 0.20 percentage points.
Investors were willing to hold U.S. Treasury securities with virtually no compensation.

In response to this extreme flight to quality, the Federal Reserve showed its capacity for
innovation yet again by creating the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF). For several
decades, going back at least to the 1970s, the Fed has lent Treasury securities to primary
dealers on an overnight basis. This lending seeks to reduce the number of failed securities
transactions. Treasury dealers routinely sell and promise to deliver securities that they do not
own, counting on their ability to procure the right Treasury bill, note or bond in time to complete
the transaction. Sometimes they miscalculate. However, when a primary dealer is unable to
obtain the specific issue it has promised to deliver, that dealer can go to the Fed in the early
afternoon and borrow what it needs. There is a small fee, and the borrower is expected to
return the security the next day. Since the Fed holds some of nearly every Treasury issue, it can
lend whatever is needed, thereby ensuring that markets function smoothly. In February 2008,
for example, the Federal Reserve held 210 of the 238 distinct Treasury issues outstanding
(exact Fed holdings are available at www.ny.frb.org/markets/soma/sysopen_accholdings.html).

The Term Securities Lending Facility takes this existing lending program and transforms it in
three ways. First, while the traditional program lends overnight, the new one provides securities
for 28 days. Second, the Term Securities Lending Facility dramatically broadens the collateral
accepted. Until March 2008, lending meant swapping one Treasury security for another. By
contrast, the Term Securities Lending Facility explicitly allows dealers to obtain Treasury
securities in exchange for “AAA/Aaa-rated private-label residential [mortgage-backed securities]
not on review for downgrade” (as announced at
www.ny.frb.org/newsevents/news/markets/2008/rp080311.html).5 Finally, the Fed announced
its willingness to loan up to $200 billion through the Term Securities Lending Facility.

Operationally, the Term Securities Lending Facility is an auction where primary dealers bid for
Treasury securities. Potential borrowers of the securities bid the fee (the interest rate) they are
willing to pay, with a minimum that depends on the collateral acceptable in the auction. In the
first auction on March 27, 2008, the Federal Reserve offered $75 billion face value of securities,
received $86.1 billion in bids and the winning bid was 33 basis points. Thus, for 33 basis points
a dealer could exchange a residential mortgage-backed security that might be selling at
discount implying a risk premium of up to several hundred basis points for a Treasury security.
The majority of the succeeding weekly auctions have been undersubscribed, with the amount
offered exceeding the total quantity for which primary dealers are bidding. Fed officials view this
as a sign of success, because it signals that there is no longer a desperate demand for
Treasury securities.

  Broadening the allowable collateral beyond that accepted in standard open market operation required that the
Federal Reserve Board invoke Section 13 (3) of the Federal Reserve Act cited in the discussion of Bear Stearns
below.

Like the Term Auction Facility, the securities lending program is changes the composition of the
Fed’s asset holdings without affecting their size. While this goal is not explicit, the Fed is
essentially selling Treasury holdings and buying residential mortgage-backed securities. Like
other changes in asset composition, this one is directed at reducing the relative price of various
securities. The Term Auction Facility was aimed at the gap between term and overnight
interbank lending rates; the Term Securities Lending Facility is directed toward the premium
paid to hold U.S. Treasury securities relative to mortgage-backed securities. Fleming, Hrung,
Keane, and McAndrews (2008) estimate, and Figure 3 confirms, that the Term Securities
Lending Facility was extremely effective in raising Treasury repo rate back to levels close to the
federal funds rate immediately upon implementation.

Bear Stearns

On March 13, 2008, it became apparent that the investment bank Bear Stearns was on the
verge of shutting down. A letter one week later from Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman Christopher Cox (2008) to Dr. Nout Wellink, Chairman of the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision, reports that Bear Stearns’s “liquidity pool” – assets such as Treasury
securities that can be quickly converted to cash – had dropped from $18 billion to $2 billion from
Monday to Thursday. The firm was unable to obtain short-term loans to continue conducting
business. As Cox’s letter emphasizes, in mid-May the firm continued to remain solvent. Public
disclosures in “10-Q filings” confirm this: Two weeks earlier, at end of February 2008, Bear
Stearns had roughly $12 billion in capital to support just under $400 billion in assets.

The sudden bankruptcy of Bear Stearns would almost surely have been catastrophic. Again,
public documents tell us that on February 29, 2008, the firm had $14.2 trillion of notional value
in derivative contracts – futures, options and swaps – outstanding with thousands of
counterparties. Clearly, the firm was a part of a complex interconnected network of financial
arrangements. If Bear Stearns had failed, it would then need to sell its assets into a market that
lacked the liquidity to handle it, so prices for those securities could collapse in a way that would
affect the entire financial system.

Since Bear Stearns was not a commercial bank, it had no way to use its collateral to obtain
liquidity from the Federal Reserve. While Fed officials did not care about Bear Stearns itself,
their concern for system-wide financial stability led them to invoke Article 13(3) of the Federal
Reserve Act, which gives the Board of Governors the power to authorize Federal Reserve
banks to make loans to any individual, partnership, or corporation provided that the borrower is
unable to obtain credit from a banking institution.

On March 14, 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York made a loan directly to Bear
Stearns. Data released on March 20, 2008, combined with press reports that the loan was
repaid on March 17, imply that Bear borrowed approximately $12.9 billion.

By any measure, this action was extraordinary. Not since the 1930s had the Fed actually made
a loan based on Article 13 (3). Then, over the next weekend, central bank officials brokered a
deal in which JP Morgan Chase purchased Bear Stearns for a total of approximately $3 billion.
Included in the deal is a loan from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

The Fed’s participation in the deal is described in congressional testimony by Federal Reserve
Bank of New York President Timothy Geithner (2008, Annex III). The basics are as follows: The
Federal Reserve Bank of New York made a $29 billion 10-year loan at the primary lending
(discount) rate to a newly formed limited liability company created to hold $30 billion worth of

                                             17
Cecchetti                           Crisis and Response                            June 2008


mortgage-backed securities previously owned by Bear Stearns. JP Morgan Chase put in $1
billion and assumed the first loss. Unlike standard discount lending, where the Fed has recourse
to go after the entire borrowing bank if the pledged collateral is insufficient to cover the loan,
here there is no recourse. This means that if the value of the assets placed in this new
company turn out to be less than $29 billion, the Federal Reserve would suffer a loss.

But the credit risk associated with this extraordinary loan clearly belongs to the U.S. Treasury.
A March 17, 2008, letter from Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulsen to Geithner reads, in
part, “that if any loss arises out of the special facility… the loss will be treated by the FRBNY as
an expense that may reduce the net earnings transferred by the FRBNY to the Treasury general
fund.” The standard practice is that Federal Reserve System revenue – including interest on its
securities portfolio, net of operating expense – is turned over to the U.S. Treasury. Thus, any
losses arising from the credit facility created to support the J.P. Morgan Chase purchase of Bear
Stearns will reduce that amount.

The subsidy implicit in the loan to Bear Stearns is clearly a fiscal, not a monetary operation. The
Federal Reserve is effectively acting as the fiscal agent for the Treasury.. As an aside, note that
actions in which the fiscal authority dictates how the central bank holds its assets can run the
risk of compromising central bank independence if they become a regular occurrence.

There has been substantial criticism of the Bear Stearns action. Reinhart (2008) calls it a
“bailout” and believes that it has dealt a fatal blow to the Fed’s ability to act as an honest broker
in encouraging private sector solutions to problems posed by failing institutions, as it did in 1998
when confronting the failure of Long Term Capital Management (Lowenstein,2001). At first
glance, this accusation of a bailout may seem peculiar, because Bear Stearns’s shareholders
and employees took huge losses, and the price paid by JP Morgan may well be below Bear
Stearns’s net worth. Nevertheless, there is a good argument that the holders of Bear Stearns’s
bonds and other liabilities were in fact bailed out. A disorderly collapse of the firm could very
well have left this group repaid with even less. As a result, lenders may now feel safe in making
loans to other investment banks, encouraging the borrowers to take more risk than they should.

As for the Fed’s ability to marshal the private sector into cooperating when circumstances
demand, we will have to wait and see. What we can say is that the decision to extend the Fed’s
lending facility to investment banks is likely to lead to increased regulation and supervision of
entities in this business.

Primary Dealer Credit Facility

The evening of March 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve used its Article 13(3) powers for a second
time in three days to create the Primary Dealer Credit Facility. The 19 primary dealers
authorized to participate in daily open market operations and the Treasury auctions are not
banks. They are investment banks and brokers. None of them have access to either traditional
discount loans or the Term Auction Fund. Starting in mid-March they could borrow from the
Federal Reserve.

Like discount loans made to commercial banks, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility allows
borrowers to pledge a relatively broad set of collateral including “investment-grade corporate
securities, municipal securities, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities for
which a price is available” (see www.ny.frb.org/newsevents/news/markets/2008/rp080316.html).

The Primary Dealer Credit Facility was immediately popular. For the first three weeks of its
existence, borrowing averaged over $30 billion per day, before gradually declining to around
$10 billion by the end of May 2008.

Lending directly to primary dealers serves two objectives: First, it ensures short-term funding for
investment banks. The experience with Bear Stearns, which sustained a sudden loss of short-
term funding but looks to have remained solvent, made Fed officials realize that lender-of-last
resort operations needed to be extended beyond commercial banks. Second, the Primary
Dealer Credit Facility seeks to reduce interest-rate spreads between the asset-backed securities
that can be used for collateral in these loans and U.S. Treasury securities, thereby improving
the ability of investors to buy and sell asset-backed securities in financial markets. Since
primary dealers can now take a relatively broad set of bonds to the Fed and obtain immediate
cash, these securities should be more readily acceptable as collateral in private borrowing
arrangements. If this works, all the Fed should have to do is announce the program; it should
not have to make many, if any, loans.

Looking back at Figure 2, notice that the gap between the interest rate on government agencies
and U.S. Treasury securities fell immediately on March 17, 2008, with the creation of the
Primary Dealer Credit Facility and continued to decline, although much more modestly, as the
Term Securities Lending Facility began operation. By the end of May 2008, the spread on
government agency debt that are normally 15 to 25 basis points above the Treasury rate were
still 50 basis points – not great, but better than the spread of 90 basis points in mid-March.
There are several reasons the spread could have fallen at this time. It also could have been the
reduction in Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s capital requirements announced on March 19 or
Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers release of their quarterly earnings on March 18, 2008.
But the new Federal Reserve programs probably played a role, too.


The Evolution of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet

To understand the comprehensive impact of all of these changes in Fed operations, we return to
the balance sheet. Table 3 shows the evolution Fed assets over the nine months from July 2007
to May 2008; and the changes are enormous.6 Because the liabilities of the Federal Reserve
have not changed in any material way, they are omitted from this table.

Before the crisis, the Fed held nearly $800 billion in securities outright. By the end of May 2008,
that had been fallen to less than $450 billion, of which roughly one-third was committed to the
Term Securities Lending Facility. Repurchase agreements used to be around $30 billion; by
spring 2008 they exceed $100 billion. Prior to December 2007, loans were inconsequential.
Nine months into the crisis, the Fed was lending over $170 billion through a variety of
mechanisms. Interestingly, since the beginning of April, with discount rate penalty cut to 25
basis points above the federal funds rate target, discount borrowing has skyrocketed to an
average of more than $12 billion. All the while, the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet
has hardly changed, rising at the end of the year to accommodate seasonal demand for
currency, but then falling back. Everything Federal Reserve policymakers had done was aimed
at changing the composition of assets they held, not the size of their balance sheet.
6
 Aid to commercial banks does not end with the changes in Federal Reserve practice. The little-known Federal
Home Loan Banks have been another source of funding. During second half of 2007, these government-sponsored
enterprises provided commercial banks with roughly $230 billion in loans. These loans are for longer terms than the
discount window, are cheaper than discount loans even at a penalty spread of 25 basis points, and allowed for a
broad range of mortgage-based collateral.

Conclusion

On August 9, 2007, the global financial system started to crack. Financial institutions
everywhere were forced to confront the reality that their substantial holdings of mortgage-
backed securities were worth less than they thought, and had become very difficult to value.
Banks uncertainty about both their own level of capital and their ability to borrow made them
unwilling to lend. Some financial intermediaries began to have trouble finding the short-term
financing that was essential for them to carry on their daily business.

Central bank policymakers worked to response appropriately. Traditional interest rate
instruments proved to be ineffective, so Fed officials innovated in a number of ways. By lending
both cash and securities, based on collateral of questionable value, the Fed tried to bring order
back to financial markets. The amounts involved are massive. By the end of May 2008, the
Fed had committed nearly two-thirds of its $900 billion balance sheet to these new programs:
$150 billion to the Term Auction Facility; $100 billion to 28-day repo of mortgage-backed
securities, $200 billion to the Term Securities Lending Facility; $62 billion to foreign exchange
swaps; $29 billion to a loan to support the sale of Bear Stearns; and $20 billion so far to the
Primary Dealer Credit Facility.

Was it prudent for the Federal Reserve to refashion its policy tools in this way? The amount
committed by the Federal Reserve has been so large that it is natural to wonder what would
happen if the Fed were to run out of capacity to engage in these sorts of transactions. Ip (2008)
reports that Fed officials were concerned about this possibility, and have examined several
mechanisms to increase lending capacity should the Fed need it. The simplest approach is to
have the Treasury increase the size of its deposit account, with the Fed they using the proceeds
as they see fit. There is also the possibility that, even without further legislation, the Federal
Reserve could issue its own debt.

The financial crisis of 2007-2008 raises a number of substantial and difficult questions. What
should policymakers do when prices of leveraged assets boom? How should central banks
respond to declines the price of risky assets, and the associated increase in risk premia?
Should monetary policymakers react to illiquidity in the market for specific assets, and if so
how? When a highly leveraged and complex financial institution experiences losses, what is the
central bank’s responsibility? Should a central bank take credit risk in its lending operations, or
should this function belong to the U.S. Treasury? Perhaps with experience and research, the
answers to these questions will become clear. Once the crisis is safely past, we might want to
reassess the role of the central bank. But in the financial crisis of 2007-2008, the Federal
Reserve was the only official body that could act quickly and powerfully enough to make a
difference. Given the very real and immediate dangers posed by the financial crisis that began
in August 2007, it is difficult to fault the Federal Reserve for its creative and aggressive
responses.
