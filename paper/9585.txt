The Effect of Expected Income on Individual Migration Decisions
John Kennan and James R. Walker
NBER Working Paper No. 9585
March 2003, Revised February 2008
JEL No. J6,J1

                                              ABSTRACT

The paper develops a tractable econometric model of optimal migration, focusing on expected income
as the main economic influence on migration. The model improves on previous work in two respects:
it covers optimal sequences of location decisions (rather than a single once-for-all choice), and it allows
for many alternative location choices. The model is estimated using panel data from the NLSY on
white males with a high school education. Our main conclusion is that interstate migration decisions
are influenced to a substantial extent by income prospects. The results suggest that the link between
income and migration decisions is driven both by geographic differences in mean wages and by a tendency
to move in search of a better locational match when the income realization in the current location is
unfavorable.

1 Introduction
    There is an extensive literature on migration.2 Most of this work describes patterns in the
data: for example, younger and more educated people are more likely to move; repeat and
especially return migration accounts for a large part of the observed migration flows. Although
informal theories explaining these patterns are plentiful, fully specified behavioral models of
migration decisions are scarce, and these models generally consider each migration event in
isolation, without attempting to explain why most migration decisions are subsequently reversed
through onward or return migration.
    This paper develops a model of optimal sequences of migration decisions, focusing on
expected income as the main economic influence on migration. We emphasize that migration
decisions are reversible, and that many alternative locations must be considered. The model is
estimated using panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on white males with
a high school education.
    Structural dynamic models of migration over many locations have not been estimated before,
presumably because the required computations have not been feasible.3 A structural
representation of the decision process is of interest for the usual reasons: we are ultimately
interested in quantifying responses to income shocks or policy interventions not seen in the
data, such as local labor demand shocks, or changes in welfare benefits. Our basic empirical
question is the extent to which people move for the purpose of improving their income
prospects. Work by Keane and Wolpin (1997) and by Neal (1999) indicates that individuals
make surprisingly sophisticated calculations regarding schooling and occupational choices.
Given the magnitude of geographical wage differentials, and given the findings of Topel (1986)
and Blanchard and Katz (1992) regarding the responsiveness of migration flows to local labor
market conditions, one might expect to find that income differentials play an important role in
migration decisions.

      Holt (1996) estimated a dynamic discrete choice model of migration, but his framework modeled the
move/stay decision and not the location-specific flows. Similarly, Tunali (2000) gives a detailed
econometric analysis of the move/stay decision using microdata for Turkey, but his model does not
distinguish between alternative destinations. Dahl (2002) allows for many alternative destinations (the set
of States in the U.S.), but he considers only a single lifetime migration decision. Gallin (2004) models net
migration in a given location as a response to expected future wages in that location, but he does not
model the individual decision problem. Gemici (2007) extends our framework and considers family
migration decisions, but defines locations as census regions.

                                                     1
    We model individual decisions to migrate as a job search problem. A worker can draw a
wage only by visiting a location, thereby incurring a moving cost. Locations are distinguished by
known differences in wage distributions and amenity values. We also allow for a location match
component of preferences that is revealed to the individual for each location that is visited.
    The decision problem is too complicated to be solved analytically, so we use a discrete
approximation that can be solved numerically, following Rust (1994). The model is sparsely
parameterized. In addition to expected income, migration decisions are influenced by moving
costs (including a fixed cost, a reduced cost of moving to a previous location, and a cost that
depends on distance), and by differences in climate, and by differences in location size
(measured by the population in each location). We also allow for a bias in favor of the home
location (measured as the State of residence at age 14). Age is included as a state variable,
entering through the moving cost, with the idea that if the simplest human capital explanation of
the relationship between age and migration rates is correct, there should be no need to include a
moving cost that increases with age.
    Our main substantive conclusion is that interstate migration decisions are indeed influenced
to a substantial extent by income prospects. There is evidence of a response to geographic
differences in mean wages, as well as a tendency to move in search of a better locational match
when the income realization in the current location is unfavorable.
    More generally, the paper demonstrates that a fully specified econometric model of optimal
dynamic migration decisions is feasible, and that it is capable of matching the main features of
the data, including repeat and return migration. Although this paper focuses on the relationship
between income prospects and migration decisions at the start of the life cycle, suitably modified
versions of the model can potentially be applied to a range of issues, such as the migration
effects of interstate differences in welfare benefits, the effects of joint career concerns on
household migration decisions, and the effects on retirement migration of interstate differences
in tax laws.4


2 Migration Dynamics
    The need for a dynamic analysis of migration is illustrated in Table 1, which summarizes
10-year interstate migration histories of for the cross-section sample of the NLSY, beginning at
age 18. Two features of the data are noteworthy. First, a large fraction of the flow of migrants


    4
    See for example Kennan and Walker (2001) and Gemici (2007).

                                                  2
involves people who have already moved at least once. Second, a large fraction of these repeat
moves involves people returning to their original location. Simple models of isolated move-stay
decisions cannot address these features of the data. In particular, a model of return migration is
incomplete unless it includes the decision to leave the initial location as well as the decision to
return. Moreover, unless the model allows for many alternative locations, it cannot give a
complete analysis of return migration. For example, a repeat move in a two-location model is
necessarily a return move, and this misses the point that people frequently decide to return to a
location that they had previously decided to leave, even though many alternative locations are
available.

3 An Optimal Search Model of Migration
   We model migration as an optimal search process. The basic assumption is that wages are
local prices of individual skill bundles. We assume that individuals know the wage in their
current location, but in order to determine the wage in another location, it is necessary to move
there, at some cost. This reflects the idea that people may be more productive in some locations
than in others, depending on working conditions, residential conditions, local amenities and so


                                                  3
forth. Although some information about these things can of course be collected from a distance,
we view the whole package as an experience good.
    The model aims to describe the migration decisions of young workers in a stationary
environment. The wage offer in each location may be interpreted as the best offer available in
that location.5 Although there are transient fluctuations in wages, the only chance of getting a
permanent wage gain is to move to a new location. One interpretation is that wage differentials
across locations equalize amenity differences, but a stationary equilibrium with heterogeneous
worker preferences and skills still requires migration to redistribute workers from where they
happen to be born to their equilibrium location. Alternatively, it may be that wage differentials
are slow to adjust to location-specific shocks, because gradual adjustment is less costly for
workers and employers.6 In that case, our model can be viewed as an approximation in which
workers take current wage levels as a rough estimate of the wages they will face for the
foreseeable future. In any case, the model is intended to describe the partial equilibrium
response of labor supply to wage differences across locations; from the worker’s point of view
the source of these differences is immaterial, provided that they are permanent. A complete
equilibrium analysis would of course be much more difficult, but our model can be viewed as a
building-block toward such an analysis.
    Suppose there are J locations, and individual i’s income yij in location j is a random variable
with a known distribution. Migration decisions are made so as to maximize the expected
discounted value of lifetime utility. In general, the level of assets is an important state variable
for this problem, but we focus on a special case in which assets do not affect migration decisions:
we assume that the marginal utility of income is constant, and that individuals can borrow and
lend without restriction at a given interest rate. Then expected utility maximization reduces to
maximization of expected lifetime income, net of moving costs, with the understanding that the
value of amenities is included in income, and that both amenity values and moving costs are
measured in consumption units. This is a natural benchmark model, although of course it
imposes strong assumptions.


    5
     This means that we are treating local match effects as relatively unimportant: search within the
current location quickly reveals the best available match.
    6
     Blanchard and Katz (1992, p.2), using average hourly earnings of production workers in
manufacturing, by State, from the BLS establishment survey, describe a pattern of “strong but quite
gradual convergence of state relative wages over the last 40 years.” For example, using a univariate AR(4)
model with annual data, they find that the half-life of a unit shock to the relative wage is more than 10
years. Similar findings were reported by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991) and by Topel (1986).

                                                     4
      There is little hope of solving this expected income maximization problem analytically. In
particular, the Gittins index solution of the multiarmed bandit problem cannot be applied
because there is a cost of moving.7 But by using a discrete approximation of the wage and
preference distributions, we can compute the value function and the optimal decision rule by
standard dynamic programming methods, following Rust (1994).


3.1       The Value Function
      Let x be the state vector (which includes wage and preference information, current location
and age, as discussed below). The utility flow for someone who chooses location j is specified as
u(x,j) + .j, where .j is a random variable that is assumed to be iid across locations and across
periods and independent of the state vector. Let p(xN| x, j) be the transition probability from
state x to state xN, if location j is chosen. The decision problem can be written in recursive form
as

                                                          [
                              V ( x ,ζ ) = max v ( x , j ) + ζ j
                                                 j
                                                                        ]                              (1)

where

                     v ( x , j ) = u( x , j ) + β ∑ p( x ′| x , j )v ( x ′)                           (2)
                                                              x′
and

                                     v ( x ) = Eζ V ( x , ζ )                                         (3)


and where $ is the discount factor, and E. denotes the expectation with respect to the
distribution of the J-vector with components .j. We assume that .j is drawn from the Type I
extreme value distribution. In this case, using arguments due to McFadden (1973) and Rust
(1987), we have
                                                      J
                                exp( v ( x )) = ∑ exp( v ( x , k ))                                   (4)
                                                     k =1

      Let D(x,j) be the probability of choosing location j, when the state is x. Then

      We compute v by value function iteration, assuming a finite horizon, T. We include age as a
state variable, with v / 0 at age T+1, so that successive iterations yield the value functions for a
person who is getting younger and younger.


4 Empirical Implementation
      A serious limitation of the discrete dynamic programming method is that the number of
states is typically large, even if the decision problem is relatively simple. Our model, with J
locations and n points of support for the wage distribution, has J(n+1) J states, for each person,
at each age. Ideally, locations would be defined as local labor markets, but we obviously cannot
let J be the number of labor markets; for example, there are over 3,100 counties in the U.S.
Indeed, even if J is the number of States, the model is computationally infeasible8, but by
restricting the information available to each individual an approximate version of the model can
be estimated; this is explained below.


4.1       A Limited History Approximation
      To reduce the state space to a reasonable size, it seems natural in our context to use an
approximation that takes advantage of the timing of migration decisions. We have assumed that
information on the value of human capital in alternative locations is permanent, and so if a
location has been visited previously, the wage in that location is known. This means that the
number of possible states increases geometrically with the number of locations. In practice,
however, the number of people seen in many distinct locations is small. Thus by restricting the
information set to include only wages seen in recent locations, it is possible to drastically shrink
the state space while retaining most of the information actually seen in the data. Specifically, we
suppose that the number of wage observations cannot exceed M, with M < J, so that it is not
possible to be fully informed about wages at all locations. Then if the distributions of location
match wage and preference components in each of J locations have n points of support, the
number of states for someone seen in M locations is J(Jn²)M, the number of possible M-period


      8
     And it will remain so: for example, if there are 50 locations, and the wage distribution has 5 support
points, then the number of dynamic programming states is
40,414,063,873,238,203,032,156,980,022,826,814,668,800.

                                                     6
histories describing the locations visited most recently, and the wage and preference
components found there. For example, if J is 50 and n is 3 and M is 2, the number of states at
each age is 10,125,000, which is manageable.
    This approximation reduces the number of states in the most obvious way: we simply delete
most of them.9 Someone who has “too much” wage information in the big state space is
reassigned to a less-informed state. Individuals make the same calculations as before when
deciding what to do next, and the econometrician uses the same procedure to recover the
parameters governing the individual's decisions. There is just a shorter list of states, so people
with different histories may be in different states in the big model, but they are considered to be
in the same state in the reduced model. In particular, people who have the same recent history
are in the same state, even if their previous histories were different.
    Decision problems with large state spaces can alternatively be analyzed by computing the
value function at a finite set of points, and interpolating the function for points outside this set,
as suggested by Keane and Wolpin (1994).10 In our context this would not be feasible without
some simplification of the state space, because of the spatial structure of the states. Since each
location has its own unique characteristics, interpolation can be done only within locations, and
this means that the set of points used to anchor the interpolation must include several
alternative realizations of the location match components for each location; allowing for n
alternatives yields a set of nJ points, which is too big when J = 50 (even if n is small). On the
other hand it is worth noting that our limited history approximation works only because we have
discretized the state space. If the location match components are drawn from continuous
distributions, the state space is still infinite even when the history is limited (although
interpolation methods could be used in that case).




    9
     Note that it is not enough to keep track of the best wage found so far: the payoff shocks may favor a
location that has previously been abandoned, and it is necessary to know the wage at that location in order
to decide whether to go back there (even if it is known that there is a higher wage at another location).
    10
      For example, this method was used by Erdem and Keane (1994) to analyze the demand for liquid
laundry detergent, and by Crawford and Shum (2005) to analyze the demand for pharmaceuticals. In
these applications, the agents in the model do not know the flow payoffs from the various available choices
until they have tried them, just as our agents do not know the location match components until they have
visited the location.

                                                     7
4.2        Wages
      The wage of individual i in location j at age a in year t is specified as

                   wij ( a ) = μ j + υ ij + G ( X i , a , t ) + ηi + ε ij ( a )                       (6)


where :j is the mean wage in location j, L is a permanent location match effect, G(X,a,t)
represents a (linear) time effect and the effects of observed individual characteristics, 0 is an
individual effect that is fixed across locations, and g is a transient effect. We assume that 0, L
and g are independent random variables that they are identically distributed across individuals
and locations. We also assume that the realizations of 0 and L are seen by the individual.11
      The relationship between wages and migration decisions is governed by the difference
between the quality of the match in the current location, measured by :j + Lij , and the prospect of
obtaining a better match in another location k, measured by :k + Lik . The other components of
wages have no bearing on migration decisions, since they are added to the wage in the same way
no matter what decisions are made. The individual knows the realization of the match quality in
the current location, and in the previous location (if there is one), but the prospects in other
locations are random. Migration decisions are made by comparing the expected continuation
value of staying, given the current match quality, with the expected continuation values
associated with moving.


4.3        State Variables and Flow Payoffs
      Let R = (R0,R1,...RM-1) be an M-vector containing the sequence of recent locations (beginning
with the current location), and let T be an M-vector recording wage and utility information at
these locations. The state vector x consists of R, T and age.
      The flow payoff for someone whose “home” location is h is specified as

                                u~h ( x , j ) = uh ( x , j ) + ζ j                                    (7)

where




      11
     An interesting extension of the model would allow for learning, by relaxing the assumption that
agents know the realizations of 0 and L. In particular, such an extension might help explain return
migration, because moving reveals information about the wage components. Pessino (1991) analyzed a
two-period Bayesian learning model along these lines, and applied it to migration data for Peru.

meaning that A is true). The flow payoff in each location has a random permanent component >;
the realization of this component is learned only when the location is visited. This location
match component of preferences is analogous to the match component of wages (L), except that
> can only be inferred from observed migration choices, whereas both migration choices and
wages are informative about L. The cost of moving from R0 to j for a person of type J is
represented by )J(x,j). The unexplained part of the utility flow, .j , may be viewed as either a
preference shock or a shock to the cost of moving, with no way to distinguish between the two.


4.4      Moving Costs
      Let D(R0,j) be the distance from the current location to location j, and let A(R0) be the set of
locations adjacent to R0 (where States are adjacent if they share a border). The moving cost is
specified as

               (                            (       ( ))                                     )
Δ τ ( x , j ) = γ 0τ + γ 1 D( A 0 , j ) − γ 2 χ j ∈ A A 0 − γ 3 χ ( j = A 1 ) + γ 4 a − γ 5 n j χ ( j ≠ A 0 ) (9)


We allow for unobserved heterogeneity in the cost of moving: there are several types, indexed by
J, with differing values of the intercept (0. In particular, there may be a “stayer” type, meaning
that there may be people who regard the cost of moving as prohibitive, in all states. The moving
cost is an affine function of distance (which we measure as the great circle distance between
population centroids). Moves to an adjacent location may be less costly (because it is possible to
change States while remaining in the same general area). A move to a previous location may
also be less costly, relative to moving to a new location. In addition, the cost of moving is
allowed to depend on age, a. Finally, we allow for the possibility that it is cheaper to move to a
large location, as measured by population size nj. It has long been recognized that location size
matters in migration models (see e.g. Schultz [1982]). California and Wyoming cannot
reasonably be regarded as just two alternative places, to be treated symmetrically as origin and


                                                       9
destination locations. For example, a person who moves to be close to a friend or relative is
more likely to have friends or relatives in California than in Wyoming. One way to model this in
our framework is to allow for more than one draw from the distribution of payoff shocks in each
location.12 Alternatively, location size may affect moving costs – for example, friends or relatives
might help reduce the cost of the move. In practice, both versions give similar results.


4.5        Transition Probabilities

      The state vector can be written as      x = ( x , a ) , where x = ( A 0 , A1 , xυ0 , xυ1 , xξ0 , xξ1 )   and where x0L

indexes the realization of the location match component of wages in the current location, and
similarly for the other components. The transition probabilities are as follows

                  ⎧1, if j = A0 , x ′ = x , a ′ = a + 1
                  ⎪
                  ⎪⎪1, if j = A , x ′ = ( A , A , xυ , xυ , xξ , xξ ), a′ = a + 1
                               1             1 0     1   0    1     0

p ( x′| x, j ) = ⎨ 1                                                                                               (10)
                 ⎪ 2 , if j ∉ {A , A }, x ′ = ( j, A , sυ , xυ , sξ , xξ ),1 ≤ sυ ≤ nυ ,1 ≤ sξ ≤ nξ , a ′ = a + 1
                                     0 1                 1         0       0

                 ⎪n
                 ⎪⎩0, otherwise


This covers several cases. First, if no migration occurs this period, then the state remains the
same except for the age component. If there is a move to a previous location, the current and
previous locations are interchanged. And if there is a move to a new location, the current
location becomes the previous location, and the new location match components are drawn at
random. In all cases, age is incremented by one period.




      12
      Suppose that the number of draws per location is an affine function of the number of people already
in that location, and that migration decisions are controlled by the maximal draw for each location. This
leads to the following modification of the logit function describing choice probabilities:




Here nj is the population in location j, and R can be interpreted as the number of additional draws per
person.

                                                           10
4.6        Identification
      We can identify the influence of wages on migration decisions in our model using panel data
on individuals who start out in locations with different mean wage levels, or who have different
realizations from the distribution of match components in their initial location. Even if wages
are irrelevant (i.e. if "0 = 0), the model predicts that people with unfavorable realizations of the
location match preference component > in the initial location would be more likely to migrate.
But as long as we have data on the match component of wages, we can distinguish the effect of
wages from the effect of locational preferences. We illustrate this using a very simple case of the
model.13
      Suppose there are just two locations, and the payoff in location j is "0 (:j + Lj ) + >j . Each
person knows {:j}, and knows the realizations of L and > in the initial location, and the
distributions FL and F> from which the match components are drawn. Assume for simplicity that
only one move is possible, and that it must be made in the initial period. Then if L and > have
zero means, and if decisions are made to maximize expected income, the probability that
someone who is born in location 1 would move to location 2 is

           Pr (α 0 ( μ1 + υ1 ) + ξ1 + δ < α 0 μ2 ) = Fξ (α 0 ( μ2 − μ1 − υ1 ) − δ )                     (11)


      The data reveal the proportion of people who move at each level of wages, and the
relationship between wages and migration can thus be used to predict the effect of a change in
wage levels. For example, if :1 changes to :1', a person with wage w will behave in the same way
as a person with wage w + :1' - :1 behaved before the change.14


      13
      We do not directly see the location match component of wages, but this component can be identified
by comparing the variability of wages within and across locations for each individual. One simple way to
do this is as follows. Let yi be a vector containing the wage history for individual i. For each individual
history classify the elements of the cross-products matrix yiy'i , as follows: (1) diagonal elements, (2) off-
diagonal elements that refer to covariances in the same location and (3) off-diagonal elements that refer to
covariances in different locations. Let A1, A2 and A3 denote the sample averages of these cross-products
(where the average is taken over the entire unbalanced panel). Then A3 is a consistent estimator for F20 ,
A2-A3 is a consistent estimator for F2L and A1 - A2 is a consistent estimator for F20 . Given these variance
estimates, the location match component can be estimated by solving a standard signal extraction
problem. Although this heuristic method gives a transparent account of how the wage components can be
extracted, in practice we estimate all of the wage parameters jointly as part of the maximum likelihood
procedure, as described below.
      14
      This is quite general: the preference and wage shocks need not be separable, for example. The effect
of a change in :2 depends on more assumptions. In our model, the effect of an increase in :2 is exactly the
same as the effect of a decrease in :1 by the same amount, because the two match components affect

                                                     11
4.7        Data
      Our primary data source is the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Cohort
(NLSY79); we also use data from the 1990 Census. The NLSY79 conducted annual interviews
from 1979 through 1994, and shifted to a biennial schedule in 1994. The location of each
respondent is recorded at the date of each interview, and we measure migration by the change in
location from one interview to the next. We use information from 1979 to 1994 so as to avoid the
complications arising from the change in the frequency of interviews.
      In order to obtain a relatively homogeneous sample, we consider only white non-Hispanic
high-school graduates with no post-secondary education, using only the years after schooling is
completed.15 Appendix A describes our selection procedures. The NLSY over-samples people
whose parents were poor, and one might expect that the income process for such people is
atypical, and that the effect of income on migration decisions might also be atypical. Thus we
use only the “cross-section” subsample, with the poverty subsample excluded. The sample
includes only people who completed high school by age 20, and who never enrolled in college.
We exclude those who ever served in the military and we exclude those who report being out of
the labor force for more than one year after age 20. We follow each respondent from age 20 to
the 1994 interview or the first year in which some relevant information is missing or
inconsistent.
      Our analysis sample contains 432 people, with continuous histories from age 20 comprising
4,274 person-years. There are 124 interstate moves (2.9 percent per annum).
      In each round of the NLSY79, respondents report income for the most recent calendar year.
Wages are measured as total wage and salary income, plus farm and business income, adjusted
for cost of living differences across States (using the ACCRA Cost of Living Index). We exclude
observations with positive hours or weeks worked and zero income.
      We use information from the Public Use Micro Sample from the 1990 Census to estimate
State mean effects (:j), since the NLSY does not have enough observations for this purpose.




migration decisions only through their sum, and the decisions are driven by expected income comparisons
(with no risk aversion).
      15
      Attrition in panel data is an obvious problem for migration studies, and one reason for using NLSY
data is that it minimizes this problem. Reagan and Olsen (2000, p. 339) report that “Attrition rates in the
NLSY79 are relatively low ...The primary reason for attrition are death and refusal to continue
participating in the project, not the inability to locate respondents at home or abroad.”

                                                    12
From the PUMS we select white high-school men aged 19-20.16 We estimate State mean wage
effects using a median regression with age and State dummies.17 We condition on these
estimated State means in the maximum likelihood procedure that jointly estimates the
remaining parameters of the wage process and the utility and cost parameters governing
migration decisions.


5 Estimation
      In this section we discuss the specification and computation of the likelihood function.


5.1          Discrete Approximation of the Distribution of Location Match Effects
      We approximate the decision problem by using discrete distributions to represent the
distributions of the location match components, and computing continuation values at the
support points of these distributions. We first describe this approximation, and then describe
the specification of the other components of wages.
      For given support points, the best discrete approximation F̂ for any distribution F assigns

probabilities so as to equate F̂ with the average value of F over each interval where F̂ is constant.

If the support points are variable, they are chosen so that F̂ assigns equal probability to each
point.18 Thus if the distribution of the location match component L were known, the wage
prospects associated with a move to State k could be represented by an n-point distribution with
equally weighted support points μˆ k + υˆ ( qr ) , 1 # r # n, where L̂ (qr) is the qr quantile of the

distribution of L, with

                                                   2r − 1
                                            qr =                                                        (12)
                                                    2n


      16
      The parameters governing migration decisions and the parameters of the wage process are estimated
jointly to account for selection effects due to migration (although in practice these effects are empirically
negligible). The State mean effects are specified as age-invariant and are estimated using wages observed
at the beginning of the worklife, to minimize the potential effects of selection. We include observations for
19 year olds from the PUMS to increase the precision of the estimated State means.
      17
     We measure wages as annual earnings and exclude individuals with retirement income, social
security income or public assistance; we also exclude observations if earnings are zero despite positive
hours or weeks worked.
      18
           See Kennan (2004).

                                                     13
for 1 # r # n. The distribution of L is in fact not known, but we assume that it is symmetric
around zero. Thus for example with n = 3, the distribution of :j + Lij in each State is
approximated by a distribution that puts mass a on :j (the median of the distribution of
:j + Lij ), with mass a on :j ± JL , where JL is a parameter to be estimated. The location match
component of preferences is handled in a similar way.


5.2      Fixed Effects and Transient Wage Components
      Even though our sample is quite homogeneous, measured earnings in the NLSY are highly
variable, both across people and over time. Moreover, the variability of earnings over time is
itself quite variable across individuals. Our aim is to specify a wage components model that is
flexible enough to fit these data, so that we can draw reasonable inferences about the
relationship between measured earnings and the realized values of the location match
component. For the fixed effect 0, we use a (uniform) discrete distribution that is symmetric
around zero, with 7 points of support, so that there are three parameters to be estimated. For
the transient component g we need a continuous distribution that is flexible enough to account
for the observed variability of earnings. We assume that g is drawn from a normal distribution
with zero mean for each person, but we allow the variance to vary across people. Specifically,
person i initially draws Fg(i) from some distribution, and subsequently draws git from a normal
distribution with mean zero and standard deviation Fg(i), with git drawn independently in each
period. The distribution from which Fg is drawn is specified as a (uniform) discrete distribution
with four support points, where these support points are parameters to be estimated.


5.3      The Likelihood Function
      The likelihood of the observed history for each individual is a mixture over heterogeneous
types. Let Li(2J ) be the likelihood for individual i, where 2J is the parameter vector, for someone
of type J, and let BJ be the probability of type J. The sample loglikelihood is
                                        N
                                          ⎛ K             ⎞
                             Λ(θ ) = ∑ log⎜ ∑ π τ Li (θτ )⎟                                     (13)
                                     i =1 ⎝ τ =1          ⎠
      For each period of an individual history two pieces of information contribute to the
likelihood: the observed income, and the location choice. Each piece involves a mixture over the
possible realizations of the various unobserved components. In each location there is a draw
from the distribution of location match wage components, which is modeled as a uniform


                                                 14
distribution over the finite set Υ = {υ (1), υ (2), " , υ ( nυ )} . We index this set by TL , with TL(j)

representing the match component in location j, where 1 # TL(j) # nL. Similarly, in each location
there is a draw from the location match preference distribution, which is modeled as a uniform

                                                   {                             }
distribution over the finite set Ξ = ξ (1) , ξ ( 2 ) ," , ξ ( nξ ) , indexed by T> . Each individual also

draws from the distribution of fixed effects, which is modeled as a uniform distribution over the

                  {                            }
finite set Η = η(1), η(2), " , η( nη ) , and we use T0 to represent the outcome of this. And each

individual draws a transient variance, from a uniform distribution over the set
ς = {σ ε (1), σ ε (2), " , σ ε ( nε )} , with the outcome indexed by Tg.

    The unobserved components for individual i are then represented by a vector Ti with Ni +3

                      (                                                    )
elements: ω i = ωξi , ωηi , ωεi , ωυi (1) , ωυi ( 2 ) ," , ωυi ( N i ) , where Ni is the number of locations visited

by this individual. The set of possible realizations of Ti is denoted by S(Ni); there are

nξ nη nε ( nυ ) i points in this set, and our discrete approximation implies that they are equally
              N




likely.
    We index the locations visited by individual i in the order in which they appear, and we use

the notation      κ it0 and κ it1 to represent the position of the current and previous locations in this

index. Thus       κ it = (κ it0 , κ it1 )   is a pair of integers between 1 and Ni. For example, in the case of


someone who never moves,                    κ it0 is always 1, and κ it1       is zero (by convention), while for someone

who has just moved for the first time, 6it = (2,1).
    Let 8it(Ti,2J) be the likelihood of the destination chosen by person i in period. Recall that
D(x,j) is the probability of choosing location j, when the state is x. Then

                               (                                                                                       )
 λit (ω i , θτ ) = ρ h ( i ) A(i , t ), ωυi (κ it0 ) , ωυi (κ it1 ) , ωξi (κ it0 ) , ωξi (κ it1 ) , ait , A 0 (i, t + 1), θτ (14)
Here the probability that i chooses the next observed location, R0(i,t+1), depends on the current
and previous locations, the values of the location match components at those locations, the
individual’s home location h(i), and the individual’s current age. The parameter vector 2J




                                                                    15

5.4        Computation
      Since the parameters are embedded in the value function, computation of the gradient and
hessian of the loglikelihood function is not a simple matter (although in principle these
derivatives can be computed using the same iterative procedure that computes the value
function itself). We maximize the likelihood using a version of Newton’s algorithm with
numerical derivatives. We also use the downhill simplex method of Nelder and Mead, mainly to
check for local maxima. This method does not use derivatives, but it is very slow.19


6 Empirical Results
      Our basic results are shown in Table 2. We set $ =.95, T = 40, and M = 2; we show below
that our main results are not very sensitive to changes in the discount factor or the horizon




      19
      Given reasonable starting values (for example, 50% type probabilities and a fixed cost for the mover
type that roughly matches the average migration rate, with a unit variance for the transient component of
wages, and all other parameters set to zero), the maximal likelihood is reached by Newton’s method within
a day or two, on a cluster of parallel CPUs, with one CPU per home location; each likelihood evaluation
requires about 24 seconds. We found the Newton procedure to be well-behaved in the sense that it almost
always reached the same answer no matter what starting values were used: we have estimated hundreds of
different versions of the model, and found very few local maxima; even in these cases the likelihood and
the parameter values were very close to the “true” maximum. An example of our (FORTRAN90) computer
program can be found at www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jkennan/research/mbr87.f90.

                                                        16
length.20 The table gives estimated coefficients and standard errors for four versions of the
model that highlight both the effect of income on migration decisions and the relevance of the
location match component of preferences. Unobserved heterogeneity in moving costs is
introduced by allowing for two types, one of which is a pure stayer type (representing people
with prohibitive moving costs); little is gained by introducing additional types, or by replacing
the stayer type with a type with a high moving cost.
    We find that distance, home and previous locations and population size all have highly
significant effects on migration. Age and local climate (represented by the annual number of
cooling degree-days) are also significant.21 Our main finding is that, controlling for these effects,
migration decisions are significantly affected by expected income changes. This holds regardless
of whether the location match component of preferences is included in the specification. Since
the estimated effect of this component is negligible, and it enlarges the state space by a factor of
about 100, we treat the specification that excludes this component as the base model in the
subsequent discussion.




    20
       The validity of the estimates is checked in Appendix B: the estimated coefficients were used to
simulate 100 replicas of each person in the data, and the maximum likelihood procedure was applied to
the simulated data. The null hypothesis that the data were generated by the true DGP is accepted by a
likelihood ratio test.

       The “cooling” variable is the population-weighted annual average number of cooling degree days (in
thousands) for 1931-2000, taken from Historical Climatography Series 5-2 (Cooling Degree Days) – see
US NCDC (2002). For example, the cooling degree-day variable for Florida is 3.356, meaning that the
difference between 650 and the mean daily temperature in Florida, summed over the days when the mean
was above 65o, averaged 3,356 degree-days per year (over the years 1931-2000).
     We explored various alternative specifications of the climate amenity variables. Including heating
degree-days had little effect on the results (see Table 10 below). The number of States that are adjacent to
an ocean is 23. We considered this as an additional amenity variable, and also estimated models including
annual rainfall, and the annual number of sunny days, but found that these variables had virtually no
effect.
     Given the sample size, we cannot expect to obtain precise estimates of the effects of climate variations.
We include these variables mainly to ensure that the estimated effect of income is robust to the inclusion
of nonpecuniary amenities.

     6.1      Wages
           The parameters of the wage process are interpreted in Table 3, which gives the magnitudes
     of the various components in current dollars. As was mentioned above, there is a great deal of




                                                        18
unexplained variation in wages, across people, and over time for the same person; moreover
there are big differences in the variability of earnings over time from one individual to the next.22

    The wage components that are relevant for migration decisions in the model are also quite
variable, meaning that migration incentives are strong. For example, the 90-10 differential
across State means is about $4,500 a year, and the value of replacing a bad location match draw
with a good draw is about $16,000 a year.



    22
      As indicated in Table 2, the individual characteristics affecting wages include age, AFQT score, and
an interaction between the two; the interaction effect is included to allow for the possibility that the
relationship between AFQT scores and wages is stronger for older workers, as argued by Altonji and
Pierret (2001).

6.2      Moving Costs and Payoff Shocks
      Since utility is linear in income, the estimated moving cost can be converted to a dollar
equivalent. Some examples are given in Table 4.

                                  Table 4: Moving Cost Examples

 Young mover             20         1           0                1            0           $370,461
 Average mover           24.355     0.664       0.427            0.727        0.371       $300,521


For the average mover, the cost is about $300,000 (in 2007 dollars), if the payoff shocks are
ignored. One might wonder why anyone would ever move in the face of such a cost, and in
particular whether a move motivated by expected income gains could ever pay for itself.
According to the estimates in Table 4, a move away from a bad location match would increase
income by $8,104, on average, and a move from the bottom to the top of the distribution of State
means would increase income by $9,198. A move that makes both of these changes would mean
a permanent wage increase of $17,302, or $301,574 in present value (assuming a remaining
worklife of 40 years, with $ = .95). The home premium is equivalent to a wage increase of
$22,298, and the cost of moving to a previous location is relatively low. Thus in some cases the
expected income gains would be more than enough to pay for the estimated moving cost. Of
course in most cases this would not be true, but then most people never move.
      More importantly, the estimates in Table 4 do not refer to the costs of moves that are actually
made, but rather to the costs of hypothetical moves to arbitrary locations. In the model, people
choose to move only when the payoff shocks are favorable, and the net cost of the move is
therefore much less than the amounts in Table 4. Consider for example a case in which someone
is forced to move, but allowed to choose the best alternative location. The expected value of the
maximum of J-1 draws from the extreme value distribution is (+log(J-1) (where ( is Euler’s
constant), so if the location with the most favorable payoff shock is chosen, the expected net cost
of the move is reduced by log(J-1)/"0. Using the estimated income coefficient, this is a reduction
of $261,872. Moreover, this calculation refers to a move made in an arbitrary period; in the
model, the individual can move later if the current payoff shocks are unfavorable, so the net cost

                                                    20
is further reduced. Of course people actually move only if there is in fact a net gain from
moving; the point of the argument is just that this can quite easily happen, despite the large
moving cost estimates in Table 4. In section 6.3 below we analyze the average costs of moves
that are actually made, allowing for the effects of the payoff shocks.
   Another way to interpret the moving cost is to consider the effect of a $10,000 migration
subsidy, payable for every move, with no obligation to stay in the new location for more than one
period. This can be analyzed by simulating the model with a reduction in (0 such that (0/"0 falls
by $10,000, and with the other parameters held fixed. We estimate that such a subsidy would
lead to a substantial increase in the interstate migration rate: from 2.9% to about 4.9%.


Moving Costs and Payoff Shocks: An Example
   To understand the relationship between moving costs and prospective income gains, it is
helpful to consider an example in which these are the only influences on migration decisions.
Suppose that income in each location is either high or low, the difference being )y, and suppose
that the realization of income in each location is known. Then, using equation (5), the odds of
moving are given by

                                                                                                 (17)




                                                                                                 (18)


where 8L is the probability of staying in one of JL low-income locations (and similarly for 8H and
JH), and where )V is the difference in expected continuation values between the low-income and
high-income locations. This difference is determined by the equation


                                                                                                 (19)




For example, if $ = 0, then )V = "0 )y, while if moving costs are prohibitive (exp(-(0) . 0), then
)V = "0 )y/(1-$).


                                                 21
    These equations uniquely identify "0 and (0 (these parameters are in fact over-identified,
because there is also information in the probabilities of moving to the same income level).23 If
(0 < $)V, then the odds of moving from a low-income location are greater than JH to 1, and this
is contrary to what is seen in the data (for any plausible value of JH). By making (0 a little bigger
than $)V, and letting both of these be large in relation to the payoff shocks, the probability of
moving from the low-income location can be made small. But then the probability of moving
from the high-income location is almost zero, which is not true in the data. In other words, if the
probability of moving from a high-income location is not negligible, then the payoff shocks
cannot be negligible, since a payoff shock is the only reason for making such a move.
    The net cost of moving from a low-income location to a high-income location is (0 - $)V,
while the net cost of the reverse move is (0 + $)V. The difference is 2$)V, and equations (17)
and (18) show that $)V determines the relative odds of moving from low-income and high-
income locations. Thus $)V is identified by the difference between 8L and 8H; this difference is
small in the data, so $)V must be small. The magnitude of (0 is then determined by the level of
8L and 8H, and since these are close to 1 in the data, the implication is that (0 is large, and that it
is much larger than $)V. Since $)V is roughly the present value of the difference in income
levels, the upshot is that the moving cost must be large in relation to income.
    For example, suppose JL = JH = 25, with $ = .95. In our data, the migration probability for
someone in the bottom quartile of the distribution of State mean wages is 5.5% (53 moves in 964
person-years), and for someone in the top quartile it is 2.1% (16 moves in 754 person-years). If
1-8L = 53/964 and 1-8H = 16/754, then (0 = 7.34, and )V = 1.02, and the implied moving cost is
(0/"0 = 85.3)y. Taking )y to be the difference in the mean wages for States in the top and
bottom quartiles gives (0/"0 = $304,195 (in 2007 dollars). On the other hand if 8L = .7, the
implied moving cost is only 14.4)y, or $51,369. We conclude that the moving cost estimate is
large mainly because the empirical relationship between income levels and migration
probabilities is relatively weak.




    23
      It is assumed that 8L, 8H, JL, JH, )y and $ are given. Dividing (17) by (18) and rearranging terms
yields a quadratic equation in e$)V that has one positive root and one negative root. Since e$)V must be
positive, this gives a unique solution for )V. Equation (17) then gives a unique solution for (0, and
inserting these solutions into equation (19) gives a unique solution for "0)y.

                                                     22
6.3      Average Costs of Actual Moves
      Our estimates of the deterministic components of moving costs are large because moves are
rare in the data. But moves do occur, and in many cases there is no observable reason for a
move, so that the observed choice must be attributed to unobserved payoff shocks, including
random variations in moving costs. The question then arises as to how large the actual moving
costs are, conditional on a move being made.24 Because the payoff shocks are drawn from the
type I extreme value distribution, this question has a simple answer.
      The cost of a move may be defined as the difference in the flow payoff for the current period
due to the move. Since a move to location j exchanges .0 for .j , the average cost of a move from
R0 to location j is

                            Δ ( x, j ) = Δ ( x, j ) − E (ζ j − ζ 0 | d j = 1)                           (20)

where dj is an indicator variable for the choice of location j.
      In logit models, the expected gain from the optimal choice, relative to an arbitrary alternative
that is not chosen, is a simple function of the probability of choosing the alternative

the gross continuation value is

moving costs, using the posterior distribution over the unobservables. The likelihood of an

    The estimated average moving costs are given in Table 5. There is considerable variation in
these costs, but for a typical move the cost is negative. The interpretation of this is that the
typical move is not motivated by the prospect of a higher future utility flow in the destination
location, but rather by unobserved factors yielding a higher current payoff in the destination
location, compared with the current location. In the case of moves to the home location, on the
other hand, the estimated cost is positive; most of these moves are return moves, but where the
home location is not the previous location the cost is large, reflecting a large gain in expected
future payoffs due to the move.

6.4      Goodness of Fit
      In order to keep the state space manageable, our model severely restricts the set of variables
that are allowed to affect migration decisions. Examples of omitted observable variables include
duration in the current location, and the number of moves made previously. In addition, there
are of course unobserved characteristics that might make some people more likely to move than
others. Thus it is important to check how well the model fits the data. In particular, since the
model pays little attention to individual histories, one might expect that it would have trouble
fitting panel data.
      One simple test of goodness of fit can be made by comparing the number of moves per
person in the data with the number predicted by the model. As a benchmark, we consider a
binomial distribution with a migration probability of 2.9% (the number of moves per person-
year in the data). Table 6 shows the predictions from this model: about 75% of the people never
move, and of those who do move, about 14% move more than once.25 The NLSY data are quite
different: about 84% never move, and about 56% of movers move more than once. An obvious
interpretation of this is mover-stayer heterogeneity: some people are more likely to move than

    25
       Since we have an unbalanced panel, the binomial probabilities are weighted by the distribution of
years per person.

                                                    25
others, and these people account for more than their share of the observed moves. We simulated
the corresponding statistics for the model by starting 100 replicas of the NLSY individuals in the
observed initial locations, and using the model (with the estimated parameters shown in
Table 2) to generate a history for each replica, covering the number of periods observed for this
individual. The results show that the model does a good job of accounting for the heterogeneous
migration probabilities in the data. The proportion of people who never move in the simulated
data matches the proportion in the NLSY data almost exactly, and although the proportion of
movers who move more than once is a bit high in the simulated data, the estimated model comes
much closer to this statistic than the binomial model does.

Return Migration
   Table 7 summarizes the extent to which the model can reproduce the return migration
patterns in the data (the statistics in the Model column refer to the simulated data set used in
Table 6).

      The model attaches a premium to the home location, and this helps explain why people
return home. For example, in a model with no home premium, one would expect that the
proportion of movers going to any particular location would be roughly 1/50, and this obviously
does not match the observed return rate of 35%. The home premium also reduces the chance of
initially leaving home, although this effect is offset by the substantial discount on the cost of
returning to a previous location (including the home location): leaving home is less costly if a
return move is relatively cheap.
      The simulated return migration rates match the data reasonably well. The main discrepancy
is that the model over-predicts the proportion who ever return home from an initial location that
is not their home location. That is, the model has trouble explaining why people seem so
attached to an initial location that is not their “home”. One potential explanation for this is that
our assignment of home locations (the State of residence at age 14) is too crude (in some cases
the location at age 20 may be more like a home location than the location at age 14). More
generally, people are no doubt more likely to put down roots the longer they stay in a location,
and our model does not capture this kind of duration dependence.


6.5      Why are Younger People More Likely to Move?
      It is well known that the propensity to migrate falls with age (at least after age 25 or so).
Table 8 replicates this finding for our sample of high-school men. A standard human capital
explanation for this age effect is that migration is an investment: if a higher income stream is
available elsewhere, then the sooner a move is made, the sooner the gain is realized. Moreover,
since the worklife is finite, a move that is worthwhile for a young worker might not be
worthwhile for an older worker, since there is less time for the higher income stream to offset
the moving cost (Sjaastad [1962]). In other words, migrants are more likely to be young for the

                                                    27
same reason that students are more likely to be young.

     Our model encompasses this simple human capital explanation of the age effect on
migration.26 There are two effects here. First, consider two locations paying different wages,
and suppose that workers are randomly assigned to these locations at birth. Then, even if the
horizon is infinite, the model predicts that the probability of moving from the low-wage to the
high-wage location is higher than the probability of a move in the other direction, so that
eventually there will be more workers in the high-wage location. This implies that the
(unconditional) migration rate is higher when workers are young.27 Second, the human capital
explanation says that migration rates decline with age because the horizon gets closer as workers
get older. This is surely an important reason for the difference in migration rates between young
adult workers and those within sight of retirement. But the workers in our sample are all in their
twenties or early thirties, and the prospect of retirement seems unimportant for such workers.
     We find that the simple human capital model does not adequately explain the relationship
between age and migration in the data. Our model includes age as a state variable, to capture
the effects just discussed. The model also allows for the possibility that age has a direct effect on
the cost of migration; this can be regarded as a catch-all for whatever is missing from the simple


     26
      Investments in location-specific human capital might also help explain why older workers are less
likely to move. Marriage might be included under this heading, for example, as in Gemici (2007). It is
worth noting that if we take marital status as given, it has essentially no effect on migration in our sample,
in simple logit models of the move-stay decision that include age as an explanatory variable.
     27
      One way to see this is to consider the extreme case in which there are no payoff shocks. In this case
all workers born in the low-wage location will move to the high-wage location at the first opportunity (if
the wage difference exceeds the moving cost), and the migration rate will be zero from then on.

                                                      28
human capital explanation. The results in Table 2 show that this direct effect is significant.


6.6      Decomposing the Effects of Income on Migration Decisions
      Migration is motivated by two distinct wage components in our model: differences in mean
wages (:j) across locations, and individual draws from the location match distribution (Lij). The
relevance of these components can be considered separately, first by suppressing the dispersion
in L, so that wages affect only because of differences in mean wages across locations, and
alternatively by specifying the wage distribution at the national level, so that migration is
motivated only by the prospect of getting a better draw from the same wage distribution (given
our assumption that location match effects are permanent). Table 9 shows that the estimated
income coefficient is roughly the same across these alternative specifications.
      Consider an economy in which everyone has the same preferences over locations, and also
the same productivity in each location. In a steady state equilibrium, everyone is indifferent
between locations: there are wage differences, but these just equalize the amenity differences.
People move for other reasons, but there are just as many people coming into each location as
there are going out. There should be no correlation between wages and mobility, in the steady
state. Nevertheless, if moving costs are high, at any given time one would expect to see flows of
workers toward locations with higher wages as part of a dynamic equilibrium driven by local
labor demand shocks. As was mentioned above (in footnote 6), there is some evidence that local
labor market shocks have long-lasting effects. So in a specification that uses only mean wages in
each location (with no location match effects), we should find a relationship between mean
wages and migration decisions. This is in fact what we find in Table 9 (in the “State Means”
column). But we also find that the exclusion of location match wage effects is strongly rejected
by a likelihood ratio test.
      In our model, the productivity of each worker includes a permanent location match
component. Even if differences in mean wages merely equalize the amenity differences between
locations, the model predicts a relationship between wage realizations and migration decisions,
because of location match effects: if the location match component is bad, the worker has an
incentive to leave. This motivates the “National Wages” column of Table 9, where it is assumed
that mean wages are the same in all locations (as they would be if measured wage differences
merely reflect unmeasured amenities). We find that workers who have unusually low wages in
their current location are indeed more likely to move.

6.7      Sensitivity Analysis
      Our empirical results are inevitably based on some more or less arbitrary model specification
choices. Table 10 explores the robustness of the results with respect to some of these choices.
The general conclusion is that the parameter estimates are robust. In particular, the income
coefficient estimate remains positive and significant in all of our alternative specifications.
      The results presented so far are based on wages that are adjusted for cost of living differences
across locations. If these cost of living differences merely compensate for amenity differences,
then unadjusted wages should be used to measure the incentive to migrate. This specification
yields a slightly lower estimate of the income coefficient, without much effect on the other
coefficients, and the likelihood is lower (mainly because there is more unexplained variation in


                                                  30
the unadjusted wages). Thus in practice the theoretical ambiguity as to whether wages should be
adjusted for cost of living differences does not change the qualitative empirical results: either
way, income significantly affects migration decisions.
    The other specifications in Table 10 are concerned with sensitivity of the estimates to the
discount factor ($), the horizon length (T), heterogeneity in moving costs and the inclusion of a
second climate variable (heating degree days).28 Again, the effect of income is quite stable across
these alternative specifications.




    28
      Table 10 is a sample of many alternative specifications that were tried. As was mentioned earlier,
size (as measured by population) may affect migration either as a scaling factor on the payoff shocks, or as
a variable affecting the cost of migration. We experimented with these alternatives, and also expanded the
moving cost specification to allow quadratic effects of distance and location size and climate variables;
none of these experiments changed the results much.

7 Spatial Labor Supply Elasticities
   We use the estimated model to analyze labor supply responses to changes in mean wages, for
selected States. We are interested in the magnitudes of the migration flows in response to local
wage changes, and in the timing of these responses. Since our model assumes that the wage
components relevant to migration decisions are permanent, it cannot be used to predict
responses to wage innovations in an environment in which wages are generated by a stochastic
process. Instead, it is used to answer comparative dynamics questions: we use the estimated
parameters to predict responses in a different environment. First we do a baseline calculation,
starting people in given locations, and allowing them to make migration decisions in response to
the wage distributions estimated from the Census data. Then we do counterfactual simulations,
starting people in the same locations, facing different wage distributions.
   We take a set of people who are distributed over States as in the 1990 Census data for white
male high school graduates aged 20 to 34. We assume that each person is initially in the home
State, at age 20, and we allow the population distribution to evolve over 15 years, by iterating the
estimated transition probability matrix. We consider responses to wage increases and decreases
representing a 10% change in the mean wage of an average 30-year-old, for selected States.
First, we compute baseline transition probabilities using the wages that generated the parameter
estimates. Then we increase or decrease the mean wage in a single State, and compare the
migration decisions induced by these wage changes with the baseline. Supply elasticities are
measured relative to the supply of labor in the baseline calculation. For example, the elasticity of
the response to a wage increase in California after 5 years is computed as ()L/L)/()w/w), where
L is the number of people in California after 5 years in the baseline calculation, and )L is the
difference between this and the number of people in California after 5 years in the counterfactual
calculation.

    Figure 1 shows the results for three large States that are near the middle of the one-period
utility flow distribution. The supply elasticities are above .5. Adjustment is gradual, but is
largely completed in 10 years. Our conclusion from this exercise is that despite the low
migration rate in the data, and the large migration costs implied by this rate, the supply of labor
responds quite strongly to spatial wage differences.


8 Conclusion
    We have developed a tractable econometric model of optimal migration in response to
income differentials across locations. The model improves on previous work in two respects: it
covers optimal sequences of location decisions (rather than a single once-for-all choice), and it
allows for many alternative location choices. Migration decisions are made so as to maximize
the expected present value of lifetime income, but these decisions are modified by the influence
of unobserved location-specific payoff shocks. Because the number of locations is too large to

                                                                      34
allow the complete dynamic programming problem to be modeled, we adopt an approximation
that truncates the amount of information available to the decision-maker. The practical effect of
this is that the decisions of a relatively small set of people who have made an unusually large
number of moves are modeled less accurately than they would be in the (computationally
infeasible) complete model.
   Our empirical results show a significant effect of expected income differences on interstate
migration, for white male high school graduates in the NLSY. Simulations of hypothetical local
wage changes show that the elasticity of the relationship between wages and migration is
roughly .5 . Our results can be interpreted in terms of optimal search for the best geographic
match. In particular, we find that the relationship between income and migration is partly
driven by a negative effect of income in the current location on the probability of out-migration:
workers who get a good draw in their current location tend to stay, while those who get a bad
draw tend to leave.
   The main limitations of our model are those imposed by the discrete dynamic programming
structure: given the large number of alternative location choices, the number of dynamic
programming states must be severely restricted for computational reasons. Goodness of fit tests
indicate that the model nevertheless fits the data reasonably well. From an economic point of
view, the most important limitation of the model is that it imposes restrictions on the wage
process implying that individual fixed effects and movements along the age-earnings profile do
not affect migration decisions. A less restrictive specification of the wage process would be
highly desirable.

deleted by each rule.29 The NLSY79 contains three subsamples, a nationally representative cross
section sample, a supplemental sample of minorities and economically disadvantaged youth and
a sample of individuals in the military in 1979. We start with the 2,439 white non-Hispanic
males in the cross-section sample. We exclude respondents who ever served in the military, and
we include only those with exactly a high school education.
    We assume that permanent labor force attachment begins at age 20; thus we exclude
respondents who were born in 1957, and who were therefore not interviewed until they were
already more than 20 years old. We drop those who are in school or report graduating from
high school at age 20. Since we use the AFQT (conducted in 1980) to help explain wages, we
drop individuals with missing AFQT scores. Respondents who report being out of the labor force
for more than one year after age 19, due to disability, tending house, or “other”, are dropped on
the grounds that they are not typical of this population. We use residence at age 14 as the home
location, so we drop people for whom this variable is missing; we also drop people whose
location at age 20 is unknown. We dropped one person who never reported income after age 19.
We also dropped four people who died in their 30s, again on the grounds that they are atypical.
Finally, we dropped one individual who was incarcerated in 1993 (after reporting remarkably
high incomes in earlier years). Application of these criteria produced a sample of 439
individuals and 6,585 person years.
    We apply two period-level restrictions. The first is that the histories must be continuous: we
follow individuals from age 20 to their first non-interview or the 1994 interview.30 Since a
missed interview means that location is unknown, we discard all data for each respondent after




    29
         Of course, the numbers in the table depend on the order in which the criteria are applied.
    30
      For the 22 people who moved before age 20, we record the previous location, but treat the location
match wage and preference components at that location as unknown. This means that there is a reduced
cost of moving to the previous location, but the location match components are not determined until the
individual enters the labor force at age 20.

                                                       36
the first missed interview.31 Finally, we delete observations before age 20 from the analysis
sample. Seven respondents have information only during their teenage years.
    Our final sample contains 4,274 periods for 432 men. There are 124 interstate moves, with
an annual migration rate of 2.9 percent. More than a one-third of the moves (43) were returns
to the home location. There are 361 people who never moved, 31 who moved once, 33 who
moved twice and 7 who moved three times or more. The median age is 25, reflecting the
continuous-history restriction.




     31
        The NLSY follows all members of the cohort and attempts to interview every member. Roughly half
of the non-respondents in one round are interviewed in the next.

   The parameter estimates from Table 2 were used to generate 100 replicas of each NLSY
observation, starting from the actual value in the NLSY data, and allowing the model to choose
the sequence of locations. Table 12 gives maximum likelihood estimates using the simulated
data. The last column reports the t-value testing the difference between the estimates and the
individual DGP parameters; the last row reports likelihood ratio tests of the hypothesis that the
data were generated by the process that did in fact generate them (assuming that the simulation
program works) . The estimated coefficients are close to the true values, and the P² test accepts
the truth. We take this as evidence that our estimation and simulation programs work.
