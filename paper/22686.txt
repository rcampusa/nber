                                          ABSTRACT

Do the stringent formal sector borrowing requirements common in many developing countries
restrict credit access, technology adoption, and welfare? When a Kenyan dairy's savings and
credit cooperative randomly offered some farmers the opportunity to replace loans with high
down payments and stringent guarantor requirements with loans collateralized by the asset itself
— a large water tank — loan take-up increased from 2.4% to 41.9%. (In contrast, substituting
joint liability requirements for deposit requirements did not affect loan take up.) There were no
repossessions among farmers allowed to collateralize 75%of their loans, and there was only a
0.7% repossession rate among those offered 96% asset collateralization. A Karlan-Zinman test
based on waiving borrowing requirements ex post finds evidence of adverse selection with
lowered deposit requirements, but not of moral hazard. A simple model and rough calibration
suggests that adverse selection may deter lenders from making welfare-improving loans with
lower deposit requirements, even after introducing asset collateralization. We estimate that 2/3 of
marginal loans led to increased water storage investment. Real effects of loosening borrowing
requirements include increased household water access, reductions in child time spent on water-
related tasks, and greater school enrollment for girls.

     1     Introduction

 1       Formal-sector lenders in developing countries often impose very tight borrowing require-

 2   ments, such as high deposit requirements or guarantor requirements. To the extent that these

 3   requirements restrict credit access, investment, technology adoption, and welfare, there may be

 4   a strong case for steps to encourage lenders to loosen these borrowing requirements, for exam-

 5   ple by loosening regulatory caps on interest rates, strengthening legal and contract enforcement

 6   institutions to expand the scope for collateralization of debt, or even subsidizing lenders. While

 7   the evidence summarized in Banerjee et al. (2015) suggests both limited take up and limited

 8   impact of expanding credit access through standard microfinance contracts, it is possible that

 9   moving from the very restrictive borrowing requirements in many developing contracts to bor-

10   rowing requirements more typical of developed countries would have a bigger impact.

11       We examine the impact of replacing loans with high down payments and stringent guarantor

12   requirements with asset- collateralized loans, similar to the mortgages and car loans that are

13   common in developed countries. In particular, we studied a Kenyan dairy's saving and credit

14   cooperative which randomly offered different borrowing conditions to different members. Its

15   standard borrowing conditions required that one third of loans be secured with deposits by the

16   borrower, and that the remaining two thirds be secured with cash or shares from guarantors.

17   Allowing borrowers to collateralize loans for water tanks using assets purchased with the loans

18   dramatically increased borrowing. Only 2.4% of farmers borrowed under the savings cooper-

19   ative's standard borrowing conditions. The loan take up rate increased to 23.9% under 25%

20   deposit or guarantor requirements and 75% tank-collateralization. The take-up rate further in-

21   creased to 41.9% when all but 4% of the loan could be collateralized with the tank. Thus more

22   than 90% of those who wished to borrow at the available interest rate were credit-constrained.

23   Results were similar in a separate out-of-sample test.

24       However, we find no evidence that joint liability expands credit access. There was no sta-

25   tistically significant difference in loan take up between farmers offered loans with a 25 percent



                                                     1
26   deposit requirement and those offered the opportunity to substitute guarantors for all but 4

27   percent of the loan value.

28     Defaults did not increase with moderate deposit requirements and asset collateralization. In

29   particular, there were no tank repossessions when 75% of the loan could be collateralized with

30   the tank itself and 25% was collateralized with deposits from the borrower and/or guarantors.

31   Reducing the deposit requirement to 4% with 96% asset-collateralization induced a 0.7% repos-

32   session rate overall, corresponding to a 1.63% repossession rate among the marginal farmers

33   induced to borrow by the lower borrowing requirements. The hypothesis of equal rates of tank

34   repossession under a 4% deposit requirement and under a 25% deposit or guarantor require-

35   ment is rejected at the 5.25% level using a Fisher exact test. Karlan-Zinman tests based on ex

36   post waivers or borrowing requirements suggest that this difference is entirely due to adverse

37   selection, rather than the treatment effects associated with moral hazard.

38     A simple model suggests that under adverse selection, a lender with market power facing

39   interest rate caps, such as the savings and credit cooperative we study, will set deposit require-

40   ments above the socially optimal level even with asset collateralization. To see this, note that at

41   the margin, raising deposit requirements selects out unprofitable borrowers but imposes a cost

42   on credit-constrained inframarginal borrowers, and a profit-maximizing lender will not inter-

43   nalize these costs to inframarginal borrowers. A rough calibration suggests that the cooperative

44   could increase profits by moving to 75% but not 96% asset collateralization. Consistent with the

45   results of the calibration, after learning the results of the program, the lender changed its policy

46   to allow 75% collateralization with the tank, but not to allow 96% collateralization.

47     With regards to investments, we find that those offered the opportunity to collateralize loans

48   with the tanks were more likely to have purchased tanks and had more water storage capacity

49   overall. These results also suggest that improving credit access can influence technology adop-

50   tion (Zeller et al., 1998). Consistent with Devoto et al. (2013), our results suggest that credit

51   provision can contribute to increased access to clean water in the developing world. Children of

52   households offered less restrictive credit terms spent somewhat less time collecting water and


                                                      2
53   tending to livestock and difference-in-difference estimates find that fewer girls in these house-

54   holds were out of school. We find no impact on milk production.

55       The primary contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we extend the literature on asset-

56   collateralized loans in developing countries. Existing literature on transition and developed

57   economies (Aretz, Campello, and Marchica 2016, Calomiris et al. 2016) provides evidence that

58   when institutional reforms at the national level expand collateralization options, borrowing in-

59   creases at both extensive (higher loan takeup) and intensive (more leverage) margins. One such

60   expansion of collateralization options is the enhancement of the ability to collateralize loans

61   with the assets that they are used to purchase ( Assuncao et al. 2014).1 Our context allows iden-

62   tification from randomization at the level of individual loans. The result is a novel estimate of

63   the direct impact on loan uptake of replacing a high-deposit loan with an asset-collateralized,

64   low-deposit loan. Secondly, we measure how repossession rates vary under different loan con-

65   tracts, and use a Karlan-Zinman test to decompose the effect of lower deposit requirements on

66   repossession into moral hazard and adverse selection effects.2 Our model builds on the results

67   of the Karlan-Zinman test to suggest that even after asset-collateralization is allowed, lenders

68   will set deposit requirements which are too high from a social welfare standpoint.

69       We also provide results that contribute to the literature on credit access in the developing

70   world. A large literature in development economics examines the potential for microfinance

71   to expand access to credit, often through joint liability lending (Morduch, 1999; Hermes and

72   Lensink, 2007). We find very large effects of asset collateralization on credit uptake consistent

73   with Feder et al. (1988).

74       The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section two provides background on smallholder

75   dairy farming in the region we study. Section three presents a model with which we interpret

76   the data. Section four explains the program design. Section five explains the data and our

77   empirical specifications. Section six discusses the impact of borrowing requirements on loan

79   overall impacts of relaxing borrowing conditions on loan recovery and tank repossession, and

80   calibrates the model to the data. Section eight discusses the impacts on real outcomes. Section

81   nine concludes by discussing potential policy implications and directions for further research.



82   2     Background

83       WHO and UNICEF estimate that approximately 900 million people lack access to water at

84   their homes (2010), with substantial consequences for global health and human development.

85   We examine the potential of asset-collateralized credit to expand access to large rainwater har-

86   vesting tanks among a population of dairy farmers in an area straddling Kenya's Central and

87   Rift Valley provinces. Because installation of water supply at the household level requires sub-

88   stantial fixed costs, there has been increasing interest in whether extension of credit can help

89   improve access to water (Devoto et al 2011).3

90       Collection of water from distant sources limits water use, including for hand washing and

91   cleaning, with potential negative health consequences (Wang and Hunter, 2010; Esrey 1996).

92   It also imposes a substantial time burden, particularly for women and girls, with potentially

93   negative consequences for schooling.4

94       Dairy farmers in particular benefit from reliable access to water because dairy cattle require a

95   regular water supply (Nicholson (1987), Peden et al. (2007), and Staal et al (2001)). Without easy

96   access to water, the most common means of watering cattle is to take them to a source every

97   two or three days, which is time consuming and can expose cattle to disease (Kristjanson et al.

98   1999).5

99       Rainwater harvesting tanks provide convenient access to water, reducing the need to travel

     4
       In our baseline survey, women report spending 21 minutes per day fetching water, three times as much as men, and
       our enumerators reported that women were typically more eager than their husbands to purchase tanks.
     5
       During the baseline survey, it was reported that farmers spent on average ten hours per week taking their cows to
       the water sources.

100   to collect water and then carry it home. Moreover, rainwater is not subject to contamination by

101   disease-bearing fecal matter. In the area we examine, approximately 30% of farmers are con-

102   nected to piped water systems, but these systems provide water only intermittently, typically

103   three days per week. 70% of farmers do not have any connection to a water system. Historically,

104   many farmers in the area used stone or metal tanks to harvest rainwater or store piped water for

105   days when piped water is not available. Approximately one-quarter of comparison group farm-

106   ers had a water storage tank of more than 2,500-liter capacity at baseline. However, stone tanks

107   are susceptible to cracking, and metal tanks are susceptible to rusting, so neither approach is

108   particularly durable. Lightweight, durable plastic rainwater harvesting tanks were introduced

109   about 10 years prior to the start of the study. These plastic rainwater harvesting tanks are dis-

110   played prominently at agricultural supply dealers in the area and are the dominant choice for

111   farmers obtaining new tanks. Almost all farmers are thus familiar with the product, but since

112   they cost about $320 or 20% of annual household consumption, very few farmers tend to own

113   them.

114       Like most of Kenya's approximately one million smallholder dairy farmers, the farmers in

115   our study sell milk to a dairy cooperative, the Nyala dairy cooperative (although not all are

116   members of the cooperative). The Nyala dairy cooperative performs basic quality tests, cools the

117   milk, and then sells it to a large-scale milk producer for pasteurization and sale to the national

118   market. It keeps track of milk deliveries and pays farmers monthly. During the time period we

119   study, selling to the Nyala dairy was more lucrative for farmers than selling on the local market

120   or to another dairy, which would have involved higher transport costs.6

121       The Nyala dairy cooperative has an associated savings and credit association (SACCO). These

122   are widespread in Kenya, with total membership of almost five percent of the population.7 SAC-
      6
        Casaburi and Macchiavello (2014) examine a different Kenyan context in which farmers sell to dairies even though
        the dairy pays a lower price than the local market, arguing that farmers value the savings opportunity generated by
        the monthly, rather than daily, payments provided by dairies.
      7
        Until 2012, many dairy cooperatives ran SACCOs as a service to their members, with the dairy cooperative's man-
        agement also overseeing the SACCO. The 2012 SACCO act made cooperatives separate farming and banking activi-
        ties. SACCOs previously run by a dairy cooperative became a separate legal entity but have tended to retain strong
        links with the dairy cooperative.




                                                               5
123   COs are typically limited to a 12% annual interest rate, but in some cases they can charge 14%

124   annually (SASRA, 2013). In practice, this is interpreted as 1% monthly interest and 1.2% monthly

125   interest. As a result, SACCOs are typically conservative in their lending, imposing stringent

126   borrowing requirements.

127     In the SACCO we examine, the borrower must have savings deposited in the SACCO worth

128   1/3 of the total amount of the loan and must find up to three guarantors willing to collateralize

129   the remaining 2/3 of the loan with savings and/or shares in the cooperative. Borrowers and

130   guarantors are paid the same standard 3% quarterly interest on funds deposited in the SACCO

131   as are other depositors. These terms are fairly typical. The Nyala SACCO offers loans for a va-

132   riety of purposes, mostly school fees and emergency loans in the case of illness and agricultural

133   loans in kind (advances on feed). In the year prior to the study, it made just 292 cash loans to

134   members, averaging KSh 25,000 ($315).

135     In order to examine how potential borrowers respond to different potential loan contracts, we

136   focus on an environment in which lending is feasible. Several features of the institutional en-

137   vironment are favorable to lending. First, farmers who borrow agree to let the SACCO deduct

138   loan repayments from the dairy's payments to the farmer for milk. This provides a very easy

139   mechanism for collecting debt that not only has low administrative cost for the lender but also

140   effectively makes repayment the default option for borrowers, instead of requiring them to ac-

141   tively take steps to repay debt. Second, the dairy paid a higher price for milk than alternative

142   buyers, providing farmers with an incentive to maintain their relationship with the dairy. Fi-

143   nally, the SACCO may have more legitimacy in collecting debt than would an outside for-profit

144   lender.

145     The physical characteristics of rainwater harvesting tanks also make them well-suited as col-

146   lateral. The tanks are bulky and have to be installed next to the user's house, so a lender seeking

147   to repossess a tank can find them easily. Moreover, tanks have no moving parts and are durable,

148   so they preserve much of their value through the repossession and resale process. Finally, while

149   tanks are too large to be easily transported by hand for more than a short distance, a lender


                                                      6
150   seeking to repossess them can easily load them onto a truck.



151   3     Model

152   With full information there would be no need for collateral, deposits, or guarantors, and bor-

153   rowers with a tank valuation up to a certain amount would get loans. However, in the presence

154   of asymmetric information about valuations on the one hand, and outcome realizations on the

155   other, adverse selection and moral hazard preclude attainment of the first best. In order to help

156   motivate the empirical work in subsequent sections, we build a simple model in which a lender

157   can respond to such imperfections by introducing non-price rationing mechanisms into credit

158   contracts, but in doing so fails to achieve the information-constrained social optimum. .

159       In Section 3.1 we lay out the assumptions . We allow risk-averse potential borrowers to vary

160   in their valuation of tanks, and in initial wealth. Given their wealth and tank valuations as well

161   as the deposit required by the lender, potential borrowers choose whether to borrow to buy a

162   tank, in which case they must use some of their wealth for the deposit, constraining their first-

163   period consumption. Remaining wealth can be used for first-period consumption or additional

164   savings for period 2. Borrowers then receive stochastic income and choose whether to repay the

165   loan or allow the lender to repossess the tank.

166       In section 3.2, we first consider the problem of a borrower deciding whether to repay given

167   the borrower's first period savings ( defined to include the deposit ), tank valuation, and income

168   realization. We then solve backwards to the problem of a potential borrower deciding whether

169   to take out a loan given their initial wealth, their tank valuation, and the required deposit. We

170   show that if potential borrowers are credit constrained, high deposit requirements will have a

171   selection effect on repayment in which they screen out low-valuation or low-wealth borrowers

172   who are relatively unlikely to repay. High deposit requirements will also have a treatment effect

173   on repayment conditional on borrowing, lowering the threshold tank valuation above which

174   borrowers choose to repay the loan for each possible period-two income realization.


                                                        7
175     In section 3.3, we work back further to the problem of the lender choosing the size of the

176   required deposit. To reflect our institutional context, we consider a monopoly lender with ex-

177   ogenously fixed interest rates. We show that, since in the presence of adverse selection, a lender

178   fails to internalize the cost to credit-constrained inframarginal borrowers due to a high deposit

179   requirement, stricter deposit requirements than would be socially optimal are chosen.



180   3.1     Assumptions


181



182     Below we describe key assumptions of the model in addition to the basic framework. These

183   key assumptions are designed to ensure that the support of first-period wealth, second-period

184   income, and tank valuation generate, for any deposit requirement, some marginal borrowers

185   and some inframarginal credit-constrained borrowers. We also make some assumptions to as-

186   sure that we focus on interesting/relevant cases. For example, we assume that the distribution

187   of shocks is sufficiently wide that some borrowers will default in some states of the world. We

188   also make some technical assumptions to ensure the profit function is well-behaved and contin-

189   uous.

190     Borrower i's valuation of the tank is denoted θi . θi is private information encompassing util-

191   ity benefits of the tank, time savings, and any dairy farming productivity and risk-reduction

192   benefits. (These are likely to vary among farmers, for example, due to distance from other wa-

193   ter sources, availability of household labor, and taste for clean water.) There is a continuum of

194   potential borrowers, with water tank valuation continuously distributed over the interval [θ, θ]

195   according to some cumulative distribution function F (θ) with a probability mass function that

196   is continuous on its support. Potential borrowers value consumption of a composite good c as

197   well as water tanks, with preferences for potential borrower i represented by a utility function

198   U (θi , c) = u(c1 ) + u(c2 ) + θi I2 (T ), where u is at least three-times continuously differentiable,

199   u0 > 0, u00 < 0, limc→0 u0 = ∞ and limc→∞ u0 = 0 and I2 (T ) is an indicator for owning a tank

200   at period t = 2 . c1 and c2 represent non-tank consumption in each of the two periods, and we

                                                        8
201   impose the constraint c1 , c2 ≥ 0.8 For simplicity, discounting and net present discounted value

202   weightings are set aside, and we assume utility does not depend on tank ownership in period

203   1, I1 (T ).
                                                                                                      
204       Potential borrower i has an initial wealth wi at period t = 1, drawn from the interval W , W

205   according to the distribution Fw (·) which is continuously differentiable. The realized value

206   of w is private information, known only to the borrower. Income at period t = 2 is denoted
                                                          
207   yi , and drawn stochastically from the interval Y , Y . In order to ensure differentiabilty of the

208   profit function, we assume that yi is drawn from a uniform distribution and that Y is large

209   enough that a borrower with second-period income Y has higher wealth after repayment than

210   a borrower with second period income Y has after repossession. Formally, Y > Y + RT P.

211   The final assumption we invoke to ensure differentiability is assumption A, described in the

212   appendix. 9 The realized value of y is also private information, known only to the borrower. The

213   distributions of initial wealth, water tank valuation and income are independent, have positive

214   densities throughout their supports.

215       Potential borrowers can purchase tanks at price P in period t = 1 through a contract with

216   the lender in which they must repay RT P at t = 2, where RT is the gross interest rate. If they

217   purchase a tank, then in period t = 2 they choose whether to repay the loan or allow the tank to

218   be repossessed. We assume that the support of θ is wide enough that some potential borrowers

219   are not willing to purchase tanks at full cost, but every potential borrower would purchase a

220   tank if it were free. In particular, assume that 0 < θ, and that the potential borrower with lowest

221   endowment W and valuation θ prefers consumption to the tank, and thus when yi is unknown
      8
        Because borrowers weigh utility from non-tank consumption against the constant utility of tank consumption, our
        assumptions on the marginal utility of non-tank consumption are insufficient to ensure that this constraint binds.
        We could ensure this, however, by assuming limc→0 u(c) = −∞.
      9
        Assumption A rules out a particular pathological behavior of the optimal savings and default cutoff functions. The
        uniformity and wide support of y ensures that utility is single-peaked in savings. Were this condition to fail, it is
        conceivable optimal savings would move discontinuously. Were it not for the possibility of this discontinuity, the
        results would hold for any distribution with continuous pdf and finite support. Note also that while we use the
        example of a uniform distribution, single-peakedness is ensured for a wider class of distributions. One sufficient
        condition is wide support (Y > Y + RT P ) and relative flatness. This condition is satisfied for truncated normal
        distributions with variance sufficiently large relative to their support, β distributions with small parameters, and
        certain triangular and trapezoidal distributions.




                                                                9
222   will not purchase the tank even if somehow assured of receiving the best possible income draw

223   in the next period, Y .10

224        If farmers borrow to buy a tank, they must make a deposit of at least the lender’s requirement

225   D ∈ [0, P ], which earns a gross interest rate RD . The lender chooses the required deposit,

226   but borrowers take it as a parameter. Potential borrowers may also allocate wealth to savings

227   and they earn gross interest RD on any saving. Gross savings, including the value of the tank

228   deposit, are denoted S, so for those who borrow to purchase a tank, overall savings S ≥ D,

229   while those who do not purchase a tank are not subject to this constraint.

230        To ensure that the model reflects a market with credit-constrained borrowers and allows for

231   the possibility of adverse selection effects on equilibrium outcomes, we make two assumptions.

232   The first is that, for any deposit requirement D, there exist marginal borrowers. Specifically, we

233   assume that the support of W and θ are wide enough that a farmer with period-1 wealth W and

234   tank valuation θ will prefer not to borrow even when D=0, and a farmer with period-1 wealth W

235   and tank valuation θ will prefer to purchase a tank even when D=P. The second assumption is

236   that at least some borrowers are credit constrained for any deposit requirement D. Specifically,

237   we assume the deposit requirement causes some potential borrowers to be credit constrained if

238   they undertake the tank investment, in the sense of constraining their first period consumption

239   below the level that would be optimal were the deposit not mandated. Since marginal utility is

240   decreasing in consumption and consumption is always higher under default than repayment, a

241   sufficient assumption for there to exist a positive measure of agents who are credit constrained

242   is u0 (W ) > RD E(u0 (yi − RT P )). We call borrowers who satisfy u00 (w) > RD E(u00 (yi − RT P ))

243   ”definitely credit-constrained.”

244        To ensure that a nonzero mass of credit-constrained farmers will choose to borrow, we assume

245   that for any D, there is some wi such that u0 (wi − D) > RD E(u0 (yi + RD D − RT P )), and an agent

246   with initial wealth wi and tank valuation θ −  for some  > 0, will choose to borrow a tank.

247   Liquidity constraints make holding wealth in the SACCO costly and are thus consistent with our
      10
           This condition is assumed to hold for any reasonable deposit requirement, i.e. any D between 0 and P.



                                                                 10
248   empirical result that greater deposit requirements reduce loan take up dramatically. However,

249   the model also admits individuals who are not credit constrained, and for sufficiently high wi

250   these individuals will optimally choose S > D (such that higher c1 could have been chosen).

251   We make final assumptions that W and Y are large enough so that repayment of loan principal

252   and interest is always feasible ex ante, W RD + Y > RT P, and initial payment of the deposit is

253   always feasible W > P.11 This assumption is more accurately thought of as a simplification: in

254   the case that wealth levels are such that some farmers may find themselves unable to pay off

255   the tank, our assumptions on u are such that those farmers will never borrow, regardless of the

256   level of D, and thus we can ignore them for the purpose of the model and restrict our attention

257   to those farmers for whom repayment is always feasible ex ante.

258        There is a limited liability constraint so that if the borrower fails to repay, the only assets which

259   the lender can seize are the pledged deposit D and the tank. If the tank is repossessed, it is sold

260   for δP 12 and the lender is repaid the principal and interest, as well as a repossession fee, KB .

261   We assume KB is small enough that the borrower has higher wealth under repossession than

262   under repayment. Leftover proceeds from the sale of the tank, if they exist, are returned to the

263   borrower. We let DF denote the deposit level at which the principal, interest, and repossession

264   fees are exactly covered by the deposit and tank sale proceeds. We also allow for the possibility

265   that default creates an additional utility cost M ≥ 0 for borrowers, because it may negatively

266   affect their relationship with the cooperative, which pays a premium price for milk, and which

267   is owned by fellow farmers.

268        The lender is a monopolist with cost of capital RD .13 The lender chooses a required deposit
      11
         Farmers also own land, and while land markets are thin and transaction costs for formal sales are high, some sales
         and rental transactions do take place. (For a discussion of land tenure, see Place and Migot-Adholla, 1998; Barrows
         and Roth 1990).
      12
         The assumption that δ ≤ 1 is natural in the case of a scaled-up permanent program, but because tanks were made
         available at the wholesale price under the program we examine, and because the program was available to only
         some farmers, the resale value of a repossessed tank could potentially be somewhat greater than P in our context,
         and indeed one repossessed tank sold for more than the wholesale price. We assume, however, that δ is not so large
         that potential borrowers can profit by borrowing and allowing repossession (δ ≤ RT is one sufficient condition for
         this).
      13
         The SACCO may have a small amount of capital available at very low cost from its earnings from transaction fees
         on payments to farmers, but we will treat its cost of capital at the margin as the 3% per quarter it pays to depositors.




                                                                  11
269   value D∗ to maximize expected profits. Reflecting the regulatory cap on interest rates faced by

270   SACCOs, the gross interest rate that the lender charges to borrowers is fixed at RT . (Empiri-

271   cally, the net interest rate corresponding to RT is the 1% per month interest rate charged by the

272   SACCO.) We assume that the lender can only offer a single variety of contracts. As we discuss in

273   detail in section 3.4, there are several reasons to believe that a model in which the lender offered

274   a menu of contracts would not reflect empirical reality.

275        Denote the total cost of repossession to the lender as K.14 (In the program we examine, farmers

276   were charged a KSh 4,000 repossession fee, but we estimate the full cost of repossession for the

277   lender at KSh 8,500, even excluding intangible costs like the costs of bad publicity and the risk

278   of vandalism, so the empirical case corresponds to K = 8, 500 and KB = 4, 000.) We assume

279   KB < K as this would reasonably be expected as a property of the optimal contract, since

280   because farmers are risk averse, it will generally not be optimal for borrowers to fully bear the

281   risk associated with negative income shocks that lead to tank repossession.                 15



282        Below, we first solve potential borrowers’ problems of whether to repay conditional on having

283   borrowed and whether to borrow given the D chosen by the lender. We then solve for the profit

284   maximizing D∗ for the lender, given borrower behavior.



285   3.2     The Borrowers’ Problem


286   We first consider the problem of a borrower deciding whether to repay a loan given the deposit

287   D, their tank valuation θi ,, gross savings S, and second period income yi . We then solve back-

288   wards to the first-period problem of a potential borrower deciding whether to purchase a tank

289   given their wealth and tank valuation.

290   Proposition 1. Under the conditions on the distribution of tank valuation assumed earlier, a marginal

291   level of income exists, denoted by y R (θi , S, D), at which a borrower with valuation θi is indifferent
      14
         For example, rental costs for a truck to move the tank, the time of staff members and the security guard who is
         present at repossessions, management time, the risk of negative publicity or vandalism by a disgruntled borrower.
      15
         Moreover, one could imagine that if the contract imposed severe penalties on borrowers during periods when they
         had negative income shocks and had to allow tank repossession, some borrowers might react in ways that would
         create large costs for the SACCO, for example vandalizing tanks prior to repossession.


                                                              12
292   between forgoing consumption in order to make the repayment and allowing the tank to be repossessed.

293   yiR is continuously differentiable with respect to all of its arguments, strictly decreasing in θi and S, and

294   weakly decreasing in D. When D is such that all repossessions result in negative equity, yiR is strictly

295   decreasing in D.16

296        Proof: see appendix.

297        When choosing whether to repay the loan, the borrower trades off utility from other consump-

298   tion against utility from the tank. Since utility of consumption is concave, the cost of foregone

299   consumption from repaying the tank loan is decreasing in second-period resources, and thus

300   S and y. Higher θ makes repayment more attractive. y R defines a repayment probability that

301   is increasing in S. In general, y R does not need to be within [Y , Y ] for every (θi , S, D) tuple;

302   however our assumptions ensure that there do exist such tuples at which repayment occurs.

303   Corollary 2. For definitely credit-constrained borrowers who have S = D, the threshold level of income

304   for repayment yiR is strictly decreasing in the deposit requirement even if negative equity lending does

305   not occur.

306        This follows immediately from the fact that yiR is decreasing in S. Note that higher D may

307   make the potential credit-constrained borrower worse off overall by constraining c1 , but it in-

308   creases second period assets, which allows higher c2 . Diminishing marginal utility of consump-

309   tion then favours repayment once the loan has been made. In the negative equity case, higher S

310   (via D) increases c2 under repayment,but has no effect on c2 under repossession, so this effect is

311   even stronger.

312        Having solved for repayment behavior conditional on borrowing and saving, we can now

313   solve for borrowing and saving behavior as functions of D and w.

314   Proposition 3. Potential borrowers will borrow if θi > θ∗ (D, wi ), where θ∗ is continuously differen-
      16
           Note for this section’s propositions that θR , yiR , θ∗ , and u may fail to be differentiable at D = DF . This is because
           utility in the case of repossession may not be differentiable with respect to D at this point. Thus this section’s proofs
           all assume D 6= DF . However, all of the propositions still hold at D = DF in the following sense: because all of
           the aforementioned functions are continuous at D = DF and continuously differentiable around D = DF , if a
           proposition states, for example, that a function f is weakly increasing in D, we have shown that its derivative is
           non-positive where it exists, and thus there exists some  > 0 such that for all D ∈ (DF − , DF + ), f (D) ≥ f (DF )
           if D < DF and f (D) ≤ f (DF ) if D > DF .


                                                                     13
315   tiable in D and wi for almost all farmers. Among these farmers, θ∗ is weakly increasing in D for all

316   farmers, strictly increasing in D for some farmers, and decreasing in wi . Hence, the repossession rate will

317   be:                              R R θ̄                    R (θ, S, D))f (θ)f (w)dwdθ

                                                    w [1   − Fθ (θ∗ (D, w))]fw (w)dw

318     Proof: See Appendix.

319     Potential borrowers compare the expected utility from borrowing to purchase the tank against

320   the expected utility from not borrowing. The expected utility from borrowing depends on the

321   distribution of income draws, and the subsequent optimal choice regarding whether to repay the

322   loan and thus retain the tank. In particular, in any y realisation where borrowers subsequently

323   choose to default on the loan, they would have been better off by not borrowing.

324     Borrowing to purchase the tank reduces consumption for all income realizations, and poten-

325   tial borrowers thus consider the gains from owning the tank against the cost of foregone con-

326   sumption. Given the assumptions on the support of the cumulative distribution function F (θi ),

327   there will be an interval of wealth levels for which a marginal potential borrower, with valuation

328   θ < θ∗ (D, w) < θ, exists. This borrower is indifferent whether to borrow. Potential borrowers

329   with greater valuations will borrow while those with lower valuations will not. There may be

330   some wealth levels below which even those with θ = θ̄ do not borrow (and some wealth level

331   above which everyone borrows). However, our assumptions ensure that θ∗ (w) ∈ [θ, θ] for a

332   nonzero mass of potential borrowers. The mass of potential borrowers who decide to borrow is

333   given by
                                                       Z    w
                                      τ (D) = 1 −               Fθ (θ∗ (D, w))fw (w)dw.                       (2)

334   Proposition 4. Potential borrowers with θi > θ∗ (D, w) who are definitely credit constrained will have

335   S = D, and would be strictly better off with a lower required deposit. Moreover, if repossessions are

336   negative equity, potential borrowers with a nonzero chance of default are better off with a lower deposit

337   irrespective of whether they are credit constrained. In the case of positive equity or zero probability of

338   default, borrowers who are not credit constrained are indifferent to marginal changes in D. Trivially,


                                                                  14
339   those with θi < θ∗ (D) are also indifferent to marginal changes in D since they do not borrow.

340     Proof: By definition , those who are definitely credit constrained have


                                  u0 (wi − D) > RD E u0 (yi + RD D − RT P ) .
                                                                           
                                                                                                        (3)



341     Since yi + RD S − RT P is a borrower’s consumption level under repayment, and borrowers

342   have higher period 2 consumption in the case of default than in the case of repayment, u0 (yi +

343   RD S − RT P ) represents an upper bound on a borrower’s marginal period two utility. Thus

344   definitely credit constrained borrowers have



                                 u0 (c1 (wi , D)) > RD E u0 (c2 (wi , D, θi , S = D) .
                                                                                    
                                                                                                        (4)


345     The rest of the proof is immediate from Claim 4 in the proof of proposition 3 (see Appendix

346   A).

347     u0 (yi + RD S − RT P ) is trivially decreasing in S for S > 0. Furthermore u0 (wi − S) is trivially

348   increasing in S for S < wi . Thus definitely credit constrained borrowers maximize expected

349   utility by setting S=D, and are strictly better off with a lower deposit.

350     To see the intuition for the impacts of changes in D on non-credit-constrained borrowers , note

351   first that under negative-equity repossession, c2 is decreasing in D since more wealth is seized

352   when D increases. To see that non-credit-constrained borrowers with θi > θ∗ are indifferent

353   to changes in D when default never occurs or is positive equity, note first that unconstrained

354   borrowers who don’t default ultimately recover all of RD D and thus are unaffected by changes

355   in D. Similarly, unconstrained borrowers who do default also recover all of RD D when D ≥

356   DF . The third result, that those who do not borrow are indifferent to marginal changes in the

357   required deposit, trivially follows from the fact that they do not borrow, and thus do not put

358   down a deposit.

359   3.3      The Lender's Problem


360   Having solved the borrower’s problem, we can consider a profit-maximizing lender’s problem

361   of choosing the optimal required deposit D∗ .17 Denote the lender’s net profit per customer who

362   repays a loan without a tank repossession as Πr , equal to the interest paid by the borrower

363   minus the cost of borrowing the capital to finance the loan, RD P .



                                                      Πr = (RT − RD )P                                              (5)


364        To calculate the payoff to the lender when a borrower fails to repay a loan and the tank has

365   to be repossessed, note that the lender will seize the required deposit and the accrued interest,

366   RD D, sell the repossessed tank for δP , and incur the cost of repossession, K, in addition to

367   the previous outlay on borrowing the capital for the loan, RD P . It will have to return to the

368   borrower any proceeds of the tank sale net of interest and repossession fees, max{RD D + δP −

369   RT P − KB , 0}. Hence, the lender’s profit from a loan, Πd , if the loan is defaulted upon and the

370   tank is repossessed is

           The SACCO has major market power, so for simplicity we model it as a monopolist. While other lenders serve
           rural Kenya, the SACCO’s unique relationship with the farmers in our sample gives it an effective monopoly on
           this particular type of loan for dairy farmers in the area.



                                                               16
374     Let E(Π(D)) denote expected total profits, which the lender maximizes over D. On the inten-

375   sive margin, an increase in D will (weakly) reduce tank repossession risk for existing borrowers

376   since borrowers will be less willing to allow tanks to be repossessed if they are required to

377   make a larger deposit. Intuitively, this is because a larger deposit means that they have more

378   resources in period t = 2 from which to finance consumption, reducing u0 (c2 ). Under negative

379   equity repossession, default also falls in D as it involves greater foregone consumption. This

380   is the treatment effect of D. On the extensive margin, an increase in the required deposit will

381   reduce the total number of loans and thus both the total profit from loans with no repossession

382   and the expected loss from repossessions. This is the selection effect.

383     A greater deposit also directly reduces the lender's losses if borrowers fail to repay and pro-

384   ceeds from the tank sale are inadequate to cover the borrower's principal, interest, and tank

385   repossession fee obligations. This never occurs in our data.

391   A proof that this derivative exists and is continuous except at the two points mentioned below

392   is given in appendix A. In maximising profit, the lender will not consider the welfare effects

393   of raising the required deposit on inframarginal customers who would have borrowed in any

394   case. Customers who are credit-constrained or have negative equity suffer a reduction in utility

395   from an increase in the required deposit, which does not factor into the lender’s choice of the

396   required deposit rate. This creates a wedge between the private and social benefits from raising

397   the deposit requirement that will tend to make lenders choose deposit requirements that are too

398   high from a social point of view. As long as the lender's profits are continuously differentiable

399   in the deposit requirement at D∗ (and thus the FOC holds), reducing the deposit ratio slightly

400   from the lender's profit maximizing level will generate a second-order reduction in profits, but

401   a first order increase in welfare for infra-marginal borrowers.

402     There are two points at which profits could fail to be continuously differentiable in D. One

403   of these points is the minimal deposit level at which all of the borrowers repay, D̃. Lemma 1

404   demonstrates that D∗ < D̃.

405   Lemma 1. The profit-maximizing deposit ratio will be such that there is some non-zero probability of

406   repossession.

407     Proof: see appendix.

408     Intuitively, this lemma follows from the fact that if there were zero repossessions, the lender

409   could lower the deposit, increasing the number of borrowers with a negligible increase in the

410   repossession rate. The other point at which profits could fail to be continuously differentiable in


                                                                18
411   D is the point,DF , at which a borrower's net equity after the resale of a tank is zero. Specifically,

412   DF is the point at which the deposit plus the resale value of the tank just covers the debt on the

413   tank plus interest and the repossession fee, KB . Increases in D will increase loan recovery in

414   the event of repossession only for D less than DF . Above DF , increases in D will affect profits

415   only by changing the probability of tank repossession. By Lemma 1, profits are continuously

416   differentiable with respect to D over the interval [0, D̃) except at DF .

417        Thus for D∗ 6= DF , a small change in the deposit will create a second-order change in prof-

418   its for the lender, but a first-order loss in welfare for infra-marginal borrowers. This generates

419   our main result that in the presence of adverse selection generated by heterogeneous tank valua-

420   tion, the lender chooses deposit requirements that are too stringent from a social point of view.18

421


422   Proposition 5. If the profit-maximizing D∗ is not DF , (i.e., if RD D∗ + δP − KB − RT P 6= 0) or 0,

423   then reducing the deposit requirement from the profit maximising level D∗ increases social welfare.


424   Proof. Social welfare is the sum of borrowers’ utilities and lender's profit:


425                                                   E(Π(D)) + Utotal (D),


426   where Utotal (D) is the total expected utility of all the borrowers, given deposit requirement D.

427        If RD D + δP − RT P − KB 6= 0 (i.e., D 6= DF ) and D∗ 6= 0, then D∗ is characterized by the
                                                                                 ∂E(Π(D))
428   lender's FOC, since lemma 1 implies D∗ < P. This implies                     ∂D       = 0. As we showed before,

429   definitely credit-constrained inframarginal borrowers strictly prefer lower deposits, and other
      18
           From the standpoint of an unconstrained social planner who seeks to maximize social welfare, the first best would
           be to allocate tanks to every farmer who has a sufficiently high valuation. Repossessions consume resources, so
           would never take place. This could be implemented by setting required deposits to zero, and only allowing high
           valuation farmers to borrow. Further, on account of risk aversion through concave u(c) it is optimal for farmers to
           be fully insured against income shocks. Consumption utility then becomes deterministic.
           One could also consider a mechanism design problem for a planner constrained by lack of information on indi-
           vidual specific tank valuations and income realizations. Such a constrained planner would face the problem of
           designing a mechanism in which potential borrowers would reveal their tank valuations and income shocks. We
           will not attempt to solve this mechanism design problem, but the result that a small reduction in the deposit from
           the profit maximizing level will improve social welfare demonstrates that even a constrained social planner could
           generate higher welfare than a monopolist.




                                                                  19
                                                                           ∂Utotal (D)
430   inframarginal borrowers weakly prefer lower deposits:                   ∂D         < 0. Given the assumptions

431   on the support of w and θ, there will be a nonzero-measure group of inframarginal borrowers

432   who are definitely credit constrained. Potential borrowers who do not borrow will be indifferent

433   to changes in D. Hence the derivative of social welfare with respect to D is negative:

                                      ∂E(D)       ∂Utotal (D)       ∂Utotal (D)
434
                                       ∂D     +      ∂D         =      ∂D         < 0.


435   Thus, a social planner that takes borrower welfare into account will set a strictly lower D than

436   would a profit-maximizing lender.


437     Since the deposit is greater than socially optimal, the equilibrium fails to achieve the information-

438   constrained social optimum. A social planner without information on borrowers’ types could

439   still increase welfare by lowering the deposit.

440     Note that the lender’s first order condition simplifies considerably in the empirically relevant

441   special case where the deposit plus the resale value of the tank is great enough that the borrower

442   has positive equity. Hence, in this case Ld is not a function of D, thus L0d (D) = 0 and the FOC

443   simplifies and can be written as:



                                ∂θ∗

444     Here, the left hand side is the ratio of marginal borrowers to marginal tank repossessions.

445   The marginal tank repossession term consists of two components; marginal borrowers having

446   positive default probability, and inframarginal borrowers having increased default probability.

447   In the empirical section we will measure this ratio. At the optimal deposit set by the lender, this

448   ratio equals the ratio of the net costs of a tank repossession to the profits from a successful loan.

449   Ld > Πr and thus this ratio must exceed one, since otherwise even loans that are defaulted upon

450   are profitable overall.

451   3.4   Discussion


452   The model could be extended in various ways. One extension which may seem natural is to

453   allow the lender to offer a menu of contracts, with varying interest rate/deposit requirement

454   pairings. We have several reasons to believe that a model with a menu of contracts would not,

455   in fact, be realistic. First, both before and after the experiment, the SACCO only offered a single

456   set of terms for loan contracts. Additionally, the low cap on interest rates drastically limits the

457   scope for variation in contract terms. As discussed below, the 10% inflation rate meant that SAC-

458   COs could charge no more than 2% real annual interest. The 3% quarterly nominal rate paid to

459   depositors in the SACCO further limits the range of contracts that would have been profitable–

460   even with no defaults–to a .5 percentage point window. In an equilibrium in which borrowers

461   choose different deposit-interest rate pairs, all borrowers with positive deposits would still ex-

462   perience distortions.

463     Additionally, we have treated the distribution of income as independent across potential bor-

464   rowers, but it is also worth considering the case in which yi = yc + yii where yc is a common

465   shock, for example, due to weather or milk prices, and yii is an idiosyncratic borrower-specific

466   shock and the common shock is observable, but idiosyncratic shocks are private information

467   for borrowers. In this case, requiring all borrowers to be insured against aggregate risk would

468   reduce repossessions by addressing the moral hazard that arises if borrowers allow tank repos-

469   session during periods of negative shocks, even when this is socially inefficient, because they

470   do not face the full costs of repossession. Borrowing decisions will also be improved because

471   borrowers will face more of the full costs of borrowing, including the cost of the risk of default.

472   Hence this will be part of optimal contract design. The optimal response to a common shock is

473   thus insurance, rather than a greater deposit requirement.

474     The model could also be extended to include guarantor requirements in addition to deposit

475   requirements. Depending on the assumptions, substituting guarantor contracts for deposit re-

476   quirements might or might not increase access to credit.The assumptions of the model ensure

477   that there are farmers with low enough tank valuations that they choose not to borrow but

                                                      21
478   enough initial wealth that they would not be credit constrained if they did borrow. They also

479   ensure that there are farmers with too little initial wealth to borrow, but high enough tank valua-

480   tion that they would borrow if they were not credit constrained. Imagine farmers could perfectly

481   contract with each other in the sense of being able to observe each other’s initial wealth, tank

482   valuations, and income, and fully enforce all contracts. Then regardless of whether the lender

483   offers a formal guarantor contract, high-wealth, low-valuation farmers would act as guarantors

484   to low-wealth, high-valuation farmers. Even if the lender does not offer a guarantor contract, de

485   facto guarantors could lend low-wealth borrowers money to pay down their deposit. Thus un-

486   der this assumption, replacing a deposit requirement with a guarantor contract from the lender

487   will not affect loan uptake. Similarly, if farmers cannot contract with each other independent of

488   the existence of a formal guarantor contract, then loan uptake will be the same with or without

489   such a contract, since no one will be willing to extend a guarantee.

490     On the other hand, if the existence of a formal guarantor contract improves farmers’ ability

491   to contract with each other, then such an arrangement will affect outcomes. Formal guarantor

492   agreements could improve farmers’ ability to contract with each other if, for example, informal

493   borrowers had the option to default on informal lenders by choosing to use their loan funds for

494   something other than purchasing the tank (i.e, further increasing first-period consumption), and

495   if lenders were then unable to extract repayment in the second period. One scenario in which

496   this would be the case is one in which would-be guarantors were concerned that borrowers

497   might ask for ”loans” only to abscond with their borrowed funds and move out of town. This

498   option would be rendered impossible by the existence of a formal guarantor contract which

499   would ensure that the informal borrower actually puts the guarantor’s money into buying the

500   tank. Thus formal contracts would incentivize repayment (and mitigate adverse selection of

501   informal borrowers with no intention of repaying) by introducing the cost of a lost tank for

502   those who default.

503     However, while formal guarantor contracts impact individual outcomes in this intermediate

504   case, they need not necessarily increase total demand for loans in general equilibrium. High-



                                                      22
505   wealth, low-valuation farmers who are near-indifferent toward borrowing but do borrow in the

506   case of no guarantor contracts may choose not to borrow if it is possible for them to act as guar-

507   antors. Such farmers may prefer to act as guarantors for high-valuation low-wealth borrowers,

508   and in doing so may lose enough period-one wealth to render borrowing no longer worthwhile.

509   The net effect could be that all borrowers who enter the market when guarantor contracts are

510   introduced are offset by guarantors leaving the market, or even that more guarantors leave the

511   market than borrowers enter.

512        Thus it is an empirical question whether guarantor contracts impact outcomes, as theory

513   would predict different outcomes depending on the nature of contracting in a given empirical

514   context.



515   4       Project Design and Implementation

516        This section first discusses features of the loan contracts that were common across treatment

517   arms and then discusses differences across treatment arms that were used to estimate the impact

518   of borrowing requirements on loan take up and on tank repossession and to separately measure

519   moral hazard and adverse selection. (We focus on the main sample and describe some slight

520   differences in the out-of-sample group at the end of the section.)



521   4.1       Common Loan Features Across Treatment Arms


522   All farmers in the project were offered a loan to purchase a 5,000-liter water tank. As a bulk

523   purchaser of the tank, the SACCO was able to purchase tanks at the wholesale price and get free

524   delivery to the borrowers' farm. In the main sample, the wholesale price was KSh 4,000 (about

525   $53) below the retail price and the SACCO passed these savings on to borrowers.19 The price

526   of the tank to the farmers, denoted P in the model, was KSh 24,000 (about $320), or roughly
      19
           In this paper we use the dollar to Kenyan Shilling exchange rate at the time of the study which was approximately
           $1:KSh 75.



                                                                 23
527   20 percent of annual household consumption. Borrowers also incurred installation costs for

528   guttering systems and base construction that averaged about KSh 3,400, or 14% of the cost of

529   the tank.

530        All farmers received a hand-delivered letter with the loan offer, and were given 45 days to de-

531   cide whether to take up the loan. All loans were for KSh 24,000 and required an up-front deposit

532   of at least KSh 1,000. The interest rate was 1% per month, charged on a declining balance.20

533        Since the inflation rate is about 10% per annum, the real interest rate was very low. The 1%

534   monthly interest rate is standard for SACCOs but is below the commercial rate. All treatment

535   arms were charged a 1% late fee per month. The interest rate on a late balance was in the

536   ballpark of the market range, but since processing late payments was labor intensive and costly

537   for the lender, the lender was better off when borrowers paid on time. The amount due each

538   month was automatically deducted from the payment owed to the farmer for milk sales. If milk

539   payments fell short of the scheduled loan payment, the farmer was required to pay the balance

540   in cash. Debt service represented 8.4% of average household expenditures and 11.4% of median

541   expenditures at the beginning of the loan term.

542        Collection procedures for late loans were as follows. When a farmer fell two full months of

543   principal (i.e. KSh 2,000) behind, the SACCO sent a letter warning of pending default and pro-

544   vided two months to pay off the late amount and fees. The letter was hand-delivered to the

545   farmer and followed up with monthly phone reminders. If the late payment was still outstand-

546   ing after a further 60 days, the SACCO applied any deposits by the borrower or guarantors to

547   the balance.

548        In arms other than the 100% secured joint liability arm (described below), it is possible that

549   a balance would remain due after this. If a balance still remained, the SACCO gave the farmer
      20
           Charging interest on a declining balance is common in Kenya. Borrowers repaid a fixed proportion of the prin-
           cipal each month plus interest on the remaining principal. Borrowers were scheduled to repay KSh 1,000 of their
           principal back each month for 24 months. In the first month, when farmers had not repaid any of the KSh 24,000
           principal, borrowers were scheduled to repay KSh 1240. In the second month, farmers were scheduled to repay KSh
           1230; in the third month they were scheduled to repay KSh 1220; and in the final month farmers were scheduled to
           repay the final KSh 1,000 of their principal and KSh 10 in interest.



                                                                24
550   an additional 15 days to clear it and waited to see if the next month's milk deliveries would

551   be enough to cover the balance. If not, the SACCO would repossess the tank, charging a KSh

552   4,000 fee for administrative costs to the borrower from the proceeds of any tank sale. KB was

553   thus KSh 4,000. The full administrative costs associated with repossessing the tank, including

554   the cost of hiring a truck, staff time, and security, was approximately KSh 8,500, so K should

555   be considered to be at least KSh 8,500 and likely larger, since the lender also risked negative

556   publicity or vandalism from repossession.

557     The SACCO was the residual claimant on all loan repayments and was responsible for ad-

558   ministering the loan. To finance the loans to farmers, Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) pur-

559   chased tanks from the tank manufacturer, which then delivered tanks to farmers. The SACCO

560   arm of the cooperative then deducted loan repayments from farmer's savings accounts and re-

561   mitted these payments to IPA, holding back an agreed administrative fee, structured so as to

562   ensure the SACCO was the residual claimant on loan repayments. IPA financed the loan with a

563   grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. To ensure that the cooperative repaid IPA,

564   the cooperative and IPA signed an agreement with tBrookside Dairy Ltd., he milk processing

565   plant, the dairy's customer and the largest private milk producer and processor in the country.

566   The agreement authorized Brookside to make loan repayments directly to IPA out of the milk

567   payments to the cooperative.



568   4.2   Treatment Arms


569   As shown in Table 1, farmers were randomly assigned to one of four experimental loan groups,

570   two of which were randomly divided into subgroups after uptake of the loans. One group was

571   offered loans with the standard 100% cash collateral eligibility conditions typically offered by

572   the cooperative (and by most other formal lenders in Kenya, including SACCOs and banks).

573   Specifically, the borrower was required to make a deposit equal to one-third of the loan amount

574   (KSh 8,000) and to have up to three guarantors deposit the other two-thirds of the loan (KSh

575   16,000) with the SACCO as financial collateral. Guarantors could either be those who already


                                                    25
576   had savings or shares in the cooperative or those willing to make deposits. This group will be

577   denoted Group C (for Cash collateralization).

578        A second group was offered the opportunity to put down a 25% (KSh 6,000) deposit, and to

579   collateralize the remaining 75% of the loan with the tank itself. This group is denoted Group D

580   (for deposit).

581        In a third group, the borrower only had to put down 4% of the loan value (KSh 1,000) in a

582   deposit and could find a guarantor to pledge the remaining 21% (5,000 KSh), bringing the total

583   cash pledged against default to 25% of the loan amount. Like the deposit group, 75% of the

584   loan could be collateralized with the tank itself. This group is denoted Group G (for guarantor).

585   Comparing this guarantor group with the 25% deposit group isolates the impact of replacing

586   individual with joint liability.

587        In a final group, denoted Group A (for Asset collateralization), 96% of the value of the loan

588   was collateralized with the tank itself and only a 4% deposit was required.

589        In order to distinguish treatment and selection effects of deposit requirements, the set of farm-

590   ers who took up the 25% deposit loans was randomly divided into two sub-groups. In one, all

591   loan terms were maintained, while in the other, KSh 5,000 of deposits were waived one month

592   after the deposit was made, leaving borrowers with a deposit of KSh 1,000, the same as borrow-

593   ers in the 4% deposit group, A. The deposit (maintained) and deposit (waived) subgroups are

594   denoted (DM ) and (DW ) respectively.

595        Similarly, within the guarantor group, in one subgroup loan terms were maintained and in

596   the other, the guarantors had their pledged cash returned and were released from liability in the

597   case of default. Borrowers were informed of this. These guarantor-maintained and guarantor-

598   waived subgroups are denoted (GM ) and (group GW ), respectively.21

599        The selection effect of the deposit requirement on an outcome variable is the difference in the
      21
           To avoid deception, at the time the loans were first offered, potential borrowers were told that they would face a
           50% chance of having KSh 5,000 of the deposit requirement waived or of having the guarantor requirement waived,
           respectively.



                                                                 26
600   variable between all borrowers in the 4% deposit group and the 25% deposit group (waived)

601   subgroup. The deposit treatment effect is the difference in a variable’s value between the deposit

602   (maintained) and deposit (waived) subgroups. Selection and treatment effects of the guarantor

603   requirement are defined analogously.



604   5      Data and empirical specifications

605        In this section we discuss the sampling frame, randomization, data collection, and the empir-

606   ical approach.



607   5.1     Sampling, Surveys, and Randomization


608   A baseline survey was administered to 1,968 households chosen randomly from a sampling

609   frame of 2,793 households regularly selling milk to the dairy. 1,804 farmers were offered loans in

610   accordance with the treatment assignment shown in Table 1. 419 farmers were offered 100% se-

611   cured joint-liability loans and 510 were offered 4% deposit loans.22 460 farmers took out loans.23

612        Midline surveys were administered to all households in the sample, in part to check that tanks

613   had been installed and were in use, but also to collect data on real impacts, including school par-

614   ticipation and indicators of time use, based on asking what every household member did in the

615   24 hours prior to the survey. Subsequently a number of shorter phone surveys were admin-

616   istered, each of which focused on the three months prior to the survey. Time use information

617   was collected from households in all groups,24 while detailed production data was elicited from
      22
         The groups with the least and most restrictive loan forms were the largest because this maximized power in picking
         up real effects of the loans. Loans were offered in three waves, since it was unknown ex ante how many farmers
         would borrow and the total capital available for purchasing tanks was limited.
      23
         Loans were given in three phases, with contractual repayment periods running from March 2010 - February 2012;
         May 2010 - April 2012; and September 2010 - September 2012. (As discussed below, another set of loans in an
         out-of-sample group began in February 2012. The total number of loan offers that were prepared was 2616, but 19
         of these offers could not be delivered, so the total number of loan offers that were delivered to farmers was 2597.
         When a household entered into a loan agreement, a water tank was delivered within a period of three months.
      24
         Specifically, 1,699 households were interviewed in September 2011: 1,710 in February 2012; and 1,660 in May 2012.




                                                               27
618   households in the 4% deposit group and the 100% secured joint-liability group.25 Finally, ad-

619   ministrative data from the dairy cooperative was used to construct indicators of loan recovery,

620   repossession, late payment collection actions26 , and early repayment.

621        Table 2 reports F-tests for baseline balance checks across all treatment groups. Of the 26 indica-

622   tors presented, one exhibits significant differences across groups at the 5-percent level, and two

623   do so at the 10-percent level. This is in line with what would be expected when the assignment

624   is indeed random.

625        In part, using the proceeds from the first set of loans, approximately 2600 additional farmers

626   were offered loans between February and April 2012 (following a baseline survey in December

627   2011), providing an out-of-sample test. These loan offers were for KSh 26,000, due to an increase

628   in the wholesale price of tanks. The monthly interest rate on these loans was 1.2% rather than

629   one percent. We report data from this “out of sample'' group on take up rates, loan recovery,

630   and tank repossession outcomes.

631        These farmers were randomly assigned to receive loan offers requiring only a KSh 1,000 de-

632   posit; a KSh 6,000 deposit; or KSh 5,000 from a guarantor plus a KSh 1,000 deposit. These

633   deposits were the same value required in the first set of loan offers but, because the loan offer

634   was for KSh 26,000 rather than KSh 24,000, they were slightly lower as a percentage of the loan

635   amount: i.e. 4% deposit loans; 25% deposit loans; or 21% guarantor, 4% deposit loans. No

636   farmers received the standard Nyala 100% secured joint liability loan offer in this out-of-sample

637   group.



638   5.2       Empirical Approach


639        Empirical specifications typically take the form:


                                                  M        W W      M        W W
                                yi = α + βA Ai + βD Di + β D Di + β G G i + βG G i + εi                  (11)
      25
           Data was collected from 901 respondents in 2011, and from 863 respondents in February 2012.
      26
           E.g. receipt of a letter warning of pending default or reclamation of security deposit


                                                                28
640   where yi is the outcome of interest, Ai , DiM and GM
                                                         i are dummy variables equal to one if farmer

641   i was randomized to Group A, D, or G, respectively, and DiW and GW
                                                                       i are equal to one for

642   those members of the deposit and guarantor groups who had their obligations waived ex post.

643   The base group in this specification is therefore Group C, the 100% deposit group. For some

644   specifications, we add a vector of individual covariates, Xi .

645     The overall average impact of moving from a 4% deposit requirement to a 25% deposit or

646   guarantor requirement on take up or tank repossession or any other dependent variable is that

647
                                M − β and β M − β , respectively. The ex post randomized removal of
      given by the differences βD    A     G     A

648   deposit and guarantor requirements in groups DW and GW allows estimation of the selection

649   and treatment effects of deposits and guarantors. In particular, the selection effects of being

650
                                                                           W − β and β W − β ,
      assigned to either the deposit or guarantor group are identified by βD    A     G     A

651   and reflect the extent to which greater deposit requirements or guarantor requirements select

652   borrowers who behave differently than those who take up loans in the 4% deposit group due to

653   differential selection. Under the model, this corresponds to selection of farmers with different

654   tank valuations.

655     Note that in the notation of the model, the loan take up rate corresponds to τ (D) = 1 −

       w F (θ (D, w))fw (w)dw and the repossession rate corresponds to

657   Effects of changing the required deposit D, which we empirically estimate, correspond to changes

658   in the relevant cutoff values. The selection effect corresponds to changes in θ∗ while the treat-

659   ment effect corresponds to changes in y R .The repayment propensity of marginal farmers who

660   are induced to borrow by being offered a 4% deposit requirement rather than a 25% deposit

661   requirement is equal to the difference in repayment between the 4% and 25% deposit (waived)

662   group, divided by the fraction of borrowers in the 4% group who would only borrow if in that

663   group, e.g., the difference in loan take up rates between the 4% and 25% groups, divided by the



                                                           29
664   take up rate in the 4% group. This corresponds to

                                             ρ(6, 000) − ρ(1, 000)

                                                                                                    (13)

665   in the model.

666       The treatment effects of borrowing requirements are identified by comparing loan repayment

667   outcomes for borrowers who have the borrowing requirements maintained with outcomes bor-

668   rowers who have borrowing requirements waived ex post. That is, any treatment effect of the

669
                                                                 M and β W , while a treatment
      deposit requirement would show up in a difference between βD      D

670
                                                     M and β W differed. The treatment effects of the
      effect of the guarantors would be observed if βG      G

671   deposit requirement would encompass the incentive effects of borrowing requirements in the

672   model. Specifically, as the required deposit D decreases, the cutoff value y R (D, θ, S) rises for

673   some borrowers and is unchanged for others. The effect of moving from D = KSh 6, 000 to

674   D = KSh 1, 000 corresponds to ρ(6, 000) − ρ(1, 000) in the model.



675   6     Loan Take up Rates

676       Subsection 6.1 discusses the impact of borrowing requirements on loan take up and subsection

677   6.2 discusses the impact of borrowing requirements on observable borrower characteristics.



678   6.1    Impact of Borrowing Requirements on Loan Take Up


679   Allowing farmers to collateralize loans with the assets purchased with the loan greatly expands

680   access to credit. In the original sample, 2.4% of farmers borrow under the standard SACCO

681   contract with 100% cash collateralization (Group C); 27.6% - more than ten times as many -

682   borrow when the deposit is 25% and the rest of the loan can be collateralized with the tank

683   (Group D); and 44.3% borrow when 96% of the loan can be collateralized and only a 4% deposit

684   is required (Group A) (See table 4). This implies that more than 40% of all targeted farmers


                                                       30
685   would like to borrow at the prevailing interest rate and use this technology, but are not doing it

686   because of borrowing requirements. To put this slightly differently, at least (44.3 − 2.4)/44.3 =

687   95% of potential tank purchasers would have been prevented from purchasing tankes due to

688   credit constraints under the standard SACCO contract.

689        Take up rates in the out-of-sample group are broadly comparable to those in the original ex-

690   periment (Table 4), so in the combined sample, we estimate that 94% of those willing to borrow

691   with a low deposit would be unwilling to borrow under the SACCO's original loan terms. This

692   not only serves as a useful confirmation of the broad patterns in the data, but since farmers in the

693   out-of-sample group had had a chance to see the original lending program in operation, it also

694   provides some reassurance that the original results were not due to misconceptions regarding

695   the water tanks or the loans, or to some unusual period-specific circumstances.27

696        Our second finding is that joint liability does not increase credit access relative to the deposit

697   requirement with individual liability. In the original sample, 27.6% of farmers borrow when

698   they have to put up a 25% deposit themselves (Group D), but only 23.5% borrow when they

699   can ask a friend or relative to put up all but 4% of the value of the loan (Group G) (Table 4). In

700   the out-of-sample group, the point estimates of take up rates is higher in the 21% guarantor, 4%

701   deposit group than in the 25% deposit group, but the difference is still not significant, and in the

702   combined sample, there is almost no difference in take up (as seen in Table 4, columns 2 and 3).

703        The high elasticity of loan take up with respect to asset collateralization and the lack of re-

704   sponse to joint liability points to a potential limitation of traditional joint-liability based micro-

705   finance and suggests that addressing barriers to asset collateralization may play an important

706   role in addressing credit constraints.
      27
           Point estimates suggest that, averaging across treatment arms, approximately 2.7% fewer members of ''out-of-
           sample ''group purchased tanks through the program. The difference is not statistically significant at the 5% level,
           but it is at the 10% level. One might expect some decline in tank purchases due to the increase in the price of the
           tank and the increased interest rate.




                                                                  31
707   6.2       Impact of Borrowing Requirements on Observable Borrower Characteristics


708   Under the model, the lender may use deposit requirements to screen out borrowers with low

709   valuation, who are more likely to default, and it is assumed that the lender cannot directly

710   observe borrowers’ tank valuations. This raises the question of whether the borrowers under

711   different arms differ in observables. As shown in Table 3, we find some evidence that borrowers

712   in the 4% arm are not as well off, but overall we find remarkably small differences in observ-

713   able borrower characteristics among borrowers across arms. Columns (2)-(5) report borrower

714   characteristics by arm. In column (1) these characteristics are reported for the whole sample,

715   including borrowers and non-borrowers in all experimental arms.

716        Of the 84 possible pair-wise comparisons,28 we observe statistically significant differences at

717   the 5% level in just four, almost exactly what would be expected under the null hypothesis of

718   no differential selection on observables across treatment arms. Under the model, this suggests

719   that the farmers with tank valuations intermediate between various levels of θ∗ associated with

720   different borrowing requirements are not that different on observables, suggesting that it would

721   not be easy to screen borrowers on observables. That said, the variables in which there were

722   significant differences mostly make sense in terms of the model. Borrowers in the 4% deposit

723   group had lower log household assets than those in the 25% collateralized group and had lower

724   log expenditures than those in both the deposit and guarantor groups. It is reasonable to think

725   that poorer households might place less monetary value on a water tank than richer households,

726   and thus might be disproportionately represented among those willing to borrow with a 4%

727   deposit, but not under stricter borrowing requirements.

728        The starkest difference between the (few) farmers in the 100% secured joint-liability group

729   who chose to borrow and farmers in other arms who chose to borrow is that the former typically

730   chose to borrow only if they already owned a tank. 80% of borrowers already owned a tank,

731   whereas only 43% of borrowers in the full sample owned tanks at baseline. Under the model,

732   this could be interpreted as indicating that those who already owned tanks placed the highest

733   value on them. Relaxing borrowing requirements induced non-tank owners to buy tanks.

734        Relative to those who did not accept loan offers, borrowers tended to have more assets, higher

735   per capita expenditure, more milk-producing cows, and more years of education, all of which

736   might plausibly be associated with greater tank valuations under the model.29 Under the model,

737   differences between borrowers and non-borrowers would be starker than differences among

738   borrowers across arms, if those with very low tank-valuation/initial wealth level pairs, who

739   would not buy even with a low deposit, differ on observables from those with high valua-

740   tions/wealth levels, but those in an intermediate range of valuation are more similar on observ-

741   ables.



742   7       Impact of Borrowing Requirements on Loan Repayment

743        Subsection 7.1 discusses loan recovery and tank repossession, assessing evidence for selection

744   and treatment effects of borrowing requirements. Subsection 7.2 provides a rough calibration of

745   the model, and subsection 7.3 discusses late payment.



746   7.1       Loan Recovery and Tank Repossession


747        No tanks were repossessed with 75% asset collateralization under either the 25% deposit

748   (Group D) or the 21% guarantor, 4% deposit condition (Group G) (Table 5). We also observe

749   no tank repossessions when a 25% borrowing requirement was initially imposed and all but 4%

750   of the deposit was later waived. Rates of tank repossession were 0.7% in the 4% deposit, 96%

751   asset collateralized group (Group A). In particular, one tank was repossessed in the original

752   sample and two more were repossessed in the out-of-sample group. In one out of those three

753   cases the borrower paid off arrears and reclaimed the tank after the tank had been repossessed
      29
           There were few statistically significant differences between borrowers and non-borrowers in the 100% collateralized
           group, but there is little power to detect such differences in this group due to the small number of borrowers (see
           column [2]).




                                                                  33
754   but before it had been resold.30 Note that in all cases, proceeds from the tank sale were sufficient

755   to fully pay off the principal and interest on the loan. The two tanks that were repossessed and

756   then sold were purchased at KSh 29,000 and KSh 22,000).31 There were thus no cases of loan

757   non-recovery, defined as a failure to collect principal, interest, and late fee.

758        Aside from the small 100% secured joint-liability group (Group C), confidence intervals on

759   loan non-recovery rates and on tank repossession rates are fairly tight, so we can reject even very

760   low underlying probabilities of tank repossession. It is clearly impossible to use asymptotics

761   based on the normal distribution when we observe zero or close to zero tank repossessions, but

762   we can create exact confidence intervals based on the underlying binomial distribution. For

763   example, in the combined 4% deposit group, all 431 loans were fully recovered (Table 5). We

764   can therefore reject the hypothesis that the underlying loan non-recovery rate during the period

765   of the loans was more than 0.69 percent. To see this, note that if the true rate was 0.69 percent,

766   then the probability of observing at least one case of loan non-recovery in 431 loans would be

767   (1 − 0.0069)431 = 0.05. Using a similar approach with three tank repossessions, we can reject

768   the hypothesis that the underlying tank repossession rate during the period was more than 2.02

769   percent or less than 0.14 percent.

770        Table 5 displays Clopper-Pearson exact confidence intervals for the rate of tank repossessions

771   and loan non-recovery under the point estimates for each loan type, calculated based on the

772   combined sample, including loans from both the original sample and out-of-sample groups.

773   (Clopper and Pearson, 1934).32
      30
         We classify this case as a repossession since the costs of repossession were incurred.
      31
         The high price relative to the loan value likely reflects the low depreciation rate on tanks as well as the fact that
         loans were based on the wholesale value of the tank.
      32
          A two-sided confidence interval can be calculated for cases with a nonzero number of events. Letting p denote the
         underlying true probability of an event (tank repossession or loan non-recovery), n the number of loans, and E the

                                                                   34
774     While 25% borrowing requirements do not seem to select borrowers prone to tank repos-

775   session, borrowers selected by 4% requirements are more likely to have tanks repossessed. In

776   particular, we can reject the hypothesis that the repossession rate is the same in the 4% deposit

777   group as among a group combining both forms of 25% cash collateralization (e.g., combining

778   the 25% deposit group and the 21% guarantor, 4% deposit group) at the 5.25% level. (Since the

779   normal approximation is not a good approximation when the probability of an event is close

780   to zero, we used Fisher's exact test to test for a difference between the repossession probabili-

781   ties.) (As discussed below, after the end of the program, the SACCO began offering 75% asset-

782   collateralized loans on its own, and there have been no tank repossessions. If one treated these

783   observations as part of the sample, the p-value would be below 5%, but since these observa-

784   tions were not randomized and took place in a different time period, it is hard to quantify how

785   much this should increase confidence that underlying tank repossession rates differ between

786   samples with 75% and 96% asset-collateralized loans.) The sample size is inadequate to have

787   this level of confidence for differences between the 96% asset-collateralized group and either the

788   25% deposit or guarantor group on its own.

789     There is no evidence of treatment effects of stricter borrowing requirements on tank reposses-

790   sion, since tank repossession rates did not budge off zero when deposit or guarantor require-

791   ments were waived ex post. We also do not find differences in repossession between individual

792   and joint liability.33



793   7.2     Change in SACCO Policy Following the Program


794   We can try to assess welfare based on both the observed behavior of the lender following the

795   trial and based on calibrating the model using the data. Starting with the simplest comparison,
                                                               N
                                                                     n
                                                                      (1 − p)n−i (p)i =   α
                                                               P     
       confidence interval is calculated by solving for p in         i                    2
                                                                                            .
                                                               i=E

         If there are zero events, the lower limit of the confidence interval is zero. In this case, we use a one-sided confidence
         interval with α = 0.05 for the upper bound. In this event, the upper bound can be calculated by solving for p in
         (1 − p)n = α
      33
         See Carpena et al. (2013), Karlan and Giné (2014), and Giné et al. (2011) for other work on this issue.



                                                                   35
796   our data suggests that moving from the status quo policy of 100% cash collateralization to loans

797   75% collateralized with the asset and 25% collateralized with cash could increase loan demand

798   without increasing repossession. This suggests that under the model it would increase both

799   lender and borrower welfare. After the end of the program, once the SACCO had learned about

800   demand for loans and repayment rates under various conditions, it began using its own funds

801   to offer 75% asset-collateralized loans to farmers. (One caveat is that the model abstracts from

802   administration costs of loans, and given the tiny gap between borrowing and lending rates,

803   these are significant. Perhaps in response, the SACCO introduced an appraisal fee on all its

804   loans. For the tank loan, this is equal to KSh 700.)

805     It seems reasonable to conjecture that the SACCO felt that with the addition of the KSh 700

806   fee, it was either profitable in expectation to lower the deposit requirement to 25%, or that the

807   costs were low enough that the SACCO could afford to take this step as a way of improving

808   members’ welfare. It is not clear whether it would have been profitable to lower the borrowing

809   requirement to 25% without the KSh 700 fee, since the SACCO's margins on lending are very

810   small, and the SACCO most likely incurred additional administrative costs, including costs

811   associated with late payments, by reducing borrowing requirements.

812     Based on knowledge of salaries in the SACCO and rough estimates of staff time allocation,

813   we estimate that the cost of administering the additional loans would be at least covered by the

814   KSh 700 fee plus the margin the SACCO earns on the difference between the interest rate it pays

815   its depositors and what it charges to borrowers.

816     Our point estimates suggest that since allowing 75% asset collateralization did not lead to any

817   additional tank repossessions, moving from requiring 100% cash collateralization to 75% asset

818   collateralization would have been profitable during the period we examined. Of course while

819   we observe no extra risk of tank repossession, we cannot reject the hypothesis of an underlying

820   increase in tank repossession of up to 0.32 percent with 75% asset collateralization.

821     However, since our results raise the question of why the lender did not lower the deposit

822   prior to the experiment, one natural hypothesis is that it did not know how borrowers would

                                                       36
823   respond and feared the downside risk. Given that the SACCO did not choose to offer 96%-

824   asset-collateralization loans, it is not clear from revealed preference alone whether doing so

825   would have been socially optimal. While it is not clear how one should model the objective

826   function of the SACCO, since it is a cooperative, the fact that the cooperative did not lower the

827   borrowing requirement to 4% after learning the results of the experiment suggests that reducing

828   the borrowing requirement was not seen as profit maximizing. If it were profit maximizing, it

829   would have been in the interest of all cooperative members, both borrowers and non-borrowers,

830   to lower the deposit to 4%. While reducing the borrowing requirement to 4% might have bene-

831   fited borrowers, it would have reduced overall profits and thus harmed non-borrowers, which

832   would include the median voter in the SACCO.

833     While the model is stylized, and not meant to capture all features of the setting we examine,

834   a rough calibration of the model suggests conclusions similar to those drawn from the revealed

835   preference analysis. Given that moving from 100% cash collateralization to a 25% deposit re-

836   quirement induced no defaults, the model–abstracting away from administrative costs–directly

837   suggests that this change would increase profits (see the proof of lemma 1). The model also

838   suggests that this change would increase borrower welfare, and would thus be socially optimal.

839   While the model suggests that lowering the deposit requirement below 25% would be socially

840   optimal, it isn’t clear what the optimal magnitude would be for this decrease. Given the data, a

841   rough calibration based on the results above and the first order condition for profit maximiza-

842   tion suggests that moving all the way down to a 4% deposit requirement would not have been

843   profitable for the SACCO.

844     As the model’s FOC for lenders makes clear, the profit-maximizing deposit level depends not

845   on the average rate of loan recovery and tank repossession, but on the ratio of the marginal addi-

846   tional tank repossessions associated with a change in D to the marginal increase in total loans. To

847   calculate the marginal repossession rate in the combined sample when moving from 25% loans

848   to 4% loans, i.e., D decreasing from KSh6, 000 to KSh1, 000, note that the average repossession

849   rate is 0.7% for 4% deposit loans, hence ρ(1, 000) = 0.007%, and zero for 25% loans (Table 5, col-



                                                      37
850   umn 2), hence ρ(6, 000) = 0%. The take up rate for 4% deposit loans is 41.89%. For 25% deposit
                                                                       τ (6,000)−τ (1,000))dw
851   loans, the combined sample take up is 23.93%. Thus                       τ (6,000)        = (41.89−23.93)/41.89 =

852   42.9%. In other words, 42.9% of those who borrow with a 4% deposit are marginal in the sense

853   that they would not borrow with a 25% deposit. Thus our point estimate of the marginal repos-

854   session rate is 0.007/.429 = 0.0163, implying that 1.63% or 1 in 62 of the marginal loans made

855   under a 4% borrowing requirement would lead to a repossession.

856        Whether a lender would prefer the low deposit depends on whether the marginal profit for

857   an extra loan is more than 1/62nd as much as the repossession costs that the lender bears,

858   K − KB , which we estimate to be at least KSh 4,500. In our context, the additional profits to

859   the lender from a successful loan are likely to be extremely small. In particular, the difference

860   between the interest rate of 3% per quarter that the SACCO pays on deposits and the interest

861   rate of 1% per month that it charges borrowers amounts to only KSh 53 over two years on KSh

862   18,000 (the amount of the loan, less the 25% deposit, since the borrower earns interest on the

863   deposit). Since interest is paid only on the declining balance, the SACCO makes even less than

864   this on each successful loan. This is less than the expected loss from additional unreimbursed

865   tank repossession costs, which are KSh 4,500/62 = KSh 73. Taking into account the costs to the

866   SACCO of processing loans would further reinforce the conclusion that moving to a 4% deposit

867   would not have been profitable. However, the low expected loss to the lender from additional

868   loans suggest that it is reasonably likely that moving from a 25% deposit requirement to a 4%

869   requirement would be socially desirable, with benefits to borrowers outweighing the small costs

870   to the lender



871   7.3       Late Payment


872   Table 6 presents late payment results for the 456 borrowers in the original sample for whom we

873   have complete repayment data34 Columns (1) to (3) report late payment outcomes during the

874   loan cycle and columns (4) to (6) show payments that were late at the end of the two-year loan

           Data on the time of repayment are missing for four borrowers.



                                                                38
875   cycle. The notes below the table show the p-values on the existence of the selection effect that

876   will drive wedges between private and social optima, as well as on the treatment effects. We

877   first discuss overall effects and then selection and treatment effects.

878     There is evidence of 'overall 'effects of different treatments. Those offered 100% secured joint-

879   liability loans are much less likely to be ever late than those in any other group, with point

880   estimates of the difference ranging from 43 to 59 percentage points. Moving from a 100% se-

881   cured joint-liability loan to a 96% asset-collateralized, 4% deposit loan also increases issuance

882   of pending default letters, and it increases late balances at the end of the loan cycle by KSh 222,

883   or about $3. None of the ten 100% collateralized loans were late at the end of loan. This is a

884   significantly smaller proportion than in the 4% deposit arm, but not than in the 25% deposit or

885   guarantor arms. The extent to which loans were late, however, is tiny, as shown in Column (5)

886   of Table 6, which reports the outstanding late balance at the end of the contractual loan period.

887   Point estimates of the average late balance varied from 46 to 297 KSh, or less than one percent

888   of the loan value. Mean months late in the other groups varied from 0.08 to 0.22 months, or 2-7

889   days.

890     There is some suggestive evidence, significant at the 10% level, that stricter deposit and guar-

891   antor requirements select borrowers who are less likely to be ever late (Table 6, column 1). The

892   25% deposit requirements selects borrowers who are 11 (57 − 46) percentage points less likely

893   to be late at least once than the 4% deposit loan. Similarly, imposing a guarantor requirement

894   leads to borrowers who are 14 (57 − 43) percentage points less likely to be late ever. We find no

895   significant treatment effect of either the deposit or guarantor requirements on being ever late.

896     For other repayment outcomes, shown in other columns, there is little evidence of a selection

897   effect. Column (2) reports whether a borrower received a pending default letter at some point

898   in the loan cycle (which was typically sent when a farmer was at least two months in arrears).

899   There is no evidence of treatment and selection effects for the deposit group. There is only a bor-

900   derline significant negative treatment effect of requiring a guarantor (p = 0.10). According to

901   column (3), 11 percent of borrowers had security deposits reclaimed, with no significant differ-


                                                       39
902   ences between the treatment arms and the 4% deposit groups. We cannot reject the hypotheses

903   of no treatment effect and of no selection effect.

904        The model has only three periods, whereas the actual program took place over 24 months.

905   In the last four months of the program, many farmers paid off their loans using their deposits,

906   potentially creating a 'mechanical'effect through which larger deposits reduce late repayment

907   that is not present in the model.35 For outcomes at the end of the cycle, which may be influenced

908   by the mechanical effect, we see evidence of treatment effects in columns (4)-(6), but not much

909   evidence of selection effects.

910        Repaid late is a dummy variable equal to 1 if at the contractual maturity date the borrower

911   has an outstanding balance left to pay. Column (6) in Table 6 shows the number of months by

912   which full repayment of the loan was late (any farmers who paid early are counted as being zero

913   months late.). There are significant treatment effects from the 25% deposit on “repaid late''and

914   “months late.''Waiving the deposit increases the chance that borrowers are late at the end of

915   the loan cycle by about 10 percentage points and increases the time by which loans miss the

916   two-year end of the loan cycle by 11% of a month, or just over 3 days. This seems likely to be

917   a mechanical effect. However, since the magnitudes are small, with the difference in the late

918   balance less than 2 USD, these late balances themselves are unlikely to have a major impact

919   on the profitability of lending. There is no evidence for treatment effects of guarantors on late

920   payment outcomes.

921        Overall, our data does not indicate a consistent pattern in late repayment differences between

922   the 4% and 25% groups. In three of the six measures of lateness, the point estimates indicate

923   that there was greater late repayment in the 25% deposit group and in the other three cases the

924   point estimates indicate there was greater late payment in the 4% loan group.

925        It is difficult to quantify the extra administrative costs for the SACCO caused by higher rates
      35
           Although the existence of such a 'mechanical 'effect would make it difficult to decompose the treatment effect
           into incentive and mechanical effects, it would not interfere with distinguishing these treatment effects from the
           selection effects which generate a wedge between profit-maximizing and social welfare maximizing borrowing
           requirements.



                                                                 40
926   of late payment due to reducing borrowing requirements. The SACCO made very few loans

927   initially and handled much of the bookkeeping manually, in a way that avoided high fixed costs

928   for software and for training staff, but that involved fairly high marginal costs for processing

929   late payments. When payments were late, the SACCO had to manually calculate how late the

930   payments were and send letters. In principle it would be fairly easy to build a software system

931   that would automate this process and send out notices by text message. If a paper copy was

932   needed, it this could be sent with milk transporters who visit farmers every day to collect milk

933   which is delivered to the dairy daily.

934     One way to get a sense of the cost of late payment is to examine the extent to which the

935   SACCO increased fees when it began making tank loans with a 25% down payment. As noted,

936   the SACCO now applies a KSh 700 initial fee, just under three percent of the value of the loan.

937   This suggests that KSh 700 was enough to cover both any perceived extra expected costs of

938   tank repossession and any extra administrative cost of more frequent late payments caused by

939   moving from the original SACCO contract to a 25% deposit contract.

940     Another other striking feature of the data is that early repayment was common. It is surpris-

941   ing that so many farmers would forego a close to zero interest loan, since 95 percent of those

942   who bought a tank under the 4% arm were sufficiently credit constrained that they would not

943   purchase a tank under strict borrowing requirements.

944     Under the standard savings and credit cooperative contract, 90% of people in the 100% se-

945   cured joint-liability group repaid their loan early. On average, they were 15 months early on

946   a 24 month contract. Even setting aside the eight months of principal in their deposit, they

947   forewent seven months of low interest loan. Of course it is possible that some of these early

948   payers took out new loans through the SACCO's ordinary lending program once their existing

949   loans were paid off. However, since ordinary loans must be fully collateralized through own

950   and guarantors'shares and deposits, paying off a loan early is still giving up access to capital.

951   When 21% of the 25% deposit loan is waived (KSh 5,000 of a KSh 6,000 deposit), many house-

952   holds apply the waived funds almost fully to pay down the principal. They effectively stuck


                                                     41
953   with the status quo of the contract that they signed, thus giving up KSh 5,000 of low-interest

954   loan for more than one year.



955   8     Real Impact of Changing Borrowing Requirements

956       While micro-finance organizations often portray their loans as being for investment, there

957   has been debate about the extent to which they are actually used for investment as opposed

958   to for financing consumption (Banerjee et al, 2015). Asset-collateralized loans are potentially

959   more likely to flow towards investment, since lenders making these loans presumably have

960   stronger incentives to ensure that borrowers actually obtain the assets than lenders making un-

961   collateralized loans.

962       In this section, we show that loosening borrowing requirements for loans to purchase 5,000

963   liter rainwater harvesting tanks indeed led to increased investment in large tanks, although

964   approximately one-third of the additional loans taken under the looser borrowing requirements

965   may have been used to finance investments which would have taken place in any case. Since

966   the rainwater harvesting tanks represent a new technology, our findings also provide evidence

967   for the idea that access to credit may facilitate technology adoption.

968       Within the water literature, our findings are consistent with Devoto et al. (2011) in suggesting

969   that expanding access to credit had real effects on access to water, and time use. Difference-in-

970   difference estimates suggest that access to credit to purchase tanks also increased girls ' school-

971   ing. Table 8 presents ITT estimates of the impact of assignment to the 4% deposit group, as

972   opposed to the 100% secured joint-liability group, on tank ownership, water storage capacity,

973   cow health, and milk production. These data were collected in a series of survey rounds of

974   farmers in the two groups. We present our results in terms of a simple difference-in-differences

975   framework, comparing these groups before and after loan offers were made. All specifications

976   include survey round fixed effects.

977       Assignment to the 4% deposit group (Group A) rather than the 100% secured joint-liability

                                                       42
 978   group (Group C) increased the likelihood of owning any kind of tank by 17.5 percentage points,

 979   an increase of about 35% compared with the counterfactual (note that about 45% of all house-

 980   holds had a tank at baseline) and led to an approximately 60 percent increase in household water

 981   storage capacity. Both increases are significant at the 1 percent level (as shown in columns 1 and

 982   2). There is a 27% increase in ownership of a tank with 2,500 liter capacity or more. Since the

 983   difference in loan take up between Group C and Group A is approximately 40%, we estimate

 984   that approximately two-thirds of the additional loans generated new tank investments, while

 985   one-third financed purchases that would have taken place in any case.

 986        We find no significant effects on milk production (Table 8). The point estimate is that log

 987   production increases by 0.047 points, but this is insignificant, with a t-statistic just under one

 988   (column 6).36

 989        There is evidence that farmers offered favorable credit terms were more likely to sell milk to

 990   the dairy to pay off their loans. Table 9 is based on monthly administrative data from the dairy

 991   on milk sales for farmers in all arms of the study. It compares the 4% deposit group (Group A) to

 992   all other groups using an ITT approach. Column 4 suggests more Group A farmers sold milk to

 993   the dairy. While assignment to the 4% deposit group does not significantly affect the quantity of

 994   sales (column 2 and 5), there is some evidence of an effect outside the top five percentiles during

 995   the period before loan maturation (although again this effect shows up only in differences, not

 996   in levels).

 997        Devoto et al (2011) find that household water connections generated time savings. Table 10

 998   reports estimates of the impact of treatment assignment on time use and schooling for children

 999   between the ages of 5 and 16. We present time-use results for the full sample (columns (1) and

1000   (2)), and separately for households with (columns (3) and (4)) and without (columns (5) and (6))

1001   piped water. Odd-numbered columns measure time spent fetching water in minutes per day
       36
            Table 8, column 4, suggests provision of water tanks reduced sickness among cows. Biologically, it is quite plausible
            that rainwater harvesting could improve cow health, because it reduced the need for cattle to travel to ponds or
            streams to drink and thus reduces their exposure to other cattle. However, since there were baseline differences in
            cow health (as reflected in the coefficient on treatment in this column), it is also possible that this simply reflects
            mean reversion.



                                                                     43
1002   per household member, and even-numbered columns measure time spent tending to livestock,

1003   again in minutes per day per household member.

1004       Treated girls spent 3.17 fewer minutes per day fetching water (significant at the 1% level).

1005   Boys spent 9.66 fewer minutes per day tending to livestock, (significant at the 10% level) with

1006   smaller effects for girls that are not statistically significant (Columns 1 and 2, respectively). The

1007   greater access to credit for the purchase of tanks allows females in treatment households to make

1008   up nearly all of the gender differential (point estimate -2.22 minutes per day per female, column

1009   1, row 1) in time spent fetching water, significant at the 10 % level. Access to credit to purchase

1010   water tanks reduces time spent by girls tending to livestock by 12 min/day in households with

1011   piped water. In households without piped water, it reduces time spent by boys tending to

1012   livestock by 15 min/day.

1013       Difference-in-difference estimates suggest that greater access to credit also reduced school

1014   drop-out rates for girls (Table 11). Observations in each regression are at the individual child

1015   level, with standard errors clustered at the household level. Enrollment rates in general were

1016   very high at baseline, at about 98%for both boys and girls. Over time, some students dropped

1017   out, so these rates were 3-5 percentage points lower in the survey following the loan offers.

1018   While access to credit had no impact on boys' enrollment, girls in households assigned to the

1019   treatment group were less likely to drop out - the implied treatment effect on girls is 4 percentage

1020   points. The effect of treatment on girls’ school enrollment, while significant in a difference-in-

1021   differences specification, is not significant in levels.



1022   9     Conclusion

1023       In high-income countries, households can often borrow to purchase assets with a relatively

1024   small down payment. In contrast, formal-sector lenders in low-income countries typically im-

1025   pose very stringent borrowing requirements. Among a population of Kenyan dairy farmers, we

1026   find credit access is greatly constrained by strict borrowing requirements. 42% of farmers bor-


                                                         44
1027   rowed to purchase a water tank when they could primarily collateralize the loan with the tank

1028   and only had to make a deposit of 4% of the loan value, but a small fraction (2.4%) borrowed

1029   under the lender's standard contract, which required that loans had to be 100% collateralized

1030   with pre-existing financial assets of the borrower and guarantors.

1031        Lower borrowing requirements are associated not only with increased borrowing, but with

1032   increased investment in the new technology. With regards to repayments, we find that when

1033   75% of the loan could be collateralized with the tanks, all borrowers repaid in full. However,

1034   reducing required deposits to 4% of the loan value selected marginal borrowers with a 1.63%

1035   rate of failing to pay and having their tanks repossessed (although we see no moral hazard

1036   effect). Finally, we find no evidence that substituting guarantors for deposit requirements ex-

1037   pands credit access, casting doubt on the extent to which joint liability can serve as a substitute

1038   for the type of asset-collateralization common in developed countries.

1039        A simple adverse selection model suggests that since tight borrowing requirements select

1040   safer borrowers, profit-maximizing lenders will have socially excessive incentives to choose

1041   tight deposit requirements. One policy implication is that legal and institutional barriers to

1042   using assets to collateralize debt could potentially have large effects on credit access, invest-

1043   ment, and technology adoption. In general, weak property rights or contract enforcement could

1044   inhibit collateralization of loans with assets purchased with the loan. In our context, the lender

1045   experienced no problems repossessing collateral, and the key barrier to reducing borrowing re-

1046   quirements may have been financial repression in the form of regulatory limits on the interest

1047   rate SACCOs can charge customers. Adverse selection implies borrowing limits are too strin-

1048   gent, so regulatory limits on interest rates push in the wrong direction.37

1049        A back of the envelope calculation suggests that only a small increase in the interest rate

1050   would be needed to offset the cost of the higher tank repossession rate among those who borrow
       37
            Note that this conclusion is robust to the possibility that shocks to income might be correlated across borrowers,
            and that repossession rates might have been higher in bad states of the world. Lenders will have private incentives
            to consider any such correlations in setting deposit requirements. Moreover, since aggregate shocks are observable,
            they are better addressed through insurance than through high deposit requirements.




                                                                   45
1051   with a 4% down payment.38

1052        Financial repression can alternatively be relaxed through upfront fees. After seeing the results

1053   of the program, the SACCO introduced the financial innovation of imposing a KSh 700 initial

1054   fee and of reducing its deposit requirement to 25%. The fee provides an upper bound on the

1055   relaxation in financial repression needed to enable expanded credit access in our setting.

1056        Note also that the SACCO could have easily have covered the administrative costs of the pro-

1057   gram by retaining some portion of the approximately $50 gap between the wholesale price the

1058   SACCO paid for the tanks and the price at which tanks were sold to the farmer. In the pro-

1059   gram we examined, the tanks were sold to the farmer at the wholesale price, but if the SACCO

1060   charged farmers even 20% of the retail price markup, it could have raised this KSh 700 to cover

1061   administrative costs.      39



1062        Increasing the fee for tank repossession could also increase the lender’s incentives to reduce

1063   borrowing requirements. However, increasing the tank repossession fee would have undesir-

1064   able risk-sharing properties since farmers will only experience tank repossession if hit by neg-

1065   ative income shocks. Limited liability constraints might make it difficult to collect large repos-

1066   session fees from defaulting borrowers.

1067        The model does not, however, simply suggest removing barriers to asset collateralized loans.

1068   Since strict borrowing requirements select more profitable borrowers, the model suggests that

1069   profit-maximizing lenders will face socially-excessive incentives for tight borrowing require-

1070   ments. The market failure identified in the paper creates a potential case for policymakers to

1071   encourage less restrictive borrowing requirements by subsidizing such loans - the opposite of
       38
          In particular, since one out of 62 marginal borrowers has a tank repossession, and since the extra cost incurred by the
          SACCO from a tank repossession is approximately KSh 4,500, an increase in profits per loan of KSh 4,500/62 = KSh
          72.58 would have been enough to make this worthwhile for the lender in this particular season. This corresponds
          to an increase in the annual interest rate of approximately three tenths of one percent. In reality, a bigger increase
          might be needed, since lenders would also have to consider the cost of any additional late payments associated
          with moving to a 4% deposit ratio.
       39
          Indeed, we estimate that 30% of the wholesale-retail markup would be sufficient to cover not only the SACCO's
          administrative costs of lending to farmers, but also the administrative costs of a larger entity lending to SACCOs.
          The fairly similar take up rates in the original sample and the out-of-sample group suggest that tank demand is not
          terribly price elastic, so it seems likely that there would be substantial tank demand even with somewhat higher
          prices.


                                                                  46
1072   existing regulatory policy. Of course, while we have argued that adverse selection will cre-

1073   ate market failures that lead to excessive borrowing requirements, there is also the danger of a

1074   government failure, with large-scale government subsidies to allow lower borrowing require-

1075   ments turning into favors for the politically connected and possibly triggering bailouts or costly

1076   SACCO failures if borrowing requirements dropped too low. Still, it may be possible to isolate

1077   particular types of subsidies that would be useful and that would limit the downside risk to the

1078   government.

1079     Most SACCOs are small and handle transactions manually, making administrative costs fairly

1080   high, and thus discouraging lending. Differences in loan administration efficiency and in ad-

1081   ministrative costs relative to loan value may partially account for differences in borrowing re-

1082   quirements between low and high-income countries. The development of better ICT technology

1083   for the sector could potentially radically lower the cost of handling late payments. Since it seems

1084   unlikely that the developer of better software for SACCOs could fully extract the social value of

1085   such software, subsidizing the creation of better software for managing SACCO accounts might

1086   be welfare improving.

1087     Studies that would shed light on the impact of relaxing borrowing requirements in contexts

1088   beyond the context of rainwater harvesting tanks and the dairy industry examined here would

1089   constitute public goods to the extent that their results might inform multiple lenders. As noted,

1090   a second out-of-sample test in Kenya after the initial study generated similar results to those

1091   presented above. A similar pilot program was implemented by the J-PAL Africa policy team in

1092   Rwanda. In the first phase, 43 out of about 160 farmers took up the loan, with only one default.

1093   Since the second Nyala test, the lender has extended the program, using its own resources,

1094   and has also experienced high repayment rates. Thirteen SACCOs have chosen to implement

1095   similar programs without subsidies. Additionally, following the results of this study, a major

1096   commercial bank in Kenya (Equity Bank) has started a program with another tank manufacturer

1097   in which it is making loans to finance tank purchases.

1098     More ambitiously, policymakers could offer to insure borrowers and/or lenders against ob-


                                                       47
1099   servable negative shocks to the state of the world, such as droughts or price declines, potentially

1100   just offering bridging loans that would allow lenders to defer payment during such periods,

1101   with the loans still incurring interest.

1102     One area we hope to explore in future work is whether prospect theoretic preferences could

1103   help explain why demand for loans is so responsive to the possibility of collateralizing loans

1104   using assets purchased with the loan and why repayment rates are so high. Under prospect

1105   theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), people value gains relative to a reference point less than

1106   they disvalue losses relative to that reference point. Prospect theoretic agents may be averse to

1107   pledging an existing asset as collateral to obtain a new asset like a water tank, so they would

1108   have low take up rates when high deposits are required. However, prospect theoretic agents

1109   would be more likely to take up loans if they can use assets purchased with the loan as collateral,

1110   because this limits risk to existing assets. Once the tank is purchased, their reference point will

1111   shift, creating a strong incentive for prospect-theoretic farmers to retain possession. This could

1112   account for the very high repayment rates.

1113     Prospect theory can also potentially explain the finding that the largest difference in observ-

1114   able characteristics between those borrowing in the 100% secured joint-liability group and those

1115   borrowing in the other arms is that 80% of borrowers in the 100% secured joint-liability loan

1116   arm already owned tanks. This is surprising from a diminishing returns perspective, but it is

1117   consistent with loss aversion, since most of the existing tanks are stone or metal and thus sus-

1118   ceptible to loss from cracking or rust. Prospect theory might also help explain why farmers who

1119   made 25% deposits and later had them waived often simply applied the waived deposit toward

1120   paying down the loan early.

1259   A         Proofs for the Model Section

1260   Proposition 1.
1261     Under the conditions on the distribution of tank valuation assumed earlier, a marginal level of income
1262   exists, denoted by y R (θi , S, D), at which a borrower with valuation θi is indifferent between forgoing
1263   consumption in order to make the repayment and allowing the tank to be repossessed. yiR is continuously
1264   differentiable with respect to all of its arguments, strictly decreasing in θi and S, and weakly decreasing
1265   in D. When D is such that all repossessions result in negative equity, yiR is strictly decreasing in D.

1266   Proof. If the borrower repays the lender, her second-period utility is

                                             U2,r (yi , S; θi ) = θi + u(yi + RD S − RT P ),                                   (14)

1267   that is, the benefit of the tank, θi , plus the consumption utility from resources remaining once
1268   the loan principal and interest RT P are repaid. Consumption is financed from the remainder
1269   of the gross returns from savings and the income draw. To derive the utility of a borrower who
1270   does not repay the loan and allows the tank to be repossessed, first consider the net proceeds
1271   the borrower receives from the sale of the tank. In the event of repossession, a borrower will
1272   receive their net equity in the tank (from the lender’s point of view) if it is positive and will lose
1273   the required deposit if their net equity is negative. The net equity of the borrower is equal to
1274   the total value of the tank and the required deposit, RD D + δP , minus the total claims of the
1275   lender in the event of default, RT P + KB . Hence, in the event of default, the borrower faces a
1276   financial cost from default of min{RT P + KB , RD D + δP }. Since the borrower’s assets before
1277   repossession have value RD S + δP, a defaulting borrower receives net proceeds from the first
1278   period of max{RD S − (RT − δ)P − KB , RD (S − D)}, and has total second-period utility of

                    U2,d (yi , S, D; θi ) = u(max{yi + RD S + δP − RT P − KB , yi + RD (S − D)}) − M                           (15)

1279   where the final term captures the disutility from harming their relationship with the SACCO M .
1280   Consumption is financed by the period two endowment yi , any net proceeds from the sale of the
1281   tank, and any non-deposit savings. Loan defaults only occur when low income is realized, since
1282   high-income borrowers will have a reduced marginal utility of consumption and thus prefer
1283   to repay the loan, and potential borrowers will not borrow if they know that they will allow
1284   the tank to be repossessed for all income realizations.40 Note also that whether any default
1285   would be positive or negative equity is determined prior to and independently of the period
1286   two income draw, depending only on whether δP + RD D ≥ RT P + KB . Comparing the utilities
1287   from repayment and default yields the condition for repossession, conditional on borrowing at
1288   t = 1. A borrower will only default upon the loan and allow the tank to be repossessed if she
1289   earns low enough period-two income that the utility from defaulting exceeds the utility from
1290   repayment:
                                  U2,repossession (yi , S; θi ) > U2,repay (yi , S; θi ).         (16)
       40
            Recall that the the borrower receives no utility benefit from the tank if it is repossessed, but still incurs the repos-
            session fee.




                                                                     53
1291   Under the conditions on the distribution of tank valuation assumed earlier, a marginal level
1292   of income exists, denoted by y R (θi , S, D), at which a borrower with valuation θi is indifferent
1293   between repaying the loan and allowing the tank to be repossessed. Since u0 (c) is decreasing,
1294   and default gives higher consumption, repayment is preferred at any higher yi . First consider
1295   the case where D is such that any loan default involves positive equity. In this case y R is defined
1296   by:
                     θi + u(y R + RD S − RT P ) = u(y R + RD S + δP − RT P − KB ) − M.                  (17)
1297   Since
                      θi + u(y R + RD S − RT P ) − u(y R + RD S + δP − RT P − KB ) + M                  (18)
1298   is continuously differentiable, and has nonzero derivative with respect to y R (this follows from
1299   the fact that y R + RD S − RT P < y R + RD S + δP − RT P − KB ), the continuous differentiability
1300   of y R follows from the implicit function theorem.
1301     Clearly, higher θi allows a higher consumption differential between default and repayment
1302   at the point of indifference. This translates to a lower y R . Letting c2,r denote second period
1303   consumption in the case of repayment and c2,d in the case of default, total differentiation gives:

                                 dθi + u0 (c2,r ) − u0 (c2,d ) (dy R + RD dS) = 0

1306   Separately, in the case where negative equity repossession can occur, y R is defined by:

                             θi + u(y R + RD S − RT P ) = u(y R + RD (S − D)) − M                       (22)

1307   Again, continuous differentiability of y R is direct from the implicit function theorem. By total
1308   differentiation:

                        dθi + u0 (c2,r )(dy R + RD dS) − u0 (c2,d )(dy R + RD (dS − dD)) = 0            (23)

1312   These results reflects that, for a borrower with given θi who has positive equity, the decision
1313   to repay only depends on their wealth, and thus higher S reduces y R . In the negative equity
1314   case,the direct effect of D (holding S constant) is to decrease c2 under default, again reducing y R .
1315   Higher θi increases the benefits of repayment, and thus justifies incurring the greater foregone
1316   consumption utility associated with lower yi .

1317     Proposition 3. Potential borrowers will borrow if θi > θ∗ (D, wi ), where θ∗ is continuously differ-
1318   entiable in D and wi for almost all farmers. Among these farmers, θ∗ is weakly increasing in D for all
1319   farmers, strictly increasing in D for some farmers, and decreasing in wi . Hence, the repossession rate will
1320   be:                           R R θ̄             R

       Proof. At period t = 1, potential borrowers i will borrow if expected utility from not borrow-
       ing is lower than expected utility from borrowing. The utility potential borrowers receive if
       they do not borrow, denoted as Ū , is equal to their consumption utility across the two periods
       u(c01 ) + u(c02 ) where second-period consumption is c02 = (w − c01 )RD + yi . This is evaluated
       at the consumption profile that maximises expected utility, characterised by the Euler equation
       u0 (c01 ) = RD E(u0 (c02 )). Borrowers, knowing their θi , will allow their tanks to be repossessed
       if they have a low income realization, yi ≤ y R (θi , D). Then, the borrower's expected utility
       from borrowing will be equal to the expectation over all possible income outcomes that in-
       clude income realizations that lead to default, Ud (yi , D; θi ), and that lead to keeping the tank,
       Ur (yi , D; θi ). This will exceed the expected utility from not borrowing, and thus the individual
       will choose a savings amountt S (and thus a c1 ) and borrow, if
                                                                                                                                   !

         U (D, wi , θi ) = max              Ud (yi , S, D; θi , wi )fY (yi )dyi +            Ur (yi , S, D; θi , wi )fY (yi )dyi
                           S≥D     Y                                                yiR

                                                                                                                    ≥ U (wi ). (28)

1321   Note that the value Ud (yi , S, D; θi , wi ) depends on whether D is sufficiently large to preclude
1322   negative equity repossession. Since we consider only borrowers who can always repay the tank,
1323   the utility cost of repayment for a borrower of a given wealth level with a given deposit require-
1324   ment is finite. Thus for any borrower we consider, there is some θrepay ∈ [0, ∞) for which she
1325   repays the loan with nonzero probability. As is shown below, utility from borrowing is continu-
1326   ous, increasing, and weakly convex in θ whenever there is a nonzero probability of repayment
1327   (that is, whenever θ > θrepay ). Furthermore, borrowers who do not value tank ownership are
1328   strictly worse off borrowing. Thus, for all w ∈ [W , W ], there exists a marginal tank valuation,
1329   denoted by θ∗ (D, w) ∈ [0, ∞), where a potential borrower with wealth w would be indifferent
1330   regarding whether to borrow. θ∗ (D, w) need not be within the support of θ for all w, but under
1331   our assumptions, for every D ∈ [0, P ] there is a range of w for which θ∗ (D, w) ∈ [θ, θ]. Higher
1332   valued potential borrowers will borrow while lower valued potential borrowers will not. Thus,
1333   the mass of potential borrowers with a fixed w who borrow is given by 1 − Fθ (θ∗ (D, w)), with
                                        R θ̄
1334   the mass of defaults given by θ∗ (D,w) FY (y R (θ, S)fθ (θ)dθ. Integrating over the distribution of w
1335   gives the population borrowing and default rates. To show the proposition’s claims about the
1336   derivatives of θ∗ , we proceed in five steps. First, we show that overall utility given S, D, w and
1337   θ is continuously differentiable in all of its arguments. Next we use that fact to demonstrate
1338   that S ∗ (D, w, θ), the optimal amount of savings, is continuously differentiable in its arguments
1339   for almost all farmers. From there, we show that overall utility from borrowing and optimizing
1340   savings, U ∗ (D, w, θ) is continuously differentiable in all of its arguments almost everywhere.
1341   Having shown this, we prove proposition 4, that U ∗ is weakly decreasing in D for all farmers

                                                                  55
1342   and strictly decreasing in D for some farmers even in the case of positive equity loans. Lastly,
1343   we use the last two facts to prove the remaining parts of proposition 3.
1344     Claim 1: Overall utility from borrowing Uoverall (θ, w, S, D), given a savings level S, is continuously
1345   differentiable in each of its arguments.

       Proof. Overall utility is given by
                                         Z   y R (S,D,θ)
            Uoverall = u(wi − S) +                         [u(c2,def ault (S, D, y)) − M ]fy (y)dy
                                         Y
                                                                             Z    Y
                                                                        +                    [u(y + RD S − RT P ) + θ]fy (y)dy. (29)
                                                                               y R (S,D,θ)

1346   The proofs of claims one and two assume that y R 6= Y and y R 6= Y . We will show at the end of
1347   the proof of claim two that these cases occur for only a zero-measure set of farmers.
         The right hand side of equation 28 is trivially differentiable in wi , with derivative u0 (wi − S),
       which is continuous. By proposition 1, y R is continuously differentiable in all of its arguments.
       Lastly, u is continuously differentiable in c2 , and in cases of both repayment and repossession,
       c2 is continuously differentiable with respect to S and D. Thus by Leibniz’ rule, the expression is
       differentiable with respect to S, D, and θ. Noting that the envelope theorem gives that changes
       in y R are second-order, we have

1348   The continuity of each of these expressions is immediate from the fact that u’ is continuous and
1349   the fundamental theorem of calculus.41

1350      Claim 2: Optimal savings S ∗ (D, w, θ) is continuously differentiable in all of its arguments for almost

1356   which is also continuous.
1357     It is also immediate from equation 30 that ∂Uoverall
                                                         ∂S   is continuously differentiable with respect
1358   to w. Using all of these facts, and the fact that

                                                        ∂2
                                                            Uoverall < 0                                      (43)
                                                       ∂S 2
1359   for all S, we can apply the implicit function theorem to derive that Smax is continuously differ-
1360   entiable with respect to D, w, and θ.
1361      If Smax > D, S ∗ = Smax , and so we have that S ∗ is continuously differentiable with respect to
1362   D, w, and θ. If Smax < D, S ∗ = D. Since marginal changes in D, w, and θ still leave Smax < D, S ∗
1363   has constant derivative 0 with respect to w and θ and one with respect to D whenever Smax < D.
1364   S ∗ may fail to be continuously differentiable when Smax = D. However, note that ∂S∂w      max
                                                                                                      > 0
1365   where it exists. This follows from the fact that Uoverall is concave in S and (as can be seen in
1366   equation 28), the marginal utility of S is increasing in w. Furtheremore, at the points where
1367   Smax is not differentiable with respect to w (in particular, the w values for which y R is equal to
1368   Y or Y ), it is both left and right-differentiable, with negative semi-derivatives. Thus, given θ,
1369   Smax = D holds for at most one value of w, and thus for a zero measure of borrowers.
                      R
1370      Similarly, ∂y                                                        R
                         ∂θ is negative where it exists. At both Y and Y , y is both left and right differ-
1371   entiable with respect to θ with negative semi-derivatives. Since changes in w don’t affect y R
1372   directly, this implies that in the case of constrained savings (Smax < D,) y R = Y or y R = Y for
1373   any w for only a zero measure (two-element) set of θ. Furthermore, in the unconstrained case,
1374   changes in w affect y R only through changes in Smax . Since Smax is increasing in w everywhere,
       ∂y R (S ∗ )
1375
          ∂θ       is negative where it exists. Similarly at both Y and Y , y R is both left and right differen-
1376   tiable with respect to w with negative semi-derivatives. Thus in the unconstrained case, y R is
1377   equal to one of its endpoints for only a zero-measure set of w given any θ. Thus, given any D,
1378   there is are at most two values of θ for which y R is equal to one of its endpoints for more than a
1379   zero-measure set of w. Thus the claim is proven.

1380     Claim 3:Let U ∗ (D, w, θ) denote total utility from borrowing with optimized savings. U ∗ is continu-
1381   ously differentiable in all of its arguments whenever Smax 6= D, y R 6= Y , and y R 6= Y .



                                                              58
1382   Proof. Note that
                                    U ∗ (D, w, θ) = Uoverall (D, S ∗ (D, w, θ), w, θ).                       (44)
1383   Thus differentiability is immediate from claims one and two, and

                                     ∂ ∗             ∂Uoverall ∂S ∗ ∂Uoverall
                                       U (D, w, θ) =               +          .                              (45)
                                    ∂w                 ∂S ∗ ∂w        ∂w
1384   And analogous expressions hold for the derivatives with respect to θ and D. Recall that we
1385   either have S ∗ = Smax or S ∗ = D. If S ∗ = Smax , then ∂U∂S
                                                                 overall
                                                                    ∗    = 0, and

                                             ∂ ∗              ∂Uoverall
                                                U (D, w, θ) =                                                (46)
                                             ∂x                 ∂x
1386   for each variable x ∈ {D, θ, w}. Thus continuous differentiability follows from claim 1. If S ∗ =
              ∗    ∂S ∗
       D, ∂S                                                       ∗
1387
            ∂w = ∂θ = 0, and thus we can again ignore the S in the relevant derivative, and so
1388   continuous differentiability with respect to w and θ again follows immediately from claim 1. If
                   ∗
1389   S ∗ = D, ∂S
                ∂D = 1, so
                                     ∂ ∗              ∂Uoverall ∂Uoverall
                                       U (D, w, θ) =           +           ,                        (47)
                                    ∂D                  ∂S ∗         ∂D
1390   and continuous differentiability follows from claims 1 and 2.

1391     Claim 4 (Proposition 4): Potential borrowers with θi > θ∗ (D, w) who are definitely credit con-
1392   strained will have S = D, and they would be strictly better off with a lower required deposit. Moreover, if
1393   repossessions are negative equity, potential borrowers with a nonzero chance of default are also better off
1394   with a lower deposit irrespective of whether they are credit constrained. In the case of positive equity or
1395   zero probability of default, borrowers who are not credit constrained are indifferent to marginal changes
1396   in D. Trivially, those with θi < θ∗ (D) are also indifferent to marginal changes in D since they do not
1397   borrow.

1398   Proof. Recall from the proof of claim 3 that for non-credit-constrained borrowers (those who set
1399   S ∗ > D,)
                                                  ∂U ∗   ∂Utotal
                                                       =         .                                   (48)
                                                  ∂D       ∂D
1400   It is thus immediate from equation 32 that U ∗ is unchanging in D in the positive equity case and
1401   decreasing in D in the negative equity case. For credit-constrained borrowers (those who set
1402   S ∗ = D), we have
                                           ∂U ∗    ∂Utotal ∂Uoverall
                                                =          +          .                              (49)
                                            ∂D       ∂D         ∂S ∗
1403   The first term in this expression is zero in the positive equity case and negative in the negative
1404   equity case. To sign the second term, recall that borrowers are credit-constrained if and only if

                                                      Smax < D,                                              (50)

1405   where Smax is the unique point at which ∂U∂S
                                                 total
                                                       = 0. But since Utotal is concave in S, this means
             ∗                       ∂Uoverall
1406   that S = D > Smax implies ∂S ∗ < 0. Thus the expression is strictly negative in both the
1407   positive and negative equity cases.


                                                           59
1408        Proof of Proposition 3

1409   Proof. We have that
                                               ∂U ∗
                                                     = 1 − F (y R )                                  (51)
                                                ∂θ
1410   for all levels of θ. Since borrowers are strictly worse off borrowing if they have a repayment
1411   probability of zero, θ = θ∗ implies that F (y R ) < 1. This fact, along with claim 3, allows us to
1412   apply the implicit function theorem, giving that θ∗ is continuously differentiable in D and w
1413   whenever Smax 6= D, y R 6= Y and y R 6= Y . It is at this point that we invoke assumption A,
1414   which states that Smax = D or y R = Y at θ∗ for at most a zero-measure set of w. (Note that
1415   we can never have y R = Y at θ∗ , since borrowers who will always default are strictly worse off
1416   borrowing). Thus continuous differentiability in D and w holds for all but a zero-measure set
1417   of w. Since U ∗ is increasing in w faster than U is, θ∗ is decreasing in w. 42 For those farmers
1418   for whom U ∗ is strictly decreasing in D, θ∗ is increasing in D. For those farmers for whom U ∗ is
1419   unchanging in D, θ∗ is unchanging in D.
1420     For a fixed w, the repossession rate is decreasing in the deposit requirement D, because θ∗ is
1421   increasing in D (adverse selection) and y R is decreasing in D (moral hazard).
1422



1423



1424        Assumption A:
1425     Smax = D or y R = Y at θ∗ for at most a zero-measure set of w, and at w∗ for at most a zero-measure
1426   set of θ.
1427     Although Smax is increasing in w, it may be increasing in θ. But θ∗ is decreasing in w. It is thus
1428   possible, in principle, that Smax = D could hold at θ∗ for a nonzero-measure set of w. In such
1429   a case, the profit function could fail to be differentiable. However, this condition would require
1430   peculiar behavior: by the existence of credit-constrained borrowers, Smax < D, at (W , θ∗ (W )).
1431   Thus in order for Smax to be equal to D for a positive-measure set of w, one of two things would
1432   need to happen. In one case Smax (θ∗ ) would need to be increasing or decreasing in w until it hits
1433   D, at which point its derivative with respect to w would need to be exactly zero for an interval
1434   of w’s. In the other case, Smax would need to bounce above and below D so pathologically as
1435   w increases as to be equal to D at an uncountable number of points. (Analogous behavior could
1436   yield that Smax = D at w∗ for a nonzero-measure set of θ, where w∗ is as defined below.) We
1437   have no reason to think this bizarre behavior is especially probable, and thus reasonable priors
1438   are that the parameters are almost always such that assumption A holds. Exactly analogous
1439   logic holds for the y R = Y case.
1440        Derivative of Expected Profit
       42
            That U ∗ is increasing in w faster than U is follows from the fact that borrowers always have lower second-period
            consumption than non-borrowers, and thus higher savings. The result is thus immediate from the envelope theo-
            rem.




                                                                  60
1441   Proof. To show that expected profit is continuously differentiable in D whenever D 6= DF , it is
1442   convenient to change the order of integration to
                        (Z Z                                                                 )
                            θ  W
                                       Πr − F (y R (θ, S ∗ (w, D), D))Ld (D) fw (w)fθ (θ)dθdw .
                                                                           
             E(Π(D)) =                                                                            (52)
                            θ   w∗ (D,θ)


1443   Note that the existence of a w∗ for every θ follows from two facts. First limw→∞ U ∗ −U = θ, since
1444   as w grows, repayment probability approaches one and the consumption differential between
1445   borrowers and non-borrowers approaches an infinitesimal share of consumption. Secondly,
1446   limw→D U ∗ − U = −∞, since consumption is always lower in the case of borrowing.
1447      Because optimal savings is always changing in w, but not always changing in θ, it simplifies
1448   the proof to change the order of integration and consider w∗ rather than θ∗ . However, we will
1449   show at the end of the proof that the resulting expression for the derivative of expected profits
1450   is equal to the one used in the body of the paper.
1451     Consider the functions Z : R3 → R and H : R2 → R3 defined by

1453     Note that                                        Z    θ
                                           E(Π(D)) =               Z(H(D))fθ (θ)dθ.                    (55)
                                                           θ


1454     We proceed by demonstrating the continuous differentiability of various terms in Z and H
1455   using the implicit function theorem. Assume for the below (through equation 64) that y R is
1456   not equal to either of the endpoints of its support. Consider first the case of credit-constrained
1457   borrowers, who have Smax < D and thus set S ∗ = D. Define F1 : R4 → R1 , which we will use
1458   to define y R given a fixed w, θ and D. Set

                         F1 (y, w, θ, D) = θi + M + u(y + RD D − RT P ) − u(c2,def ault ).             (56)

1459     The total differential dF1 is represented by
                                  h                                                          i
                                                                            ∂c2,def ault 0
                                   u0r − u0d 0 1 RD (u0r − u0d ) −              ∂D      ud       ,     (57)

1460   where u0r denotes the marginal utility of consumption under repayment, u0 (y R + RD D − RT P ),
1461   and u0d the marginal utility of consumption under default, u0 (c2,def ault ). It can be verified that
1462   each entry in dF1 is continuous in (y, w, θ, D)-space, and thus F1 is continuously differentiable
1463   over R4 . Furthermore, u0r − u0d > 0. Thus by the implicit function theorem, y R is continuously
1464   differentiable with respect to (w, θ, D), and thus also with respect to each individual term in this
1465   vector.

                                                                   61
1466    In order to show continuous differentiability of w∗ , we define a new function G1 : R4 → R2
1467   which can be used to jointly determine y R and w∗ for a fixed θ and D. We define
                                                                                       
                                         θi + M + u(y + RD D − RT P ) − u(c2,def ault )
                     G1 (y, w, θ, D) =                                                    .     (58)

1471   given by u0 (w−D), and u0n denotes the marginal utility of first-period wealth for non-borrowers,
1472   given by u0 (w−Sn ), where Sn satisfies the non-borrower’s euler equation. It can again be shown
1473   that each entry in dG1 is continuous as a function of (y, w, θ, D) and and thus dG1 is continuous.

1475   Since nonborrowers save less than borrowers with the same initial wealth level, this expression
1476   is always positive, and thus the matrix is invertible. Thus we can apply the implicit function
1477   theorem to derive that y R and w∗ , when defined jointly, are continuously differentiable with

1484   This expression is also negative.
1485     Thus in all cases such that D 6= DF , Smax 6= D, y R 6= Y , and y R 6= Y , S ∗ , y R , and w∗ are
1486   continuously differentiable with respect to (S ∗ , y R , w, θ, D). With this established, we can move
1487   to the continuous differentiability of the component functions of profit.
1488      We return now to consideration of the functions, Z and H, that we defined above. Much of
1489   the remainder of the proof is built around an extension of Leibniz’ integral rule that states that
1490   if a function f (w, t) is measurable and integrable over w, and is differentiable in t for all but a
1491   zero-measure set of w’s inR the interval A, with derivative bounded onR A in absolute value by an
1492   integrable function, then A f (w, t) is differentiable with derivative A f 0 (w, t). (Billingsley 1995)
         We claim, given this result, that Z is continuously differentiable in D and θ for all but two
       possible θ values. These are the values at which y R = Y and y R = Y for more than a zero-
       measure set of w. Call them θU and θL , respectively.   To see Rthat Z∗ is continuously differentiable
                                                                                                 
       for all other θ, recall that we showed above that Πr − F (y (θ, S (w, D), D))Ld (D) is continu-
       ously differentiable with respect to (w, θ, D) whenever Smax 6= D, y R = Y and y R = Y . Recall
       from claim two of the proof of proposition three that for a given θ, one of these conditions holds
       for at most three w (call them ω1 , ω2 , and ω3 .). By the leibniz’ rule extension, we thus have
       differentiability of Z as long as the derivatives of

                                         Πr − F (y R (θ, S ∗ (w, D), D))Ld (D)

1493     Every term in this expression except for ∂y                                      ∂y
                                                   ∂D is trivially bounded. But note that ∂D can take
1494   one of two values: the value for the unconstrained case in which the borrower saves Smax or the
1495   value for the constrained case in which the borrower saves D. We have already shown that both
1496   of these expressions are continuous in w, and thus are bounded in absolute value on [W , W ].
               R
1497   Thus ∂y
             ∂D , and so the whole expression of interest, is bounded in absolute value by a constant
1498   (and therefore integrable) function.
                                                               2
       43
            In that case we labeled this whole expression as ∂ U∂S

                              ∗
            as a function of S rather than determining their derivatives jointly.

1499        Thus Z is continuously differentiable in D whenever θ 6= θL and θ 6= θU , and in particular,

1502   which is continuous with respect to (w0 , θ, D).44
1503     From our results above, we also have that H is continuously differentiable whenever θ and D
1504   are such that Smax 6= D at w∗ and y R is not equal to one of the endpoints of its support. Recall
1505   that assumption A ensures that w∗ is not so pathological that for some D, Smax (w∗ ) = D, y R = Y
1506   or y R = Y for a nonzero mass of θ. By a similar argument to that which we used to show the
                           R
                                              ∂w∗
1507   boundedness of ∂y∂D , we have that ∂D is bounded in absolute value over the set of all θ ∈ [θ, θ]
1508   such that Smax (w∗ ) 6= D, y R 6= Y , and y R 6= Y .
         Putting these together, we derive that Z ◦ H is continuously differentiable in R2 for all but a

1509      That the second line of this expression (integrated over θ) is equal to the analogous expressions
1510   in the body of the paper is immediate from a change in the order of integration. To see that the
1511   first line is equal to the analogous expression in the body of the paper, consider the function
       44
            Technically, Z could fail to be differentiable when w∗ is equal to one of the endpoints of its support. However, w∗
            is strictly decreasing in θ, and so this can occur for only a zero-measure set of θ. Thus as with other zero-measure
            discontinuity points (we won’t repeat another argument along these lines given the frequency with which they
            appear in this proof), we can work around this.

1519     Lemma 1. The profit-maximizing deposit ratio will be such that there is some non-zero probability of
1520   repossession.

       Proof. Assume for contradiction that D∗ is such that the overall probability of repossession is
       zero. Let P(D, w) denote the probability of an individual with initial wealth level w borrowing
       and defaulting when the deposit requirement is D. Let Ω0 denote the set of all w such that
       repossession occurs with nonzero probability for D = D∗ . Recalling that we have assumed the
       probability of repossession is zero when the deposit level is D∗ , we have
                                                                      Z   w
                                                                 0=           P(D∗ , w)dw                                    (71)
                                                                       w
                                                                      Z
                                                                  =           P(D∗ , w)dFw                                   (72)

       By definition, for any w ∈ Ω0 ,
                                                                      P(D∗ , w) > 0.

                                                                                    =⇒ µ(Ωc0 ) = 1.

       Note that Ωc0 , the complement of Ω0 , is the set of all w such that P(D∗ , w) = 0

Note: Milk volumes in liters per month. Reported means are across all six loan groups.
The F-stat tests for equality of means across all six loan groups. Certain time use vari-
ables are omitted due to space constraints. One excluded time use variable (socializing
with neighbors) has a significant F-test statistic. Including the ten omitted time use
variables, we conduct baseline checks on 39 variables. Standard errors are clustered at
the household level when necessary.

     repossession p value
     4% deposit = 25% deposit or guarantor

      Note: Tank repossession and loan non-recovery data include loans from the original sample and out of sample
      groups. Of the three tank repossessions in the 4% group, one repossession was in the original sample while two were
      in the out-of-sample group. 25% deposit or guarantor refers to the aggregate of the 25% deposit and 21% guarantor,
      4% deposit groups. 95% Clopper-Pearson exact confidence intervals are displayed in parentheses under the point
      estimates for each of the rates. One-sided tests were conducted for cases with zero repossessions. Treatment effect
      on repossession is obtained by conducting Fishers Exact Test for the difference between rates of 4% deposit and
      25% deposit or guarantor groups. Note that including the additional 152 loans the Nyala cooperative has offered
      independently, the p-value is 0.0362.
