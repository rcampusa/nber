We link industry-level data on trade and offshoring with individual-level worker data from the Current
Population Surveys from 1984 to 2002. We find that occupational exposure to globalization is associated
with significant wage effects, while industry exposure has no significant impact. We present evidence
that globalization has put downward pressure on worker wages through the reallocation of workers
away from higher wage manufacturing jobs into other sectors and other occupations. Using a panel
of workers, we find that occupation switching due to trade led to real wage losses of 12 to 17 percentage
points.

I.        Introduction

          Between 1983 and 2002, the United States economy experienced a boom in offshoring

and a doubling of imports of manufactured goods from low-income countries. Over this same

period, roughly 6 million jobs were lost in manufacturing and income inequality increased

sharply. These parallel developments led some critics of globalization to conclude that “good”

manufacturing jobs had been shipped overseas, putting downward pressure on wages of middle-

class American workers. Concern over these developments motivated the US Congress to pass

the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Yet the degree to which changes in the US labor

market are related to growth in international trade and offshoring is still the subject of heated

debate.

          The standard approach to identifying effects of import competition on wages is to use

variation in the prices (or quantities) of imported goods across industries over time as an

exogenous shock and examine the impact on industry-specific labor market outcomes. This

approach has been used to measure the impact of globalization on industry wage differentials and

to measure the effects of sector-specific import competition on wages and employment. For

example, Feenstra and Hanson (1999) use a two-step procedure, first identifying the impact of

outsourcing and high technology investments on productivity and prices and then tracing through

the impact of induced productivity and price changes on relative wages among production and

non-production workers. Using data for the US manufacturing sector between 1979 and 1990,

they find that the real wages of production workers were probably unaffected by offshoring

activities, while the real wages of non-production workers increased by 1 to 2 percentage points.

Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2006), in the first paper to distinguish between imports from high-




                                                  1
income versus low-income countries, find that only low-income imports negatively affected firm

exit, survival, and employment growth.

         A key limitation of the previous literature on the labor market effects of globalization is

that it typically focuses on changes within manufacturing. In this paper, we focus on potential

wage impacts across occupations, both within manufacturing and across the broader economy. In

a typical occupation, some workers are in tradeable sectors (e.g. manufacturing), and others are

in non-tradable sectors (e.g. fast food services). To expand our analysis of wage outcomes due to

globalization beyond manufacturing, we begin by defining the concept of occupational exposure

to international trade or offshoring activities.1 Inasmuch as the demand for a particular worker’s

skill is affected by trade, those who are working in either the tradable or non-tradable goods (or

services) sector could be hurt by foreign competition. Also, if occupational tenure and

experience is a more important determinant of wages than industry experience, then focusing on

exposure at the industry level may understate the costs of globalization.

         In order to examine this empirically, we link industry-level data on trade and offshoring

with individual-level worker data from the Current Population Surveys. We find a significant

divergence between the impact of occupational exposure and industry exposure to globalization

on wage outcomes. In particular, we find no significant negative effects of either international

trade or offshoring on wages of all types of workers if we measure globalization at the industry

level. When we focus on occupational exposure and include workers in both manufacturing and

services, however, we find large and significant effects. Our analysis indicates that workers in

routine occupations, such as those employed in “blue-collar” production occupations, have

suffered the greatest losses from globalization. These results are consistent with recent empirical

1
    We are greatly indebted to Gordon Hanson for suggesting this idea.


                                                   2
work demonstrating the importance of occupational tenure and downplaying the importance of

tenure within a particular industry for a worker’s wages (Kambourov and Manovskii 2009a and

2009b).2

          We also explore how the impact of globalization has changed over time. A number of

scholars have suggested that wage pressure from developing countries is likely to have increased

during the 1990s. Feenstra (2008) singles out expanded competition from China as having

exerted pressure on US wages, and he is not alone in this view (see also Freeman (1995) and

Krugman (2008)). Empirical evidence for this conjecture is limited, however. 3 We find that

while the impact of trade and offshoring on US wages through the mid-1990s was small in

magnitude and insignificant, the effects became much larger in the second half of the 1990s. By

the end of our sample period in 2002, we find significant and economically important effects of

globalization on wages using our occupational exposure measure. Based on our study, it is likely




2
    Kambourov and Manovskii (2009a) find that ”returns to occupational tenure are substantial.”

They also indicate that “when occupational experience is taken into account, tenure with an

industry or employer has relatively little importance in accounting for the wage one receives.

This finding is consistent with human capital being occupation specific.” Their results imply

that switching occupations will have a much greater impact on worker wages than switching

industries.
3
    One important exception is Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2012), who exploit differences in US

regional exposure to import competition from China to show significant effects on employment,

unemployment and wages during the 1990 through 2007 period.


                                                 3
that the impact of globalization on US wages in the post-2002 period has increased further as

more firms have engaged in offshoring to low wage destinations.4

          We examine the impact of globalization on US workers by focusing attention on how

workers are affected by imports, exports, and offshoring to low and high income countries. Our

results indicate that a ten percent increase in occupational exposure to import competition is

associated with nearly a 3.0 percent decline in real wages for workers who perform routine tasks

among workers in our 1984-2002 sample, and a 4.4 percent decline for workers taken from

1997-2002.5 We also find substantial wage effects of offshoring to low wage countries: a ten

percentage point increase in occupation-specific exposure to overseas employment in low wage

countries is associated with a 0.7 percent decline in real wages for workers performing routine

tasks for our entire sample, and a 2.0 percent decline for 1997-2002. For routine occupations

with significant export activity, wages are positively linked to export growth. For these workers,

a ten percentage point increase in export share at the occupation level is associated with a 6.7

percentage point increase in wages over the sample period. For the end of the period (1997-




4
    Since the CPS changed its occupational coding scheme in 2003, analysis beyond 2002 is not

attempted in this paper. Analysis by the authors of Bureau of Economic Analysis data indicates

that offshoring to low wage countries has increased markedly since 2002, with employment in

low income countries (e.g. China) exceeding that of high wage countries.
5
    This finding is consistent with recent work highlighting the differential impact of offshoring by

worker skill type. Hummels, Jøgensen, Munch and Xiang (2011) use matched worker and firm

data from Denmark and find that offshoring raises skilled worker wages but lowers unskilled

worker wages, while exporting raises the wages of all types of workers.


                                                   4
2002), every percentage point increase in export shares for routine workers is associated with a

percentage point increase in wages.

         We also find that globalization has put downward pressure on worker wages through the

reallocation of workers away from higher paid manufacturing sectors towards other sectors, and

through a shift of workers out of trade-vulnerable occupations. First, we find that domestic

employment has declined in industries with expansion in low income country employment,

consistent with evidence that multinational firms have shifted production overseas.6 Then, using

a subset of the CPS data where we are able to match the same worker over time, we estimate a

first stage equation with the exposure of an occupation to trade as an instrument for whether or

not a worker switched occupations. In the second stage, we find that occupation switching due to

trade led to real wage losses of 12 to 17 percentage points between 1984 and 2002.7 Any analysis

6
    Our results corroborate results on employment declines within manufacturing by Harrison and

McMillan (2011) who use firm-level data on multinational manufacturing firms, but stand in

contrast to Desai, Foley, and Hines (2009). Desai, Foley, and Hines do not distinguish between

high wage and low wage affiliate employment and find that offshoring is unambiguously

positive for US employment.
7
    Other scholarship has documented the cost of trade-induced shifts in employment. Menezes-

Filho and Muendler (2011) use a Brazilian trade reform to document significant short run costs

to workers and sticky intersectoral labor reallocation. Artuc, Chaudhuri and McLaren (2010)

develop a theoretical model which shows that adjustment costs for workers are likely to be

significant and can explain why there is likely to be sluggish reallocation and short-term negative

wage effects on workers under trade liberalization. Cosar (2011) also explores sluggish labor

market adjustments by developing a two-sector small open economy overlapping generations


                                                 5
of the wage effects of globalization which is restricted to only manufacturing workers would

miss the downward pressure on wages resulting from workers leaving manufacturing and

entering the service sector. The associated distributional implications are potentially important,

given historically large wage premia paid to manufacturing (relative to service) workers in the

United States (see Figure 1 for a graphical exposition) and significant empirical evidence that

industries compensate workers differently.8 It is also worth noting that our results are unlikely to

be explained by the fact that weaker workers are more likely to switch occupations (Trefler and

Lui (2011)). When we control for unobserved differences in worker quality among those who

switch occupations, we continue to find suggestive results that the wage declines associated with

globalization are due to workers switching occupations.

         An important limitation of our study (and other papers in this literature) is that we are

unable to fully separate the impact of trade and offshoring from other changes in the labor

market. Two primary identification challenges exist. First, it may be that trade and offshoring are

the result of changes in the domestic labor market. For example, if firms choose to move

operations offshore in response to changes in the domestic labor market (e.g. unions), this

reverse causality would invalidate the causal interpretation of our results. Second, it may be that

technological change is correlated with trade in a manner preventing causal interpretation of our

coefficient estimates. For example, if more routine tasks are more easily performed overseas or

automated, we will be unable to accurately characterize the counterfactual of how wages would

have evolved in the absence of globalization. Insofar as some workers face competitive pressure


model which is calibrated to Brazilian data. The paper finds that human capital is a much bigger

barrier to labor mobility than search frictions.
8
    See for example Katz and Summers (1989) and Krueger and Summers (1988).


                                                   6
from low-wage workers in foreign countries and automation, it will be difficult to separately

identify the impact of either exposure. We attempt to address these concerns in several ways.

First, by combining industry level trade or offshoring data with individual level information on

wages and worker characteristics, we hope to side-step the issue of reverse causality since it is

difficult for one worker to affect aggregate trade outcomes. Second, we pay considerable

attention to capturing technological change across industries that could influence both worker

wages and globalization outcomes. We include annual measures of total factor productivity,

capital accumulation, the price of investment goods by industry and computer use rates by

industry and occupation, which represents our best attempt to account for technical change that

could potentially affect workers directly. Third, we explore the robustness of our results to

instrumental variable estimation where we exploit factors that should affect the tradability of

certain good, or the desirability of certain offshore locations (results available in online

appendices). These instruments may themselves be endogenous, however. Consequently, we

focus our attention mainly on results that rely on fixed effects by industry and occupation and the

available control variables to measure the impact of globalization on workers. The focus of this

paper is on the importance of occupation versus industry-level measures of exposure to

globalization, and that focus is important irrespective of identification issues, which will

continue to remain a challenge. In the absence of a “clean” natural experiment or a fully

compelling instrument for the tradability of certain occupations, our results must be interpreted

with appropriate caution.9

9
    In a recent paper, Jensen and Kletzer (2005) attempt to measure the tradability of service sector

goods using an approach which considers the spatial concentration of service industries and

occupations. They posit that more spatially-concentrated industries or occupations are more


                                                   7
          The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes our data, documents broad trends

in trade, offshoring, wages and employment, and presents the empirical specification. Section III

presents our main empirical findings regarding the impact of offshoring and trade on domestic

wages and employment at the occupation versus the industry level. Section IV concludes.



II.       Data Description, Empirical Strategy, and Trends

A.        Data Description

          Our sample of US workers is taken from the Current Population Survey Merged

Outgoing Rotation Groups for 1983-2002, which provides data for over 3.4 million workers who

are assigned a consistent classification for their industry and occupation during the period.10

Offshore activity in each industry is measured by the total employment of foreign affiliates

among multinational US firms, separated into high and low-income affiliate locations, as




tradable, and find evidence consistent with this hypothesis in US data. We chose not to pursue

this strategy, as geographical concentration may reflect other factors, such as state-specific

regulations that lead to clustering of certain industries or occupations.
10
     We would like to express our gratitude to David Autor for providing us with concordances that

provided a consistent coding scheme of industries and occupations for the period. The CPS

occupation and industry codes were reclassified in 2003 to correspond to the North American

Industrial Classification System, which made it difficult to compare data before and after the

change. We begin with 1984 because occupation codes for the 1979 through 1981 period are not

consistent with the classification for later years and we use lags in our empirical specification

which leads us to drop 1983.


                                                  8
collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).11 Our data on import penetration and

export shares are taken from Bernard at al. (2006), which we recalculated and updated through

2002. Since relative price series for imports and exports are incomplete, we substitute for prices

by using the share of exports in production and import penetration at the four-digit SIC 1987

level.12 We control for productivity changes that could also affect labor demand as well as wages

using the NBER’s calculations of total factor productivity provided by Wayne Gray. This data

source also provides us with measures of the prices of investment goods, capital to labor ratios,

and the real price of shipments by industry and year.13 These are included in our main

specifications to control for technological change that could also affect wage rates. Lastly, we

match our workers to information on computer use rates by industry and occupation from CPS

computer supplements conducted during our sample period (1984, 1989, 1993, 1997, 2000).

Using the available surveys, we interpolate and extrapolate computer use rates for the entire

11
     The BEA sample of multi-national firms accounted for 80 percent of total output in

manufacturing in 1980, suggesting that the coverage is fairly extensive. However, using these

data we are unable to distinguish between imports from affiliates (arms-length trade between

firms) and imports from non-affiliates.
12
     Results using prices instead of quantities are available in the online appendix. The results are

qualitatively similar to our main results using quantities.
13
     These data were aggregated from the 4-digit to 3-digit SIC level using the employment

distribution in 1979. The 3-digit SIC level was converted to our industry classification scheme

using a concordance provided by David Autor that was a census-based scheme that consistently

defined industries for our sample period. A similar method was used to match CPS workers to

the trade data.

window.14 Summary statistics for the individual worker sample matched to our offshoring, trade,

technology, and price data are available in Table A1.

          We use Autor et al.’s (2003) distinction between routine and non-routine tasks to allow

us to separately identify the impact of different measures of globalization across different types

of workers. To the extent that routine tasks are more easily offshored or replaced with imports,

we would expect globalization to have a larger impact on workers performing these types of

tasks. Autor et al. (2003) describe routine jobs as “tasks that can be expressed using procedural

or ‘rules-based’ logic, that is, codified in a fully specified sequence of logical programming

commands (“If-Then-Do” statements) that designate unambiguously what actions the machine

will perform and in what sequence at each contingency to achieve the desired result.” While

Autor et al. (2003) use routine-ness to designate which jobs can be easily performed by

computers, we would argue that routine jobs are also more readily codified, communicated, and

consequently transferred overseas. Examples of these jobs include attaching hands to faces of

watches, sewing fasteners and decorative trimming to articles, and services tasks that we think of

as offshorable, such as answering telephones.

          Following Autor et al. (2003), we aggregate five different measures of the routine-ness of

tasks into a single index for each occupation k. Two indicators, Routine Manual and Routine

Cognitive, measure the routine-ness of tasks by occupation in each of these dimensions. These

range from 1 for tasks that are not routine to 10 for tasks that are fully routine. The three other

measures are: (1) Direction, Control, and Planning of Activities (DCP) which measures non

routine cognitive tasks (2) Eye, Foot, and Hand coordination (EFH) activities which require non-

routine manual task completion and (3) The Math indicator which measures the quantitative or

14
     These data were also provided by David Autor and are used in Autor et al. (1998).


                                                  10
analytical reasoning skills required. The index of routine-ness by worker education level,

industry, and year is given by:

                                       Routine Cognitive k  Routine Manual k
             Routine k                                                                   .
                           Routine Cognitive k  Routine Manual k  DCPk  EFH k  Math k

          The index ranges from 0 to 1.15 The last three terms DCP, EFH and Math refer to

cognitive tasks that are higher order in their complexity, and presumably are associated with

larger costs of performing outside of a firm’s central location.



B.        Empirical Strategy

          Our empirical strategy is to regress log wages of worker i in industry j in period t (Wijt) on

lagged measures of exposure to offshoring and international trade (Git-1j) using annual data from

1983 to 2002, first at the industry level and subsequently at the occupation level, which we will

define below. This paper examines the impact of globalization (i.e. offshoring and trade) on

wages, and the domestic labor market response to offshoring and trade in the short run. After

controlling for all observables such as education, age, sex, ethnicity and experience, workers in a

frictionless world could costlessly move from one industry or occupation to another. We test this

hypothesis and find that barriers exist at the occupation but not at the industry level.


15
     See Autor et al. (2003) for a thorough description of these variables. Our calculation of routine

is the sum of routine manual tasks (Finger Dexterity) and routine non-manual (Set Limits,

Tolerances or Standards), as a share of those tasks and non-routine manual (Eye, Hand, Foot),

non-routine analytic (General Educational Development, Mathematics), and non-routine

interactive (Direction, Control and Planning) tasks. More details on this classification scheme are

available in the online appendix.


                                                   11
          We use lagged measures of exposure to offshoring and trade for two reasons. First, since

offshoring requires time to implement, and wage adjustment is not instantaneous, it is unlikely

that the causal effect of offshoring on wages will play out within a single calendar year. Second,

within a given year, offshoring, trade exposure, and wages are likely to be affected by

simultaneous shocks. We use four measures of exposure to offshoring and international trade:

offshoring to low-income affiliate locations, offshoring to high-income affiliate locations, export

shares, and import penetration. To allow for the possibility that offshoring to low-income

locations might have different effects than offshoring to high-income locations, we include as

separate regressors the log of employment in sector j by US-based multinationals in low and

high-income countries.

          There are three additional challenges to identifying the causal effect of globalization on

wages. First, the industries that are most likely to globalize may also be those with lower wages

or greater volatility. We address this concern by including industry fixed effects (Ij) in our

specification. Second, globalization and wages may be jointly affected by common time-varying

shocks, such as the business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations. We control for these by

including time fixed effects (dt). Third, we control for time-varying shocks at the industry level

that could be confounded with changes in globalization by adding a number of additional

controls. TFPjt-1 captures changes in productivity by industry and year that could affect demand

for labor.16 We also attempt to capture productivity changes including two (arguably) exogenous

measures, the price of investment goods and computer use rates. The price of investment goods

PINVjt-1 captures in part the role of falling computer prices and the potential impact of labor-

16
     Since total factor productivity is a function of wages, we estimate our equations with and

without total factor productivity. The results are similar with and without controlling for TFP.


                                                   12
saving technology on labor market outcomes. We also control for industry factor intensity

(lagged capital to labor ratio KLRATIOjt-1) and computer use rates by industry and year (COMPjt)

to account for contemporaneous changes in an industry’s wage rate based on the ability to

substitute for labor with computers.17 Finally, we control for individual characteristics including

age, sex, race, experience, education, and location (Zijt):

(1a ) Wijt   0 Z ijt   1G jt 1   2 TFP jt 1   3 PINV jt 1   4 KLRATIO      jt 1     5 COMP jt   6 d t   7 I j   ijt .

          To examine the relationship between wages and globalization at the occupation level, we

retain the same setup as in (1a) but modify the G vector to create a measure of occupational

exposure to offshoring or trade. Each variable in the G vector was created from a merged dataset

of BEA offshore employment data, trade data, and CPS monthly outgoing rotation group

individual-level data, by industry and year. We calculate for each occupation its exposure to

trade using the distribution of workers employed in this occupation across industries in 1983.

                                                                         Lkj83
For each occupation k and industry j, we have:  kj83                            where Lkj83 is the total number of

workers in occupation k and industry j in 1983, and Lk 83 is the total number of workers across all

industries in occupation k. We then calculate occupation-specific import penetration in year t for

occupation k as:

                                                      J

     Our results are similar if we control for computer use rates in the previous year.

where IMPjt is the measure of import penetration for goods in industry j in year t. We continue to

control for technological changes by industry, and set these technological changes equal to unity

for workers outside of manufacturing.18

         This leads to a specification of the form:

(1b) Wijkt   0 Z ijkt   1G kt1 
 2 TFP jt 1   3 PINV jt 1   4 KLRATIO   jt 1     5 COMPkt   6 d t   7 I j   8Occupation   k     ijkt

where k indexes the worker’s occupation, and workers within the same k occupation may be in

different j industries.19 Our G vector is now an occupation-specific measure for each worker, and

we have added occupation fixed effects to absorb variation specific to time invariant features of

occupations. Note that we also control for variation in computer use rates by occupation and

year, which is meant to account for wage changes driven by the ability of some occupations to

benefit from computer technology (Autor et al. 1998). We will estimate this specification for all

occupations, separately by the degree of how routine the tasks are within a given occupation, and

for samples of workers who switch occupations. One important implicit assumption in our

approach is that barriers to changing occupations are similar across routine and non-routine

occupations. Kambourov and Manovskii (2008) show this to be the case. They also decompose

occupation switching across routine and non-routine occupations and show that between 1968


18
     An alternative approach would be to create occupation-specific measures of each of our

control variables. In the online appendix, we estimate models with occupational-specific

measures of TFP, the price of investment goods, and the capital to labor ratio. The results are

qualitatively similar to the results presented in the main text. These are presented in Table A9.
19
     For workers outside of manufacturing, the control variables for TFP, PIINV, and REALSHIP

are not available and are therefore assumed constant in our main specifications.


                                                               14
and 1997 workers were not able to escape routine occupations by switching into non-routine

ones.



C.      Trends in Offshoring, Trade, Employment, and Wages

        In this section we outline broad trends in the data for employment, wages, and the

relationship between wages and measures of globalization. In Figure 1, we compare the trends in

employment and wages in the manufacturing sector alongside the same trends in the service

sector between 1979 and 2002. We present these trends separately for workers performing

routine and non-routine tasks. Total manufacturing employment (using the CPS employment

numbers) fell from 22 to 17 million from 1979 to 2002, with rapid declines at the beginning of

the early 1980s and in the late 1990s. Within manufacturing, the labor force has become

increasingly high-skilled with a large decline of roughly 6 million in the number of workers in

routine occupations, and a modest increase of roughly 1 million in the number of workers

performing non-routine occupations.

        In contrast, demand for both types of workers continued to grow in the service sector, and

many of the displaced routine manufacturing workers may have found employment in the service

sector. These trends have important implications for the US wage distribution. As shown in the

bottom of Figure 1, where we report the real hourly wage among CPS workers, manufacturing

workers enjoyed a large wage premium during the entire period among both routine and non-

routine workers. Insofar as manufacturing provided an opportunity to earn high relative wages –




                                                15
even for low-skill workers – its decline might also have played a role in increasing US income

inequality during the period.20

          The three panels displaying wage trends exhibit significant differences during the sample

period. Real wages grew in the 1980s, fell or stagnated in the 1990s, and then begin increasing

around 1995-1996. Over the entire period, the gap between manufacturing and service wages

narrowed, particularly from the mid-1990s onwards. These different trends are one factor which

leads us to break our samples into different time periods. We turn now to an examination of how

offshoring and trade may be related to these employment and wage trends within manufacturing

and in the overall economy.

          As shown in Figure 2, foreign affiliate employment in low-income countries by US based

multinationals nearly doubled over the entire sample period, while affiliate employment in high-

income countries remained roughly constant. The increase in developing country activity has

been accompanied by a reduction in the US workforce for these parents from almost 12 million

workers in 1982 to 7 million workers in 2002.
20
     See Autor et al. (2008) for a review of these trends. It is worth noting that while the trends in

Figure 1 are informative, they do not control for other factors that affect income, such as sex,

age, and experience. We redid the trends in wages by educational attainment using wage

residuals. These wage residuals were computed using Lemieux’s (2006) approach for each

educational category separately. We also added industry dummies to control for inter-industry

wage differentials. The wage residuals show similar trends, with falling wage premia for less

educated workers and rising wage premia for more educated workers. Similar results are

observed for wage premia when workers are stratified by routine-ness of occupation. Results are

available from the authors upon request.


                                                    16
          In Figure 3, we report changes in the distribution of occupation wage residuals across the

476 occupations in the CPS. Each point in the figure represents the occupation-specific wage

premium in 1983 and 2002. The wage premium was calculated by taking the residual in a

regression of real log wages on education category dummies, experience category dummies, an

interaction of education and experience, controls for sex, race, year and state.21 These premia

were then collapsed into one term for each occupation and year. In order to compare the

occupational wage residual changes by their potential exposure to offshoring, we stratify

occupations by whether they are above the median occupation in terms of routine task content.

As shown in Figure 3, over the sample period routine occupations were more likely to experience

declines in wage premiums, possibly because these tasks can be performed overseas at lower

cost. Of 240 routine occupations, 187 experienced wage premium declines and only 53 had

increases in their wage premium. In contrast, among 236 non-routine occupations, 134

experienced increases and only 102 experienced declines.

          Before estimating equations (1A) and (1B), in Table 1 we provide a descriptive

regression that is consistent with the results presented in Figure 3. In particular, Table 1 shows

that an industry’s share of routine jobs in 1983 is a good indicator of subsequent offshoring to

low-income locations and increasing import penetration. The dependent variables are the log

difference between 1983 and 2002 in employment offshored to low-income countries (in

columns (1) and (2)) or high-income countries (in columns (3) and (4)) and the change in import

penetration (in columns (5) and (6)). As shown in column (1), an industry’s share of routine jobs

in 1983 is a significant predictor of the subsequent increase in employment offshored to low-

income countries, explaining roughly 7 percent of the variation across industries as a single

                                                  17
regressor. We estimate that industries with 1 percentage point more routine jobs in 1983

experienced a 5.1 percent increase in offshore employment to low-income countries by 2002,

and this result is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. However, in column (3) there is no

significant relationship with offshoring to high-income countries. The significant relationship

between an industry’s share of routine jobs in 1983 and subsequent offshoring to low-income

countries, which stands in contrast to high income country offshoring, is one reason to maintain

the distinction between offshoring to high and low income countries in the subsequent analysis.

       Column (5) shows that the industry share of routine jobs in 1983 is also a significant

predictor of future increases in import penetration. We find a 1.2 percentage point increase in our

import penetration measure among industries with 1 percentage point more routine jobs,

suggesting that industries with more routine jobs have also faced greater import competition. In

columns (2), (4), and (6), we include a range of additional predictors, and continue to find similar

effects for the industry share of routine jobs. Our control variables, which include industry

averages of the price of investment goods, total factor productivity, capital to labor ratios, and

computer use rates, do not qualitatively affect the results.

In the remainder of the paper, we continue to make a distinction between high and low-income

offshore locations, and to differentiate workers by the routine content of their jobs. The patterns

in the figures and Table 1 indicate rising trade and offshoring to low-income countries in

industries with workers whose jobs are characterized by a high routine content.



III.   Offshoring, Trade, and the Impact on Domestic Workers

A.     Wage Impacts of Offshoring and Trade at the Industry versus Occupation Level




                                                  18
          In Table 2, we present our main results showing how the impact of offshoring and trade

are quite different when using industry versus occupation measures of exposure. In the first four

columns, we present our estimates for equation (1A) which defines exposure to trade or

offshoring at the industry level. In the last four columns, we redo the analysis using our

occupation exposure measure, as outlined in equation (1B). We also present the main results

where we stratify the workers based on the routine content of the worker’s occupation, since we

anticipate that routine tasks are more easily monitored offshore than more complex tasks, and so

domestic workers performing these tasks may be more affected by offshoring and trade

(Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg 2008). Note that the standard errors are clustered by industry and

five year period in columns (1) through (4) and by occupation and five year period in the last

four columns. Industry regressions include industry fixed effects and occupation regressions

include occupation as well as industry fixed effects.

          Columns (1) through (4) of Table 2 identify the impact on wages of workers in industries

which were more exposed to international trade or offshoring during the 1984 through 2002

period.22 In these four columns, only workers within the manufacturing sector are included in the

estimation. The results suggest a very limited role for offshoring or trade in explaining log

wages. There is no statistically significant relationship between low-income-affiliate

employment, lagged export share, or lagged import penetration and industry-level wages; indeed,

the point estimates are close to zero. There is a positive and statistically significant relationship

between high-income-affiliate employment and domestic wages, although the magnitude is not

22
     Note that we exclude 1983 for consistency with our occupation results, which can only be

estimated from 1984-2002, since occupation was only coded consistently from 1983 and on, and

we are using lagged measures of our independent variables.


                                                  19
large: the point estimate suggests that a one percent increase in affiliate employment in high

income countries is associated with a 0.01 percent increase in wages, and this is found even for

workers in the most routine occupations. In these first four columns, which rely on differences in

exposure to trade or offshoring across industries, the evidence suggests that trade has no

substantial negative effect on worker wages.

       In columns (5) through (8) of Table 2, we present results from specification (1B) where

we measure exposure to trade or offshoring at the occupation level. The effects of both

offshoring and trade are larger in sign and generally significant at the five percent level, in

contrast to the industry-level results reported in the first four columns. In the first row of column

(5), the coefficient on low-income affiliate employment suggests that a ten percent increase in

employment offshored within an occupation is associated with a 0.4 percent wage reduction for

U.S. workers. For workers in the most routine occupations, we find that a ten percent increase in

low-income affiliate employment abroad is associated with a 0.7 percent decline in domestic

wages, whereas workers in less routine occupations were largely unaffected by offshoring.

Although the magnitude of the effect is small, the results are consistent with an interpretation

that workers in low income locations perform the same tasks that low-skilled workers perform in

the US and are therefore substitutes for workers in the US.

       We also find a positive effect of lagged high-income affiliate employment on wages.

Workers in high-income locations appear to perform tasks that are complementary to workers in

the US and so expansion of employment in high-income countries can benefit domestic workers.

These results are robust to a range of specification choices, including whether we use prices of

imported and exported goods instead of quantities, and our chosen set of control variables, such

as controlling for the real price of shipments by sector to account for variation in product



                                                 20
demand.23 The results are qualitatively similar to the results presented here, and are available in

the online appendix.

          Our results indicate that a ten percent increase in occupational exposure to import

competition is associated with nearly a 3 percent decline in real wages for workers who perform

routine tasks. While some occupations have experienced no increase in import competition (such

as teachers), import competition in other occupations (such as shoe manufacturing) has increased

by as much as 40 percentage points.24 For occupations with significant export activity, wages are

positively linked to export growth. For these workers, a ten percentage point increase in export

share at the occupation level is associated with a 6.6 percentage point increase in wages over the

sample period.

          Krugman (2008) and Feenstra (2008) both hypothesize that the effects of international

trade and offshoring may have increased recently relative to earlier decades. In Table 3, we split

the sample into earlier and later time periods. In particular, we allow the impact of globalization

to vary between 1984 and 1991, and 1992 through 2002 when our sample ends. We also explore

23
     The results indicate that workers with price decreases in their product market have suffered the

largest wage declines, with this pattern most pronounced in routine occupations. Similar to our

core results, however, this effect is only observed using occupational exposure measures of

import price changes. Special thanks to Lawrence Edwards for generous use of his price series

data on imports. Other specifications we have tested include removing measures of TFP and

controlling for price changes in the service sector using a CPI/PPI index, both of which provide

results similar to those presented in Table 2. Likewise, the results including the real price of

shipments are similar to the results in Table 2.
24
     See the online appendix for further information on import exposure by occupation.


                                                   21
whether the impact of globalization varied for female workers, unionized workers, across

education levels, and for different age groups. The results in Table 3 suggest that there is no

significant association between log wages and employment in offshore locations in the early

years of our sample (1984-1991, 1984-1996). However, in the later periods (1992-2002, 1997-

2002) worker wages are negatively and significantly associated with increased offshore

employment in low income affiliate locations. In the years 1997-2002, the coefficient estimates

in the fourth row of Table 3 indicate that a 10 percent increase in low-income affiliate

employment is associated with a one percent decrease in domestic wages. These negative

coefficients contrast with the positive coefficients on high income affiliate employment. For

1997 through 2002, a 10 percent increase in high income affiliate employment is associated with

nearly a 1 percent increase in domestic wages.

       Table 3 also reports the coefficient on lagged imports and exports, measured at the

occupation level. The point estimates for occupation-specific import penetration are statistically

significant across all time periods, with the coefficients ranging from -0.21 to -0.32. These

coefficients indicate that a ten percentage point increase in import penetration is associated with

a wage decline in the exposed occupation of 2 to 3 percent. The coefficients become larger and

more negative in magnitude in the later time periods. The evidence also points to a positive and

significant association between export share and domestic wages, but the point estimates are

positive and significant for export share only in the later part of the sample period.

       In Table 3, we also explore heterogeneity in our results across different demographic

groups. Anecdotes in the popular press and elsewhere suggest that women, union workers, and

older workers may have been disproportionately affected by international competition. If we

restrict the sample to either women or union workers, there is no evidence that their wages were



                                                 22
more negatively affected than the rest of the sample. In fact, the wages of unionized workers

appear to have been relatively unaffected by either export activity or import competition.

However, the wages of workers without higher education and older workers do appear to have

been disproportionately affected by offshoring activities, as the point estimates are larger for

these groups of workers. The estimates in Table 3 indicate that all of the negative and significant

effects of offshore employment and import penetration were concentrated on workers with a high

school education or less.

       Since the results point to much stronger effects of offshore activities on domestic wages

in the later part of the sample period, we reproduce Table 2 for the 1997 through 2002 period in

Table 4. The results confirm that, for the last five years of our sample, offshoring and

international trade exerted much larger effects on occupation-specific wages than the earlier

years. The results also confirm that over the most recent sample period, industry-level wage

effects are negligible. In columns (1) through (4), all but two of the point estimates are

statistically insignificant and the magnitudes are close to zero, indicating offshoring or trade does

not significantly affect industry-level wage premia.

       Columns (5) through (8) suggest that occupation-specific changes in offshoring and trade

are associated with significant wage effects, particularly for workers in the most routine

occupations. For these workers, a ten percent increase in offshoring to low-income countries is

associated with a 2 percent decrease in wages. For the most workers, however, a ten percentage

point increase in high-income affiliate employment is associated with a 1.7 percent increase in

wages. One explanation is that workers in high-income locations perform tasks that are

complementary to routine workers in the US. A one percent increase in export shares is

associated with a one percent increase in wages while a one percent increase in import



                                                 23
penetration is associated with a -0.44 percent decline in wages. The effects of these globalization

measures are generally small in magnitude and insignificant for individuals who work in the

occupations with the least routine content.

          While we control for a number of observables, there are other shocks which might be

difficult to control for and could affect workers in routine occupations. To verify that our results

are not driven by secular trends in which wage changes, globalization, and technological change

are all moving together over time, we present a falsification exercise in Table 5. In particular, we

regress current period wage changes for 1984 through 1989 on future globalization shocks for

2002. Our future globalization shocks are the logs of low and high income affiliate employment

in 2002, as well as export shares and import penetration in 2002. If the analysis is driven by

spurious trends, then the coefficient on 2002 measures of globalization should be significant in

explaining wages for the 1984 through 1989 period. Table 5 shows that 2002 measures of

globalization do not significantly affect wages in the earlier period. In contrast, 2002 measures of

globalization do significantly affect wages in 1997 through 2002. For example, our offshoring

measure to low income countries is significantly negatively correlated with wage changes among

workers during this later period. This is new evidence that our results are not being driven simply

by a spurious correlation between offshoring and domestic wage changes.25

25
     It is worth discussing alternative possibilities that could undermine our interpretations of our

findings. For example, it may be that even if the US had engaged in autarky in this later period,

domestic workers would have been replaced by machines, thereby implicating offshoring when

the workers’ decline was inevitable. This possibility naturally cannot be evaluated in our data.

Also, if our technology control variables are measured with error, it may be that the wage

declines we observe are a byproduct of the substitutability between these workers and capital.


                                                   24
B.        Offshoring, Trade, and the Reallocation of Labor Across Sectors

          In this section, we try to identify mechanisms for the differences between industry-level

and occupation-level exposure to offshoring and trade. We begin by analyzing the relationship

between offshoring and domestic manufacturing employment. We then examine the wage

consequences of switching industries, sectors, and occupations using a panel of CPS workers

who are followed for more than one period.

          In Table 6, we present an analysis of employment trends in manufacturing in response to

offshoring. Our unit of analysis is each education  industry  year cell. There are five education

categories for workers, 67 manufacturing industries, and 19 years of data (1984-2002). In

column (1), we present pooled results for all industries, and in the remaining columns we split

industries by the fraction of an industry’s workforce performing routine tasks. Pooling across all

task types, the results in column (1) indicate that the impact of offshoring depends on whether

affiliate employment is located in high or low-income countries. A one percent increase in

employment in low-income countries reduces domestic employment by 0.02 percent while a one

percent increase in employment in high-income countries increases domestic employment by

0.07 percent. Breaking the results down according to how routine the workforce is, we see that

the negative effects of offshoring to low-income countries are largest for workers in the most

routine industries. The point estimate in column (2), at -0.041, suggests that a one percent




However, we would argue that the strong correlation between the timing of increased offshore

employment and declining domestic wages seems unlikely to be fully explained by stories of this

nature.


                                                  25
increase in affiliate employment in low-income locations is associated with a 0.041 percent

reduction in employment of workers in the most routine occupations.

          In contrast, greater offshoring to high wage countries is associated with a significant

increase in employment in the U.S. Across all workers, the evidence suggests that a one percent

increase in affiliate employment in high-income locations is associated with a .074 percent

increase in employment at home. For routine workers, the impact is more positive, with a one

percentage point increase in offshore employment in high income countries associated with a .15

to .19 percent increase in U.S. employment. This evidence suggests that offshore employment in

high-income locations is complementary with employment at home. The evidence presented in

Table 6 is consistent with Harrison and McMillan (2011), who use firm-level Bureau of

Economic Analysis data to show that domestic employment of US multinationals is

complementary with their employment in high income locations but that increasing employment

of US firms in low income locations substitutes for employment in the US.26

          The coefficients on offshoring in Table 6 are significant but small in magnitude, and

suggest both substitution (in low-income countries) and complementarity (in high-income

locations). In contrast, the coefficients are large and negative but imprecisely estimated for both

import penetration and export activity. For the pooled sample, a one percentage point increase in

26
     Our online appendix includes a rich set of robustness checks for these results. Among these are

a set of results based on instrumental variables estimation where we instrument for trade and

offshoring using the variables that capture changes over time in the cost of trade and offshoring.

The instruments are: Internet access, telephone connections including cell phone usage, and the

industry share of routine jobs. The results confirm the negative relationship between offshoring

to low-income countries, import penetration and manufacturing employment.


                                                   26
import penetration reduces US manufacturing employment by 0.61 percent. While it is not

surprising that the coefficient on import competition is negative, the negative coefficient on

sectoral export shares is less intuitive and deserves explanation. The negative coefficients may

indicate that export growth was labor-saving for workers with less than a college degree, which

is sensible if a significant degree of offshoring takes place through exports for further processing.

Likewise, the negative and significant coefficient on total factor productivity suggests that

productivity growth has been labor saving for most educational categories.27 Productivity growth

in manufacturing has been achieved in conjunction with falling employment.

          The results in Table 6 suggest that productivity growth, export growth, and import

competition have been associated with (sometimes significant) declines in domestic

manufacturing employment and that the effects of offshoring have been smaller in magnitude

and mixed in sign. These results are important insofar as they suggest a fluid labor market where

changes in other factor prices and global competition lead to employment reallocation.

Furthermore, these results provide an explanation for our finding in Table 2 that the within-

industry wage effects of trade and offshoring are smaller than the within-occupation effects. If

trade and offshoring lead some workers to shift sectors (in particular, to exit high wage jobs in

manufacturing), then it is possible that the wages of those who retain their jobs or find new jobs

in the same industry are not significantly affected by offshoring, whereas those who shift sectors

or occupations are more negatively affected.28 We examine this conjecture in Table 7.

27
     The results in Table 6 are robust to excluding total factor productivity as a control variable.
28
     In results available in the online appendix, we directly assess the wage consequences among

those who switch industries within manufacturing. We find that (1) switching within

manufacturing has mild wage consequences (2) but leaving manufacturing has a more negative


                                                    27
       To explore the impact of switching out of manufacturing on wage outcomes, we construct

a sample of manufacturing workers observed in CPS samples in consecutive years between 1983

and 2002. We regress the change in log wages between period t and t+1 for a given worker on an

indicator for switching occupation, including a rich set of controls for the worker’s age, sex,

education, race, union status in the first period, and industry in the first period. If switching

occupation is costly, it may explain why the negative impact on wages is so large in our main

results. As shown in Table 7, the data indicate that trade-induced occupation switching does

indeed have serious negative wage consequences for workers. Using our matched sample of CPS

ORG workers who are observed in consecutive years, we compare the wage difference in period

T and T+1 for workers who switch occupations versus those who do not. In Panel A, we examine

workers who switch across 3-digit occupational categories. In column 1, we examine the wage

impact of all occupation switched and find that the impact is negligible; an occupation change is

associated with 0.54 percent increase in wages. One possible explanation for this result is that

some switches are upwards (as measured by average occupational wages), and others are

downward, leaving a mixed result for all switches. This hypothesis is put forward in Trefler and

Liu (2011), who find evidence that switches of both types are common in response to trade.

       In order to examine the impact of trade-induced occupational switching on wage

outcomes, we consider a system of equations for estimation. In our first stage, we examine the

impact of occupational exposure on the probability of switching occupations between periods.

We create a dichotomous measure of our instrument. All workers who are employed in

occupations above the median level of offshore exposure from low income countries are


impact and (3) leaving manufacturing is particularly costly for workers who switch occupation.

These were not included in the main text due to space considerations.

considered “tradable”. The results, presented in column 2, indicate that a being in a tradable

occupation is associated with a 9.4 percentage point increase in the probability of switching

occupations between periods. In our second stage, we examine the relationship between

switching occupations and wage declines, when this switch is induced by trade. We find that

trade-induced occupation switches are associated with a 12.1 percent decline in wages between

periods. This result is consistent with our earlier results highlighting negative consequences of

globalization on wages of workers who perform tasks that can be performed in low income

countries. In Panel B, we perform a similar analysis but use a broader classification of

occupation. If a more narrow definition of occupation implies that a worker is more likely to be

performing a similar task, these switches will presumably have less important wage

consequences. Consistent with this hypothesis, the results in Panel 2 indicate that trade is less

likely to induce a switch to a new 2-digit occupation (6.9 percentage points) but upon switching,

the negative wage consequences are even more severe: a trade-induced occupational switch

across 2-digit categories is associated with a 17.2 percent decline in wages. These results suggest

that switching occupations is very costly to workers, and provides support for our main results

suggesting that occupational exposure to competition from trade or offshoring has more

significant consequences than industry exposure.

       One possibility is that workers who switch occupations in a “downward” manner are less

productive in unobserved dimensions of worker quality. Weaker workers may sort into less

demanding occupations, and this may not be captured by the human capital measures available in

the CPS (e.g. education). While we are unable to observe variation in the quality of workers on

unobserved dimensions, we attempt to address this possibility by adding an additional control to

the wage equation, which is the difference between the inter-occupation wage differential for all



                                                 29
workers in a sector, and the inter-occupation wage differential for workers who leave that sector

in the following period. If workers who remain and those who leave a sector are similar, then this

difference should be close to zero and adding it as an additional control should have no impact

on our estimate. The negative impact of switching occupations on wages is unaffected by the

inclusion of the inter-occupation wage differential term (see also Trefler and Liu (2011) for an

application to services). Our results are suggestive that in manufacturing, worker heterogeneity

does not explain the significant decline in wages of workers who leave their occupation due to

trade or offshoring pressures.

       Our results are consistent with work by Kambourov and Manovskii (2008, 2009a, 2009b)

who find large wage declines among workers who switch occupations; this evidence suggests an

important role for occupation-specific human capital in a worker’s wage profile. Kambourov and

Manovskii (2008, 2009a, 2009b) also argue that occupation-switching may be an important

cause of the increase in US wage inequality, as younger workers are missing out on the benefits

to occupational tenure enjoyed by workers in previous decades. Insofar as this is partly driven by

competition from overseas, this highlights another mechanism by which offshoring may be

responsible for declining US wages and increasing wage inequality.



IV.    Conclusion

       This paper re-examines the impact of trade and offshoring—two primary measures of

globalization—on US workers. Using CPS data which we merge with data on exports, imports,

and BEA data on offshoring, we make three main contributions. First, we draw a distinction

between the impact of globalization on industrial wage differentials and on occupation wage

differentials. Globalization has had small or insignificant effects on industry wage differentials



                                                30
but significant effects on occupation wage differentials. These results are consistent with recent

empirical work demonstrating the importance of occupational tenure and downplaying the

importance of tenure within a particular industry in determining a worker’s wage.

       Second, we extend previous analyses which focused exclusively on manufacturing sector

workers to explore the impact of trade and offshoring on all workers. Third, we use a two stage

approach to show that one important avenue through which globalization affects wages is by

pushing workers out of the manufacturing sector to take lower paying jobs elsewhere. Using a

CPS panel of workers and the exposure of an occupation to trade as an instrument for whether or

not a worker switched occupations, we find that occupation switching due to trade led to real

wage losses of 12 to 17 percentage points between 1983 and 2002. The results are robust to the

inclusion of a term from Trefler and Lui (2011) which captures the possibility that the least able

workers are most likely to switch into lower paying occupations.

       Our results provide new evidence that the negative consequences of trade on workers are

mediated through a reallocation of labor across sectors and into different occupations. While

older models of trade posited that workers could move in a costless manner to new jobs in the

face of pressure from foreign labor, we identify large and significant wage declines among

workers who leave manufacturing, and the wage decline is particularly pronounced for those

who switch occupations. These results are consistent with new trade models which introduce

frictions into the labor reallocation process, such as Cosar (2011) and Artuc, Chaudhuri, and

McLaren (2010). Our evidence is consistent with greater frictions in moving across occupations

rather than across industries.

       We also explored how the impact of globalization on wages has changed over time. Our

different measures of globalization have no significant impact on wages during the first half of



                                                31
our sample. While our sample extends from 1984 to 2002, both offshoring and trade exert

significant effects on wages only in the second half of this period. The effects of these

globalization measures are confined to individuals who work in “routine” occupations, indicating

that much of the brunt of globalization is born by individuals who perform tasks which are easily

copied by workers elsewhere.

Note : Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses below the coefficient estimates. The workers are taken from CPS samples from
1984-2002, with their lagged values of the independent variables taken from 1983-2001. The standard errors are clustered by industry and 5
year period in columns (1-4), and by occupation and 5 year period in columns (5-8). The classification of occupations into routine categories
is determined by the proportion of tasks which are routine in each occupation, with low being occupations with more than 2/3rd, intermediate
being between 1/3rd and 2/3rd, and high being occupations with less than 1/3rd of tasks designated routine. We also control for the lagged
log price of investment, lagged total factor productivity, and lagged capital to labor ratio among manufacturing workers. Among non-
manufacturing workers, these controls are set equal to unity. Wage specifications control for a worker's gender, age, race, experience, whether
in a union, and include industry, year, education and state fixed effects. The occupation-specific exposure regressions also include 2-digit
occupation fixed effects. Controls for computer use rates are imputed by the worker's industry (columns 1-4) and by occupation (columns 5-
8).

Note : Each row represents a separate regression. The independent variables are listed in the
column headings, and the subsample of interest is listed in the row heading. Robust standard
errors are clustered by occupation and 5 year period, and are reported in parentheses below the
coefficient estimates. Wage specifications control for a worker's gender, age, race, experience,
whether in a union, imputed computer use rate by occupation and include year, education,
state, industry, and two-digit occupation fixed effects.

Note : Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses below the coefficient estimates. The workers are taken from CPS samples from
1997-2002, with their lagged values of the independent variables taken from 1996-2001. The standard errors are clustered by industry and 5
year period in columns (1-4), and by occupation and 5 year period in columns (5-8). The classification of occupations into routine categories
is determined by the proportion of tasks which are routine in each occupation, with low being occupations with more than 2/3rd, intermediate
being between 1/3rd and 2/3rd, and high being occupations with less than 1/3rd of tasks designated routine. We also control for the lagged
log price of investment, lagged total factor productivity, and lagged capital to labor ratio among manufacturing workers. Among non-
manufacturing workers, these controls are set equal to unity. Wage specifications control for a worker's gender, age, race, experience, whether
in a union, and include industry, year, education and state fixed effects. The occupation-specific exposure regressions also include 2-digit
occupation fixed effects. Controls for computer use rates are imputed by the worker's industry (columns 1-4) and by occupation (columns 5-
8).

 Source : Sample is composed of CPS MORG workers observed in two consecutive samples.
 Note : Robust standard errors reported in parentheses below coefficient estimates. Standard errors
 are clustered by 3-digit occupation. All models include year, state and education level fixed
 effects. Other demographic controls are age, sex, non-white, and union status in the first period.
 An occupation is defined as tradable if the occupational exposure from low-income countries (as
 described in Table 2) is above the median level among manufacturing workers in the sample. This
 is used to generate a binary variable for all workers in the sample, and is the instrument for
 occupational switches. In Panel A, we define an occupation switch by the worker reporting a
 different 3-digit occupation. In Panel B, an occupation switch is defined by a worker reporting a
                               1
 different 1-digit occupation. The Inter-Occupation Wage Differential Gap term is calculated by
 regressing the workers' log wage on observable characteristics and a set of occupation dummies
 among all workers, and among workers who switch occupations between periods. The difference
 in means of these terms is included in our regressions to control for potential selection on
 unobservables of those who switch occupations.

Notes : Wage premium are calculated by a standard Mincerian regression of the log wage on education,
experience, age, sex, race, year fixed efffects and state fixed effects among all workers in the CPS MORG
between in 1983 and 2002. Each point in the plot is a separate occupation identified in the CPS (N=464). The
occupations are considered routine if the share of tasks that is routine is greater than the median occupation.
Occupations with higher wage premiums in 2002 than in 1983 are shaded in.
