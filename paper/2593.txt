                                    ABSTRACT


     The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 reduced personal

marginal tax rates and provided significant          business tax breaks.

Subsequent changes through 1985 cut back on business allowances.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced marginal rates again, but added

significantly   to business taxes.       Was there any unifying theme to

these tax changes, or do they represent frequent changes in course
for tax policy?

     This paper uses a general equilibrium model capable of second—
best analysis to investigate the net effects on efficiency of each

of these changes in capital income taxation.           Under the new view
that dividend taxes are unimportant        investment disincentives,

there is no set of other parameters in the model for which these

changes generate improvements       in efficiency.     Under the old view
that dividend taxes are important, however, these changes all

increase efficiency for a wide range of values for other

parameters   in the model.

I. Introduction

     Few areas of public policy have seen changes as frequent or as
dramatic as those in tax policy, with major legislation in almost

every year from 1980 to 1986.   These tax revisions may reflect an

evolving economic environment, changing views of individual leaders,
or simply shifts in political coalitions.        They may appear almost

random, however, at least with respect to any one of the multiple

and sometimes conflicting objectives of tax policy.        We might ask

whether these tax changes reflect any consistency with respect to

revenue, economic efficiency,   distributional effects, or any of a

number of noneconomic objectives of tax policy.
     Tax initiatives enacted during the Reagan Administration might
seen particularly   inconsistent with respect to the economic

efficiency of taxes on income   front capital.    The Economic Recovery

Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) reduced personal tax rates and depreciation

recovery periods, but it favored some assets more than others.        It

thus appeared to promote saving and capital formation at the expense

of a level playing field,  It also reinforced a trend in revenue

sources away from taxes on capital such as the corporate income tax.

Subsequent changes through 1985 retrenched somewhat on the
                                                               of
generosity of depreciation allowances. Then the Tax Reform Act
1986 (TRA) repealed the investment tax credit, lengthened

depreciation   lifetimes, and added almost $30 billion per year of

revenue to the corporate income tax.     Birnbaum and Murray (1987)

refer to cost recovery provisions in an Administration       forerunner of

the Tax Reform Act as "an abrupt about—face, a 180—degree reversal

from four years earlier.  . a remarkable flip-flop (pp. 50-51)    It  .




may seem almost inconceivable that these changea were all part of a
coherent plan.
     There are, however, some unifying threads in these tax
initiatives.     Both ERTA in 1981 and TRA in 1986 were supported by

claims of economic efficiency. In the former case, supply—side
rhetoric about work effort and saving war reinforced by economists'
measures of distortions in households' choices between labor and
leisure or between present and future consumption. In the latter
case, rhetoric about the level playing field was reinforced by
economists' measures of distortions in firms' choices among
investments. Moreover, all such measures of economic efficiency are
enhanced by lower marginal tax rates.       Birnbeuo and Murray (1987)
also note that "Reagan wanted to go down in history as the president

who cut the top tex rate at least in half, from 70 percent to 35

percent or lower,     If abandoning business tax breaks and raising

corporate taxes was the price he had to pay to achieve that goal, so
be it" (p. 286)

     Were these tax changes essentially randon, or is there some set
of prior beliefs about parameter values under which efficiency

consistently    increases?   To address this question, we measure the

economic efficiency of capital tax provisions in this series of tax
initiatives    using a disaggregate   general equilibrium   model of the

U.S. economy end tax system.     This model can measure second-beat

efficiency effects of personal and corporate tax policies, including
effects on overall capital formation, end on the allocation of

resources among assets, between the corporate and noncorporate
                                  —3—



sectors, and among industries.    We also point out the importance of

key unknown parameters such as the elasticity of substitution among
assets and the elasticity of savings with respect to the net rate of
return.

       The generality of the model is important.      For example,

Fullerton and Henderson (1985) evaluate the 1981 Act using a more
restricted model that concentrates on intertemporal distortions.        In

that model, firms use fixed combinations of assets, and ERTA always

generates welfare gains.    Here, we use a more general model

developed by Fullerton and Henderson (forthcoming) in which asset
choices are endogenous.    In this model, even with moderate

substitution parameters,   the less uniform taxation in ERTA can

generate welfare losses.    For another example, Auerbach (1983) and
Gravelle (1981) concentrate on asset distortions but assume
Cobb—Douglas   production functions.    Our more general functional

forms allow us to show how the ranking of tax reforms can be

reversed for non—unitary elasticities of substitution.

       Using results of this model, we interpret recent tax reform
history.    We have no formal model of political decisionmaking,      but

it is interesting to see how beliefs about the relative importance

of different efficiency effects might have supported policymakers'

views about the ranking of alternative     reforms.    ERTA may have been

supported by those who believed that capital formation is important
(or,   in this model, that the saving elasticity is high), but it

increases economic efficiency only when the level playing field is

unimportant    (in this model, when the elasticity of substitution

among assets is low).     The aspects of the 1986 Act that reversed
ERTA may have been influenced by changing beliefs about the relative
size of those parameters or importance of those effects.

       Results also depend on the assumed effect of dividend taxes.
Under the "new view" that dividend taxes have little effect on

investment incentives, there is no set of substitution and saving
elasticities      for which these tax initiatives led to consistent

improvements      in economic efficiency.    Under the "old view", however,
reduction of personal taxes on dividends does affect incentives.              In
this case, for quite reasonable bounds on elasticities        in our model,

every change in the 1980's led to improvements in efficiency.            An

interpretation      is that policymakers adhere to incremental      reform.
       We emphasize that recent tax policy decisions were influenced

by revenue considerations, distributional        effects, and noneconomic

objectives.      Those effects are entirely ignored here in order to
focus on efficiency.       The next section summarizes the general

equilibrium model used in this paper.         The third section provides

some new results on the efficiency effects of recent tax

initiatives,      A fourth section discusses scenarios under which these

initiatives could have led to consistent increases in efficiency.



II.   A General   Equilibrium Model for     Second-Bestjgency
      Analysis
      The consumption side of the model is taken from Fullerton,
Shoveri   and Whalley   (FSW,   1983), where households have initial
endowments of labor and capital and maximize utility by choosing

among present consumption goods, leisure, and saving.         The

elasticity of substitution between consumption and leisure is
                                   —5—




specified exogenously to be consistent with an uricompensated labor
supply elasticity (0.15 for these calculations).        Similarly, the

elasticity of substitution between present and future consumption          is

specified to be consistent with an uncompensated       saving elasticity.

This parameter is set to Boskin's (1978) estimate of 0.4 for most

calculations,    but it is varied between 0.0 and 0.8 for others.1

        In deciding how much to save, households myopically use current

prices as expected future prices.        We then calculate a sequence of

equilibria in which endogenous saving from one period augments the
capital stock in the next period.        Labor force growth is set

exogenously to place the 1980 baseline equilibrium on a steady state
path.     Domestic saving is the only source of investment funds, since
the model is not open to international capital flows.
        As in the FSW model, producers in each of 18 industries have
fixed requirements    of intermediate inputs but can substitute between

labor and capital in Constant Elasticity of Substitution         (CES)

value—added    functions,2   As in Fullerton and Henderson

(forthcoming), however, producers react to a marginal cost of

capital.     They each use a nested CES function to allocate capital
between the corporate and noncorporate sectors       (or,   in housing,

between the rental and owner—occupied sectors).        The elasticity of

substitution between sectors does not affect major points made in




1The saving elasticity is used to calculate the model's elasticity
of substitution between present and future consumption which is
then fixed for simulations of alternative policies.
2The model also assumes perfect competition, perfect mobility,
perfect information, no externalities, and no involuntary
unemployment.

this paper, ao it is set to unity for all calculations     reported.3

In a final CES nest, for each sector of each industry, firms

allocate capital anong up to 28 assets including 20 types of

equipment and 15 types of structures, plus inventories and
residential and nonresidential land. The elasticity of substitution

among assets is varied in calculations below.
      For each asset in each    sector   the cost of capital is the

marginal pretsx return needed to earn the equilibrium posttax
return4 These    calculations    include the effects of stetutory tax

rotes, investment tax credit rates, particular doprocietion rules,

and the personal taxation of interest, dividends, end cepitel     gsins
All assets provide the same posttax rate of return, hut they must

earn different pretsx returns or marginal products in order to pay
taxes that differ by asset. Differential tax rules thus give rise
to interasset distortions.      The "double taxation" of corporate

source income end the nontaxation of imputed net rents in owner-

oocupied   housing mean that capital in different sectors must earn
different marginal products, giving rise to intersectoral
distortions. Finally, all taxes on capital drive a wedge between

sectors, Indeed, little is known about the incorporation
of firms, The CES function is intended   only as a representation of
that deoision, and of the possibility that taxes affect it.
                                                We assume a 4

discussed in Auerbach (1986).

the price paid by firms and the return received by savers.          Taxes

thus raise the price of future consumption      and create intertemporal

distortions.

     To ensure comparability, we wish to abstract entirely from

changes in government expenditure.        In addition, we wish to

concentrate    on changes in capital taxes.    Thus we make each regime

'revenue neutral" relative to 1980 by the imposition of a lump—sum

tax or rebate to households, and we omit changes in labor tax rates.
     Given behavioral rules and parameters, the model searches for
an equilibrium by iterating on     a wage   rate, a posttax rate of

return, and the lump—sun tax (or rebate) needed to maintain real

government expenditures.      At each iteration the model finds the cost

of capital for each asset in each sector and evaluates all demands.

Equilibrium    is found when the total demand for capital matches its

fixed supply for that period, the total demand for labor matches its

endogenous    supply, and total tax revenue matches government

expenditures.     To calibrate the model, exogenous substitution

parameters and tax rules are used together with a consistent
benchmark equilibrium data set to solve for other parameters that
allow the model to replicate the benchmark data set as an

equilibrium    solution.   Tax changes then generate alternative

sequences of equilibria that are compared to the benchnark by

calculating    the present value of equivalent variations.

     There are many assumptions and parameters that influence the
results from this model, but three are most important for present

purposes.     First, the importance of intertemporal effects is related

to the prespecified size of the elasticity of saving with respect to
                                             —8—




the   net rate of return.           We set thia to 0.4 for moet calculations
but vary it fron 0.0 to 0.8 for others.°                  Second, the importance of

interaaaet effects is related to the elasticity of substitution

among assets in production.               There is very little evidence on

appropriate values for this parameter, so we set it to one for
standard calculations            end vary it from zero to 2.0 for comparisons.0

Finally, given that the 1986 Act increases the capital gains tax
while decreasing the personal tax on                 dividen.ds,    the ranking of these

reforrs depends in an important way on the relative weights given to
those tvo forms of corporate income, There is no evidence on how
firms finance narginal investment, so we make two alternative
assuoptions         One   set of calculations sssumea that               new   corporate
investment     is financed        in the same proportions as paat investment:
34   percent   by   debt,   62    percent by retained earnings, and 5 percent
by   new   share    issues,7      Because the   weight    is   so low        en new share
issues,     for which     dividand taxes     matter; wa call        thia the         "now view"
(see Auarbach,       1979, Bradford, 1981, and King, 1977).                    The   other set
of calculations       assusas      that   corporate    eguity is equally         divided

5Boskin's (1978) saving            elasticity   is
                                                 about       0.4, but        Howry  and
Hymans' (1978) estimate ia            near zero. Ballard           at   al    (1985) review
these and other estimates.
6Berndt and Christensen (1973) found a high elasticity of
substitution between equipment and structures, but Mohr (1980)
disputes it.  These and other estimates are reviewed in Hultan and
Wykoff (198is) and Mackie (1985). Our elasticity of substiution
among 38 assets has never been estimated.

7me  noncorporate sector and housing are financed one-third by debt
and two-thirds by equity.  Financing is exogenous and identical for
all assets. As a consequence, we omit tax-related distortions in
firms' financial decisicns and the possibility that the cost of
capital can be lower for predominantly debt—financed assets.
Debt-equity ratios are not available by asset, but see Gordon,
Hines, and Summers (1987).

between retained earnings and new share issues.              Dividend taxes are

more important, and so we call this the to1d            viewit   (see McLure,
         8
1979)



III. The Effects of Tax Reforms

        In 1980, when President Reagan was elected, the top statutory

corporate tax rate was 46 percent, end personal rates extended up to
70 percent.9 Most equipment received a 10 percent investment tax

credit, and capital cost recovery periods were based on the Asset

Depreciation     Range   (ADR)   system.     Besides lowering all personal

rates, including the top rate from 70 to 50 percent, the Economic

Recovery Tax Act of 1981 expanded the investment tax credit and
created the Accelerated          Cost Recovery System (ACRS) which shortened

all depreciation lifetimes.          Table 1 shows that the fully phased—in

version of this bill would have lowered the cost of capital in the

corporate sector from 7.0 to 5.9 percent under the new view (8.5 to
7.0 percent under the old view).             ERTA also reduces the overall cost

of capital, which includes the noncorporate            sector and owner—

occupied     housing.
        To indicate tax differences across sectors or across assets,

the table also shows the coefficient             of variation of the cost of



8Empirically, the new view is supported in Auerbach (1984), but the
old view is supported in Poterba and Summers (1983, 1985). Poterba
and Summers (1985) explain some conceptual problems with each view.
9For each tax law, the Treasury's individual tax file with 90,000
households was used to calculate the weighted—average personal
marginal rate on interest receipts, dividends, capital gains,
noncorporate business income, and mortgage interest deductions.
These rates were then modified to account for taxes at the state
level, the taxation of banks, insurance companies, and the holdings
of tax-exempt institutions.
                                     —10—



capital   tinder each tax regime.  reducing the taxation of
                                      By
depreciable asseta in the corporate sector, ERTA brought overall
corporate taxes sore in line with other sectors and conseguently
reduced slightly the   coefficient     of variation across sectors.

However, EPTA widened the difference between depreciable assets and

other assets such as land and inventories.'0          Both across assets and

overall, ERTA has the largest coefficient of variation of the four

tax regises.

       Further changes ware enacted each year through 1985.        The rate

of declining balance for depreciation was reduced.,        and the deprecia-

tion lifetime for structures was increased. In addition, inflation
eroded some of the personal rate reduction through bracket creep.

By 1985, when brackets were to be indexed, the cost of capital in
the corporate sector bad risen back up from 5.9 under ERTA to 6,5
percent, using the new view financing assunptions         (from 7.0 to 7.7

percent   using the old view).      The coefficient   of variation across

assets fell back from .37 to .25 as shown in Table 1.

       The Tax Reform Act of 1986 revamped tax rulss again.        Personal

tax rates were reduced to a top marginal rate of 33 percent, and the

statutory corporate rate was cut from       46to   34 percent.   The

investment tax credit was repealed, and depreciable assets were

divided into a larger number of categories intended to reflect




10The accelerated depreciation in ERTA may have been intended to
offset the effects of high inflation, At our 4 percent inflation
rate, however, the combination of the investment tax credit and
ACRS meant that equipment investment actually received a net
subsidy at the corporate level.
                                    —11—



differences    in economic depreciation.   Finally, the 1986 Act

repealed the capital gains exclusion)1
        The table shows that these changes raise the corporate cost of

capital from 6.5 to 7.5 percent under the new view where cuts in

personal taxes on dividends are relatively unimportant (from 7.7 to

8.0 under the old view where cuts in dividend taxes are more

important).     Under the new view the cost of capital is higher than

it was in 1980, but under the old view it is lower than it was in

1980.    Under either financing assumption, the attempt to "level the

playing field" was effective in the sense that the 1986 Act provides
coefficients    of variation that are lower than those of other tax

laws.

        General equilibrium results for all tax laws appear in Figures
1—4.    The vertical axes show the present value of equivalent
variations,    in 1984 dollars.    For comparison, each $200 billion of

welfare gain represents about 0.2 percent of total welfare, the

present value of income plus leisure in the baseline of 1980 law.
Figures    1 and 2 show the   new view, while Figures   3 and 4 show the

old view.     In contrast, Figures 1 and 3 set the saving elasticity at

0.4 and vary the elasticity of substitution among assets, while

Figures 2 and 4 set the asset parameter at 1.0 and vary the saving

elasticity.     These figures can be used to illustrate the following
new results:



      calculations refer to the fully phased—in version of the law.
The model includes considerable disaggregation and detail such as
the half-year convention, the half-basis adjustment, LIFO inventory
accounting, and noncorporate taxes.  It assumes fully taxable
firms, however, and thus ignores changes in the minimum tax,
passive loss rules, and some other specific changes in 1986.

       A.    The   1ActoesnoBlyasoeneretewelfaregdins,                          In
previous studies such as Fullerton and Henderson (1985), each
industry was constrained to use assets in fixed proportions.                   That

model thus captured the intertemporal welfare gains of ERTh               but    not

the interasset welfare losses. Figure 1 shows that HP.TA does indeed
increase welfare when the elasticity of substitution is near zero
(as when assets are used in fixed proportions), but intertemporal

gains are completely offset if the intarasset substitution parameter
is    0.7 or Greater.       Under the old view, in Figure 3, ERTA's       dividend
tax   cuts help to keep welfsra gains positive until the mubstitution
parameter is more than         l5.   Figures    2 and 4   ahcw   that tUTU's

form.       Figure 1 shows that the same unit elasticity assumption in
this model would favor the efficiency of the level playing field in

the Tax Reform Act of 1986.          However, a slightly lower elasticity

would favor the 1985 tax law, end a still lower elasticity would
favor the 1981 Act.         These elasticities are all within the range of

possible estinates.         Despite the apparently definitive results of a
Cobb-Douglas       model,   we do not know which of the three tax regimes

has the largest welfare gain.




12Note that ERTA has the largest revenue losses snd lump sum tax
replacement of any simulation, so even these reduced efficiency
gains may be overstated.

                              Figore 5 confirms that the 1981 Act dominates
tns    other tax regimes, in      terms    of efficiency,   only when the

elasticity      of substitution    among assets is small      (for   a   wide   range
of    values for the intertemporal subsitut ion parameter(               The 1985

law dominates when the asset substitution              parameter is around 0.5,

and the 1986 Act dominates shen it is larger.               The area in which the

1986 Act dominates        is not an area of successive improvements,

because EPTA always generates welfare losses with this high degree
of interasset substitution.



13Because we use equivalent variations, results are transitive in
the sense that the difference between the welfare gains of two
reforms represents the welfare gain in baseline prices of moving
from one reform to the other.
                                 —14—



     Under the new view, where dividend tax reductions are

relatively unimportant,   tax changes may seem random.   In fact,

randomness may cause additional welfare costs (skinner, 1986, Alm,

1988) or benefits (Stiglitz, 1982, Chang and Wildasin,    1986).    The

apparently random changes may arise from shifting political

coalitions, despite well ordered individual preferences.

     Even under the new view, however, each change may have been a
rational response to available information and oomsensus    views.4
Debate in 1980—81 was heavily influenced by the supply-side    school

of thought, and the ooosensus view may have held that the saving

elasticity was very high.    In addition, policymakers may have been

uninformed or unconcerned about interasset distortions.     Certainly
more of the discussion was about capital formation than about level

playing fields.   Thus ERTA may have been viewed as the highest

ranking reform on efficiency grounds.15    Then changes in tax law

through 1985 might be explained by changes in the actual or

perceived importance of these distortions.    Discussion of intarasset
distortions did not begin until Auerbach and Jorgenson (1980),

Gravelle   (1981), and Hulten and Wykoff (l9slb).   These papers were

among the first to use Hall-Jorgenson   type formulas to calculate



4This discussion presumes that all three analyzed tax regimes were
available as options in 1981. Implicitly they were. Explicitly,
in fact, debate at the time included consideration of the Auerbach-
Jorgenson (1980) first-year recovery system, a proposal to provide
economic depreciation at replacement cost. Although a major point
of that proposal was tc remove the effects of inflation, its
results in this model vould look very similar to those of the 1986
legislation because we do not consider varying inflation.
15Substitution elasticities are generally high in the supply-side
view, however, and ERTA would reduce welfare with a high asset
substitution elasticity.

differences    in the marginal effective tax rates among assets used in

production.       They came too late to affect the 1981                legislation,      but

may have influenced subsequent changes.                Finally, stories about tax

shelters may have combined with new results on interasset
distortions    to raise the implicitly held elasticity of asset

substitution,     making the Tax Reform Act of 1986 perceived as most
efficient,     Similarly,       new estimates or other results on

intertemporal distortions              may have belprC change the consensus views

about parameters in Figure 5 from area A,               to   B,   to   C.

When the saving elasticity is 0.4, Figure 3 shows that there is a
wide band of values for the asset substitution paraceter (between
0.5 and 1.5) for which          each tax change in the 1980s provides an

additional   welfare gain. When the asset substitution                      paraneter is
1.0,   Figure 4 shows the same result for all values of                     the saving

elasticity.       With a   systemmatic variation of both parameters,                 Figure

6 shows   that as the savings elasticity is higher, successive

improvements      occur for a higher range of asset substitution

parameters.
       The figures demonstrate the possibility               of a coherent agenda to

achieve successive efficiency improvements.                  In fact, if a signifi-'

cant part of marginal corporate finance is new                    share issues, then

recent tax policy has been consistent by this definition for a wide

range of quite reasonable values of the two key elasticities.16
      This case also sheds some light on the theory of tax reform,

which holds that optimal tax changes may result in a tax structure
different from that of optimal            tax design.   Feldstein (1976)

analyzes a number of different implementation rules, including
delayed effective dates to allow time for adjustment, and Zodrow
(1981) demonstrates   some advantages for immediate enactment of

partial reform.   If results for the old view are any indication,

po1icakers may    adhere to incremental   reform.   Moreover, such steps

may appear to take different directions,     For example, some

additional interasset distortions   in ERTA may have been a necessary

political price of achieving large reductions of intertemporal
distortions,  Changes through 1985 and 1986 may then have addressed
the interasset margin while trying to minimize losses on the

intertemporal margin.



V.   Concluding Remarks
      Clearly, tax policy is not driven by any single criterion such
as the measure of economic efficiency used in this paper.        Indeed,

decisions are not made by any single political agent.       The different

policymakers   in this process place different relative weights on

revenue considerations,   distributional effects, many noneconomic

objectives, and possibly economic efficiency.       The limited purpose



16 Poterba and Summers
                       (1983, 1985) find support for the old view of
dividend taxes. Mackie (1985) reviews estimates of the elasticity
of substitution among assets, and Ballard at al (1985) review
saving elasticities.
                                     —17—



in this paper is to investigate how the last of these considerations

may have affected tax policy decisions since 1980.
       We employ a detailed general equilibrium         model of the U.S.

economy and tax system to evaluate the efficiency effects of recent
tax law changes.       This model is capable of second—best       analysis of

simultaneous     distortions   in households'   saving decisions,    firms'

sectoral location decisions, and producers' asset combination

decisions.      This simultaneity is   important      for analyzing the

particular reforms ccnsidered here, but it may come at the expense
of a better model for each distortion considered separately.

Although this model is comprehensive, it         is   not witnout limitations,

It adopts particular assurptioos,       for example, that there are mo

aujistment     costs, noncompetitve behacors, or distortions          other

than taxes
       One does not need to accept all the assumptoons           t the model,

however, to follow tOe logic of the interpretations              'iith the   new
view   that   taxes on dividends are relatlvely unicportant, recent tax
reforms appear inconsistent.        Advocates of the tconomic Recovery Tax

Act of 1981 cay have knowingly exacerbated            interasset distortions    in.

order to reduce intertemporal distortions, and subsequent

legislation may have been a rational response to new            information or
to   a new    consensus about the relative importance of those
distortions,      Alternatively,   with the old view that dividend taxes

matter, these reforms nay have been part of a coherent plan to

acheive greater economic efficiency through incremental tax reform.
