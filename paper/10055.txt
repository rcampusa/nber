                                           ABSTRACT

We provide a new and more complete analysis of the origins of the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, one of
the most severe environmental crises in North America in the 20th Century. Severe drought and
wind erosion hit the Great Plains in 1930 and lasted through 1940. There were similar droughts in
the 1950s and 1970s, but no comparable level of wind erosion. We explain why. The prevalence
of small farms in the 1930s limited private solutions for controlling the downwind externalities
associated with wind erosion. Drifting sand from unprotected fields damaged neighboring farms.
Small farmers cultivated more of their land and were less likely to invest in erosion control than
were larger farmers. Soil Conservation Districts, established by government after 1937, helped
coordinate erosion control. This “unitized” solution for collective action is similar to that used in
other natural resource/environmental settings.

I. Introduction.

       The Dust Bowl of the 1930s was one of the most severe environmental crises in North

America in the 20th Century.2 Severe drought and damaging wind erosion hit in the Great Plains

in 1930 and lasted through 1940. Strong winds blew away an average of 480 tons per acre of

topsoil, degrading soil productivity, harming health, and damaging air quality. The leading

historian of the Dust Bowl, Donald Worster (1979, 24), described it in the following way:

“In no other instance was there greater or more sustained damage to the American land, and

there have been few times when so much tragedy was visited on its inhabitants. Not even the

Depression was more devastating, economically…in the decade of the 1930s the dust storms of

the plains were an unqualified disaster.”

       Similar droughts and wind occurred later in the 1950s and 1970s in the Great Plains, but

there is a general consensus among soil conservationists that there was no comparable level of

erosion.3 Excessive cultivation of land in the 1930s, exposing dry soil to the wind, is the standard

explanation for the Dust Bowl.4 The issue to be explained is why cultivation was more extensive

and use of erosion control techniques more limited in the 1930s than later in the 20th century.

       Our contribution is to analyze wind erosion as a common-pool problem. We focus on the



                                                 3
effects of numerous small farms on the Great Plains in the 1930s for combating erosion during

the Dust Bowl. In contemporary erosion research, farm size is shown to be an important factor in

soil conservation.5 Small farms are associated with more intensive cultivation, less frequent use

of conservation practices, and greater soil erosion.6

       We concentrate on the downwind externalities from a farmer’s failure to shield cultivated

fields. Blowing sand from an unprotected farm smothered the lands and crops of leeward farms,

lowering their productivity and reducing returns from their erosion-control investments. These

cross-farm effects were intensified by the presence of many small farms in an erosion-prone

region. There were differential incentives according to farm size for investing in conservation

practices, such as strip cropping and fallow. We examine the effect of cultivation intensity

associated with farm size on observed variation in erosion severity across the Great Plains. The

optimal farm size for productive efficiency was smaller than for wind erosion control, and hence,

coordination among farmers was necessary. The “unitized” solution for collective action was

provided by Soil Conservation Districts adopted after 1937.7 Our analysis provides a new and

more complete explanation for the origins of the Dust Bowl.8

II. The Dust Bowl.

       A drought that was unprecedented in the 20th century began in the northern plains in 1930

and gradually spread south, covering the entire region through 1940. Strong winds, characteristic

of the area, blew across dry, cultivated soil, generating dust storms of unparalleled number,

duration, and scale. Many dust storms were local, defined by topographical boundaries, including

erodible soil texture, watersheds and hills, but very intense weather systems also brought huge

blasts that covered hundreds of miles and lasted 10 hours or more (Clements,1938).

       Some figures illustrate the extent of wind damage in the Great Plains. Light, fertile




                                                 4
topsoil became airborne and was carried far away. This material was critical for dryland wheat

farming, which dominated the plains. Each loss of soil from successive windstorms removed

more plant nutrients, until the remaining ground was heavy and relatively sterile (Stallings, 1957,

203-4). Samples of soil carried 500 miles from Texas to Iowa had 10 times as much organic

matter, 9 times as much nitrogen, 19 times as much phosphoric acid, and 45 percent more potash

as compared to the soil that remained.9 In his book on the Dust Bowl, Vance Johnson (1947,

194-5) estimated that in 1935 alone, 850 million tons of topsoil had blown away from 4,340,000

acres. Soil erosion surveys by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) in 1934 indicated that 65

percent of the total area of the Great Plains had been damaged by wind erosion and 15 percent

severely eroded. By 1938, the agency claimed that 80 percent of the land in the southern plains

had been subject to wind erosion, with 40 percent to a serious degree. 10,000,000 acres had lost

the upper five inches of topsoil, and 13,500,000 acres had lost 2.5 inches, with an average loss of

480 tons of topsoil per acre. Hugh Bennett (1939, 11) the first director of the SCS, estimated

productivity losses from erosion at $400 million annually.

       Other costs of wind erosion included destruction of nearby crops and farmland from the

localized deposit of heavier eroded material (sand), damage to livestock, buildings, household

goods, merchandise, and health problems associated with inhalation of dust particles. Claims of

greater incidence of pneumonia, asthma, influenza, and eye infections were reported from Dust

Bowl counties in Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.10 Similarly the

Chambers of Commerce of towns located in the region estimated that the costs of damage

wrought by blowing sand and dust from each storm ranged from $50,000 (Liberal, Kansas) to

$288,228 (Tucumcari, New Mexico).11

                                             Figure 1




                                                 5
       Figure 1 illustrates the range of wind erosion across the Great Plains in 1934, based on

soil erosion surveys conducted by the SCS. The figure also shows the extent of sheet erosion

from heavy rainfall. Efforts to combat water-based sheet erosion, however, did not involve the

broad externalities and coordination problems found in addressing wind erosion. As indicated on

the map, there was considerable variation in the severity of wind erosion across the region, with

bands of severe damage in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, southeastern Colorado and

southwestern Kansas, north central Nebraska, the eastern and central Dakotas, and parts of

Montana. We make use of this variation in our analysis of the effect of farm size on efforts to

combat wind erosion in the Dust Bowl.

III. Wind Erosion, Externalities, and Differential Incentives According to Farm Size.

       A. The Dynamics of Wind Erosion and Potential Externalities.

       Drought and extensive cultivation in the 1930s raised soil erodibility across the Great

Plains. Except in the far western plains where grass pasture was more common, providing some

ground cover, the soil was exposed, dry, and pulverized from repeated tillage. There was limited

moisture to make the soil cloddy and rough, and there were few obstacles to block the flow of

wind.12 We describe the dynamics of soil erosion in some detail in order to demonstrate the

nature of the externalities involved and the collective action problems encountered among

farmers in the 1930s in combating erosion.

       There were three types of soil movement in wind erosion: suspension, saltation, and

creep, and each had different cross-farm effects. Suspension involved very fine topsoil particles,

less than 0.1 mm in diameter, that were blown high into the air as dust and could be carried

hundreds of miles if the storm were strong enough. Suspension accounted for 3 to 40 percent of

soil movement. A key benefit of any farmer’s erosion control investments was limiting the loss




                                                6
of topsoil via suspension. In 1933 it was estimated that topsoil losses reduced annual

productivity from 15 to 25 percent, and when the soil was fully stripped, fields became

unproductive or “barren.”13 The external effects of suspended dust were felt quite a distance

from the source, and the topsoil could be beneficial for receiving farms. The negative effects

were damage to buildings and the health of livestock and people from inhaling blowing dust.

       Saltation and creep involved larger particles, 0.1 to 0.5 mm in diameter for the former

and 0.5 to 1.0 mm for the latter. Saltation and creep brought the most localized externalities

through the formation of hummocks and sand drifts up to 40 feet high that smothered downwind

crops. Saltation accounted for 50 to 80 percent of total soil movement, and creep 7 to 25

percent. These heavier particles fanned out, destroying stable soil crusts and vegetation, and

exposing more soil to erosion. This type of erosion was compared to an epidemic disease or

avalanche that, if not contained at its source, would spread rapidly. The leeward area affected

depended on soil texture and moisture as well as wind speed. It could be several thousand acres

or more, but adjacent fields and farms were most vulnerable.14Limiting the damage from

blowing and drifting sand was the other major benefit of a farmer’s efforts to combat erosion.

       The two leading erosion control methods in the 1930s were strip cropping with strip

fallow and windbreaks of trees or brush.15 Both provided barriers to lower surface wind velocity

and carrying capacity, but the former was more prevalent because trees could not be grown in

many parts of the plains. Strip fallow also had the advantage of building up soil moisture and

roughness, which reduced erodibility, whereas tree windbreaks actually absorbed moisture from

surrounding ground (Greb and Block, 1961). Strip fallow involved creating alternating bands,

placed perpendicular to the wind, of wheat and fallow (usually with wheat stubble) or bands of

wheat or cotton and drought-resistant crops like sorghum.16 Breaking fields into bands of




                                                 7
cultivated areas and stubble reduced the exposed area over which the wind passed. Fallow strips

were part of crop rotations, which at maximum involved one-third to one-half of a farm’s total

crop acreage in three or two-year rotations.

       The barriers provided by tree windbreaks or wheat stubble could protect downwind fields

for distances 10 to 20 times their height depending on the porosity and shape of the obstruction,

wind speed, soil type, and moisture, especially if used in combination with other erosion control

methods, such as stubble mulch.17 Stubble mulch involved leaving plant residue in the cultivated

areas between fallow strips. If wheat stubble were 1 feet high, for example, then around 20 feet

downwind could be sheltered if the soil were very sandy, and over 300 feet, if the soil were

heavy, clay loam. In the 1930s recommended fallow strips ranged from 1 to10 rods or 16.5 to

165 feet.18 Through investment in erosion control a farmer could reduce topsoil losses and shield

downwind crops from being smothered by saltating and drifting particles. He also could

maintain the viability of fallow strips and windbreaks in combating erosion, which otherwise

would be covered by sand and made ineffective. A major externality in the 1930s occurred when

sand from one farmer’s unprotected fields drifted across the fallow strips and fields of his

downwind neighbor, eliminating any of the productive benefits of those investments.

       Depending on the size of the unprotected area, wind speed, soil type, and amount of soil

moisture, the absence of erosion control on one field or farm could lead to the degeneration of all

erosion control in the region. Similarly, if an isolated farm were strip fallowed, but bordered

upwind by exposed land, the treated farm would gradually succumb as drifting and saltating soil

particles overwhelmed successive fallow strips and crops.

B. Wind Erosion, External Effects, Farm-Size, and Collective Action.

       To completely combat regional erosion, all of the cultivated acreage in a topographical




                                                 8
area of similarly erodible soil would have to be included in a “wind erosion unit” of 50,000 to

500,000 acres or more. The optimal farm sizes for addressing wind erosion and production,

however, were not the same. Most estimates by agricultural economists and extension agents in

the 1930s of appropriate production sizes for the region suggested two sections of land, 1,280

acres, depending on location in the plains. Few scale economies could be realized beyond that

size.19 Nevertheless, in the 1930s, most farms were smaller than the prescribed levels for optimal

production. The Great Plains was covered by hundreds of thousands of small farms. This

condition was largely a legacy of the Homestead Act that limited claims to 160 to 320 acres

when the region was settled between1880 and 1925.

                                               Table 1

       Table 1 shows the prevalence of small farms in all 362 Great Plains counties in our

sample, as well as in the counties of the Great Plains where crop acres as a share of total

farmland were at least 40 percent. We make this distinction because the Great Plains included

areas that specialized in cattle raising with natural grass pasture, as well as areas of extensive

wheat cultivation. These croplands were the most vulnerable to wind erosion. Since available

farm-size categories in the agricultural census do not exactly match the 160 and 320 acres in

homesteads, we present census data on the share of farms below 180 and 500 acres.

       Small farms were checker boarded across the land, surrounding somewhat larger farms, a

condition that increased the potential for externalities from those farms that failed to practice

erosion control.20 As shown, the share of small farms decreased dramatically between 1930 and

1964. Although approximately two-thirds of farms were below 500 acres in the 1930’s, only

about one third were that small by 1964.

       Accordingly, collective action among farmers was necessary to address wind erosion. In




                                                  9
commenting on strip cropping and recognizing the externalities involved, Charles Kellogg of the

Bureau of Chemistry and Soils (1935, 5) stated: “Such a practice, to be most effective, must be

adopted on a community basis. Isolated farmers following this practice are not greatly benefited

if the adjoining land is allowed to blow badly.” The large number of small farms on the Great

Plains, however, raised the costs of coordination. Indeed, Roland Renne of the Montana

Agricultural Experiment Station (1935, 426-9) noted: “Dealing with thousands of different

owners slows up the adoption of a planned land use program…”

       Private motivation to invest in strip fallow was reduced when farmers did not internalize

the externalities.21 The problem was accentuated for small farm owners. Each farmer had to

consider the benefits of strip fallow with the opportunity costs of lost production.22 Because

small farmers captured fewer of these leeward effects, they were less likely to have any fallow

rotation, leaving their land in cultivation and their fields exposed to wind.23

       The excessive tillage practices of small farms were noted by the U.S. Great Plains

Committee (1936, 3, 40-6, 75), appointed by President Roosevelt, “…. although we now know

that in most parts of the Great Plains a farm of this size [homestead]….were required to put this

land under plow, regardless of whether or not it was suited to cultivation.” Cooper, et al, of the

Bureau of Agricultural Economics (1938, 146-8) claimed that farms “are so small that the

establishment of a system of farming that will conserve soil and produce a desirable family

income is practically impossible.” SCS geographer Warren Thornthwaite (1936, 242) concluded:

“…. the type of tillage which, because of its low cost, gives the farmer his only advantage is the

primary cause of wind erosion so destructive in nature that it eventually renders the land unfit for

cultivation.”

IV. Empirical Analysis of Farm Size, Investment in Erosion Control, and Wind Erosion.




                                                 10
       In this section, we first summarize the parameters that influenced a farmer’s decision to

invest in erosion control in the 1930s. We then present quantitative evidence on the importance

of farm size and externalities in that decision. In the empirical analysis, we focus on the fallow

decision because it is the only soil conservation variable continuously reported in the agricultural

census, and strip fallow was the primary means of combating wind erosion recommended by the

SCS.

       We assume that farmers sought to maximize profits by determining the share of their

cropland to place into strip fallow. Strip fallow increased productivity by conserving moisture

and reducing the losses of wind erosion. There were opportunity costs from lost production on

fallowed land. Farmers had to balance those costs with the productive benefits on land that

remained in crops. The productivity gain, however, depended upon the fallow actions of

neighboring farmers--on the aggregate fallow share of total cropland in a wind erosion zone, due

to cross-farm effects.

       Elsewhere we show that when there is only one farm in an erosion-prone region, all

externalities are internalized and the socially-optimal fallow share is achieved.24 When there is

more than one farm, however, farmers will not adopt this share. Moreover, smaller farms have

even greater incentives to deviate from the optimal share because their opportunity costs from

lost production are higher relative to the productivity benefits from fallow.25 Accordingly, in the

presence of many small farms, the total fallow share is lower than socially optimal, and this in

turn, reduces the fallow share selected by every farmer, large and small alike.

       This framework suggests the following implications for empirical analysis of wind

erosion on the Great Plains in the 1930s:

       a. Small farms should have lower fallow shares.




                                                11
       b. The presence of many small farms in a region should reduce fallow incentives on

             larger farms, implying that the greater the variation in farm size, the lower the fallow

             share of cropland on all farms.

       c. Regions with lower fallow shares of cropland (greater fully cultivated shares) should

             have more intense wind erosion, controlling for natural factors.

In the following section we use these implications to guide our analysis of the effects of farm

size on fallow, cultivation, and the intensity of wind erosion damage across the Great Plains.

Three other testable implications are presented here for use in our analysis of collective action in

Section V.

       d. The presence of many small farms and positive transaction costs should require

             formal, coercive government institutions to promote rapid collective action to address

             wind erosion.

       e. Such government institutions should be adopted first in regions where wind erosion

             was most severe.

       f. Larger farmers should be the major advocates of collective action, and subsidies to

             small farms would be required to offset the production losses of increased fallow

             shares.

We now turn to examination of the relationships among farm size, fallow, cultivation, and the

intensity of erosion damage.

A. Farm Size and Fallow Share.

       There are very limited farm-level quantitative data that allow for comparison of the

fallow share of cropland for farms of different size. One data source that provides this

information is a 1936 Resettlement Administration survey of 263 farms in nine townships in




                                                  12
Morton, Slope, Bowman, and Hettinger Counties, North Dakota. This was a mixed

farming/ranching area where more of the land was in crop production, as indicated by 1935

agricultural census data. The percentage of total farmland devoted to crops in the four counties

ranged from 41 to 73 percent, with an average of 54 percent. The survey included mean crop and

mean fallow acres across eight farm-size categories. The calculated fallow shares of cropland are

shown in Table 2, and as predicted, the fallow shares generally increased with farm size.

                                              Table 2

       The shares can be placed into broader context by referring to the 1935 agricultural

census, which indicates that the mean fallow share of cropland for those four counties was

approximately 15 percent when the average farm size was 675 acres. As shown in the table,

farms that were larger than 880 acres had fallow shares above the county mean share and about

twice that of smaller farms. Further, the fallow shares for farms of all sizes were below the one-

third to one-half shares recommended by SCS officials. This finding is consistent with the

notion that the presence of small farms with their limited fallowing would have reduced the

fallow shares of larger farmers. It is instructive to note that as farm size grew over time and Soil

Conservation Districts were put into place in the Great Plains after 1937 to coordinate farmer

anti-erosion efforts, fallow shares in these North Dakota counties increased. By 1964, the mean

fallow share calculated from the census was 28 percent, closer to the range recommended by soil

conservation officials.26

       In our econometric analysis we use county-level agricultural census data from 1930 to

1964. Discussion of the definitions and the comparability of the data across time are provided in

the Data Appendix. We examine the relationship among farm size and fallow share of cropland

using census data for the counties in the Great Plains most vulnerable to erosion, where the share




                                                 13
of crop acres was at least 40 percent of total farmland. This sample allows us to avoid including

ranching counties of mostly pastureland where neither crops nor fallow were major options due

to poor soil quality.

        The relationship that we estimate is

                                  fi = a + b1 si + b2 si2 + b3 di+ ei,

where fi is the share of strip-fallow acres of total crop acreage in each county i, si is average farm

size (land in farms divided by number of farms), si2 is farm size squared, and di is the estimated

standard deviation in farm size in each county. The share of fallow acres is expected to rise with

farm size, but decline with a greater deviation in farm size. The existence of both small and

larger farms in a county would raise cross-farm effects and weaken individual incentives to

invest in wind erosion control.

                                               Table 3

        Table 3 reports the regression results. Since we have data from each agricultural census

between 1930 and 1964, we estimated the fallow relationship separately for each census year, as

well as pooled across the entire period.27 As indicated in the table, the estimated coefficient on

the farm size variable is positive and statistically significant each year. The fallow share

increases with farm size at a decreasing rate, and the marginal effect of farm size on the fallow

share, calculated at the sample mean farm size (shown in italics in the table), are stable through

the years with largest impacts in 1935 and 1940. Further, during early census years, the standard

deviation of farm size in a county exerts a negative and statistically significant effect on fallow

share. Where there was a considerable range of sizes with failure of small farmers to invest in

wind erosion control, the overall use of strip fallow was reduced. As average farm size increased

over time, the variation in farm size tended to decline, and the effect of the standard deviation of




                                                  14
farm size diminished.

       The last column in Table 3 shows the results from the estimation of a panel regression

model with county and time fixed effects. Time effects control for factors such as wheat and

cattle prices, federal farm programs, and other institutional and technological factors. The county

fixed effects allow us to use within county variation to estimate our model. The results of the

fixed-effects panel model further indicate the strong impact of farm size on the use of strip

fallow. The negative and significant coefficient on the farm size deviation variable points to the

role smaller farms played in inhibiting investment by all farms in strip fallow. Large, positive

coefficients on the census year fixed effect variables relative to 1930 (not reported in Table 3)

indicate the growing use of strip fallow over the period.

                                              Table 4

       Using the estimated coefficients for each year we can show the potential increase in

fallow share as farm size increased. The results are given in Table 4. Panel (A) shows the

change in the fallow share of cropland over time as mean farm size grows. Panel (B) reports the

estimated effect of a one standard deviation increase in average farm size on the fallow

percentage for each census year. In 1935, the fallow share is estimated to be 24 percent at a farm

size of 758 acres, but it is only 14 percent at the mean size of 512 acres. Since approximately

2/3’s of farmland was in cropland in 1935 in our sample, this one standard deviation increase in

farm size implies a 166-acre increase in cropland, of which an estimated 75 acres (or 45 percent

of the increase in cropland) would have been put in fallow, assuming no change in crop share.

       The first column of panel (C) shows the estimated “peak” farm size based on the

coefficient estimates of average farm size and farm size squared. These “peak” farm size

estimates can be interpreted as the size beyond which no increase in fallow share is expected as




                                                15
farm size increases. The second column of panel (C) displays the fallow share that corresponds

to this “peak” farm size. In 1935, the fallow share is estimated to be 36 percent at the peak size

of 1,526 acres. This difference of over 1,000 acres in farm size from the mean of 512 acres

implies an increase of 685 acres in cropland, based on the ratio of 2/3’s cropland to total

farmland. Of this increase in cropland, an estimated 323 acres (47 %) would be placed in fallow.

The last column also shows that for farm sizes closer to those recommended as optimal for

production by agricultural economists in 1930s, the fallow share estimates approach the

suggested 1/3 to 1/2 ratio for fallow share of cropland.

       These estimates suggest that an increase in farm size from 512 acres to 1,526 acres in

1935 would have raised fallow shares to their recommended levels. Larger farmers had

approximately three times the cultivated acreage of average farmers and therefore, could

internalize more of the returns from investing in erosion control. Their farms were large enough

to better control the drift of heavier saltating and creeping soil particles that otherwise would

have smothered their fields and strip-fallow investments. Ignoring coordination problems and

assuming complete compliance by all farms in a wind unit, the results in Panel (C) for 1935

indicate that if all farms had been 1,526 acres, they would have internalized most of the

externalities of erosion control, especially those associated with the drift of heavier saltating and

creeping particles. Small farmers, however, captured fewer of these benefits and placed less of

their cropland in fallow. Where their cultivation practices prevailed, wind erosion damage

should have been more severe. We now examine this issue.

B. Farm Size, Cultivation Shares, and the Intensity of Wind Erosion across the Great
Plains

       As indicated in Figure 1, the intensity of wind erosion varied across the counties of the

Great Plains. The literature on erosion and our analytical framework suggest that this variation



                                                 16
should be a function of differences in drought conditions, wind velocity, sand content of the soil

(erodibility), and the extent of cultivation (cropland – strip fallow) across the counties. The

effect of small farms on erosion control should be reflected in the cultivation measure.

       In 1934, the Soil Conservation Service conducted reconnaissance erosion surveys

throughout the United States. State and national maps were prepared in 1934 and 1935 detailing

locations of wind and water erosion of different intensities, ranging from no erosion, slight,

moderate, severe, and very severe erosion. We use these maps to assign erosion index values to

each county in the Great Plains in 1934 and estimate the following relationship:

       WEi = f (ri, ti, wi, ci,),

where WEi is the wind erosion index measure for county i, ranging from 0 to 3 for no, light,

moderate, and severe erosion; ri is the deviation in rainfall from normal levels during 1930-35, ti

is percent sand in county soil; wi is average annual hourly wind velocity by county; and ci is

percent of total county farmland in cultivation (i.e. total cropland minus fallow divided by sum

of total cropland, including fallow or idle land, and pasture). The Data Appendix describes the

details of variable construction. Controlling for these variables, as well as state fixed effects, we

examine the impact of cultivation intensity as determined by farm size on wind erosion.

                                               Table 5

       Table 5 summarizes the results of the statistical analysis. Columns (1) and (2) report the

coefficient estimates of the OLS model with state fixed effects in the full and truncated samples

of Great Plains counties, respectively. The last two columns present ordered probit estimates,

utilizing the ordinal nature of the dependent variable. The regression results indicate that the

counties with higher cultivation shares of total farmland faced more severe wind erosion. The

coefficient estimates for the other variables have the expected signs, and most are statistically




                                                 17
significant.

                                               Table 6

        Table 6 shows the observed cell frequencies and the predicted probabilities for different

levels of wind erosion. The results are based on the coefficient estimates of the ordered probit

model at various cultivation share values from the truncated sample estimation. Column 2 reports

the predicted erosion probabilities that are calculated at the mean values for all of the variables.

The predicted probabilities of the model are similar to the observed cell frequencies, indicating

the model’s ability to predict correctly. The last two columns are calculated at the mean values

for the variables, except that in column 3, the cultivation share is assumed to be 50.8 percent, one

standard deviation below the mean share, while in column 4 the cultivation share is assumed to

be 100 percent of farmland. If the average county cultivation share is 50.8 percent, the predicted

probabilities of “no” or “light” wind erosion (i.e. Prob (WE = 0) and Prob (WE = 1)) increase

from those associated with the mean cultivation share, whereas the probabilities of “moderate”

and “severe” erosion decrease. In contrast, if we assume that farmers in a county put all of their

farmland into cultivation (cultivation share = 100 percent), which was not unlikely for very small

homesteads of 160 - 320 acres, the predicted probability of “severe” wind erosion jumps from

0.26 to 0.58 and the predicted probability of “no” wind erosion practically disappears. These

calculations indicate the important effect of cultivation intensity and farm size on the magnitude

of the wind erosion damage in a county.

V. A “Unitized” Response for the Control of Externalities: The Formation of Soil
Conservation Districts.

        A. Farm-Size Effects and Private Efforts to Address Wind Erosion.

        With all farms in the 1930s below the size necessary to fully combat wind erosion and

internalize the externalities involved, coordinated actions were required. Private efforts to



                                                 18
contain the blowing and drifting of soil would have posed a formidable bargaining problem even

if farmer incentives had been aligned. Hence, a difficult collective action problem existed in the

Great Plains in the 1930s. And given the magnitude and severity of the problem, there were

important reasons for moving quickly to reduce the costs of wind erosion. Unfortunately, the

drought began in 1930, but an effective institutional response did not emerge until after 1937.

       In the early 1930s, the expectation was that the drought would end and that short-term

private efforts to combat erosion would be sufficient. Even so, the challenge of coordinating

action among farmers was understood clearly. In a 1936 report to H.H. Bennett, Chief of the

SCS, J.T. Reece, Soil Conservation Supervisor in Littlefield, Texas, argued: “The premier

problem in establishing a constructive erosion control program in this camp is securing adequate

cooperation from the farmers and land owners, for without this, no conservation program is

possible.”28

       To encourage coordinated investment in erosion control, the SCS, starting in 1934,

developed 79 demonstration areas to show farmers the benefits of various conservation

practices.29 Reflecting the size necessary to address regional erosion, these demonstration areas

were large, ranging from 24,960 to 169,000 acres in Colorado, 30,000 acres to114, 000 acres in

Kansas, and 30,000 to 114,000 acres in Nebraska.30Given the mixed incentives to participate in

erosion control, the response to calls for voluntary collective action was limited.31 Indeed, the

SCS noted a lack of voluntary farmer participation in the erosion control programs outlined in

the demonstration projects. In 1935, Bennett reprimanded F.L. Duley, Regional SCS Director in

Mankato, Kansas, stating, “Frankly, it is somewhat disappointing to note that such a small

portion of your project is being retired from cultivation and that you are not using any strip-




                                                 19
cropping measures whatsoever…we have been considering that strip-cropping would make up

one of our principal means of erosion control.”32

       An examination of records for demonstration areas in Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico,

and Texas in 1936-37 reveals differential actions in erosion control among “cooperators” and

“non-cooperators.” Data on fallow and strip cropping across farms shows that for cooperators the

fallow and strip-cropping share of total cultivated land was 25 percent, whereas for non-

cooperators the share was 14 percent.33 Other evidence suggests that the smallest farmers in the

demonstration areas were the non-cooperators. Records from two erosion control projects in

Dalhart and Dublin, Texas in 1937 and 1939 identify cooperators and non-cooperators according

to farm size. Although the data set is small, in both cases cooperating farms were somewhat

larger than non-cooperating farms. In Dalhart, located in the Texas Panhandle, the mean size of

cooperating farms was 629 acres, whereas the mean size of non-cooperators was 418 acres. In

Dublin, located in central Texas, the mean size of cooperating farms was 145 acres, while the

average size of non-cooperating farms was118 acres.34

       B. Government Intervention to Address the Collective Action Problem: Soil
       Conservation Districts.

       More direct and coercive government intervention came in 1937 with inauguration of

Soil Conservation Districts (SCDs) that had the authority to force farmer compliance and the

resources (subsidies) to cover the costs of erosion control. The SCDs were local government

units and required state legislation for establishment. A model statute was drafted by USDA

Assistant Secretary M.L. Wilson and Assistant Solicitor Philip M. Glick and submitted by

President Roosevelt to the state governors for legislative adoption in February 1937:

…for the discontinuance of land use practices contributing to erosion and the adoption and

carrying out of soil conservation practices and to provide for the enforcement of such programs



                                               20
and regulations…The failure by any land occupier to conserve the soil and control the erosion

upon his lands causes a washing and blowing of soil, of water, from his lands on to other lands,

makes the conservation of soil and the control of erosion of the other lands difficult or

impossible.35

       We expect the states with the greatest wind erosion problems to be the first to adopt

legislation to promote cooperation among farmers. Indeed, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, at the

center of the Dust Bowl, enacted wind erosion laws in 1935, earlier than other Great Plains

states.36 In all three states, district officials were authorized to enter private property to combat

erosion and to fine non-complying owners.37 In Colorado, another central Dust Bowl state,

assessments were levied against farmlands to fund erosion control, and Soil Conservation

Districts had the power to block new cultivation plans with “sod land ordinances.”38

       The conservation districts were even larger than the demonstration areas. For example,

districts in Kansas in 1941 ranged from about 250,000 acres to nearly 600,000 acres.39 The

district sizes reflected the areas necessary to encompass an erodible region or wind zones.

Districts typically covered entire counties, and they clearly focused on externalities. The land-use

ordinances applied only where neglect on one farm caused damage or hindered conservation

treatment “on adjacent lands.” The 1939 Extension Service Review noted:

Individual farmers have been practicing measures of erosion control for years, but they have

learned that it is a difficult if not a losing single-handed fight…As the forces of wind and water

are not halted by the section line or fence row, erosion becomes a community problem, and

community problems require community action (Partain, 1939, 357-8).

       Within the districts, individual farmers entered into contracts with the SCS to cooperate

in reducing soil erosion for five years. The SCS provided equipment, seeds, fencing, and




                                                  21
personnel for erosion control. Erosion control ordinances imposing land use regulations on all

farmers could be adopted upon a favorable vote of a majority of the farmers in a district. Under

the statute, the district supervisors could occupy parts of farms and begin erosion control with the

costs plus 5 percent levied by court order against the farmer.40 Further, farmers who did not

comply were ineligible for SCS assistance. Moreover, beginning in 1938, the Agricultural

Adjustment Administration (AAA) required that “every cooperator handle his land by using

practices which are effective in preventing wind erosion.”

       Subsidies were provided. 30 percent of AAA payments to a farm were to be earned by

carrying out soil conservation practices. AAA payments to the farmer, however, were to be

reduced by $1.00 per acre for each acre of land where approved practices were not implemented.

If it were deemed that the farmer’s land had become “a wind erosion hazard to surrounding

farmers in the community,” they would not receive any funds under the 1939 Agricultural

Conservation Program (ACP). These funds were significant to a farm family, amounting to $162

per applicant in 1939.41 Districts could acquire lands “for purposes of conservation” and receive

1939 Agricultural Conservation Program funds and loans from the Farm Security Administration

(FSA). Finally, the FSA was authorized to make loans for erosion control investments to be

repaid with ACP allocations. Other FSA loans were to assist farmers “obtain a proper-size

operating unit.”42

       The available evidence also suggests that larger farmers, who bore more of the costs of

cross-farm erosion externalities, were the major proponents of Soil Conservation Districts. Data

from Farm Service Agency files in Helena, Montana include information on the size of farms

owned by individual farmers who petitioned for the establishment of three SCDs in Montana:

The Little Beaver SCD (formed January 27, 1942), the Cascade County SCD (approved June 17,




                                                22
1946), and the Powder River County SCD (organized December 17, 1953). A comparison of the

average farm size of the petitioners with census data on the average farm size in the county

allows us to test the hypothesis that political support for SCDs would come from larger farmers.

As indicated in Table 7, the petitioning farmers had somewhat larger farms on average than the

mean farm size in the county. Especially in Fallon County, the average farm size of petitioners

was one standard deviation larger than the mean farm size in 1940.

                                              Table 7

VII. Conclusion.

       In this paper we re-examine a well-known environmental disaster, the Dust Bowl of the

1930s, and emphasize the important role that farm size and externalities played in both

contributing to severe wind erosion and inhibiting corrective action. Best possible wind erosion

control would have required farms that would have been productively inefficient. We argue that

farmers were more likely to adopt wind erosion control, such as putting part of their cropland to

strip fallow, if they were operating at sizes closer to recommended production levels. At those

sizes they internalized more of the benefits of fallow relative to the opportunity costs of lost

production. Farm-level data and our empirical analysis using county census data provide

evidence that larger farms had greater fallow shares. Further, our analysis shows that erosion

across the Great Plains was more severe in those counties where cultivation shares were greater.

       Soil Conservation Districts, which could be as large as 600,000 acres, eventually were

implemented in order to coordinate and enforce farmer actions to combat regional wind erosion.

Within these districts, individual farmers entered into contracts with the SCS to cooperate in

more complete erosion control.




                                                 23
       The results reported here are consistent with more contemporary analyses of the sources

of wind erosion that emphasize the importance of land use practices relative to natural geologic

and climatic conditions. Field personnel of the SCS recognized the problem of small farms in the

1930s, but this issue has been lost in subsequent work on the Dust Bowl by historians,

agricultural economists and engineers. Regulations within Soil Conservation Districts, along

with the gradual consolidation of farms, led to changes in cultivation practices that better

shielded the soil so that when droughts affected the Great Plains in the 1950 and 1970s, the

region was less vulnerable to wind erosion.43

       The Dust Bowl illustrates a classic common-pool problem. Exacerbated by the existence

of many small farms in the Great Plains, it was not solved until larger units were created that

aligned the incentives of the individual parties. In this sense, addressing the problem of

widespread wind erosion required actions similar to those necessary to reduce losses in

competitive oil extraction, fishery exploitation, and aquifer drawdown.44

                                              Data Appendix

The qualitative and quantitative evidence presented in the paper come from many sources as

indicated in the endnotes. This appendix describes the quantitative evidence presented in the

tables and used in the econometric analyses.45

Data Sources:

1. U.S. Agricultural Census Data, 1930 – 1964.

The census data are electronically available from the Great Plains Population and Environment

Database, 2001, Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR),

University Michigan, http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/plains, and from U.S. Historical Census Data

Browser, http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/census/ . When necessary we supplemented these sources

using the print versions of Agricultural Census data.

Census Data Definitions, Data Construction and Comparability across Time:

A. Farmland: The land in farms includes all cropland harvested, all land on which crops failed,

all cropland idle or fallow, all cropland used only for pasture, all woodland, and all other land

including all wastelands, house yards, barnyards, feed lots, lanes, roads, ditches, etc. This

variable is quite comparable across years although there were changes in the inclusion of

“nonagricultural” land, which is only a small portion of farmland.

B. Total Crop Acres: Includes cropland harvested, land on which crops failed, cropland idle or

fallow and cropland used for pasture. This variable is consistent across years, but the specific

definition of “cropland for pasture” differs slightly in 1945.

C. Fallow Acres: Fallow or idle land as defined by the census during 1930-1945, and summer

fallow as defined during 1950-1964. This is the most comparable definition of fallow, although

the latter years’ fallow acres are more restricted than the years of 1930 – 1945.




                                                 25
C. Fallow Share (constructed variable) = 100*(Fallow Acres / Total Crop Acres).

D. Crop Share (constructed variable) = 100*(Total Crop Acres / Farmland).

E. Cultivation Share (constructed variable) = 100*(Total Crop Acres – Fallow Acres) /

Farmland.

F. Standard Deviation in Farm Size (constructed variable):

The agricultural census provides farm size categories and the number of farms in each category.

We constructed following categories that are comparable over the years and used these data to

calculate an approximate standard deviation: 0-49 acres, 50-99 acres, 100-179 acres, 180-259

acres, 260-499 acres, 500-999 acres and over 1,000 acres. The standard deviation of farm size

was calculated based on the difference between average farm size and the mid-point of each

category, weighted by the number of farms in each category. In order to choose the mid-point for

the open-ended category of farms over 1,000 acres, we first estimated the farmland in farms over

1,000 acres and calculated the average farm size in this category. We used this calculated

average size as the mid-point if it were between 1000 and 3000 acres. If the estimated average

farm size were smaller than 1000 acres, we used the lower limit of 1000 acres as the mid-point.

Otherwise, the upper-limit of 3,000 acres was used as the mid-point. The formula for weighted

variance is provided below:

       Variance = ∑ ( N i / N T )( M i − F ) 2
                     i
where Ni = # of farms in a category for a county; NT= Total number of farms in a county;

       Mi=Mid-point of a size category; and F =Average farm size in a county.

2. Data used in the Wind Erosion Analysis:

A. Wind Erosion Index: State Erosion Reconnaissance Survey maps prepared in 1934 by the

SCS for Montana, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, and




                                                 26
New Mexico are available at the National Archives, Record Group 114, Cartographic Collection.

See Kifer and Stewart (1938, 9) for a 1934 map and a 1935 U.S. Erosion Reconnaissance Survey

map is available in Joel (1937). We consider only wind erosion as indicated on the maps and do

not assign values for water erosion. The maps are color coded and shaded to identify locations

of different erosion intensity. A county was assigned a value from 0 to 3 based on dominant

erosion conditions indicated in the maps. Generally, a county’s erosion index value was based

on the condition that characterized 50 percent or more of the county. In cases where severe

erosion conditions were widespread within the county, but the total appeared to cover less than

50 percent of the land area, the county was still assigned the severe index value, 3. The

indication that severe erosion was widespread and not localized warranted the higher value.

B. Rainfall Deviation: is average percent departure from normal by county, 1930-35, from

Cronin and Beers (1937, Table 8, 41-54).

C. Wind Velocity: Annual average hourly wind velocity in miles per hour 30 feet above the

ground is from Chepil, Siddoway, and Armbrust (1962, 163). They provide a map of the United

States with isobars of similar wind speeds. These are used to map onto county locations. For the

Great Plains, the minimum wind speed was 9 miles per hour and the maximum was 14. Each

county was assigned one of the following wind velocity values: 9 mph = 0, 10 mph =1, 11 mph

= 2, 12 mph =3, 13 mph = 4, 14 mph =5.

D. Percent Sand in Soils: Soil erodibility in a county is indicated by percent sand, since sandy

soils are highly erodible. % sand by county is from STATSGO data set graciously provided to

us by Geoff Cunfer from the Great Plains Population and Environment Database, 2001, Inter-

University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), University of Michigan.

E. Definition of the Sample:




                                                27
Our definition of the Great Plains is based on the map of the region in Kifer and Stewart’s (1937,

9) Works Progress Administration Report. Their designation of the Great Plains includes the 362

eastern counties of Montana, Colorado, and New Mexico, all of North Dakota, those west of the

97th meridian in South Dakota, most of those west of the 98th meridian in Nebraska, Kansas, and

Oklahoma, and west Texas counties in the Panhandle to 32 degrees latitude. The results

described in the text do not appear to be sensitive to our definition of the Great Plains. Dropping

far eastern counties in North and South Dakota, for example, do not change our results.

In our analyses, we also used a truncated sample of Great Plains counties where crop acres as a

share of total farmland were at least 40 percent (285 in 1930, variable after that). We make this

distinction because the Great Plains included areas that specialized in cattle raising with natural

grass pasture and areas of extensive wheat or cotton cultivation. Croplands were the most

vulnerable to wind erosion.

Notes: Fallow share calculations are based on the coefficient estimates presented in Table 3. Panels (A) and (B) show the fallow share

as a percentage of total crop acres calculated at the mean farm size and at the farm size of mean-plus-one standard deviation,

respectively. The first column of panel (C) gives the estimates of the “peak” farm size based on the coefficient estimates of the

average farm size and average farm size squared. These are estimates of farm size beyond which no increase in fallow share is

expected as farm size increases. The last column of panel (C) presents the fallow share values based on these “peak” farm size

estimates.

Sources: Rainfall deviation is from Cronin and Beers (1937, Table 8, 41-54). Annual

average hourly wind velocity is from Chepil, Siddoway, and Armbrust (1962, 163). Sand

percentage by county is from STATSGO data set graciously provided to us by Geoff

Cunfer from the Great Plains Population and Environment Database, 2001, Inter-

University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), University of

Michigan. Cultivation share is calculated from 1930 Agricultural Census county-level

measures of farmland, cropland and fallow acres.

Notes: Huber-White robust standard errors are in parentheses. Standard errors of ordered

probit specification are adjusted for clustered errors by state. The threshold parameters of

the ordered probit are correctly ordered and precisely estimated. Columns (1) and (3)

results from Great Plains counties where county level total crop acre percentage is at least

40 percent of the total farmland. OLS models include state dummy variables, all of which

are positive and statistically significant relative to the left-out state of Oklahoma. For the

detailed descriptions of variable definitions and construction, see the Data Appendix.

    We use the term “cultivated” acres to describe crop acres that do not include fallow or

idle land. Cultivation share is the percent of total county farmland in cultivation (i.e. total

cropland minus fallow or idle land divided by sum of total cropland, including fallow or

idle land, and pasture).

and Paschal (1942), and Kraenzel, (1942, 583-6) for complaints about small farmers. Very small farmers
with mortgages or tenant payments also may have had less incentive to invest in erosion control because
placing land in fallow may have placed them below their budget constraints.
24
   A longer version includes a formal model, working paper, Karl Eller Center, University of Arizona 2002.
25
   The model is flexible enough for zero fallow shares on some farms, most likely on very small farms.
26
   Government commodity policies and other factors may have influenced fallowing decisions. As
described later in the text, fallow shares increased generally after the Soil Conservation Districts were
created.
27
   We take farm size as exogeneous in examining the fallow decision and later in determining the effects
of cultivation on wind erosion. Other productivity factors, such as relative factor prices, non-farm income
and technology were the major determinants of farm size (Kislev and Peterson, 1982). Initial farm sizes
largely were set by the Homestead Act. After 1937, SCDs, which subsidized and occasionally forced the
adoption of erosion control, reduced any potential effect of wind erosion and erosion control investments
on farm size. We tested for endogeneity of farm size using farm population per 1000 farm acres in 1930
as an instrument for the same sample used in the regression reported in Table 3. The result of the Durbin-
Wu-Hausman test indicates no evidence of endogeneity or inconsistency in the OLS estimates.
