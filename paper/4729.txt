       Shifts in the incidence of various types of training over the 1980s favored more-educated.

more-experienced workers. Coupled with the fact that this training is associated with higher

wages, these shifts suggest that training may have contributed to the growth of wage inequality

in this period. However, the shifts were apparently too small, or the returns to training too low,

for training to have played a substantial role in this increase. The estimated changes inwage

differentials associated with schooling and experience are at best only slightly smaller once we

account for changes in the distribution of training across schooling and experiencegroups, as well

as changes in the returns to training and in the length of training programs.

1. Introduction

       Wage inequality in the 1980s increased along two dimensions. First, there was an

increase in within-group" wage inequality, or wage inequality among workers with the

same schooling, age, etc. This dimension of inequality trended upwards through the 1970s

and 1980s, although more strongly so in the 1970s (Juhn, ci a!., 1993). Second, there was

an increase in "between-group inequality, in the form of growing wage differentials

between workers with different amounts of schooling or experience. The increases in

schooling and experience differentials were the largest contributors to the overall growth

of wage inequality in the 1980s (Juhn, et a!., 1993; Blackburn, et al., 1990; Katz and

Murphy, 1992; Murphy and Welch, 1992).

       Existing research that seeks to explain these changes in the wage structure has

focused primarily on the rise in between-group inequality.' Not surprisingly, economic

research has emphasized demand and supply explanations? This research generally

concludes that demand shifts explain relatively more of the growth of wage inequality, and

in particular points to a shift in relative demand towards more skilled workers, probably

driven by technical change (Bound and Johnson, 1992; Bennan, et aL, 1993). Supply-based
explanations have focused largely on the quantities of workers at different schooling

levels. The "first-order" explanation based on supply changes does not fit the data,

because the college-high school wage differential grew in the 1980s even though the



    'Blackburn and Neumark (1993) provide some evidence on potential explanations of
increased within-group inequality, in particular whether the price of ability has risen, as
conjectured by Juhn,et al. (1993).
    ?l'here is also research on institutional changes regarding minimum wages and union
organization (Blackburn, et aL, 1990), and the changing composition of jobs in the U.S.
economy (Bluestone and Harrison, 1986)..
                                              I
 relative supply of college-educated workers was higher in the 1980s than in the 1970s.

 However, the rate of growth of the college-educated workforce slowed in the 1980s, which,

 coupled with a steady growth of relative demand for more-edu&ted workers, could

 partially explain the rising college wage premium in this period (Blackburn, et al., 1990;
Katz and Murphy, 1992).

       While supply-based analyses of changes in the wage structure in the 1980s have

focused on quantities (or changes in quantities) of workers at different schooling levels,

another potential supply-side explanation is that the quaiity of workers at various schooling

levels has changed. This possibility was first raised by Blackburn, et al. (1990), who

suggested that the relative ability of college- to high school-educated workers may have

increased over the 1980s. However, the evidence is somewhat contradictory. Blackburn

and Neumark (1993) find no evidence of a widening ability differential between schooling

levels over this period, while Bishop (1991a) reports that the quality of college graduates

relative to high school graduates increased over the 1980s.3

       Explanations based on quality changes at different schooling levels have been

criticized because they can at best provide a partial explanation of the increase in

between-group wage inequality. The reason is that wage differentials by schooling level

expanded not only for cohorts just entering the labor market, but for older cohorts as well,
for whom the distribution of characteristics across schooling levels cannot have changed

(Blackburn, et aL, 1990; Levy and Murnane, 1992).


    31n related research, Cameron and Heckinan (1993) show that over the 1980s an
increasing proportion of high school graduates held GEDs, and that the returns to such
degrees are lower than the returns to a high school diploma.

   4th principle, such changes could arise through selection into employment. But this
seems implausible for prime-age males, who have employment rates exceeding 90 percent.
                                             2
       However, the "quality" of a worker is not determined solely by schooling, and is not

fixed at the completion of schooling. In particular, training—which is likely to increase a

worker's productivity and wage—may occur at any point in a worker's career (although

theory suggests that it is more likely to occur at young ages). Our goal in this paper is to

explore further whether quality changes can explain changes in the wage structure over the

1980s. But rather than focusing on school quality, we examine the role of changes in

training. There are at least two empirical clues that motivate this question. First, Krueger

(1993) provides evidence that changes in the incidence of computer use at work can

explain a significant portion of the increase in the return to schooling from 1984 to 1989,

partly because more-educated workers are more likely to use computers at work. It seems

likely that computer use on the job (especially when it is independent of computer use at

home) is associated with training. Second, Cl's tabulations suggest that increases in the

incidence of training over the 1980s were more pronounced for more-educated workers

(Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1992).

       In our view, asking whether changes in the distribution of training across workers

contributed to the growth of wage inequality in the 1980s is of interest for two reasons.

First, changes in training may be an important part of a supply-side, quality-based

explanation of changes in the wage structure, which can explain widening schooling-wage
differentials for less-experienced as weli as more-experienced workers! Second, a

stronger case could be made for efforts to expand trsining for lower-wage workers if the

relative (or absolute) wage declines they have experienced in the past decade can be

attributed to relative (or absolute) declines in training.


   'Of course, such changes cannot be viewed as entirely distinct from demand-side
changes, since changes in the demands for skills may spur training.
                                               3
 II. The Data

        We utilize data from the January 1983 and January 1991 supplements to the

 Current Population Survey (CPS). In both of these supplements, respondents were asked

 two questions regarding the incidence of training: 'Did you need specific skills or training

 to obtain your current (last) job? and "Since you obtained your present job, did you take

 any training to improve your skills? Individuals responding affirmatively to either of

 these questions were then asked to list the sources of each type of training from a list

 including school, a formal company program, informal on the job training, and other types

of training.6 (Individuals could identify more than one source.) We focus on the set of

training questions that are common to the 1983 and 1991 surveys. We are interested both

in training to qualify for the current job, and training to improve skills on the current job,
since either type is likely to increase a worker's productivity. The first type of training is

relatively more likely to be worker-financed, and the second employer-financed, although

the information on financing is sparse and not common across the two surveys.7' A

response indicating that an individual received training in school to qualify for the current

job is somewhat ambiguous, since they may simply be referring to regular schooling.

Nonetheless, such information is potentially interesting because it indicates schooling that



    'More details are provided in U.S. Department of Labor (1992).
     71n the 1983 survey respondents were asked if their in-school and formal company
training was paid for by their employer. In the 1991 supplement, respondents were asked
if their employers paid for all, half or more, less than half, or none of their in-school
training only.
    'Studies that have tested whether workers or employers pay for general and spéeific
training have shown that although most employers and workers consider the training they
receive to be fairly general, employers appear to pay for a large portion of training
(Baron, Berger, and Black, 1993; Bishop, 1990).
                                              4
the worker perceives as directly related to the skills or qualifications for the current job.

       While the questions were asked of all employed and unemployed persons, we are

ultimately interested in looking at the relationship between training and wages, and hence

use data only on the outgoing rotation group (the members of which have wage data). In

all cases, we report results using weighted data. The weights were constructed to

represent the universe of non-self-employed individuals, aged 16 and over, who reported

working for a wage in the survey week. The original sampling weights were adjusted to

reflect that the population used in this study includes only those individuals who reported

complete data on training, wages, schooling and other variables used in the empirical

analysis. The weights were adjusted separately by age (five-year intervals for individuals

under 25, ten-year intervals for all others), race, and sex. The empirical analysis focuses

mainly on men, reflecting the emphasis in the literature on changes in their wage structure.

       We use the hourly wage when it is reported, and otherwise the weekly wage divided

by usual weekly hours. The hourly wage is top-coded at $99 in both years, and we observe

no top-coded hourly wages in our data. However, the weekly wage was top-coded at $999

in 1983, and $1923 in 1991. Because the $999 figure is often binding, this change in the

top-coding may affect wage regression results, especially for more-educated workers whose

earnings are likely to be higher. We handle this by imposing on both years the lower of

the two top-codes, measured in real dollars. Thus, we use a top-code in 1991 of $999

inflated to 1991 dollars using the PCE implicit price deflator, for a top-code of $1390.

Once we have converted all wages to a nominal hourly wage with consistent top-codes, we

express 1991 hourly wages in terms of 1983 dollars, again using the PCE implicit price

deflator. This allows the esthnated wage regression coefficients to be more easily

interpreted as reflecting real wage changes or differentials.

 Changes in the Distribution of Training

        The first question is whether the distribution of training has changed in ways that

may explain changes in the wage structure. Some partial evidence on this question is

provided in Bureau of Labor Statistics (1992), which documents an overall increase in

training on the current job, and at the same time, sharper increases for more-educated

workers. In this section, we provide a more detailed analysis of this question. To assess

whether changes in the distribution of training could have generated changes in schooling-

wage differentials for more-experienced as well as less-experienced workers, we considec

i) changes in each type of reported training, the number of types of training, and the

length of formal company training, by schooling level, ii) changes in training by level of

potential experience, and iii) changes in training by schooling level, within experience

groups.9

       Table 1 reports the incidence of training undertaken to qualify for the current job.

The data are displayed in pairs of rows, the first row showing the proportion reporting

such training in 1983, and the second showing the 1983.1991 change in the proportion.

Across the columns, we first report the proportion indicating any type of training, followed

by the proportions reporting each type of training, followed by the proportions reporting

one, two, or three or more types of training?° The first row reveals that the proportion

reporting any training to qualify for the current job was slightly greater than one-half (35),


     'Throughout this subsection, we do not report the statistical significance of the
differences in training that we discuss, since we are less interested in these differences per
se than in the effects of these differences on the wage structure.

   9'he proportions reporting four or more types of training were minuscule, so we
combine those reporting three and four or more types.

                                              6
and rose only slightly (by .01) over the sample period." There were increases in the

proportion reporting in-school training, formal company programs, and other training
methods, and a decrease in the proportion reporting informal on the job training. There

were also increases in the proportions reporting either two or three or more types of

training, and a decrease in the proportion reporting only one type of training.

       Next, we look at these proportions disaggregated by schooling and potential
experience. The first result to note is that the incidence of training rises sharply with

schooling, with the proportion reporting any training needed to qualify for the current job
rising from 29 (in 1983) for high school dropouts to .85 for those with a college deEee or

higher. However, looking at type of training (columns (2)-(5)), we see that this
relationship is monotonicaiiy positive only for in-school training, so the result to some

extent reflects the fact that higher levels of schooling are perceived as having qualified

workers for their current jobs. With respect to potential experience, almost without

exception each type of training to qualify for the current job exhibits an inverted U-shape,

with the incidence of training higher for those with 10-20 years of potential experience

than for those with less than 10 or more than 20 years of potential experience.

       The question of interest, though, is whether disparities in training across schooling

or experience groups widened between 1983 and 1991 in ways consistent with the widening

of wage differentials by schooling or experience. In general, with respect to training to

qualify for the current job, the answer appears to be no. For example, the proportion

reporting any training fell by .01 for high school dropouts and .02 for coflege graduates,

and rose by .02 IS workers with 0-10 years of experience as well as those with more than


    "In Bureau of Labor Statistics (1992) this proportion is reported to rise from 35 to
.57, although the sample is different (most importantly, perhaps, including women).
                                              7
 20 years of experience. Looking at the individual types of training by schooling level, the

 only finding consistent with respect to training contributing to widening wage differentials

 is that the proportion of college graduates reporting formal company training rose by .03,
in contrast to a .01 rise for high school graduates, and no change for high school dropouts.

But for the other types of training the changes in the incidence of training did not favor

the more educated, with the exception of those with some college education reporting in-

school training, and reporting three or more types of training. Similarly, looking at•

workers disaggregated by level of potential experience, there is no clear pattern of

increases in the incidence of training in favor of more-experienced workers, except for in-

school training.

       Table 2 turns to a similar analysis for training to improve skills on the current job.

A number of differences compared with Table 1 are notable. First, not surprisingly given

the different training question, a much smaller proportion report in-school training (.12 vs.

.25, in 1983). Second, the relationship between schooling and training is more consistently

positive, with the only exception to a positive inonotonic relationship coming for infonnal

on the job training for college graduates. More importantly, though, the evidence in favor

of relative increases in training for more-educated and more-experienced workers is quite

pronounced. The proportion reporting any training fell by .01 for high school dropouts,
rose by .02 for high school graduates, and rose by .08 for college graduates. A similar

pattern of larger increases for college graduates appears for all types of training with the

exception of in-school training, and also appears in the form of increases in the proportion

reporting two or more types of training. The same relative increase in training shows up

for more-experienced as compared with less-experienced workers. For example, the

proportion reporting any training rose by .07 for the most-experienced group, compared

                                             8
with an increase of .02 for the least-experienced group. A similar pattern of relative

increases in training favoring the most-experienced group (and sometimes also the group

with 10-20 years of experience) is reflected for each type of training, and in the

proportions reporting two or more types of training. Thus, the evidence in Table 2 is

more suggestive of a role for training in generating the growth of between-group wage

inequality over the sample period.
       Part of the motivation for looking at training, as opposed to other supply-side,

quality-based explanations of the rise in wage inequality, is the fact that schooling-wage

differentials widened for more-experienced as well as less-experienced workers, as

discussed in the Introduction. It is therefore of interest to ask whether training can

potentially explain this phenomenon as well. If training contributed to widening schooling-

wage differentials for workers of all experience levels, the relative proportion reporting

training should have risen for more-educated workers, for both less- and more-experienced

workers. To examine this, Table 3 reports changes in the proportion reporting training,

disaggregated by schooling level, within experience groups. Panel. A reports results for
training to qualify for the current job, while Panel B reports results for training to improve

skills on the current job. Looking first at trnining to qualify for the current job, there were

in fact relative increases in formal company training, other training, and informal on the

job training, for college graduates as compared with other workers, although these relative

increases show up only for the least-experienced group. On the other hand, looking at

training to improve skills on the current job (Panel B), relative increases in training for

more-educated workers are apparent for all experience groups, and if anything are sharper

for workers with 10-20 or 20+ years of experience. For example, the proportion reporting

any such training rose by .11 or .12 for college graduates with 10 or more years of

                                              9
 potential experience, compared with essentially no change for less-educated workers.

Similar relative increases appear for each type of training, and to some extent for the

proportions reporting multiple types of training. Therefore it appears that training to
improve skills on the current job, in particuiar, could have played a role in the observed

changes in the wage structure.

       The final dimension of the distribution of training that we examine is the length of

training programs. Since the duration of training, and not only its incidence, is likely to

affect wages, changes in the distribution of training based on its length could also have

influenced wages.' In the CPS supplements, length of training is reported only for in-

school training and formal company training, and can be consistently coded across 1983

and 1991 only for the categories less than 1.3 weeks, 13 to 25 weeks, and 26 or more

weeks. Because of the ambiguity regarding the interpretation of in-school training, we

focus only on the length of formal company training programs. Table 4 reports changes in

the distribution of training by length, for those reporting a formal company training

program. The first three columns refer to training to qualify for the current job. The

estimates reveal relative increases in the length of training for more-educated and more-

experienced workers. The proportion receiving training less than 13 weeks rose by .08 for

high school graduates and dropouts, but rose by only .03 for college graduates or those

with some college. In contrast, the proportion receiving training lasting 26 weeks or longer

fell by .06 for high school graduates and dropouts, but fell by only .03 for college

graduates. Similarly, the distribution of lengths of training programs shifted towards

programs lasting less than 13 weeks for workers with 0-10 year of potential experience and


    '2Studies by Mincer (1989) and Barron, Berger and Black (1993) have found that
intensity as well as incidence of training have positive effects on wage growth.

10-20 years   of potentiaJ experience (although less so for the latter group), while there was

no change in the distribution for the most-experienced workers.

      The results for training to improve skills on the current job, reported in columns

       are more ambiguous. Disaggregated by experience group, the results parallel those

for training to qualify for the current job, although the changes are less sharp. But by

schooling level, the results are reversed, with high school dropouts showing the largest

decrease in the proportion receiving training less than 13 weeks, and the largest increase in

the proportion receiving training lasting 26 weeks or more. Thus, the overall evidence

from the data on length of training is ambiguous, with only some of the evidence pointing

towards increased length of training for more-educated or more-experienced workers.

Changes in Wage Inequality
      To this point, the evidence on changes in the distribution of training is potentially

consistent with changes in training having contributed to the growth of wage inequality in

the 1980s. However, the key question is whether the changes themselves, combined with

the effects of training on wages, are sufficiently large to have induced the observed

changes in the wage structure. In this section we turn to evidence on this question.

      Our strategy consists of first estimating a standard log wage regression that captures

the increase in between-group wage inequality in the 1980s,' by adding interactions of a

year dummy variable with both schooling and experience, as in



    Uwe originally intended to consider within-group inequality as well. However, it turns
out that, in these data, within-group wage inequality did not increase from 1983 to 1991,
and if anything fell slightly. Overall wage inequality did increase. The difference between
the 50th and 10th percentile of log wages rose from .79 to .81 from 1983 to 1991, while the
9Oth-SOth difference rose from .66 to .70. However, looking at the residuals from the first
regression reported in Table 5, the 50th-lOth difference was the same (37) in 1983 and
1991, and the 9Oth-50th difference fell from 31 to 30.

 where ln(w) is the log hourly wage, S a set of schooling dummy variables, E potential

 experience, D91 a dummy variable for 1991, and Z a matrix of other control variables

 described in the footnotes to Table 5. High school graduates are the omitted reference

 category, so 6 measures the real wage change for high school graduates from 1983 to 1991,

 and the coefficients in the vector B' measure real wage changes   of other schooling groups
 relative to high school graduates. We then add to the wage equation controls for training

 and ask whether the changes in the wage structure captured in 8' and y' are reduced once

we hold the distribution of training constant

       An obvious question is whether any positive association between wages and training

that we detect represents a causal effect of training, rather than heterogeneity bias arising

because higher-wage individuals receive more training. In our view, the literature on the

returns to training establishes that individuals (higher- as well as lower-skilled workers)

experience faster wage growth during periods of training than at other times (Brown, 1989;

Bishop, 1991b; Lynch, 1988; Holzer, 1990; Mincer, 1989).

      Table 5 reports our results)' The first column shows estimates of the wage

equation described above. The estimates reflect the by now well-established changes in

the wage structure. In particular, real wages of high school dropouts relative to high
school graduates declined by 63 percent from 1983 to 1991, and real wages of college

graduates relative to high school graduates rose by 10.2 percent. The return to experience

rose by about .002 per year of experience, resulting in experience-wage differentials that


    "Throughout the wage equation analysis, we ignore issues of selection into
employment and endogeneity of wainiig. These are potentially important issues, but we
do not believe that the CPS offers data on exogenous determinants of employment or

       Column (2) adds controls for the incidence of training to improve skills on the

present job. Because dummy variables are included for each type of training, information

on the number of types of training is also captured. All four types of training are

significantly associated with higher wages, with the largest estimates for other training and

formal company training (.119 and .188 respectively). 01 course, the effect of in-school

training may partly reflect the usual schooling effect, which may explain why the estimated

returns to some college and college graduation both fall somewhat relative to column (1).

Most importantly, though, the changes in the wage structure from 1983 to 1991 are

moderated only slightly, if at all. The real wage decline of high school dropouts is now 6

percent, and the estimated growth of the experience premium is essentially unchanged.
The estimated rise in the college graduate-high school graduate differential falls from .102

to .089, a drop of 12 percent.

       A similar analysis is provided in column (3), but adding dummy variables for
training to qualify for the current job. Again, the estimated coefficients of the training

dummy variables are positive and significant, with the exception of other training. Also,

presumably because in-school training to qualify for the job overlaps strongly with college

education, the estimated coefficient of the college graduate dummy variable falls to .243.

The inclusion of these additional training variables has no further effect on the estimated

schooling-wage or experience-wage differentials. If anything, the estimated increase in the

college graduate-high school graduate wage differential rise slightly (to £92).

       Next, we extend the analysis in two ways. First, we allow for the po6sibility that

the returns to tr2ining increased over the sample period. This seems likely to have

happenedi4asarguedbyJuhn,etaL(1993)theoverallpriceofskillhasrisen. lIthe

                                             13
 returns to training have increased, then the effect of increases in training for more-

 educated or more-experienced workers may be understated in the estimates in columns (2)

 and (3) of Table 5. Column (4) reports estimates from a specification adding interactions

 of all of the training variables with the dummy variable for 1991. It turns out that there is

 no evidence of increases in the returns to any type of training. In fact, as the table

 reports, the only significant (at the ten-percent level) changes in the estimated coeffidents

 of the training variables are declines from 1983 to 1991. More to the point, this

 augmentation of the specification has some offsetting influences on the estimated changes

 in schooling-wage or experience-wage differentials. The estimated increase in the hIgh

school graduate-high school dropout differential, and in the experience-wage differential,

rise slightly, while the estimated change in the college graduate-high school graduate
differential falls to 8.3 percent.

       Second, we allow for the possibility that the returns to training vary for workers

with different amounts of schooling. If they do, then again, the estimates in columns (2)
and (3) may not fully reflect the influence of training on the wage structure. Column (5)

reports estimates from a specification adding interactions of all of the schooling variables

with all of the training variables. The estimated coefficients of these interactionsare

perhaps of some interest. The subset of these that are statistically significant (at the ten-

percent level) are reported in the table, and tend to reveal lower returns to informal and

formal training for college graduates and those with some college, and higher returns to

formal training for high school dropouts. With respect to the principal question at hand,

adding these interactions to some extent lessens our ability to explain the changes in the

wage structure, since the relative increases in training for more-educated workers now

contribute less to their wage growtt In particular, the estimated increase in the college
                                             14
graduate-high school graduate wage differential rises to 9.8 percent, scarcely below the

original 10.2 percent increase in column (I).

       Finally, we explore the consequences of also including information on the length of
formal company training programs, using the data described in reference to Table 4.

Because of missing data on length of training, a slightly smaller sample is available for this

specification, so we first (in column (6)) report estimates of the same specification as in

column (1) for this subsample. In column (7), we add the length of training variables.

The estimated coefficients of these variables are reasonable, indicating that the longest

training programs (26 or more weeks) are associated with wages that are higher by about

seven percent. Comparing columns (6) and (7) shows that the effects of adding the

training controls are similar to the previous specifications. The training variables account

for virtually none of the increase in the high school graduate-high school dropout wage

differential or the experience-wage differential, and they account for less than 10 percent

of the estimated increase in the college graduate-high school graduate wage differential.

Sensitivity Analysis
       Table 6 reports some sensitivity analyses of the results for changes in schooling-

wage differentials. First, columns (1)-(6) report results disaggregated by potential
experience. The changes in the wage structure by schooling level vaiy across the

experience groups. As discussed above, the rise in the college graduate-high school

graduate wage differential is sharpest for those with 0-10 years of experience. In fact, in

these data, the rise is not statistically significant for those with more than 20 years of

experience. On the other hand, only for those with more than 20 years of experience did

the high school graduate-high school dropout wage gap widen between 1983 and 1991.

Thus, it is only the college graduate-high school dropout wage differential that widened

                                                15
 consistently across the three experience groups." At the same time, as for the aggregated

 regressions reported in Table 5, the addition of the training variables does little to explain

 the changes in wage differentials associated with schooling.

        Column (7) reports results for the full sample when the training variables are

 added, except for in-school training, which may be difficult to distinguish from schooling.

The estimates should be compared with those in colwnn (3) of Table 5. Omitting in-

school training has very little effect on the estimates. For example, the estimated increase

in the college graduate-high school graduate wage differential is .090, compared with .092

when in-school training is included. Columns (8) and (9) add a quartic in tenure tothe

wage equation specifications estimated with and without accounting for training. Again,

the resultsare qualitatively very similar, in that the training variables account for little or

none of the changes in schooling-wage differentials.

       Finally, columns (10) and (11) report estimates of the basic specifications

substituting linear years of schooling completed for the set of dummy variables. Again,

only a small proportion of the increase in the return to schooling is explained by adding

the training variables. The increase in the return to a year of schooling from 1983 to 1991

falls from .022 omitting the training variables, to .019 including them, so that the inclusion

of the training variables 'explains" 14 percent of the increase in the return to
                                                                                   schooling.
The Role of Computers

       As discussed above, part of the motivation for looking at the role of training in


    15This is notat odds with other findings reported in the literature. For example,
Blackburn, et al. (1990, p. 37) report that the college graduate-high school graduate wage
gap widened by 13 percent for workers aged 25-64 from 1980 to 1988, but only by eight
percent for workers aged 25-34. On the other hand, the college graduate-high school
dropout wage gap widened by 16 percent for workers aged 25-64, but by 20 percent for
workers aged 25-34.

                                              16
generating the increase in wage inequality was the finding that computer use at work

partly accounts for thisincrease (Krueger, 1993), along with the presumption that

computer use at work is closely linked to training. The 1991 January supplement includes

two questions relating to computers that are useful in exploring the relationship between

training, computers, and wages. First, individuals indicate whether their tr2ining to

improve skills on the current job included computer skills. Second, individuals are asked

whether they use PCs or computer terminals at work (to which they can respond never,

less than once a week, one or more times per week, or every day).

       Table 7 provides some evidence documenting the linkages between training,

computer training, and computer use. The first row reports the proportion of those

reporting each type of training to improve skills on the current job who also report that

the training taught computer skills. The numbers reveal that, depending on the type of

training, between 25 and 43 percent of workers who report training learned computer

skills. The next four rows report on the relationship between computer use at work and

training to improve skills. The numbers show that, on the one hand, about one-quarter to

one-third of those who received training never use a computer at work. On the other

hand, in each training category over one-half of those who received training use a

computer every day. This shows that training is frequently associated with intensive

computer use. In addition, workers who do not receive training are less likely to use

computers at work, as the last column reveals. Compared to workers who received

training, workers who did not receive training are twice as likely to report never using a

computer at work (62 percent vs. 31 percent), and just over One-half as likely to report


   t6For comparability with the regression estimates that follow, these tabulations are
reported for men and women.

                                             17
 using a computer every day (29 percent vs. 54 percent). Finally, as these results suggest,

 computer use at work is related to computer training. This is shown in the last row of the

 table, which reports the proportion reporting computer-related training, classified by

 computer use at work. Virtually no workers (two percent) of those reporting computer-

related training report that they never use a computer at work, whereas 29 percent of

those who use a computer every day report computer-related training.

       The figures in Table 7 relating training to computer use at work suggest that our

findings regarding the role of training in generating changes in the wage structure ought to

dosely parallel Krueger's (1993) findings regarding the role of computer use at work in

generating these changes. In fact, though, our finding that changes in training explain
relatively little of the increase in the return to schooling contrasts with Krueger's

conclusion that "the proliferation of computers can account for between one-third and one-

half of the increase in the rate or return to education observed between 1984 and 1989'

(1993, p. 55).

       There appeax to be two differences that underlie the results. First, the estimated

increase in the return to schooling—before accounting for training or computer use—is

much smaller in Krueger's paper than in ours. His initial estimate of the increase in the

return to schooling (Table VII, columns (1) and (4)) is .01, whereas ours (Table 6, column

(7)) is .022. In fact, his incorporation of computer use accounts for an increase of .004 in

the return to schooling (his Table VII, columns (2) and (5)), whereas our incorporation of

training accounts for an increase of .003 (Table 6). Thus, much of the difference comes

from the fact that Krueger explains a greater relative amount of the increase in the return
to schooling, because he starts out with a much smaller increase.

      Second, while Table 7 documents strong relationships between training, computer-

                                             18
related training specifically, and computer use at work, the table also shows that there are

sizable fractions of workers who use computers at work but do not report computer-

related training or any training." Therefore, some of the increased use of computers at

work may be independent of training, at least insofar as we can measure such training. In

addition, Table 7 demonstrates that there is a good deal of training unrelated to

computers, which may have different effects on wages than computer-related training.

Thus, general information on training may not capture the full effects on the wage

structure of the spread of computers because computer use at work that is independent of

training may raise wages, and because the returns to computer-related training may be
higher than returns to other training.

       Table 8 presents evidence on these questions. To provide results more comparable

to Krueger's, we estimate specifications much more similar to his. We include women in

the sample, and add a dummy variable for female and an interaction between this dummy

variable and marital status to the wage equations. We also report results using linear years

of schooling, as Krueger does.'8 The estimates in columns (1) and (2) show that the

estimated return to schooling increased from .070 to .095, for an increase of .025, slightly

larger than the increase in Table 6 for men only (.022). Accounting for changes in

training, in columns (3) and (4), explains .005 of this increase, implying that training

"explains" 20 percent of the increase in the return to schooling, similar to the estimate for



    "For example, the last number in the last row of the table implies that 71 percent of
those using computers every day did not report computer-related training.
    "The only difference in the specifications is that we omit controls for union
membership (which is unavailable in the January 1983 CI'S), veteran, and part-time status.
Also, as dictated by the CPS supplements, his regressions cover 1984 and 1989, whereas
ours cover 1983 and 1991.

men in colwnns(10) and (11) of Table 6. In theseestimates, too, the increase in the

return to schooling accounted for by changes in training (.005) is similar to Krueger's

estimate of the increase accounted for by the proliferation of computers (.004). Again,

though, the overall increase in the return to schooling is larger in our data)'

       Columns (5)-(7) explore the effects of computer-related training and computer use

at work on wages, for 1991. Column (5) adds a dummy variable indicating whether the

reported training was computer-related. The estimated coefficient of the computer-related

training dummy is positive (.019) but insignificant, thus failing to provide evidence that
computer-related training has higher returns than other training. On the other hand, the

estimates in column (6) show that computer use at work, even controlling for training, is

associated with significantly higher wages, with effects of a similar magnitude to those

reported by Krueger.D Finally, in column (7) we add interactions between the computer

use and computer training variables, to check whether the returns to computer-related

training are higher for those who use computers at work (or, alternatively, whether the

returns to computer use at work are higher for those who receive computer-related



     "To better assess the change in the return to schooling over these periods, we
estimated the specifications in columns (1) and (2) of Table 8 for 1983, 1984, 1989, and
1991 using the outgoing rotation group annual files of the CI'S. Because we are interested
in the 1984-1989 and the 1983-1991 changes in the estimated return to schooling, we
handled the top-coded weekly earnings figures by inflating the $999 top-code in 1984
(1983) to the same real value in 1989 (1991). again using the PCE implicit price deflator.
We used the same exclusion restrictions as for the sample drawn from the January
supplements. In these estimates, the return to schooling rose by .009 (.075 to .084) from
1984 to 1989, and by .016 (1)72 to .088) from 1983 to 1991. Thus, the return appears to
have grown more over the longer period, although not by as much as indicated in our
January CPS data.

    20Fhe negative estimated coefficient for the computer-related training variable in this
specification may not be entirely surprising, since it measures the wage differential for
those who received such training, but do not use computers at work.
                                             20
training). In fact, two of the estimated coefficients of these interactions are negative,

although insignificant, and the results suggest that, if anything, those who use computers at

work and received computer-related training earn lower wages. This may reflect greater

firm specificity of computer skills that were obtained via training on the current job. At

any rate, the results continue to suggest that there are significant wage differentials

associated with computer use at work, independent of training.

       Thus, the proliferating use of computers is likely to have contributed to the growth

in between-group wage inequality independently of the impact of changes in training. In
addition, the results suggest that computer-related training on the job is unlikely to confer

on workers all of the gains associated with computer use at work. Rather, the wage

differentials associated with computer use at work reflect, at least in part, other factors,

such as computer skills learned in school or on previous jobs, or worker heterogeneity.

IV. Conclusion

       Shifts in the incidence of various types of training over the 1980s favored more-

educated, more-experienced workers. Coupled with the fact that this training is associated

with higher wages, these shifts suggest that training may have contributed to the growth of

wage inequality in this period. However, the shifts were apparently too small, or the

returns to training too low, for training to have played a substantial role in this increase.

The estimated changes in wage differentials associated with schooling and experience are

generally only slightly smaller once we account for changes in the distribution of training

across schooling and experience groups, as well as for changes in the returns to training

and changes in the length of training programs.

      None of this is intended to say that training does not boost wages. There may be

long-term reasons for the lower incidence of training among less-educated, lower-wage

                                             21
workers, which may or may not be amenable to policy intervention. However, in policy

debates regarding approaches to increasing the absolute or relative pay of tess-educated

and younger workers, it is important to understand that the real wage stagnation or

declines that such workers have faced in the past decade apparently did not stem from a

sharp drop-off in either self-financed or employer-financed training.
