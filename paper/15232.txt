The Impact of Job Stress on Smoking and Quitting: Evidence from the HRS

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper examines the impact of job-related stress on smoking behavior. We use data from the Health
and Retirement Study to examine how high job stress affects the probability that smokers quit and
the number of cigarettes smoked for current smokers. We include individual fixed effects, which control
for time-invariant factors. Occupational fixed effects are also included to control for occupational
characteristics other than stress; time dummies control for the secular decline in smoking rates. Using
a sample of people who smoked in the previous wave, we find that job stress is positively related to
continuing to smoke and to the number of cigarettes smoked for current smokers. The FE results are
of greater magnitude and significance than the OLS results suggesting an important omitted variable
bias in OLS estimates. It may be that individuals who are able to handle stress or have better self-control
are more likely to have high stress jobs and less likely to smoke. We also find that the smoking/stress
relationship is neither explained by heterogeneity across individuals in cognitive ability, risk taking
preferences or planning horizons nor is it explained by time varying measures that we observe.

Introduction

       Smoking is well-known to be a leading source of preventable morbidity and mortality. In
response to the increasing evidence about the smoking-related health risks, to oneself and to
others through second-hand smoke, many older individuals who smoked when they were young
have quit. Yet about 20% of the population, including the older population that we examine,
continues to smoke. Almost no one starts smoking after age 22. However, former smokers may
relapse and start to smoke again while current smokers may change the number of cigarettes that
they smoke or may try to quit. Some individuals will cycle in and out of smoking.


       Older individuals are at higher risks than other ages for smoking-related health
conditions, so they may be even more aware of the realities of adverse health outcomes as they,
and other smokers that they know, suffer harmful consequences. For example, Khwaja, Sloan
and Chung (2006) find that older smokers change their survival expectations and quit smoking in
response to health shocks. However, older individuals may find it more difficult to quit smoking
if they have been smoking for a long period of time. Importantly, they may continue to smoke to
self-medicate to deal with their stress. Yet, even at older ages, there are health gains to quitting.
For example, Taylor et al. (2002) find that male smokers who quit at age 65 gained 1.4 to 2 years
of life while female smokers gained 2.7 to 3.7 years. Therefore, it is important to understand the
factors that might prevent older individuals from quitting. Further, older smokers are an
important group to study because of the financial externalities that they impose on public
insurance programs such as Medicare.


       Stress presents physiological and psychological challenges to the body and mind; it can
be a result of real or perceived challenge to homeostasis (ability to maintain internal stability)
(Selye, 1956; McEwen, 2000; Seeman et al, 1997). That stress is a challenge to homeostasis, has
been documented in animal (Brandon, 1994; Wills & Shiffman, 1985) and clinical studies
(Sinha, 2001). In response to stress, individuals try to maintain homeostasis through a number of
mechanisms, one potential mechanism is to self-medicate by smoking (Koob and Moal, 1997).
There is evidence that stress can cause smoking, yet some of this evidence comes from small
animal and clinical studies that induce stress in experimental settings (Goeders and Guerin, 1994;



                                                                                                   2
Sinha, 2001). While these studies can assess causality more directly, the results do not translate
well into conclusions about populations of smokers. On the other hand, most studies of large
populations are epidemiologic studies that examine only correlations. Further, they often use
relatively small non-generalizable samples (e.g. Alexander et al., 1990; Cooper et al., 1989). A
large number of the studies examine children only and examine the impact of life events on
smoking initiation (e.g. Mates and Allison, 1992; Koval and Pederson, 1999; Koval et al., 2000).


       While there is more literature, and perhaps greater concern about youth smoking, stress
and smoking have been examined for adults as well. For example, relapse to smoking and
inability to stop smoking, have also been associated with stressful life events for adults (Wewers,
1988; Hymowitz et al., 1991; Mates & Allison, 1992; McKee et al., 2003; Colby et al., 1994;
Khwaja et al., 2006). Life events include, for example, divorce, death of a relative, financial
problem, illness or injury or a move to a new residence. Most of these studies use retrospective
data on stressful life events (Bonaguro and Bonaguro, 1987; McKee et al., 2003 e.g., Koval and
Pederson, 1999; Koval et al., 2000; Bonaguro and Bonaguro, 1987, McKee et al., 2003).


       Other studies have examined specific, stressful occupations such as nursing (Alexander et
al., 1990) and medicine (Cooper et al., 1989). Studies with larger more generalizable populations
tend to find that job stress and job control (together considered to be job strain) harm health and
that one of the mechanisms may be poor habits such as smoking. For example, Hellerstedt and
Jeffery (1997), using a sample of 3,843 workers in Minnesota, find that job demands increase
smoking intensity for men as well as for women. However, Amick et al., (2002) use the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics, a large and national representative survey, and find no significant
effect of high-strain work (high psychosocial job demands and low job control) on all-cause
mortality. Taken together, these studies suggest that job stress could be causally related to
smoking.


       There are at least two ways by which job-stress may be causally related to smoking. One,
metioned above, is that stress presents physiological and psychological challenges to the body
and that individuals respond by self-medicating through smoking to maintain homeostasis.
Another mechanism is that stress can reduce self-control. While behavioral economists view



                                                                                                 3
‘self-control’ through the lens of discount rates, specifically hyperbolic functions (e.g., Gruber
and Koszegi, 2001; Laibson, 1997, 2001), psychologists view self-control as a personality trait
(e.g. time invariant) akin to will power (Sinha, 2001). Muraven and Baumeister (2000) find
evidence that self control is a limited resource so that coping with stress (e.g, inhibiting negative
emotions at work) reduces the amount of self control available for subsequent tasks (e.g
controlling the urge to smoke).1 Most smokers indicate that they would like to quit smoking,2 but
they lack the willpower to do so. Surprisingly, smokers tend to support higher tobacco taxes
presumably as a method to help them quit as they lack self-control (Gruber and Mullainathan,
2002; Hersh, 2005; Kan, 2007).


         This paper examines the effect of job-related stress on the smoking behavior of older
workers. We use a self-reported measure of stress which is thought to capture the net impact of
perception of, response to, and objective level of job related chronic or acute stress. We examine
the extent to which job stress increases the likelihood that older working smokers relapse,
continue to smoke and smoke more intensely. Using the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS),
we examine workers and use separate samples of former and current smokers reflecting the
different decisions that they face. The HRS offers several advantages, including a fairly large
sample of older workers with data on smoking and job stress. The HRS also contains information
on usually unobserved factors such as risk-taking preference, planning horizon and cognitive
ability, that could potentially affect stress and smoking decisions. In addition, the HRS is a panel
survey which allows us to account for unobserved individual specific factors in our estimation.
We are also able to study quitting and relapse of older individuals over time.


Data
         We use data from the 1992 to 2004 Health and Retirement Study (HRS).3 The HRS is a
nationally representative longitudinal survey of individuals over 50 years and their spouses. The

  Data from the 2006 HRS is also available. However, the occupation category codes used in 2006 were different
from those in the previous years so that the original occupation codes were available only for persons who did not
change jobs between waves. To maintain consistency and avoid any potential bias we did not use the 2006 data.


                                                                                                                      4
HRS initially sampled persons in birth cohorts 1931 through 1941 and conducted follow up
interviews biennially. We combined the original HRS data with the RAND HRS (version H)
data. The RAND HRS data is a subset of the HRS data containing cleaned versions of several
variables. It was created by the RAND Center for the Study of Aging with the goal of making the
data more accessible to researchers.

       We restrict our sample to 10,775 individuals who were 50 to 64 years of age in 1992. In
addition, we restrict our analyses to the 6,910 ever-smokers; almost no one starts to smoke after
their early twenties. In our sample, only 0.28% (n=57) of those who reported never smoking in
any wave initiate smoking in subsequent waves of the survey. Since our analysis focuses on the
effects of job-related stress, we exclude observations for which the person reported not working
at the time of the interview. We also exclude observations for which there are missing values on
occupation codes, job stress or any of the demographic variables included in the analysis. This
reduced our sample to 4,542 individuals. To exploit the panel nature of the HRS, we restrict the
sample to individuals for whom at least two waves of data were available. Our final sample
consists of 3,825 individuals and 17,043 person-year observations. In Table 1 we compare
summary statistics in 1992 for the original HRS sample of 10,775 individuals and our final
analysis sample of 3,825 individuals. Individuals in the analysis sample are more likely to be
male and have slightly higher income levels than those in the HRS sample, but are very similar
in terms of the other characteristics. This is to be expected since the analysis sample consists of
only workers who are more likely to be male and would have higher income levels. As expected,
the analysis sample has a much higher proportion of current and former smokers since never
smokers are excluded from it.


        We separately analyze the effect of stress for three groups—the full sample of ever
smokers, a subsample of ‘lagged smokers’, and a subsample of ‘lagged quitters’. Ever smokers
have reported smoking sometime in the waves or otherwise self-report to smoking sometime in
their life. Lagged smokers are defined to be persons who reported smoking at the previous
interview wave and lagged quitters are defined as persons who reported having quit smoking by
the previous interview wave. We delineate these groups because, due to the highly addictive
nature of cigarettes, we expect that those who smoked last period and those who did not, will



                                                                                                 5
react differently to a change in stress. Individuals who have quit smoking may no longer be
addicted to tobacco, and may not be as responsive to stress as those who are currently addicted to
tobacco. Summary statistics for the subsamples of lagged smokers, ever smokers, lagged quitters
and for the full sample of ever-smokers are shown in Table 2. The lagged smokers sample
consists of 1,039 persons and the lagged quitters sample consists of 2,004 persons.


           Owing to the fact that we focus on job stress, we restrict our sample to those who worked
in the first wave. However, about 20% of this initial sample retires over subsequent waves of the
survey, while approximately 3% stops working. Current job stress is missing for these
individuals. To examine the potential impact of attrition bias, we also analyze a larger sample
that includes data from subsequent survey waves and adds controls for retirement and not-
working status. Job stress and occupational codes are set to zero for persons who had retired or
were not working.4


Dependent Variables


           Our two dependent variables are: 1) a binary indicator for whether or not a person
smokes at the time of the interview and 2) the number of cigarettes that a smoker usually smokes
in a day. Data on smoking or not comes from a survey question: “Do you smoke cigarettes
now?”. For those who report to be current smokers, they were asked the quantity of cigarettes
smoked. This could be reported in number of cigarettes, packs or cartons. For individuals who
reported the number of packs that they smoke in a day, we calculated the number of cigarettes by
assuming that each pack contains 20 cigarettes. For individuals who reported the number of
cartons smoked in a day, we assumed that each carton contains 10 packs or 200 cigarettes.

Independent Variables

           Job Stress. The main independent variable for our study is a measure of job-related stress.
In each wave of the HRS, respondents were asked how much they agree or disagree with the
statement “My job involves a lot of stress”. The answers were coded on a four-point scale, with 1
representing “strongly agree” and 4 representing “strongly disagree”. We created a binary

4
    We do not account for attrition bias due to mortality (4%), survey non-response (8%) or missing values (2%).


                                                                                                                   6
variable that took the value one if the individual reported that they strongly agree and zero
otherwise.5


          Most of the extant literature focuses on more objective measures of stress such as life
events. However, psychologists often view stress as a process separating it into steps involving:
perception, appraise, response and adaptation to harmful, threatening or challenging events
(Lazarus and Folkman, 1984; Sinha, 2001). Thus individuals might perceive or interprete the
same objective stressor (e.g. divorce) differently or could respond or adapt to it differently. One
concern with using a self-reported measure is that it may be picking up objective stress, a point
in the process (perception, appraisal, response, and adapt) or a combination of both. To the
extent to which people respond to their own personalized view of the level of stress, self-reported
stress is relevant variable for analyzing smoking decisions.


          Table 3 reports means for stress levels and other factors by occupation. Occupations are
listed in order of average level of stress in each occupation. Individuals in professional and
technical support report the highest levels of stress, followed by managerial staff. Persons in
farming, forestry or fishing report the lowest stress. This ranking of stress is almost the same as
the ranking of occupation by educational attainment; the exception is that sales has a higher level
of education than administration, but a slightly lower reported average stress. The most stressful
occupations display the lowest smoking rates (farmers are slightly out of order with a lower
smoking rate).6 These raw averages reveal a negative relationship between stress and smoking
status.


          To be able to exploit the panel nature of the HRS in our estimation, there must be
sufficient within person variation in stress and smoking status. Of the 1,039 lagged smokers,
about 29% change their report of job stress atleast once over the course of the study. The
corresponding percentages for ever smokers and lagged quitters are 33% and 28% respectively.
The variation in smoking status is slightly higher in the case of lagged smokers, with about 34%

  In some preliminary specifications, we included indicators for ‘strongly agree’, ‘agree’ and ‘disagree’ with
‘strongly disagree’ being the omitted group. Since the results were very similar to those with the single binary
variable we do not present them.
6
  The category of farmer is composed of different socio-economic types, ranging from farm owners to labors, which
might explain the inconsistency.


                                                                                                                7
changing their status. However, a lower percentage of ever smokers (19%) and only 6% of
lagged quitters change their smoking status over the study time period. In Table 4, we examine
the transition probabilities for smoking status and job stress. About 9% of lagged smokers
transition from high job stress to low job stress from one period to the next, while 8% transition
from low stress to high stress. Of those who transitioned from high to low job stress, about 23%
changed jobs whereas about 15% of those who transitioned from low to high job stress changed
jobs. The transition probabilities and percentage of job changers for ever smokers and lagged
quitters are similar. In this older sample, more individuals are likely to quit smoking than relapse
into it. About 13% of smokers quit smoking by the next time period whereas only 3% of former
smokers start smoking again.

        Demographics. We control for age, race, gender, marital status, household income and
years of education. Household income is expressed in 10,000 1992 US dollars. For marital status,
we create binary indicators for married, partnered and ‘no spouse’. The ‘no spouse’ category
combined persons who were separated, divorced, widowed or whose spouse was absent. The
reference group is never married.


        Occupation Categories. Occupational dummies help to control for occupation-related
factors other than job stress that vary systematically and that could affect smoking. Examples
would include workplace smoking bans, other working conditions, and workplace latitude. In
addition, smoking rates, and thus smoking cues, may vary by occupation, affecting quitting and
relapse.7 We classify individuals into eight occupation categories which were created from the 17
original categories reported in the HRS. The categories included: 1) managerial; 2) clerical and
administrative support; 3) sales; 4) mechanical, construction and precision production; 5) service
including private household, protective, food preparation, health and personal service; 6)
operators, fabricators and laborers; and 7) farming, forestry and fishing. The reference category
is professional and technical support and armed forces. We combine these two groups since there
were only eight persons (15 person-years) in the armed forces. To test the robustness of our
7
  To some extent, occupation fixed effects may also adjust for the peer effects of workers smoking. While the
smoking of worker-peers may be caused to some extent by common job stress, previous studies have found that
being surrounded by others who smoke increases the likelihood of own smoking. For example, Fletcher (2009) finds
that increasing the proportion of classmates who smoke by 10% increases the likelihood of individual smoking by 3
percentage points for a nationally representative sample of adolescents. Cutler and Glaeser (2007) find that
individuals whose spouses smoke are 40% more likely to smoke.


                                                                                                               8
results we re-estimate the regression excluding these individuals. As expected, the results are
almost identical to those with the full sample. We also re-estimate the regressions using the 17
original categories and combining professional and technical support and armed forces to form
the reference group. The results are qualitatively similar and so are not presented here.8

           Risk Attitudes. To measure risk preferences, the HRS asked respondents to choose among
four different gambles. The first gamble was presented as follows:
“Suppose you are the only income earner in the family, and you have a good job. You are given
the opportunity to take a new and equally good job, with a 50-50 chance that it will double your
income and a 50-50 chance that it will reduce your income by a third. Would you take the new
job?” If the answer was “no,” the respondent was presented with the second gamble: “Suppose
the chances were a 50-50 chance that it would double your income and a 50-50 chance that it
would cut your income by 20 percent. Would you still take the new job?” If the answer to the
first question was “yes”, the interviewer asked: “Suppose the chances were a 50-50 chance that it
would double your income and a 50-50 chance that it would cut your income by half. Would you
still take the new job?”


           Based on their choices, we classify respondents into four risk-aversion categories. The
most risk-averse group consisted of persons who chose to stay with their current job. The next
more risk-averse group consists of persons who chose the job with 50-50 chances of doubling
their income or reducing by a fifth. The omitted group was the least risk-averse consisting of
persons who chose to take a job with 50-50 chances of doubling their income or reducing it by
half.

           These questions were not asked in the 1994 and 1996 waves of the HRS and were also
not asked if the interview was by proxy. From 1998 onwards, only some respondents were
selected to answer these questions based on their cohort, age and/or random selection.9 Primarily
because these questions are not asked in all waves, we create a dummy variable indicating
missing. For robustness, we also use a carry-forward approach and replaced the missing
information with data from the previous wave or with the mean if more than one wave of data

was available. The results are nearly identical across the two approaches. In the reported results
we use the missing dummy variable approach.


       Financial Planning Horizon. To measure planning behavior, the HRS asked respondents:
“In deciding how much of their (family) income to spend or save, people are likely to think about
different financial planning periods. In planning your (family’s) savings and spending, which of
the   time   periods   listed   in   the   booklet   is   most   important   to   you   [and   your
(husband/wife/partner)]?” We create separate binary variables for each of the answers: “next few
months”, “next year”, “next few years”, “next 5-10 years” and “longer than 10 years”. The
shortest horizon “next few months” served as the reference group. These questions were also not
asked in the 1994 and 1996 waves or if the interview was by proxy. In 1998 and 2000
respondents were selected to answer this question based on a combination of their cohort and
random selection. In 2002, individuals who were 65 years and older were not asked this question.
The missing values are treated in the same manner as above in the discussion of risk-aversion. .


       Cognition. The HRS included a set of questions measuring the cognitive status of
respondents. We constructed a cognitive score that was the sum of three separate measures:
immediate word recall, delayed word recall and series seven. The total score varied from 0 to 25
with a higher score representing a higher cognitive ability. The immediate word recall measure
counted the number of words that the individual could recall immediately after a list of 10 words
was read to them by the interviewer. The delayed word recall measure counted the number of
words from the same list that the individual could recall after five minutes. For the series seven
measure individuals were asked to serially subtract seven starting from 100. The measure was
the number of correct answers. The series seven question was not asked in 1992 and 1994 and
none of these questions were asked to proxy respondents. We constructed the cognition score for
1996 through 2004 and treated the missing observations similar to risk aversion and financial
planning horizon.

       Labor Force Status. To check for the presence of attrition bias, we analyze the labor
force status of our sample over the survey waves. We create a dummy variable for whether or not
a person was retired. We also create a variable (not working) that took the value of one if the



                                                                                                10
person reported being unemployed, not working due to disability or not in the labor force, and
zero otherwise. We also create a binary variable for part-time work status of the individual.


Methods
         We employ several empirical methods to analyze the effect of job related stress on
smoking decisions. As a first step, we use ordinary least squares (OLS) to study the association
between stress and smoking. The OLS regression also control for demographics, occupation
fixed effects and year fixed effects. The latter is important due to the secular decline in smoking
as well as the decline with age. Since persons might select their occupation (and hence job stress)
based on unobservable characteristics that also affect smoking, the OLS estimates cannot be
interpreted as causal.

affect the smoking decision; OCit is an occupation fixed effect; Tt represents year fixed effects;
and ε it represents an idiosyncratic error term.

         Equation (1) estimates the effect of stress on smoking conditional on observable
characteristics and unobserved occupation and time effects. However, there might be other
unobserved individual specific factors such as preferences that affect both smoking decisions and
job stress. To account for the presence of such factors, we estimate the following equation:


         S it = α + βStressit + γX it + OCit + Tt + η i + ε it                       (2)


Where η i represents an unobserved individual specific term that affects the decision to smoke.

Equation 2 allows η i to be correlated with Stressit , so that certain individuals might

systematically be more likely to be in jobs with (say) a high stress level and be more likely to
smoke.




                                                                                                 11
        While the individual fixed effects model accounts for the endogeneity of job stress due to
time-invariant person-specific factors, β might not represent the causal effect of stress on
smoking because of two additional sources of potential endogeneity. The first is the presence of
time-varying unobservables that are correlated with both stress and smoking. Examples of such
factors would be marital problems, death of a close relative, or a change in mental or physical
health. In our empirical analysis, we conduct robustness checks to see if our estimate of β is
sensitive to the inclusion of certain time-varying factors that are observable to us. However, the
estimation method does not rule out other unobserved variables. The second source of potential
endogeneity is reverse causation. Smoking may alleviate stress (Aronson et al., 2008; Kassel,
Stroud and Paronis, 2003) or smokers who are unable to quit may report higher stress to justify
their decision to continue smoking.


Results


        Table 5 reports the OLS and fixed effects regression results for lagged smokers. High job
stress is positively and significantly associated with being a smoker. Accounting for the time-
invariant, person-specific characteristics through individual FE increases the magnitude and
significance of the coefficient indicating that the OLS estimates are biased downwards. One
explanation is that individuals who are less likely to smoke might also be more likely to select a
high stress job. There are several potential person-specific time-invariant omitted variables that
could explain the negative bias of OLS. Unmeasured differences in family background, quality
of education, cognitive function, level of self-control, ability to handle stress, long planning
horizon, discount rate, mental health problems10 or anxious personality could all result in this
bias. Higher levels in all but the last three in this list would likely lead to a willingness to accept
the greater stress associated with a challenging occupation and would also tend to result in lower
smoking rates. From these results, we have to be agnostic as to which factor or set of factors
account for the bias in the OLS results. We can only determine the direction of the bias.
However, below we test whether specific factors that we can measure could account for the bias.

   There are high rates of smoking in schizophrenia and mental health problems in general. There is evidence that
those with schizophrenia smoke to alleviate attention deficits. Smoking may help to address cognitive deficits in
those with schizophrenia or other mental health problems. See for instance Sacco et al. 2005.


                                                                                                              12
        Job stress also has a larger coefficient in FE regressions as compared to OLS in estimates
of the number of cigarettes smoked. However, the difference in magnitude and significance is
slight. It is reasonable that most of the bias due to the person-specific time-invariant omitted
variables occurs largely through the decision to smoke, not the number of cigarettes smoked
conditional on being a current smoker. For these older individuals, the decision to smoke is
really a decision to quit or not. Quitting would be the pivotal event. Cigarettes are very addictive
and long-term smokers have difficulties quitting even when they want to quit. Thus person-
specific time-invariant factors would likely be most influential in the decision to quit, and less so
regarding the number of cigarettes smoked.11

        Table 6 presents the estimated coefficient on stress from three sets of regressions; each
set is composed of results for OLS and FE. The first set of regressions examines the effect of
stress on smoking status for the full sample of ever-smokers. The second set examines the
number of cigarettes smoked by ever-smokers who currently smoke.12 The third set of
regressions analyzes the smoking status of lagged quitters (ever-smokers who did not smoke last
year). We only display the coefficient on stress in each regression as stress is the key variable of
interest; the coefficients on the control variables are qualitatively similar to those in Table 5.


        Job stress positively affects the smoking status and the intensity of smoking for ever-
smokers in OLS regressions. Accounting for the some of the endogeneity of stress by controlling
for time-invariant personal characteristics (FE regressions), reduces the magnitude of the
estimated coefficient for this group. These results suggest that the source of the endogeneity bias
for the ever-smokers is different from that for the lagged smokers. This could occur for several
reasons. Recall that the current smokers in this set do not overlap completely with the smokers in
lagged smokers (see footnote 8). The sample of ever smokers also includes former smokers. As
can be seen in Table 2, 68% of the ever-smokers have already quit. This sample would have been


11
   Self-control levels likely vary systematically across individuals but also there will be perturbations to the
systematic level. So some variation will be picked up in individual FE.
12
   Note that the set of current smokers from the sample of ever-smokers overlaps with but is not identical to current
smokers from the set of lagged smokers. This is because lagged smokers have to be the data set for at least two
waves (data from the previous wave is needed to establish lagged smoking status), while ever-smokers do not as the
information on ever-smoking comes from retrospective questions.


                                                                                                                 13
between 22 and 36 years of age when the first surgeon general’s report on smoking as an
important health hazard came out in 1964. Many of these smokers probably started smoking
when they were teenagers, which would have been prior to the barrage of information on the
health hazards of smoking. When they became aware of the harms of smoking they might have
responded by quitting. Those who quit in response are likely to be systematically different from
those who continued smoking into their 50s and 60s. This systematic difference could account
for the differential effect of omitted variables on stress and smoking.


        Also seen in Table 6 is that lagged quitters do not significantly change their smoking
behavior in response to stress. This may be in part due to the small percentage of this sample that
starts to smoke (only 2% as seen in Table 4). Lack of power may account for the lack of
significance. Overall, these results suggest that the group most vulnerable to job stress is lagged
smokers. These individuals are less likely to quit smoking if they are under stress and also smoke
more in response to stress.


        Next, we examine whether risk attitudes, planning horizon or cognition explain the
observed association between job stress and smoking. While there are other factors that we
believe may be important unobserved covariates, these are relevant factors that are available in
HRS. However, because these variables are only available for a subset of individuals, we do not
include them in our primary specification.13 These additional regressions are displayed in Table
7. The first column of Table 7 presents the baseline OLS regression and the following columns
display results that include each of these factors one by one in the regression specification. Since
there were several missing values for each of these variables and because we want to be able to
compare across regressions with the same sample, we include missing dummies when applicable.
The variables for risk aversion, planning horizon and cognition were set to zero if they were
missing. The coefficient on job stress does not change with the inclusion of these additional
variables suggesting that risk attitudes, time preferences or cognition scores are not the key
component of the omitted variable bias in the OLS estimates. In fact, only financial planning has



13
  Risk aversion was missing for 92% of the sample, financial planning horizon for 85% of the sample and cognition
for 34% of the sample.


                                                                                                              14
a significant impact on smoking status; as expected, a longer time horizon reduces the
probability of smoking.


          In Table 8 we examine the bias introduced by sample attrition related to labor force
status. We include dummy variables for whether or not a person was retired, otherwise not
working, or working part time with full time employment as the reference category. The results
show that for the sample of lagged smokers, individuals who retire or stop working are
significantly less likely to continue smoking. However, the number of cigarettes smoked does
not vary significantly among those who continue to smoke. Accounting for attrition due to
retirement or non-working status has little impact on the estimated coefficient on job stress,
suggesting that our results are robust to sample attrition. Attrition bias might still be a concern if,
for example, individuals who have retired are less able to cope with stress relative to those who
have not retired. Including a binary indicator for the part time nature of the job does not affect
smoking or the effect of stress on smoking.


          While the FE regressions control for time-invariant omitted variables, they do not
account for omitted variables that vary over time. In Table 9 we present the results from some
robustness checks. We examine the impact of time varying factors such as physical and mental
(depression) health, job tenure, work atmosphere and death of a parent. Including these variables
in the fixed effects regression does not change the effect of stress on smoking status for lagged
smokers. We also examine the impact of job stress for males and females separately. Males
appear to react more strongly to stress with an estimated coefficient of 0.0681 (significant at 5%
level) as compared to females who had an estimated coefficient of 0.0495 (significant at 10%
level).


Discussion
          Examining older workers, we find that job stress is positively related to smoking and to
the number of cigarettes smoked by current smokers. In our estimates for lagged smokers, we
find that compared to OLS regressions, individual FE regressions display coefficients on stress
that are larger in magnitude and significance. Because all time-invariant factors are essentially
controlled for in the individual FE regressions, the OLS bias seems to occur due to time-invariant



                                                                                                    15
personal characteristics that were omitted from the initial regressions. These factors must not
operate as importantly in regressions of the number of cigarettes conditional on smoking because
the OLS bias for these results is considerably smaller than it is for smoking status.


          While we hypothesize that the above and other potential factors could account for the
bias, we are constrained in what we can measure. In robustness checks, we find that the set of
planning horizon variables is a significant factor of the expected sign (long-term planning
reduces smoking), but inclusion of this set does not affect the coefficient on high stress. Our
measures of cognition and risk-aversion are not significant explanatory variables. We also find
that our results are robust to attrition due to retirement or not-working status and to the inclusion
of certain time varying factors such as mental and physical health, job tenure and death of a
parent.


          Our study advances the literature in several ways. First, we focus on older workers and
job stress. Older workers are those most at risk for smoking-related morbidity and mortality.
Quitting, even at later ages, improves health and functioning and can prevent some of the
adverse consequences. Second, we explicitly address the fact that older individuals are not going
to newly initiate smoking but will have different decisions to make based on whether they are
recent former smokers, recent quitters or current smokers. Third, we compare results from OLS
and individual fixed effects to assess the impact of omitted time-invariant factors. Fourth,
because the FE approach does not address potential time varying factors that could bias our
results, we examine various time varying measures of physical and mental health, external life
stress, and job tenure. We note, however, that our efforts do not preclude the existence of other
time-varying factors that are correlated with both job stress and the propensity to smoke. Fifth,
we use occupational fixed effects to control for occupational specific characteristics other than
stress. Sixth, we examine the potential impact of attrition bias; however, we are unable to
account for selection into the sample based on working status because we cannot identify factors
that would influence the decision to work, but not the decision to smoke. Lastly, while most of
the extant literature examines life-events to measure stress, we examine job stress.




                                                                                                  16
         The self-reported measure of stress that we use has strengths and weaknesses. To the
extent that people respond to their own personalized view of their level of stress and not only the
objective measure, self reported stress is a relevant variable for analyzing smoking decisions.
However, individuals might have different definitions of what constitutes “a lot of stress” and
could also vary in their response to a stressful event. The response to stress could be negative
such as anxiety, fatigue, depression, and other physiological and psychological reactions. The
alternative of using an external measure of stress would introduce new and different problems.
The respondent may not even perceive the objectively measured stress to be aversive, that is,
what is stressful for the average person, is not necessarily stressful for the specific respondent.
The measure that we use is more akin to the personalized recognition of an aversive situation; we
think that this is an appropriate measure for our purposes.


         Are smokers irrational or rational with regarding to tobacco? Smoking may be irrational
in the sense of low willpower, or hyperbolic discounting (Laibson 1997, 2001). There is
evidence that most smokers want to quit but cannot. Further, smokers tend to support higher
tobacco taxes presumably as a method to help them quit because they lack self-control (Gruber
and Mullainathan, 2002; Hersh, 2005). Smokers are addicted; they may not have the willpower
to quit even though they say that they want to quit; stress may exacerbate the problem. Studies in
behavioral economics are increasingly positing that public policies to address harmful
consumption in situations or systematically low willpower can be welfare enhancing (Thaler and
Sunstein, 2003; O’Donoghue and Rabin, 2003; Camerer, et al., 2003, Bernheim and Rangel,
2006).


         On the other hand, smoking may be ‘rational’ in terms of self medication of stress,
obtaining compensating wage differentionals for accepting stress or enjoyment of smoking.
However, there may be better alternatives to coping with stress than smoking. For example, it
may be ‘rational’ for schizophrenics to smoke to treat attention deficit problems (Sacco et al.,
2005). However, they might be better off medicating and handling their stress in other ways; the
nicotine patch, for example, provides nicotine without the smoke harming one's self and others.
Another approach could be to teach methods to bolster self-control, as psychologists are making
strides in teaching self-control (Muraven et al., 1999; Muraven and Baumeister, 2000; Mischel



                                                                                                17
and Mischel, 1983; Mischel et al., 1996). This could have positive spillovers to productivity as
well.


        The results of this paper suggest that high stress workers, cet. par., may be high at risk for
continued and increased use of tobacco. It might be productive and profitable for firms, for
example, to offer programs that help workers cope with stress as well as quit smoking and
prevent former smokers from relapsing. Firms could also ameliorate some of the job stress, cover
cessation services and products in insurance, and/or ban smoking at work. Smokers might be
able to find ways of coping with stress that do not compromise their health so greatly.
