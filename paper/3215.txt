                POVERTY PROGRAMS, INITIATION OF PRENATAL CARE AND THE
                            RATE OF LOW BIRTHWEIGHT BIRTHS


                                      ABSTRACT
         This paper specifies and estimates an econometric model of low and very
low birthweight rates for counties in the U.S. for the years 1975-1984.        We
focus on the impact of several specific public policy actions on use of
prenatal care and the subsequent effect on birthweight outcomes. Our results
point to strong racial differences in the impact of prenatal care on low
birthweight rates.     We also find that for the white population changes in
income eligibility standards and expanded availability of publicly financed
maternal and infant clinics have the strongest impacts on low birthweight
rates.
