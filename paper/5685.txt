        In this paper we explore the effects of labor demand shifts and population adjustments across

metropolitan    areas on the employment       and earnings of various demographic     groups during the

1980s. Results show that, although earnings and employment deteriorated for less-educated             and

black males in most areas in the 1980s, there was a good deal of geographic variation in the

magnitudes of these changes. Shifts in labor demand across local areas contributed to this variation,

and had greater relative impacts on the earnings and employment of these demographic groups. We

also find that population shifts across areas, presumably due to migration, at least partially offset the

effects of these demand shifts. But less-educated workers showed substantial y lower population

adjustments    in response    to these demand shifts.      These limited supply responses     apparently

contributed    importantly   to relatively greater deterioration   of employment   and earnings of these

groups in declining areas during the 1980s.

I. Introduction

        It is by now well known that the earnings and employment rates of less-educated workers

and blacks in the United States suffered during the 1980s in both relative and real terms. Some

consensus on the causes of these declines has begun to emerge in the research literature.

Specifically, the demand for less-educated labor has declined for a variety of reasons, while the

growth in supply of educated labor hm slowed (e.g., Bound and Johnson 1992; Katz and Murphy

1992). In addition, there appears to be major geographic variation in both the extent of these

demand shifts and the changes in labor market outcomes that they have caused for these different

groups. For instance, Topel (1994) and Karoly and Klerman (1994) have pointed to major

regional variation in employment and earnings outcomes for less-educated workers. Bound and

Freeman (1992) found that during the 1980s between blacks and whites grew most rapidly in the

North-Central     region where employment and earnings were declining more generally.

        There are a variety of reasons for the declining employment status of less-educated and

black workers in particular markets, especially those experiencing     declining employment overall.

Shifts in labor demand away from these groups might be greater in areas with declining overall

employment either because they are highly industrialized     areas and industry is declining, or

because these workers are highly concentrated in declining industries.      Alternatively, differences

in supply shifts might play an important   role. In particular, out-migration   from declining areas

and immigration to growing ones may be slower for minorities or less-educated groups, who

would then be more hurt by demand shifts away from particular areas, even if the shifts

themselves were skill-neutral (Topel 1986). Indeed, the tendency for earnings and employment

inequali~   across groups to worsen in areas where overall employment      levels are declining (e.g.,

Freeman 1982, 1991, Bartik 1991, 1992 is consistent with both the relative demand and the

relative supply adjustment explanations.
                                                            2

          On the demand side, areas in which manufacturing               accounts for a disproportionate        share

of employment (such as the Midwest) suffered large employment losses in that industry and

overall during the 1980s. The pro-cyclical nature of the construction industry implies that it too

will lose more than its proportionate         share of employment in declining labor markets. As these

are both industries in which less-skilled workers have traditionally been heavily represented and

relatively well-paid, their earnings and employment declined more than proportionately                       in areas

where overall labor demand was declining. Given the heavy concentration                     of blacks in central-

ity manufacturing jobs in the Midwest during the 1970s, this should have been (and apparently

was) particular y true for them. 1 In addition, the effects of any given demand shift might be

relatively more adverse for the more “marginal” groups (such as blacks, the young, or the least-

skilled workers) within any industry or area.2

         On the supply side, lower geographic mobility among older and/or less-educated workers

has been widely documented          (e.g., Schwartz 1973; Greenwood 1975; and Long 1988).

Migration rates have been lower among blacks than whites over the last three decades (Lansing

and Mueller 1967; U.S. Commerce              Department     198 1), although the opposite was true around

the period of the two World Wars and in the 1920s (primarily because of the exodus of blacks

from the rural South to the urban North). However, we have very little evidence to date on

differences across groups in population adjustments to demand shifts, or on the implications                      of




          ‘Particululy negative effects of declining manufacturing employment (especially in the central cities) on the
earnings andor employment of black males have been found by Kasarda (1989), Acs and Danziger (1992), Bluestone
Q      (1992), Bound and Freeman (1992), Bound and Holzer (1993), Holzer and Vroman (1992), and Johnson and
Oliver (1992). Juhn (1994) focuses on the effects of industrial structure on less-educated males more generally.



          2The effects of overall labor demand shifts on the relative demand for skilled and unskilled labor will also
depend on a variety of other factors such as the degree to which capital and skilled labor are complements, the relative
mobility of capital and labor, the extend to which technological change is embodied in capital, and the extent to which
technological change is skill-biased.

these differences for relative changes in employment and earnings. 3

         Supply adjustments through migration in response to local demand shifts have been

analyzed in some recent studies. Bartik (1991) and Blanchard and Katz (1992) have found

substantial mobility in response to demand shocks. Blanchard and Katz suggest that the impact of

these shocks (in terms of employment rates and wage levels) should be completely dissipated in

less than a decade because of population adjustments, while Bat-tik’s work suggests somewhat

greater persistence.4       But these studies all used aggregate measures of the overall population in

local areas when measuring adjustment processes, without differentiating                    by race or education.

         In this paper, we present evidence on these issues for the period of the 1980s. After

documenting      the demographic and geographic variation in labor market outcomes and local

demand and supply shifts during this period, we estimate the effects of demand shifts on wage

and employment changes for a variety of demographic groups (defined by education and

experience as well as race and gender). We also analyze differences across these groups in

population adjustments to these demand shifts, and how these supply adjustment differences

might have contributed to observed differences in relative wages.

         To analyze labor market and population outcomes at the local level for such detailed

demographic      groups, we use data from the Public Use Micro Samples (PUMS) of the Census of

Population in 1980 and 1990. We use the 5% samples for each of these years, which give us

vastly more individual observations with which to disaggregate outcomes by demographic group.

Furthermore, the PUMS data enable us to analyze demand/supply                      shifts as well as outcomes



          3mong the earlier studies, only Lansing and Mueller analyze differences across education and racial groups in
the responsiveness of migration rates to personal experiences of unemployment or income loss as well as local mea
unemployment. But they provide no general measures of responsiveness to labor demand shifts; and their results are quite
dated (as they are based on survey data from the early 1960s).

         4See Bartik ( 1993) for a discussion of possible explanations for the discrepancy between his estimates and those
of Blanchard and Katz.
                                                           4


across metropolitan      areas, rather than at the much broader state or regional levels that others have

examined using data from sources such as the Current Population Survey (CPS).5 On the other

hand, the analysis of cross-area changes over a single decade (rather than annual time-series

analysis of broader geographic units) prevents us from studying the dynamics of the adjustment

process that has been the focus of earlier work (e.g., Topel 1986; Bartik 1991; Blanchard and

Katz 1992).

         Our primary results are these: (1) While relative wage and employment declines for the

less-educated     occurred in most MSAS, these effects were much more severe in some areas (such

as the industrial centers of the Midwest) than others. (2) Local labor demand shifts contributed

to the deteriorating outcomes of these groups in declining areas. The effects of demand shifts on

wages and employment         were greatest among the young, the less educated, and black workers.

(3) Population adjustments did occur in response to labor demand shifts in the 1980s, with

workers moving out of declining areas into growing ones. But less-educated workers had

relatively low rates of migration in response to these demand changes; and there is some

evidence that this was also true for blacks, even within educational groups. The limited

adjustments in labor supply for these groups appear to have contributed importantly to the

relatively greater deterioration of their employment and earnings in declining areas during the

1980s.




II. Hypotheses,     Data, and Equations

A. Conceptual Framework

         To aid in the interpretation     of our empirical work we start by developing a simple model



         5We abstract here from intra metropolitan shifts in the location of employment   or population,   of the type that
as been emphasized in the literature on “spatial mismatch” (e.g., Holzer 1991).
                                                             5

of local labor markets.        Our notion is that for historical reasons different metropolitan                areas

specialize in the production of different goods (e.g., Detroit has been the center of the auto

industry, which they then “export”           to other areas (Krugman 1991).              Thus, the kind of demand

shocks that hit the U.S. during the 1980s (e.g., the decline in the auto industry)                   will have

differential effects on local areas. At the same time, demand shocks to a metro area’s export

industries will have spillover effects on other sectors of the local economy (e.g., the shutdown of

an auto plant will affect local service industries as well).              The combined effects of the initial

demand shock to the export sector and these spillover effects will then determine the overall

effects of these shocks on the relative demand for skilled and unskilled labor in the local area.

         Consider the economy in metro area k. Using constant returns to scale, technologies

firms produce both for export, Xk, and for local consumption,                   Ck,   using skilled (L.,) and

unskilled ( LU~) labor. In the short term, labor is supplied exogenously to a local area, but it is

mobile across industries.        The area also imports Mk.            Factor and product markets are

competitive.     While incorporating either sector-biased of factor-biased technological change into

our model would be straightforward            (Jones 1965), doing so would complicate the model

considerably without affecting its basic implications.              For this reason we assume fixed

technologies.

         Let yij,    represent the share of the i ~h demographic group’s workforce employed in the

j ~h sector ( ~jyi ~,=1 ), and Si j, represent the i ~h skill group’s share of the total wage bill in

the j’ ~h sector ( ~iSi jk=l ) . While not essential to the model, to help fix ideas we will also

assume that the export sector is intensive in unskilled labor (yUX >y~X ; S’ux > Suc ).6 It will be
                                                                  k    k      k     k

useful to have notation for the differences in factor intensities.              Define



         bThis will tend to be true for metro areas that “export” manufactured goods, but not necessarily those that export
services (e.g., Omaha and Hartford export insurance).

where 5 ikrepresents the aggregate percentage saving in the i ~h input at unchanged outputs

associated with a 1 percent rise in the relative wages of the i~hinput.                  The 5s are themselves

functions of the elasticities of substitution between the two labor inputs in the two sectors.                  The

terms in parentheses on the left of(1) and (2) represent shifts in the demand for the two labor

inputs. Subtracting (2) from (1) gives:



    ( dYkck-@kxk)
               - (i,k-             iuk) = (b~k+buk)       (W,k-wuk) .                       (3)




Shifts in the industrial composition       of a local area or shifts in the composition           of the workforce

affect the relative wages of skilled and unskilled workers in similar ways. Output prices are a

share- weighted linear combination of the shift in wages of skilled and unskilled labor inputs:


                      s~ckw,+Suc Wuk= pck                                                   (4)

                           k    k


       Together, equations (1)-(5) describe the production side of the model. To close the model

we need to specify the demand for output and inputs.               For simplicity, we assume that consumers

in the kthmetro area have Cobb-Douglas             utility functions and spend a constant share of their
                                                             7


income, u, on Ck (and the rest on Mk). The implication of this assumption is that:



                               (Ck-xk) = -   (pck-pxk)
                                                                         (6)



Equations (1)-(6) determine relative wages and prices and hence output and factor allocations.

In particular, shifts in the supply of skilled and unskilled labor have deterministic effects on

product and factor prices as well as on output:




                (Xk-ck)        ‘    *+(iU-i.)                            (7)

                                                                        (9)

         The demand for exports is a function of their price and a demand shifter :




                                     Xk=gk.ep                            (lo)
                                                  ‘k



where ~ represents the elasticity of demand for x~ and Ok the demand shifter. The effects of a

demand shock to exports (Ok) on local labor demand in this model can be either skill-biased or

skill-neutral.       On the one hand, negative (positive) demand shocks alone will shift demand away

from (toward) skilled labor in that area, and will therefore raise (lower) the relative wages of

skilled workers there. But local spillover effects on the demand for the non-traded good will tend

to neutralize the skill-bias of the original shock.
                                                     8


     Under the assumption of Cobb-Douglas         utility functions, demand shocks raise the price of

locally produced goods (both Ck and X~) and thus wages by b ~/ e, but leave relative wages and

the allocation of inputs across sectors alone (due to the constancy of consumers’ income shares

spent on Ck). The cost of living rises by a fraction, ~, of the rise in wages. Thus POSitiVe

demand shocks leave local area workers better off, while negative demand shocks have the

opposite effect. Under different assumptions about the nature of the local demand for goods,

demand shocks will affect the relative demand for skilled and unskilled labor, with the net effect

depending, among other things, on the degree of substitutability      between locally produced and

imported goods and services.

          Regardless of whether or not the net effect of the demand shift in the local area is skill-

biased, positive overall demand shocks to a local area will create incentives for labor to migrate

there from other areas, while negative shocks will create incentives for labor to migrate out. As

Topel has emphasized (1986), the magnitudes of such supply shifts will depend on expectations

of the future (shocks that are expected to persist will have larger effects) and on the costs of

moving.     To the extent that such costs and therefore migration rates vary across skill groups,

demand shocks that do not affect the relative demand for skilled and unskilled labor in an area

will still have effects on relative wages there through their effects on the relative local supplies of

different kinds of labor. Thus, negative demand shocks to an area will lead to growing inequality

across demographic groups if geographic mobility is higher among the more highly skilled

groups.

          The latter possibility is illustrated in Figure 1. Here we find a negative overall labor

demand shift (of magnitude AI) away from a particular local market that equally affects unskilled
                                                           9


and skilled workers (denoted by u ands respectively).’ WOand LOdenote starting wage and

employment levels for both groups (which have been set equal here for the sake of simplicity).

         But workers from both groups migrate away from this area. In this case, the magnitude of

the resulting labor supply shift among skilled workers (CD) exceeds that for unskilled workers

(FG), as does the change in total employment levels (BD and EG respectively). But this also

results in smaller wage losses for the skilled (AB v. AE) as well as smaller average employment

losses among those who remain in the area (BC v. En.

         Thus, groups with more limited population mobili~ shouid show greater wage and

employment rate deterioration         in local areas when negative local demand shifts occur.

Alternatively,    these groups will experience greater wage and average employment increases in

areas where labor demand is growing. If mobility is correlated with skills or income levels, labor

market inequality will move inversely with local demand growth.




B, Empirical Specz$cation and Data

         We test these notions first by estimating reduced-form equations for the effects of overall

demand shifts across local area on labor market outcomes and labor supply adjustments for

various groups in those areas. With these estimates, we hope to gauge the extent to which overall

demand shocks differentially affect various segments of the workforce, without trying to

distinguish between various possible explanations for such effects. Subsequently,                    we try to

          7 The overall demand shift includes the initial effects (induced by product demand shifts) as well as any
spillover effects, including those induced by labor supply responses. We abstract away from differences in the
demand elasticities for the two kinds of labor.

these areas.

          We have analyzed data for 132 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAS) from the 1980 and

 1990 PUMS files of the U.S. Census. In order to have consistent definitions of our geographic

areas over time, we use the 1990 definitions of metropolitan areas in terms of counties in both

years.g While these definitions are more geographically inclusive than are those from earlier time

periods (especially for a few MSAS such as Boston and New York), our empirical estimates do

not appear to be strongly affected by these changes.9

         We have two measures of changes in labor market outcomes for various demographic

groups that we try to explain below: hourly wages and average per capita annual hours of

employment.      In addition we measure population adjustments for each group with changes in

population size, and we measure total labor adjustment with changes in total hours worked

(which is defined as population x annual hours for the group). All of these are measured as

changes in logs between 1979 and 1989. These four outcome measures are the dependent

variables in our reduced-form equations,           estimated across MSAS, for the effects of overall labor

demand shifts across local areas.

         All of the above variables are defined for the non-enrolled,             non-institutionalized     civilian

population above the age of 16. Most results below are presented by education level (i.e., for

workers with college or more versus high school or less) and experience (less than 10 years

versus all groups) as well as by race and gender within education and experience groups.

         The kinds of overall local labor demand shifts represented by AI in Figure 1 are not




          “In a few cases, the available data did not allow us to perfectly match MSA definitions over time. But the net
changes in population attributable to these matching problems rarely account for more than a few percentage points of
the original population.

         ‘Estimates that we generated using the 1970 rather than the 1990 definitions   of MSAS in both years were
quite similar to those presented below.
                                                              11

 directly observable. Therefore we use total local employment growth as a proxy for such demand

 shifts. But an additional problem here is that total employment growth in the MSA can be driven

 by shifts in local labor supply (through population growth, etc.) as well as demand. Therefore,

following Bartik as well as Blanchard and Katz, we create an index for demand based on

nationwide employment growth in industries, weighted by the MSA-specific                            employment shares

in those industries      - i.e.,



                                                                                     (11)



where H~ represents predicted employment growth in the area, yjkrepresents                           the share of total

hours worked accounted for by sector j in MSA k (averaged over the beginning and end of the

decade), and q ~ represents the change in the log of total hours of employment in the same sector

nationally over the decade. 10 Sectors are defined on the basis of 47 roughly two-digit industry

cells.

          The index is a weighted average of employment growth during the 1980s in each MSA,

where the weights represent the different distributions               of employment across sectors in each

MSA. 11       They measure the extent to which demand was shifting away from the industries in

which workers were employed.              The index should capture exogenous shifts in local labor demand

that are predicted by the city-specific industry mix, while avoiding the endogeneity associated

with local employment growth rates. We use this index as an instrument for the overall local

employment growth.          As a point of comparison, we also present some equations in which our

outcome measures are regressed on total employment growth in the MSA estimated by OLS.



          1°Essentially, ~ ~ represents the share component in the kind of shift- share analysis often performed by urban
aonornists when studying metropolitan growth (Bradbury, Downs, and Small 1982; Terkla and Derringer 1991; Coulsen
and Rushen 1995.

         llVariation in fi ~ arises primarily due to variation in the fraction of a metro area’s workforce in manufacturing.
The correlation between these two variables is 0.75,
                                                              12


          Given the fact that we are examining changes that occur over the space of a decade, it is

 not possible for us to distinguish between the short-run and long-run effects of demand shocks in

 the way that those using annual data have done (Bartik 1991; Blanchard and Katz 1992).

 Intuitively, it seems natural to assume that our estimates represent some kind of average between

 the two. 12 Furthermore,         the major demand shocks to local areas in the 1980s (e.g., the negative

 shocks to the industrial areas of the Midwest) occurred toward the beginning of the decade and

persisted throughout it. Thus, changes in labor market outcomes over the course of the decade

should reflect the decadal responses to these shocks. 13

          Finally, we note the procedures by which all of these equations were estimated. We began

by categorizing individuals into cells on the basis of six education groups, four experience

groups, and eight race-by-gender groups within each MSA in each census year.14 Changes in

labor market outcomes and in supply adjustments were then defined for each cell and regressed

on a set of dummies for MSAS and demographic groups.                     In particular, letting yijlmk      represent


the change in an outcome for the i ~h education, the j ~h experience, the 1 ~h race and them~h sex

group in the kth metro area, we estimate equations of the form.




                         ‘ijlmk    = aijlm   + ~k+   ‘ljlmk                     (12)




           121n fact, Bartik (1993) has shown for a model similar to our own that, under plausible assumptions, long
difference estimated effects will represent a weighted average of the long-run and short-run effects estimated from a
distributed lag model,      The required assumption is that changes over time in the explanatory variable (in our case
employment growth) have to be positively correlated (i.e., across MSAS, those areas that are growing more rapidly
early in the period will be doing so throughout it), Using ES-202 data provided to us by Bartik, we confirmed that this
condition is, in fact, true for our MSAS over the 1979-1989 period.

          130il price shocks did not follow this general pattern. For this reason, one might imagine that our model would
not apply very well to metro areas in the Southwest that are heavily dependent on oil, We estimated many of our
equations on samples that eliminated metro areas located in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. These resul~ differed
negligibly from those presented below.

         l“The education groups were based on the following numbers of completed years of schooling: 0-8,9-11, 12,
13-15, 16, and 17 or more. Experience groups are O-9, 10-19, 20-29, and 30 or more. The race-by-gender groups include
Hispanics and a residual category as well as white and black non-Hispanics.
                                                           13

 Regressions were weighted using the shares of the relevant demographic group in total hours

 worked in the MSA, averaged between 1979 and 1989, Earnings weights produced virtually

 identical results, These regressions were run separately for each of the subgroups for whom we

present separate results below -- i.e., by education (college or more versus high school or less)

and experience (O-9 years versus all levels), and then for white and black males and females

within each educational group. 15

         Coefficients on the MSA dummies (the Pks) can then be interpreted as average local

wage, employment,        and population shifts, standardized for demographic differences across areas

in the composition      of local area workforces.       These dummies were then regressed on the demand

and/or supply measures         to generate the results that are reported below. The second-stage

regressions were weighted using the share of overall population in the sample accounted for by

the MSA (averaged between 1980 and 1990). ‘b This two-stage procedure was used to take

account of the multi-level nature of our data (Amemiya 1978).                 Standard errors are corrected for

potential heteroskedasticity       using procedures     proposed by White (1980, 1982), among others. 17

Since all dependent and independent variables are measured as changes in logs, all coefficients

can be interpreted as elasticities.

         Summary data on changes in the logs of our four outcome measures over the 1980s


          15 In all tabulations and estimated equations for specific race-by-gender subgroups within education   and/or
experience groups, we limited the sample to the 87 MSAS with no race-by-gender of less than 250.

         lGFor comparability   across groups, we used the same MSA weights for the analysis of all subgroups,

          17Eicher-White standard errors are known to be biased in small samples. Mackinnon and White ( 1985) argue
in favor of Jackknife standard errors. Using our data, we compared the two for the models reported in Tables 3 and 6.
In all such cases, Jackknife and Either-White standard errors are very similar.

appear in Table 1.18 Separate estimates are presented by education and experience group, and

also by race and gender within those categories. The results are generally consistent with those

that have previously appeared in the literature on recent trends in earnings inequality (see

Footnote 1). Less-educated          workers suffered substantial declines in their real wages during this

period, both in absolute terms and relative to those with college degrees. Hours worked also grew

for the more-educated       relative to the less-educated. Both wage and hours changes are more

positive for females than for males, and for whites than for blacks within each gender and

education/experience       group.

         In fact, less-educated black males lost roughly 6-7% in annual earnings relative to less-

educated white males, even though the latter experienced real earnings losses as well; while less-

educated black females lost 18~o in annual earnings relative to white females in all experience

groups combined (and somewhat less among the least-experienced).                     Overall, the generally

positive correlation between wage and hours worked changes across race, gender, and education

groups suggest a primary role for relative labor demand shifts in generating these outcomes.

         Population changes also exhibit some interesting relative patterns. We generally find

declining relative population growth for the less-educated within each race-by-gender group,

reflecting the demographic effects of rising school enrollment rates over time. These trends are

particularly strong among white females, for whom the declines in population among the less-

educated are much sharper than they are for males. The rise in relative educational attainment for

white females likely contributed to the change in their position in the labor market. 19



         18Nominal wages in this table have been deflated using changes in the national CPI-U-X 1 over this period.

          ‘%e data also indicate that the growth in population with college or more education was relatively lower among
blacks than whites. See Hauser (1993) and Kane (1994) for more evidence on this topic. But there was also a more
pronounced rise in high school graduation rates and in the fractions of people with 1-3 years of college among blacks
that are not apparent in these data, thus resulting in changes in average educational attainment that are more comparable
across the two groups.
                                                             1!)


            Evidence on the geographic variation in our supply and demand shift measures and in

 wage and employment outcomes appears in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 graphically presents

 wage growth for high school and college graduates for MSAS with 1990 populations of over 2.5

 million.     Table 2 presents data for the 21 MSAS in our sample with populations of 1 million or

 more in 1990 and for which local price indices were available,20 The real wage and hours

outcomes are presented by education group and for less-educated white and black males. The

demand measures presented include shifts in total demand (as defined above) as well as changes

in the shares of employment          accounted for by manufacturing           and construction. The supply

measure presented is the relative change (i.e., difference in logs) in total hours worked between

college graduates and those with high school or less education. As with our measures of total

demand shifts, we present predicted values of these relative hours changes, based on equations in

which they are regressed on the fi ~ measures; thus we are measuring relative supply responses to

exogenous demand shifts (rather than overall supply changes) .21

            The data in Figure 2 and Table 2 show that both wage and hours changes for the college-

educated exceeded those for high school graduates in virtually all of these MSAS, and changes in

outcomes for white males exceeded those for black males in most cases as well. However,                             there

appears to be considerable         geographic variation in these outcomes. We find relatively strong

wage growth for the less-educated in such areas as Boston and New York, while it was weakest

in traditional industrial areas such as Pittsburgh, Detroit, Cleveland, and Chicago (as well as in




        2%ere are 23 MSAS with population above 1 million in 1990 but local price data are not available for either
Phoenix and Tampa, so these MSAS have been omitted from Table 2 and Figure 2.

          21The reasons for presenting the predicted rather than the actual supply changes here me discussed more fully
in Section C below. The magnitudes of relative supply shifts are all greater than those of relative demand shifts since the
latter measure only between-industry components of increases while the former measure total increases.
                                                            16


 Houston) .22 Less-educated         black males did particularly poorly in all of the areas in which the

 relative earnings of high school workers fell.

          The increases in the relative supply of college graduates and in total demand were

 somewhat larger in Boston and New York than in the industrial areas, while the growth in the

relative demand for college graduates and the declines in manufacturing                   employment were

generally smaller in the former. More generally, we find relatively strong simple correlations

(above .6 in absolute value) between relative wage changes and our relative supply (or total

demand) variables.




  B. Reduced Form Estimates

         Tables 3 and 4 present the results of reduced-form equations estimated across MSAS, in

which our two labor market outcome measures and two supply adjustment measures are the

dependent variables, and overall employment growth in the MSA is the independent variable.

Estimates appear separately by education and experience group in Table 3, and also by race and

gender within those groups in Table 4.

         Results in Table 3 are presented for both OLS and Instrumental Variables (N) estimation

(where the latter uses the H~ measure as the instrument for total local employment growth),

while Table 4 presents them only for IV.23 It is of some interest to examine the first stage

equation for our estimates.       Both the reliability and validity of our IV estimates depend on the

reliability and validity of the first-stage estimates (Nelson and Startz 1990a,b; Bound, Jaeger, and

Baker 1995). Furthermore,          in our case, the first-stage equation is of some independent interest.


         ‘zThe weakness of the labor market in Houston, and in MSAS of the southwest          region more generally,   is
probably attributable to the collapse of the price of oil during the 1980s.

          23The R* measures for IV equations reported in these tables are from the reduced-form equations, and therefore
represent the fraction of the variation in the dependent variable explained by measured exogenous factors.
                                                         17


 The first-stage equation for the IV estimates in Table 3 (with standard errors in parentheses

 below coefficients) is as follows:


                                   qk=-o.22+2.12fik                  R2=0    .21
                                                    (0.51)


where q ~ reflects total local growth in hours of employment. The estimated coefficient on the

instrument indicates that national demand shifts at the industry level have a multiplier effect of

roughly 2 on employment         at the local level. The equation also indicates that industry mix has a

fair amount of explanatory power with regard to local employment changes, although, obviously,

there is also a good deal of additional variation in the latter that is not accounted for by the

former.

          The results of Tables 3 and 4 show several clear patterns. Total demand growth within the

MSA generally has significant positive effects on changes in both hourly wages and hours

worked (per person) over the decade. The magnitudes of these effects are generally larger for

younger than for older workers (especially on wages), larger for less-educated than for more-

educated workers, and larger for blacks than for whites (especially on hours worked),                  The

overall pattern of results generally holds for females as well as for males. These results are

largely consistent with others in the literature (e.g., Bartik, 1992; Freeman, 1991) to date, and

indicate that falling overall labor demand contributes to higher inequality in the labor market.

          Comparing the lV estimates to those of OLS, we find that the former are generally quite a

bit larger than the latter, although the estimated sampling variability of the IV estimates is

sufficiently large to imply that the differences are generally only marginally statistically

significant.24   This is consistent with our notion that the latter estimates confound the effects of


         24Differences between our OLS and IV estimates are somewhat larger than those found by Bartik and by
Blanchard and Katz with comparable instruments. These differences might be due to larger supply shift biases in our
analysis of a single cross-section of geographic areas rather than deviations from trend in time-series data,
                                                             18


labor supply and demand shifts, leading to downward biases in the estimated effects of demand

on market outcomes. Despite the fact that standard errors on the IV estimates are also

substantially larger than on those from ON, most of the differences described above in

magnitudes of effects across demographic groups are statistically significant.25

           Overall, these estimates imply that a 10% shift in demand away from an area would lead

to nominal wage declines in all experience groups of 7% and 470 respectively among those with

high school and college education.            Among the least-experienced           workers, the declines would be

11% and 6% respectively in the two education groups. Using data on price indices for the subset

of our MSAS for which these data are available, we estimate that the decline in demand would

lower price levels by roughly 2% in an area.zb Thus, much of the nominal wage declines noted

above appear to reflect changes in real wages. The magnitudes of estimated effects on real wages

of black workers in each category are even larger, and there are additional effects on hours

worked, as well as on real wages for each group, that reinforce these findings.

           With regard to labor supply adjustments, we find that changes in both population and

total hours worked by group also are positively related to labor demand shifts.27 In general,

population adjustments are larger among the more-educated                     an~or the least-experienced

cohorts.    The IV estimates of population adjustments are generally smaller than those from OLS,

which is once again consistent with the idea that the latter confound the effects of demand shifts


           25Differences in wage coefficients between the all experience and the O-9 years categories are significant at the
.05 level for both education groups. Differences in coefficients for hours worked between whites and blacks are
significant at the .05 level among those with high school or less education for both experience groups and both genders;
the difference in wage coefficients is significant only for males in the O-9 years category.

          *’Using price indices for 26 of our MSAS, we find elasticities of price levels with respect to local demand shifts
of about .16 using OLS and about .26 using IV. These are comparable to Bartiks (1991) estimated long-run effects of
about .2. Blanchard and Katz found somewhat larger effects that were dissipated after 10 years. One might worry that
one should not use the same cost of living adjustments for the more- and less-educated, but work by Idson and Miller
(1995) suggests that consumption bundles vary little by educational attainment.

          “The coefficients from the total hours equations are simply the sums of those from the relevant equations for
population adjustments and hours per person.
                                                               19


 and those of supply, in this case leading to upward biases in estimated effects. The IV estimates

 show quantitatively       large and generally statistically significant             differences in population

 adjustments     across education and experience groups. The estimates imply that a 1070 shift in

 demand away from an area would lead to declines in population for all experience groups of

 about 570 among college graduates and nothing among those with high school or less; in the

 youngest cohort, the corresponding            declines would be roughly 1170 and 6Y0.

          When comparing the population adjustments of whites with those of blacks within

education, experience, and gender groups (Table 4), the picture is somewhat less clear. The

estimates here generally indicate larger adjustments for whites only among less-educated and

more-experienced         males. In other ewes, adjustments among blacks are comparable or even larger

than among whites.zg Furthermore,              at least some of the point estimates for blacks maybe

implausibly large, although they are estimated quite imprecisely .29

          An alternative explanation for these results would stress the likelihood (explained on p. 3)

that any given change in total labor market demand in an MSA implies larger effects on the

group-specific      labor demand facing blacks than whites.30 Thus, population adjustments to unit

changes in total market demand that are comparable or greater among blacks than among whites

might actually constitute smaller responses to unit changes in their respective group-specific

demands.



           2nThe larger effects for blacks are significant between     females at both education levels and both experience
levels, except that the one for less-educated and least-experienced     women is marginal (t= 1,24). Between white and black
males, the estimates are not significantly larger for blacks, except   marginally among less-educated workers with O-9 years
experience (t=l .36). The larger estimate for less-educated white      males in all experience groups is also only marginally
significant (t=l .31).

          29For instance, the estimates suggest that a 10% decline in local demand would generate declines in the
populations of the youngest experience groups of 13% among less-educated black males, 17% among more-educated
black males, and 19% among more-educated black females.

         ‘~is is also consistent with the generally larger effects of total market demand on the wages and employment
of blacks than whites that we observe in Table 3.
                                                           20


          It is also of some interest to compare the nature of the supply adjustments made by the

various populations      -- that is, to what extent do these adjustments occur via a change in average

hours per person and to what extent via population shifts.               To provide evidence on this issue, we

present an additional set of estimates for population adjustment in Table 5. These estimates are

from regressions of population changes for a particular group on changes in total hours worked

by that group (instead of the MSA overall), where the latter is once again instrumented by fi ~gl.

Since the change in the log of total hours worked is the sum of the changes in the logs of

population changes and in hours per person, the regression will measure the shares of observed

changes in total hours worked of that group accounted for by population adjustment (with the

remainder accounted for by changes in hours per person). The IV estimates                     can be interpreted as

measures of the extent to which exogenous demand shifts for a particular group result in

population (as opposed to per person employment)                adjustment.    For the cases in which H~ has

little impact on total hours (e.g., white women) the IV estimates will not be very meaningful.

Such cases have been noted in Table 5 with a “*”.

         The results of the table show that population adjustment generally accounts for more of

the observed changes in total hours among the more-educated                   and/or younger workers, which is

consistent with our earlier estimates. Indeed, the relative lack of population adjustment among

older, less-educated workers is particularly striking.           Within the less-educated groups, we now

find that population adjustments for blacks account for smaller shares of adjustments to demand

shifts than they do for whites. This is true among both males and females, and at all experience

levels. In contrast, population adjustments among more educated blacks are roughly comparable



         31These coefficients could be obtained by dividing the estimated IV effects of demand on population adjustment
by those on total hours for any particular group in Table 3 or 4.
                                                         21


 to those observed among their white counterparts.

           These results are largely consistent with the fact noted earlier that gross migration rates

 are generally lower for blacks than for whites, even within education level.32 Together they

 suggest that supply responsiveness       to labor demand shifts of a given magnitude is lower among

blacks than whites, even after controlling for educational levels.

         By how much might the differential wage response across skill groups to demand shocks

contribute to the observed growth in wage inequality between them?                  The N results from Table

3 suggest that a 1090 shift in labor demand between areas would contribute roughly 2.7% to the

difference in wages between the two groups in the declining areas.                Using numbers from Table

2, this estimate implies that our exogenous demand shift measure can account for roughly 20-

25% of the difference between         Boston and Detroit or 40% of the difference between New York

and Detroit in terms of the growth in the college/high school wage differential.               A visual sense

of the explanatory power of our demand shift measure can be obtained from Figure 3, where

we plot relative wages against predicted overall demand for the same set of MSAS that we use in

Table 2.

         More generally, the R 2s reported in Table 3 suggest that our exogenous demand measure,

fi ~, can explain 14 percent of the variation in relative wages.           However, our calculations show

that even using the large Census samples, there is a considerable amount of sampling error in our

mean wage change measures.           Adjusting for this measurement error boosts the R 2 to above 20




          32For instance, in the 1975-1980 period, Census data show gross migration rates among white and black MSA
residents was 0.17 and 0.09 respectively. Among high school drop-outs the corresponding rates were 0.10 and 0.07;
among high school graduates they were 0.15 and 0.10 (U.S. Department of Commerce 1981). We found similar results
using NLSY data. The NLSY data show 19.690 of young white male high school graduates, but only 13,0% of black
make high-school graduates moving across metro areas between 1979 and 1988 (Bound and Holzer 1995).

percent.33 Moreover, our exogenous demand measure presumably picks up only a component of

demand.     Thus, it is possible that demand shifts can explain a large fraction of the true variation

in relative wages across the MSAS in our sample.              However, the fact that many of the MSAS

that experience large relative wage changes were also those that experienced large increases in

their immigrant population during the 1980s (e.g., Miami) at least suggests that immigration

may have also played a role (Topel 1994; Jaeger 1996).




 C. Effect of Supply and Demand Factors on Relative Wages

         The reduced-form regression results presented above show that local demand shifts have

larger effects on labor market outcomes among less-educated                workers, while supply adjustments

to these demand shifts are lower among these groups. In fact, the estimated                different   supply

adjustments are large enough to at lemt potentially explain the entire differential impact of local

demand shocks on the wages of college- and high school-educated                 workers.     The lV estimates

reported in Table 3 suggest that a 10 percent demand-induced              drop in employment will lower the

relative supply of college graduates to the local labor market by 3.6 percent, while raising their

relative wages by 2.7 percent. For such relative supply adjustments to be able to fully explain the

relative wage adjustments,      the elasticity of substitution between high school- and college-

educated labor would have to be no greater than 1 1/3, which is well within the range suggested

by conventional    wisdom.

        To more directly estimate the effects of relative supply adjustments on relative wages

between skill groups, we present estimates from regressions of the latter on the former across



         33Comparing the (weighted) average of estimated variances of the first-stage ~ks to the variance of the ~ks
themselves, we calculate that 3770 of the apparent variation in relative wages is “noise”.
                                                          23

MSAS (Table 6). These equations             also include controls for relative demand shifts between

more- and less-educated workers.           These measures are designed to capture the notion that

changing industrial structure of employment might shift demand across groups even if total labor

demand in an area remains unchanged (for reasons described in Section 1).J4

         Differences in changes in logs of wages between workers with college or more and those

with high school or less education are the dependent variables here, while differences in changes

in supply and demand measures between these groups are the independent variables.                        The supply

measures used here are total hours worked by each group. Because of the endogeneity of supply

shifts, we instrument them with fi ~. This supply measure should therefore capture the

differences across groups in the extent of supply responsiveness               to demand shifts that we

observed above, and should enable us to estimate the effect of these differences on relative wages

across groups.

         To proxy for changes in relative demand we have used a number of different measures,

all based on changes in the industrial structure of an area. For our first measure we use a variant

of the fixed-coefficient     measure of demand often used in the literature (e.g., Katz and Murphy,

1992). We calculate the demand shift in favor of group i in areak as

                                                                                                (13)
                           fiik = Zj   yijkrljk,




where i indexes skill groups, ]“ industries, and k metro areas, As before                yijk    represents the

share of the i~hdemographic group in the j ~h industry in the kth metro area, while                      q jk



          34We have no explicit measures of rates of capital inflows or technological change across metropolitan areas.
Correlations between these unobserved factors and our relative supply and demand measures are potential sources of
bias in our estimated effects of the latter, though the signs of these biases are not clear a priori.
                                                     24


represents the growth rate of industry j in area k. Thus, we now use industry shares of local

employment for specific skill groups, which weight local (rather than national) indust~

employment       growth. We use the difference between the bik for workers with college or more

education versus those with high school or less as our relative demand measure.

           Alternative measures of relative demand are based exclusively on two industries in which

many less-educated      workers have traditionally been employed, often earning a premium in wages

- i.e., manufacturing    and construction.   Indeed, declining employment in manufacturing     has

specifically been linked to declining employment levels among blacks and declining earnings

among the less-educated      more generally in several previous studies (noted above). In some

equations below, we therefore use changes in the shares of employment that are accounted for by

one or both of these industries between 1979 and 1989 in place of the relative demand indices.

           The results reported in Table 6 confirm expectations   that relative supply responses to

exogenous demand shocks have large effects on relative wages. The inclusion of the demand

shift measures tends to mute but not eliminate the estimated effect of relative supply. This

suggests     that, while changes in the relative supply may be an important factor affecting the

change in relative wages, demand factors may also play a role. Relative demand shifts have the

anticipated positive effects and are at least marginally significant. When the change in the share

of employment      in manufacturing   alone is used in place of the relative demand measure,    it

generates     the anticipated negative effect on the relative wage difference, although its effect is not

significant. The inclusion of construction along with manufacturing       generates much stronger

effects.

           Unlike Topel (1993, 1994), we find effects of relative demand but not supply in the OLS

versions of these equations.     However, when we performed       our analysis at the division level
                                                          25

(defining wage outcomes         at the division level in a way exactly analogous to the way we defined

them at the MSA level), we find a strong correlation between wage and supply changes. At the

division level, a regression of the change in the college/high school wage differential on the

change in relative hours gives a coefficient on the relative supply measure of -.52 (.16),

R 2=.59.       One interpretation     of this difference is that labor supply shifts are more exogenous

with respect to larger geographic units.35




IV. Conclusion

         In this paper we explore the effects of changes in the economy’s geographic, industrial

and occupational structure on the earnings and employment of white and black men and women

during the 1980s. We also explore how population adjustments (primarily through migration

across metropolitan areas) vary across these groups in response to these economic changes.

         The results show that earnings and employment deteriorated the most for less-educated

and/or black males in the 1980s. These effects occurred in almost all MSAS nationwide, although

they were most severe in the industrial areas of the Midwest. Overall labor demand shifts had

relatively large effects on the earnings and employment on these groups in these areas during that

time period.

         We also found evidence of supply effects on local labor market outcomes, working

through population adjustments in response to shifts in labor demand. However, older and less-

educated workers have the most limited short-run labor supply adjustments to these demand

shifts in terms of intermetropolitan       migration; and there was some evidence of lower response



          35A similar point was made by Borjas,   Freeman, and Katz (1996) when considering   results on the impact of
immigration on wages.
                                                             26

among blacks as well, even within education group. These limited adjustments appear to

contribute to the relatively greater deterioration of their earnings in declining areas during the

1980s.

          There are a number of plausible reasons for why these groups might migrate less in

response to demand shifts: less information about alternative labor market opportunities                         in other

areas; fewer social contacts in growing areas; or lower assets with which to finance the fixed

costs of a move.3b Although there have been historical periods in which less-educated workers in

the U.S. migrated in very large numbers (such as the south-to-north                    migration of blacks between

the 1920s and the 1960s), it may take fair] y dramatic shifts in regional economic conditions to

overcome the costs and barriers faced by potential migrants across these areas .J7 Regardless of

their causes, the implications        of these shifts for employment and earnings differences among

groups may be quite substantial.

         We must note several caveats in presenting these findings. Given the nature of our data,

we could only analyze the part of labor demand shifts that are between sectors (defined by two-

digit industries) rather than within them. Our ability to distinguish changes in total labor demand

in an MSA from shifts in relative demand across different groups was also limited, given the


          “For instance, Greenwood (1975) notes that college-educated migrants are much more likely to have a job
lined up prior to a move than are migrants with less education, which is consistent with the idea that the former are better
informed about job opportunities in other areas because their labor markets are often regional or national in scope.
Lansing and Mueller (1967) note that college-educated migrants report a greater role for economic factors in their
decisions to move than do the less-educated; and that blacks cite family/community reasons for moving or not moving
more frequently than do whites. Consistent with this, Stack (1996) presents a description of blacks returning to families
and communities in economically depressed areas of the rural South after having migrated northward in earlier periods
(though Frey (1995) also documents the return migration of blacks to metropolitan areas in the South, where economic
conditions are presumably more favorable). For evidence on the importance of informal networks among both whites
and blacks when searching for jobs, see Holzer (1987); and for evidence of much lower assets among blacks than whites,
see Blau and Graham (1990). Relative immigration rates across skill and racial groups might also be affected by relative
rates of marriage and differences in the presence of dual-earner families across these groups.

          ~7See Uhlenberg (1973) and Trotter (1994) for more discussion of the role of economic and social forces in
generating the out-migration of Southern blacks in the 1920s, and the relative lack of out-migration before that time.

fairly small number of MSAS for which we had sufficient numbers of blacks and whites within

education and experience groups.

         Since we are analyzing data on population adjustments over a 10-year period we cannot

distinguish between short- and long-run responses to demand shifts. Nor can we distinguish

between expected and unexpected shifts. Nevertheless, the results presented here strongly

suggest that both demand shifts and supply adjustments contributed to the labor market problems

of less-educated   and black workers in declining areas in recent years. Further research on why the

adjustment mechanisms     are used more or less frequently by different groups (i.e., whether the

differences are caused by information, financial costs, etc.), and on the potential effects of

various policy options, should be high on our agendas.

Sample: 132 largest MSAS for the top two rows, 87 MSAS with the largest Black populations     for the rest.

Note: Observations are weighted by the average of 1980 and 1990 population shares, All variables are
memured as changes in logs, 1979-89. “T, Hrs.” represents Total Hours, which is the product of
population (“Pop.”) and the average hours per person (“Hours”). Calculations are based on the nonenrolled
and noninstitutional ized civilian populations aged 16 and over. Nominal wage changes have been deflated
by the log of the change in the CPI-U-X1 index between 1979-89.

Sample:   132 largest MSAS.

Note: A II regressions are population weighted. See text for details. The R2 memures for IV         estimates are
from reduced-form equations where the dependent variables were regressed directly on the            instrument.
The instrument used for IV estimates involves employment growth in the MSA as predicted              from the
national growth of the local area’s industries, For details, see the text. The first stage R2 for   these estimates
is 0.21, while the first stage F is 34.1.

Sample:   132 largest MSAS for the top two rows, 87 MSAS with the largest Black populations       for the rest.

Note: All regressions are population weighted. See text for details. Instrument used for estimates involves
employment growth in the MSA as predicted from the national growth of local area’s industries. With the
exception of those estimates indicatedwith a “*”, all first stage F’s are above 8.

Note: All  regressions are population weighted. See text for details. In the IV estimates reported relative
supply is treated as endogenous, while all other variables are treated as exogenous.The R2 measuresare
from reduced-formequations where      the relative wage memure is regressed directly on the relevant
exogenous variables. Excluded instrument used for        IV estimates    involves employment growth in the MSA
as predicted from the national growth of local area’s industries.       First stage partial R2’s range from 0.05 to
0,25, while the first stage F’s range from 7.0 to 31.8.
