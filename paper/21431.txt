What Works? A Meta Analysis of Recent Active Labor Market Program Evaluations

                                          ABSTRACT

We summarize the estimates from over 200 recent studies of active labor market programs. We
classify the estimates by type of program and participant group, and distinguish between three
different post-program time horizons. Using regression models for the estimated program effect
(for studies that model the probability of employment) and for the sign and significance of the
estimated effect (for all the studies in our sample) we conclude that: (1) average impacts are close
to zero in the short run, but become more positive 2-3 years after completion of the program; (2)
the time profile of impacts varies by type of program, with larger average gains for programs that
emphasize human capital accumulation; (3) there is systematic heterogeneity across participant
groups, with larger impacts for females and participants who enter from long term
unemployment; (4) active labor market programs are more likely to show positive impacts in a
recession.

        In the long period of recovery after the Great Recession there is renewed
interest in the potential use of active labor market policies (ALMPs) to help ease a wide
range of labor market problems, including youth unemployment and persistent
joblessness among displaced adults (e.g., Martin, 2014). Although training programs,
employment subsidies, and similar policies have been in use for well over 50 years,
credible evidence on their causal impacts has only become available in recent decades
(see Lalonde 2003 for a brief history). Within a relatively short period of time the
number of scientific evaluations has exploded, offering the potential to learn what types
of programs work best, in what circumstances, and for whom.
        In this paper we synthesize the recent ALMP evaluation literature, looking for
systematic evidence on these issues.1 We extend the sample used in our earlier analysis
(Card, Kluve, Weber, 2010; hereafter CKW), doubling the number of studies (from 97 to
207) and increasing the number of separate program estimates from 343 to 857. Many
of the latest ALMP studies measure impacts on the employment rate of participants,
yielding over 350 estimates for this outcome that can be readily compared across
studies.
        This new sample of estimates allows us extend our earlier work in 4 main ways.
First, we can more precisely characterize average program impacts by type of ALMP and
post-program time horizon. Second, we are able to compare the relative efficacy of
different types of ALMP’s (e.g. training versus job search assistance) for different
participant groups (e.g., youths versus older workers). Third, we provide new evidence
on the variation in program effects at different points in the business cycle. Finally, we

evaluations from the U.S. and other countries, Kluve (2010), who reviews close to 100 studies from
Europe, and Filges et al. (2015), who analyze a narrower set of 39 studies. Greenberg, Michalopoulos and

interventions in low and middle income countries include Cho and Honorati (2014) and Grimm and
Paffhausen (2015).




                                                   1
conduct a systematic analysis of potential publication biases in the recent ALMP
literature.
        We summarize the estimates from different studies in two complementary ways.
Our main approach is to examine the estimated program effects on employment,
ignoring the findings from studies that model other outcomes (such as the duration of
time to an unsubsidized job). Our second approach -- which can be applied to all the
estimates in our sample, regardless of the outcome variable -- is to classify "sign and
significance" based on whether the estimated impact is significantly positive, statistically
insignificant, or significantly negative. The narrower focus of the first approach is
preferred in the meta analysis literature (e.g., Hedges and Olkin, 1985; Roberts and
Stanley, 2005; Stanley and Doucouliagos, 2012), because the magnitude of the effect is
not mechanically related to the number of observations used in the study, whereas
statistical significance is (in principle) sample-size dependent. Fortunately, the two
approaches yield similar conclusions when applied to the subset of studies for which
employment effects are available, giving us confidence that our main findings are
invariant to how we summarize the literature.
        We reach four main substantive conclusions. First, consistent with the pattern
documented in CKW, we find that ALMPs have relatively small average effects in the
short run (less than a year after the end of the program), but larger average effects in
the medium run (1-2 years post program) and longer run (2+ years). Across studies that
model impacts on employment, the short run impacts are centered between 1 and 3
percentage points (ppt.) The distribution of medium run effects is shifted to the right,
centered around 3 to 5 ppt., while the longer run effects are centered between 5 and 12
ppt. As a benchmark, the gap in employment rates between U.S. men with only a high
school education and those with a 2 or 3 year community college degree is 10 ppts.,
suggesting that a 5-10 ppt. longer-run impact is economically meaningful.2

2
 In 2015, the average monthly employment rate of men over age 25 with a high school education in the
U.S. was 63.5%; the average for men with an Associate degree was 73.8%. (U.S. DOL, 2016).




                                                  2
       Second, the time profile of average impacts in the post-program period varies
with the type of ALMP. Job search assistance programs that emphasize "work first"
tend to have similar impacts in the short and long run, whereas training and private
sector employment programs have larger average effects in the medium and longer
runs. Public sector employment subsidies tend to have small or even negative average
impacts at all horizons.
       Third, we find that the average impacts of ALMPs vary across groups, with larger
average effects for females and participants drawn from the pool of long term
unemployed, and smaller average effects for older workers and youths. We also find
suggestive evidence that certain programs work better for specific subgroups of
participants. Job search assistance programs appear to be relatively more successful for
disadvantaged participants, whereas training and private sector employment subsidies
tend to have larger average effects for the long term unemployed. Finally, comparing
the relative efficacy of ALMPs offered at different points in the business cycle, we find
that programs in recessionary periods tend to have larger average impacts, particularly
if the downturn is relatively short-lived.
       On the methodological side, we find that the average program effects from
randomized experiments are not very different from the average effects from non-
experimental designs. This is reassuring given longstanding concerns over the reliability
of non-experimental methods for evaluating job training and related programs (e.g.,
Ashenfelter, 1987). We also find that there is substantial unobserved heterogeneity in
the estimated program impacts in the literature. This heterogeneity is large relative to
the variation attributable to sampling error, leading to relatively wide dispersion in the
estimated impacts from designs with similar precision. In contrast to the patterns
uncovered in meta analyses of minimum wage effects (Doucouliagos and Stanley, 2009)
and the intertemporal substitution elasticity (Havranek, 2015) this dispersion is also
nearly symmetric. As a result, standard tests for publication bias, which look for
asymmetry in the distribution of program estimates, are insignificant.

II. Sample Construction
a. Sampling Impact Evaluation Studies
        We extend the sample in CKW, using the same criteria to select in-scope studies
and the same protocols to extract information about program features and impacts. The
CKW sample was derived from responses to a 2007 survey of researchers affiliated with
the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA) and the National Bureau of Economic Research
(NBER) asking about evaluation studies written after 1995.3 To extend this sample we
began by reviewing the research profiles and homepages of IZA research fellows with a
declared interest in “program evaluation”, looking for studies written since 2007. We
also searched the NBER working paper database using the search strings “training”,
“active”, “public sector employment”, and “search assistance.”
        In a second step we used a Google Scholar search to identify all papers citing
CKW or the earlier review by Kluve (2010). We also searched through the International
Initiative for Impact Evaluation's "Repository of Impact Evaluation Published Studies,"
the online project list of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), and the list of
Latin American program evaluations reviewed by Ibarrarán and Rosas (2009).
        After identifying an initial sample of studies, we reviewed the citations in all the
papers to find any additional ALMP studies. We also identified four additional papers
presented at a conference in early fall 2014. The search process lasted from April to
October 2014 and yielded 154 new studies that were considered for inclusion in our
ALMP impact evaluation data base.


b. Inclusion Criteria




3
  The 1995 starting point was determined in part by the existence of several well-known summaries of the
literature up to the mid-1990s, including Friedlander, Greenberg and Robins (1997), Heckman, Lalonde
and Smith (1999), and Greenberg, Michalopoulos and Robins (2003).




                                                   4
         In order to generate a consistent data base across the two waves of data
collection (2007 and 2014) we imposed the same restrictions adopted in CKW. First, the
program(s) analyzed in the evaluation had to be one of following five types:
     •      classroom or on-the-job training
     •      job search assistance, monitoring, or sanctions for failing to search
     •      subsidized private sector employment
     •      subsidized public sector employment
     •      other programs combining two or more of the above types.4
Since our focus is on "active" labor market policies, we exclude studies of financial
incentives, such as re-employment bonuses (summarized in Meyer, 1995) or earnings
subsidy programs (discussed in Blank, Card and Robins 2000). We also exclude open-
ended entitlement programs like child care subsidies, and include only individually
targeted employer subsidy programs, excluding tax incentives or other subsidies that
are available for all newly hired or existing workers. Finally, we exclude studies that
revise or update an older study in the CKW sample, or have substantial overlap with an
older study. Methodologically, we include only well-documented studies that use
individual micro data and incorporate a counterfactual/control group design or some
form of selection correction.
         Imposing these criteria we retain 110 of the 154 studies identified in the search
process.5 We added these to the 97 studies from CKW, yielding a final sample of 207
impact evaluations. A complete list of these studies is contained in the online Data
Appendix, along with our entire data base of program estimates.
         We emphasize that the evaluations in our sample have many limitations. At
best, these studies measure the partial equilibrium effects of ALMPs, comparing the
mean outcomes in a treatment group to those of an untreated control or comparison

4
  Most of these programs combine an element of job search with training or subsidized employment. We
also include 7 estimates of the “threat of assignment“ to a program in this category.
5
  The main reasons for exclusion were: overlap with other papers (i.e. estimating impacts for the same
program); program out of scope; and no explicit counterfactual design.




                                                  5
group.6 Even from this narrow perspective few studies present information on the costs
of the program, and detailed cost-benefit calculations are very rare. Moreover, although
we restrict attention to studies with a comparison group or selection correction design,
we suspect that there may be some bias in the estimates from any particular study. We
do not believe, however, that authors have a strong incentive to choose specifications
that lead to positive program estimates, since many well-known studies in the literature
report insignificant or even negative impacts for some programs or subgroups (e.g.,
Bloom et al., 2007). Thus, we do not have a strong presumption that the biases in the
literature tend to be one-sided.


c. Extracting Impact Estimates and Information on Programs and Participants
        The next step was to extract information about the programs and participants
analyzed in each study, and the corresponding program impact estimates.7 Using the
classification system developed in CKW, we gathered information on the type of ALMP,
on the types of participants that are admitted to the program (long term unemployed,
regular unemployment insurance recipients, or disadvantaged individuals8), the type of
dependent variable used to measure the impact of the program, and the econometric
methodology. We also gathered information on the (approximate) dates of operation of
the program, the age and gender of participants in the program, the source of the data
used in the evaluation (administrative records or a specialized survey), and the
approximate duration of the program.
        If a study reported separate impact estimates either by program type or by
participant group, we identified the program/participant subgroup (PPS) and coded the
impact estimates separately. Overall, we have information on 526 separate PPSs from

6
  The literature on the equilibrium effects of ALMP is scarce. For a notable exception, see Crepon et al.
(2013).
7
  As in CKW, we extracted the information from the studies ourselves, since we found that substantial
knowledge of evaluation methodology and the ALMP literature is often needed to interpret the studies.
8
  We classify the intake group as "disadvantaged" if participants are selected from low-income or low-
labor market attachment individuals.




                                                     6
the 207 studies, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 10 PPSs in each study. We also
identified up to three impact estimates for each PPS, corresponding to three different
post-program time horizons: short-term (approximately one year after completion of
the program); medium term (approximately two years after); and longer-term
(approximately 3 years after). In total, we have 857 separate program estimates for the
526 program/participant subgroups, with between one and three estimates of the effect
of the program at different time horizons.9
        We use two complementary approaches to quantify the estimated program
impacts. First, we classify the estimates as significantly positive, insignificantly different
from zero, or significantly negative (at the 5% level). This measure of effectiveness is
available for every estimate in our data base. For the subset of studies that measure
effects on the probability of employment, we also extract an estimate of the program
effect on the employment rate of participants.10
        The final step in our data assembly procedure was to add information on labor
market conditions at the time of operation of the program. Specifically, we gathered
information on GDP growth rates and unemployment rates from the OECD, the World
Bank, and the ILO. For our main analysis we focus on how program effectiveness is
related to the average growth rate and the average unemployment rate during the
period the program group participated in the ALMP, though we also look at the effect of
conditions in the post-program period.




9
  For a specific PPS and time horizon we try to identify and code the main estimate in the study. We do
not include multiple estimates for the same PPS and time horizon.
10
   We also extract the average employment rate of the comparison group, and for some analysis we
model the program effect divided by either the comparison group employment rate or the standard
deviation of the comparison group employment rate.




                                                    7
III. Descriptive Overview
a. Program Types, Participant Characteristics, Evaluation Design
        Table 1 presents an overview of the program estimates in our final sample. As
noted, we have a total of 857 different impact estimates for 526 different PPSs
(program-type/participant subgroup combinations) extracted from 207 separate
studies. To deal with potential correlations between the program estimates from a
given study - -arising for example from idiosyncratic features of the evaluation
methodology -- we calculate standard errors clustering by study.
        Column 1 presents the characteristics of our overall sample, while columns 2-6
summarize the estimates from five country groups: the Germanic countries (Austria,
Germany and Switzerland), which account for about one quarter of all studies; the
Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden), which account for another
quarter of studies; the Anglo countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, U.K. and U.S.),
which account for just over 10% of studies; and two non-mutually exclusive groups of
lower/middle income countries -- "non-OECD" countries (10% of studies), and Latin
American and Caribbean (LAC) countries (10% of studies). Appendix Figure 1 shows the
numbers of estimates by country. The largest source countries are Germany (253
estimates), Denmark (115 estimates), Sweden (66 estimates), the U.S. (57 estimates)
and France (42 estimates).
        The second panel of Table 1 shows the distribution of program types in our
sample. Training programs (including classroom and on-the-job training) account for
about one half of the program estimates, with bigger shares in the non-OECD and LAC
countries. Public sector employment programs, by comparison, are relatively rare
among recent evaluations, while job search assistance (JSA) programs, private
employment subsidies and other/combined programs each represent about 15% of the
estimates.11

11
  The JSA category includes a small number of evaluations (with a total of 8 program estimates) for
programs that monitor search activity and threaten sanctions for low search effort. We combine these




                                                  8
        The next three panels of the table show the characteristics of the program
participants, classified by age group, gender, and "type" of participant. About one-half
of the estimates are for mixed age and mixed gender groups, but we also have relatively
large subsets of estimates that are specific to either younger or older workers, or
females or males. Sixty-five percent of the program estimates (and nearly all the
estimates from the Germanic countries) are for participants who enter from the
unemployment insurance (UI) system. Typically these participants are assigned to a
program and required to attend as a condition for continuing benefit eligibility.12 The
remaining 35% of estimates are split between programs that serve the long term
unemployed (LTU) and those that serve disadvantaged participant groups. In many
cases, these groups are recruited by program operators and enroll voluntarily. Such
voluntary programs are more common in the Anglo Saxon countries and in less
developed countries that lack a formal UI system. 13
        Next we show the outcome variables used to measure the program impact and
the time horizons of the estimate. The most common outcome – particularly in the
Germanic and non-OECD countries – is the probability of employment, while the level of
earnings is the most common metric in the Anglo Saxon countries. About one sixth of
the program estimates – but 40% of those from Nordic countries – measure the exit rate
from the benefit system, typically focusing on the rate of exit to a new (unsubsidized)
job. Finally, a small subset of estimates – mostly from Anglo Saxon countries – focus on
the probability of unemployment. About one half of the estimates are for a short term
horizon (<1 year) after program completion, 35% for a medium term (1-2 years), and
16% for a longer term (more than 2 year after).




with JSA programs because both types of programs have similar incentive effects on participants' search
activity.
12
   This type of program requirement is widespread in Europe -- see Sianesi (2004) for a discussion.
13
   The U.S. job training programs analyzed in the seminal papers of Ashenfelter (1978), Ashenfelter and
Card (1985), Lalonde (1986), Heckman, Ichimura, Smith, and Todd (1998) are all of this type.




                                                   9
       The last row of the Table shows the fraction of program estimates that are based
on an experimental design. In most of our country groups about 30% of estimates come
from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have been explicitly designed to measure
the effectiveness of the ALMP of interest. An important exception is the Germanic
countries, where no experimentally based estimates are yet available.
       The distribution of program estimates over time (defining time by the earliest
intake year of the program) is shown in Figure 1, with separate counts for experimental
and non-experimental estimates. Our sample includes programs from as far back as
1980, though the majority of estimates are from the 1990s and early 2000s, reflecting
our focus on studies written since 1995. There is clear evidence of a trend toward
increasing use of experimental designs: among the 210 estimates from 2004 and later,
61% are from randomized designs.


b. Measures of Program Impact - Overview
       Table 2 gives an overview of our two main measures of program impact,
contrasting results for the short term, medium term, and long term. Column one
summarizes the sign and significance of all the available program estimates. Among the
415 short term estimates, 40% are significantly positive, 42% are insignificant, and 18%
are significantly negative. The pattern of results is more positive in the medium and
longer terms, with a majority of estimates (52%) being significantly positive in the
medium term, and 61% being significantly positive in the longer term.
       Column 2 shows the distribution of sign and significance for the subset of studies
that use post-program employment rates to evaluate the ALMP program. These 111
studies account for 490 program estimates (57% of our total sample). The short term
program estimates from this subset of studies are somewhat less positive than in the
overall sample. In the medium and longer terms, however, the discrepancy disappears.
As discussed below, these patterns are not explained by differences in the types of
ALMP programs analyzed in different studies, or by differences in participant



                                            10
characteristics. Instead, they reflect a tendency for studies based on models of the time
to unemployment exit (which are included in column 1 but excluded in column 2) to
exhibit more positive short term impacts than studies based on employment.
        Column 3 of Table 2 shows the distributions of sign and significance associated
with the estimated employment effects where we can extract both an actual program
effect (typically the coefficient from a linear probability model) and the employment
rate of the comparison group.14 The distributions are very similar to those in column 2,
suggesting that there is no systematic bias associated with the availability of an impact
effect and the comparison group employment rate.
        Finally, columns 4 and 5 report the mean and median of the distributions of
estimated program effects for the subsample in column 3. The short run program
effects are centered just above zero, with a mean and median of 1.6 ppt. and 1.0 ppt.,
respectively. In the medium term the distribution shifts right but also becomes slightly
more asymmetric, with a mean and median of 5.4 and 3.0 ppt., respectively. In the long
term there is a further shift right, particularly in the upper half of the distribution, with a
mean and median of 8.7 ppt. and 4.9 ppt., respectively.
        Positive skew in the distribution of estimated effects is often interpreted in the
meta analysis literature as evidence of "publication bias", particularly if the positive
effects are imprecisely estimated (see e.g., Stanley and Doucouliagos, 2012). Some
insight into this issue is offered by the "forest plots" in Figures 2a, 2b, and 2c, which
show the cumulative distributions of program estimates at each time horizon, along
with bands representing the standard errors of the estimates. 15
        Inspection of these graphs confirms that the overall distribution of program
effects shifts to the right as the time horizon is extended. At all three horizons there is

14
   In many cases a study reports the impact on the employment rate of the program group but does not
report the employment rate of the comparison group. As discussed below, we need the latter number to
construct effect sizes or proportional impacts on the employment rate.
15
   The distributions are limited to estimates for which we also have an estimate of the associated standard
error. Information on the standard errors of program estimates was not extracted in CKW. Thus, the
estimates are from the latest studies collected in our second round.




                                                    11
also some positive skew in the distribution of estimated effects. Interestingly, however,
the confidence intervals do not appear to be systematically wider for estimates in the
upper or lower tails of the distribution. Instead, there are a handful of positive outliers
in the short and medium term distributions that push the unweighted mean above the
median and the precision-weighted mean.
        Returning to Table 2, columns 4 and 5 also show the mean and median program
effects for estimates that are classified as significantly positive, insignificant, or
significantly negative. As would be expected if differences in sign and significance are
mainly driven by differences in the magnitude of the program estimates – rather than by
differences in the standard errors of the estimates – the mean and median are large and
positive for significant positive estimates, large and negative for significant negative
estimates, and close to zero for insignificant estimates. This pattern is illustrated in
Appendix Figures 2a, 2b, and 2c, where we plot the histograms of estimated effects at
each time horizon, separating the estimates by category of sign and significance. At all
three time horizons, the subgroups of estimates appear to be drawn from distributions
that are centered on different midpoints. This separation suggests that the sign and
significance of an estimate can serve as noisy indicator of the underlying effect.


c. Variation in Average Program Impacts
        Tables 3a and 3b provide a first look at the question of how average ALMP
impacts vary across different types of programs and different participant groups. For
each subset of estimates we show the mean program effects at each time horizon and
the corresponding fraction of program estimates that is significantly positive.
        Focusing first on comparisons across program types (Table 3a), notice that
training and private sector employment programs tend to have small average effects in
the short run, coupled with more positive average impacts in the medium and longer
runs. In contrast, JSA programs and ALMPs in the "other" category have more stable
impacts. These profiles are consistent with the nature of the two broad groups of



                                               12
programs. Participants in training and private subsidy programs often suspend their
normal job search efforts and devote their time to program activities -- a so-called "lock-
in" effect that typically leads to worse outcomes in the immediate post-program period
(see e.g., Ham and Lalonde, 1996).16 Assuming that investments made during the
program period are valuable, however, the outcomes of participants will gradually catch
up with those of the comparison group.17 By comparison, JSA programs and other
programs that include monitoring of search are designed to push participants into the
labor market quickly, with little or no investment component. In the absence of large
returns to recent job experience, it is unlikely that these programs can have large long
run effects.18
        Another clear finding in Table 3a is the relatively poor performance of public
sector employment programs – a result that has been found in other previous analyses
(e.g., Heckman et al., 1999, and CKW).
        Appendix Figure 3a shows how the relative share of different types of ALMPs
have changed over the 30 year period covered by our sample. The shares of training and
JSA programs is relatively stable, while the share of public sector employment programs
has fallen sharply, perhaps reflecting the more negative evaluation results that these
programs have often received.
        Appendix Figure 3b shows the variation over time in our two measures of
program impact. Overall, the sign and significance classifications of short term, medium
term and long term estimates are quite stable over time, with little indication that more
recent programs are more or less likely to show significant positive results. There is


16
   In cases where the program group is drawn from the regular UI system, participants in training and
subsidized employment opportunities are often exempt from search requirements that are imposed on
non-participants -- see e.g. Biewen et al. (2014) for a discussion in the German context.
17
   As noted by Mincer (1974) a similar cross-over pattern is observed in the comparison of earnings
profiles of high school graduates and college graduates.
18
   Evidence on the value of labor market experience for lower skilled workers (Gladden and Taber, 2000;
Card and Hyslop, 2005) suggests that the returns are modest and unlikely to exceed 2 or 3 percent per
year of work.




                                                   13
more variability in the mean impacts on the probability of employment, with some
evidence of an upward trend, particularly for the short and medium term impacts.
       The middle rows of Table 3b compare the distributions of program effects by
participant age group and gender. The results for PPSs which include all age groups are
quite similar to the results for the overall sample, while the results for youth
participants show a mixed pattern, with relatively small average program effects on
employment at all time horizons (columns 4-6), but more evidence of positive long-run
impacts based on sign and significance (columns 7-9). The differences across gender
groups are more systematic and indicate that average estimated program effects are
slightly larger at all time horizons for females (columns 4-6) and have a higher
probability of being significantly positive (columns 7-9).
       Finally, the bottom rows of Table 3b contracts results from evaluations based on
randomized designs and non-experimental designs. The comparisons of mean effects
suggest that experimentally based estimates tend to be larger in the short run and
decline over time, whereas non-experimentally based estimates tend to become larger
(more positive) over time. We caution that these simple "one way" contrasts must be
interpreted carefully, however, because there are multiple sources of potential
heterogeneity in the program impacts. For example, many of the experimental
evaluations focus on JSA programs, whereas many of the non-experimental evaluations
focus on training programs. The meta analysis models in Section IV directly address this
issue using a multivariate regression approach.


d. Profile of Post-Program Impacts
       Simple comparisons across the impact estimates in our sample suggest that
ALMPs have more positive average effects in the medium and longer terms. To verify
that this is actually true for a given program and participant subgroup – and is not
simply an artifact of heterogeneity across studies – we examine the within-PPS
evolution of impact estimates in Table 4.



                                             14
       Columns 1-3 show the changes in estimated program effects on the probability
of employment for the subset of studies for which we observe both short and medium
term estimates, medium and long term estimates, and short and long term estimates,
respectively. Consistent with the simple cross-sectional comparisons, the within-PPS
effects tend to increase as the time horizon is extended from the short run to the
medium run, or from the short run to the long run. The average change between the
medium and longer runs is essentially zero.
       Comparing across program types it is clear that the pattern of rising impacts is
driven by training programs, which show a relatively large gain in estimated program
effects from the short term to the medium term. The patterns for the other types of
programs suggest relatively constant or declining average program effects over the
post-program time horizon. In particular, in contrast to the patterns in Table 3a, there is
no indication of a rise in impacts for private employment subsidy programs over time,
suggesting that the gains in Table 3a may be driven by heterogeneity between studies.
We return to this point below.
       In columns 4-6 we examine the within-study changes in sign and significance for
a broader set of studies. Here, we assign a value of +1 to PPS estimates that change
from insignificant to significantly positive or from significantly negative to insignificant;
-1 to estimates that change from significantly positive to insignificant or from
insignificant to significantly negative; and 0 to estimates that have the same
classification over time. This simple summary points to similar conclusions as the
changes in estimated program effects, though JSA programs show more evidence of a
rise in impacts from the short-run to the medium run in column 4 than the comparison
of estimated effects on the probability of employment in column 1.
       Appendix Tables 1a and 1b present full cross-tabulations of sign/significance at
the various post-program time horizons. As suggested by the simple classification
system used in Table 4, most program estimates either remain in the same category, or
become more positive over time.



                                              15
IV. Meta Analytic Models of Program Impacts
a. Conceptual Framework
        Consider an ALMP evaluation that models an outcome y observed for members
of both a participant group and a comparison group. Let b represent the estimated
impact of the program on the outcomes of the participants from a given evaluation
design, and let β represent the probability limit of b (i.e., the estimate that would be
obtained if the sample size for the evaluation were infinite). Under standard conditions
the estimate b will be approximately normally distributed with mean β and some level
of precision P that depends on both the sample size for the evaluation and the design
features of the study.19 Therefore we can write:
        b = β + P─1/2 z ,                                                                       (1)
where z is a realization from a distribution that will be close to N(0,1) if the sample size
is large enough. The term P─1/2z has the interpretation of the realized sampling error
that is incorporated in b.
        Assume that the limiting program effect associated with a given study (β) can be
decomposed as:
         β = Xα + ε .                                                                           (2)
where α is a vector of coefficients and X captures the observed sources of
heterogeneity in β, arising for example from differences in the type of program or the
gender or age of the program participants. The term ε represents fundamental
heterogeneity in the limiting program effect arising from the particular way a program
was implemented, or specific features of the program or its participants, or the nature
of the labor market environment.



19
  For example, in an experiment with 50% of the sample in the treatment group and no added covariates,
        2      2
P=N/[2σ (1+ δ )], where N is the sample size, σ is the standard deviation of the outcome y in the control
group, and δσ is the standard deviation of the outcome for the program group. In more complex designs
such as difference in differences or instrumental variables the precision will be smaller.




                                                   16
           Equations (1) and (2) lead to a model for the observed program estimates of the
form:
           b = Xα + u ,                                                                (3)
where the error u = ε + P─1/2 z includes both the sampling error in the estimate b and
the unobserved determinants of the limiting program effect for a given study. We use
simple regression models based on equation (3) to analyze the program effects on the
probability of employment that are available in our sample. We interpret these models
as providing descriptive summaries of the variation in average program effects with
differences in the observed characteristics of a given program and participant group in
our sample. Recognizing the structure of the error component in (3) we prefer OLS
estimation, which weights each estimated program effect equally, rather than precision-
weighed estimation, which would be efficient under the assumption that ε=0.20 As we
show below, in contrast to “classical” meta analysis settings where each estimate is
based on a clinical trial of the same drug, the variation in ε appears to be particularly
large for ALMP’s, reflecting the wide range of factors that can potentially cause a
program to be more or less successful.
           For our full sample of program estimates we use (unweighted) ordered probit
(OP) models for the 3-way classification of sign and significance of each estimate. Note
that the t-statistic associated with the estimated impact b is just the ratio of the
estimate to the square root of its estimated sampling variance (which is the inverse of
its estimated precision). Using equation (3), we can therefore write:
           t = P1/2 b
             = P1/2 Xα + z + P1/2 ε .
If the precision P of the estimated program effects is constant across studies and there
are no unobserved determinants of the limiting program effect (i.e., ε=0) the t-statistic
will be normally distributed with mean Xα' where α'= P1/2 α. In this case the


20
     See Solon, Haider and Wooldridge (2015) for a discussion of weighting.




                                                     17
coefficients from an OP model for whether the t statistic is less than -2, between -2 and
2, or greater than 2 (i.e., the sign and significance of the estimated program effects) will
be strictly proportional to the coefficients obtained from a regression model of the
corresponding estimated program effects.
         In our sample the estimated precision of the program estimates varies widely
across studies, and there is clearly unobserved heterogeneity in the impacts. 21
Surprisingly, however, for studies that examine the probability of employment as an
outcome the estimated coefficients from OLS models based on equation (3) and OP
models for sign/significance are very nearly proportional, suggesting that the same
observable factors that tend to raise the estimated program effects also tend to lead to
more positive t statistics. Our interpretation of this pattern is that the sampling error
component of the program estimates is small relative to the variation due to observed
and unobserved heterogeneity, so the t-statistic varies across studies in proportion to
the relative magnitude of the estimated program effect. We therefore use the OP
models to summarize the broader set of program estimates.


b. Basic Models for Program Effect and for Sign and Significance
         Table 5 presents the estimates from a series of regression models for our sample
of estimated program effects on the probability of employment. We pool the effects for
different post-program horizons and include dummies indicating whether the estimate
is for the medium or long term (with short term estimates in the omitted group). The
basic model in column 1 includes only these controls and a set of dummies for the type
of program (with training programs in the omitted category). Consistent with the simple
comparisons in Table 3a, we find that the program estimates are larger in the medium



21
  As can be seen from the varying widths of the confidence intervals in Figures 2a, 2b and 2c, the precision
of the estimated program effects varies widely across studies in our sample. The precision is essentially
uncorrelated with the sample size of the evaluation (correlation = ─0.02), suggesting that studies with
larger sample sizes have more complex econometric designs that offset any potential gains in precision.




                                                    18
and long run, and that public sector employment programs are associated with smaller
program effects.
        The model in column 2 introduces additional controls for the type of participant
and study characteristics, which are reported in Table 7 and discussed below. These
controls slightly attenuate the growth in program effects over longer post-program
horizons and also reduce the magnitude of the JSA program effect from -3.2 ppts. (and
significant) to -0.1 ppts (and insignificant).
        Columns 3-5 introduce a parallel set of models that allow the time profiles of
post-program impacts to vary with the type of program. In these specifications the
"main effects" for each program type show the short term impacts relative to training
programs (the omitted type), while the interactions of program type with medium term
and long term dummies show how the impacts evolve relative to the profile for training
programs (which are summarized by the main effects in the first two rows). We present
models with and without additional controls in columns 3 and 4, and a model with
dummy variables for each participant/program subgroup in column 5. In the latter
specification the "main effects" for the type of program are absorbed by the PPS fixed
effects, but we can still estimate the coefficients for medium and long term effects --
which now measure the evolution of the program effects for the same PPS over
different time horizons -- as well as interactions of the time horizon dummies with the
type of program.
        Three key conclusions emerge from these more flexible specifications. First, as
suggested by the patterns in Table 4, the program impacts for training programs tend to
rise over time, while the effects for job search assistance programs and other programs
(which are obtained by adding the program-type/time horizon interactions to the time
horizon effects in rows 1 and 2) are roughly constant.22 Second, in the models without


22
  To aid in the interpretation of the interacted estimates, Appendix Table 4 presents the implied mean
program effects by program type and time horizon for the models in columns 3 and 4, and the associated
standard errors. Note that by construction the model in column 3 reproduces the means reported in




                                                  19
PPS fixed effects (columns 3 and 4) the implied profile of impacts for private sector
employment programs is relatively similar to the profile for training programs. When
the PPS effects are added, however, the interactions between private sector programs
and both medium term and long term horizon become relatively large and negative --
similar to the interaction effects for JSA and other programs. A third conclusion is that
public sector employment programs appear to be relatively ineffective at all time
horizons.
        We have also estimated models similar to the specifications in Table 5, but using
two alternative measures of program impacts: the estimated "effect size" (the
estimated effect on the employment rate of participants divided by the standard
deviation of employment rates in the comparison group), and the proportional program
effect (the estimated effect for participants divided by the mean employment rate of
the comparison group). These specifications are reported in Appendix Tables 2a and 2b,
respectively, and yield very similar conclusions to the models in Table 5. Essentially,
these alternative choices lead to rescaling of the coefficients of the meta analysis
models with very small changes in the relative magnitudes of different coefficients.
        A limitation of the analysis in Table 5 is that estimated program effects are only
available for 40% of our overall sample. To supplement these models we turn to
ordered probit models for sign and significance. The first 4 columns of Table 6 present a
series of OP models that are parallel to those in Table 5, but fit to our overall sample of
program estimates. The specifications in columns 1 and 3 have no controls other than
dummies for medium and long term horizons and the type of ALMP -- in the latter case
interacting the type of program with the time horizon dummies. Columns 2 and 4
report expanded specifications that add the control variables reported in Table 7.
Column 5 of Table 6 repeats the specification from column 4, but fit to the subsample of


columns 4-6 of Table 3a. For the specification in column 4 of Table 5 we normalize the covariates to have
mean 0 and fit the model without an intercept: thus the mean program effects are interpreted as means
for a program and participant group with the mean characteristics of our sample.




                                                   20
352 program estimates for which we have an estimate of the program effect on the
probability of employment. The model in column 6 reproduces the specification in
column 3, but adding PPS fixed effects. As in the model in the last column of Table 5,
the coefficients in this specification measure the evolution of the factors determining
sign and significance within a given PPS. Finally, column 7 presents estimates from a
linear regression replacing the categorical outcome variable with values of -1, 0, and +1,
also including PPS fixed effects.
         The OP models in Table 6 yield coefficients that are very highly correlated with
the corresponding coefficients from the program effect models in Table 5, but roughly
10 times bigger in magnitude. For example, the correlation of the 14 coefficients from
the specification in column 4 of Table 6 with corresponding coefficients from the
specification in column 4 of Table 5 is 0.84.23 In particular the OP models confirm that
the impacts of job search assistance and other programs tend to fade relative to the
impacts of training programs, and that public sector employment programs are
relatively ineffective at all time horizons, regardless of how the outcomes are measured
in the evaluation.24
         The models including PPS fixed effects in columns 6 (ordered probit) and 7
(linear regression) of Table 6 also imply the same qualitative findings, indicating that
within a given PPS the estimated program effect becomes more positive in the longer
run. The coefficients of the linear regression model are scaled by a factor of
approximately five relative to the ordered probit specification.


c. Participant and Study Characteristics in the Basic Models



23
  The regression model is: OP-coefficient = -0.02 + 10.57 × Effect-coefficient, R-squared = 0.70.
24
  We also fit two simpler probit models for the events of reporting a positive and significant or negative
and significant estimate, reported in Appendix Table 3. As would be expected if the ordered probit
specification is correct, the coefficients from the model for a significantly positive effect are quite close to
the OP coefficients, while the coefficients from the model for a significantly negative effect are close in
magnitude but opposite in sign.




                                                      21
         The estimated coefficients for the extra control variables included in the models
in columns 2, 4 of Table 5 and columns 2, 4, and 5 of Table 6 are reported in Table 7. The
coefficient estimates from the two models for the effects on the probability of
employment (columns 1,2) are quite similar and suggest that the impact of ALMPs varies
systematically with the type of participant (with larger effects for the long term
unemployed), their age group (more negative impacts for older and younger
participants), and their gender (larger effects for females). The estimated program
effects are also somewhat larger for studies estimated on German, Austrian or Swiss
data, but there are no large or significant differences across the other country groups.
         The coefficients from the OP models (columns 3-4) confirm most of these
conclusions about the differential impacts of ALMPs across different participant groups
and different countries.25 In particular, the OLS models for the program effects on the
probability of employment and the OP models for sign and significance show smaller
impacts for young participants and older participants, relative to the impacts on mixed
age groups, and larger impacts for long-term unemployed participants. The OP models
fit to the overall sample (columns 3, 4) also point to a larger positive impact for
disadvantaged participants relative to UI recipients, whereas the program effect models
and the OP models fit to the program effect subsample (column 5) yield an insignificant
coefficient, arguably due to the small number of studies that focus on this group.26


25
  The correlation between the coefficients in columns 2 and 4 of Table 7 is 0.69.
26
  A potentially relevant dimension of program effectiveness concerns the time ALMP participants have
spent in unemployment before entering the program. Biewen et al. (2014) investigate this issue using
three strata to estimate treatment effects: 1-3 months, 4-6 months, and 7-12 months of unemployment,
respectively. For longer training programs (mean duration of 226 days) the estimated short-term impacts
and standard errors for the three strata are 0.00 (0.04), 0.00 (0.04), 0.08 (0.40) for males, and 0.06 (0.03),
-0.01 (0.045), -0.04 (0.02) for females; medium-term impacts are 0.05 (0.03), 0.07 (0.04), 0.09 (0.045) for
males, and 0.06 (0.03), 0.11 (0.05), 0.09 (045) for females. These results show some indication that
program participants from strata with longer elapsed unemployment durations benefit more than other
groups. This result is in line with the findings from our stratification of program intake group into short-
term unemployed (“UI recipients”), long-term unemployed, and participants without benefit entitlement
(“disadvantaged”). A more detailed investigation of this issue within the meta-analysis framework is not
possible, since the primary studies rarely report information on elapsed time in unemployment before
program start.




                                                     22
         One notable difference between the program effect models and the OP models
concerns the relative impact of ALMPs on female participants. In the OLS program effect
models the estimated coefficients for female participants are around 0.04 to 0.05 in
magnitude, and statistically significant at conventional levels (with t statistics around 2).
In the OP models, by comparison, the corresponding coefficients are relatively small in
magnitude and far from significant. Further investigation reveals that this divergence is
driven by the upper tail of program effect estimates for female participants (see
Appendix Figure 4), and in particular by the relatively large estimated effects for female
PPSs that show a significant positive effect.27 This upper tail does not appear to be
driven by a few outliers, but instead reflects a systematically higher probability of
estimating a large positive effect when the participant group is limited to females.28
         An interesting aspect of the OP models is the pattern of coefficients associated
with the choice of dependent variable, reported in the top rows of Table 7. These
coefficients show that studies modeling the hazard rate of exiting the benefit system or
the probability of unemployment are significantly more likely to report positive findings
than studies modeling employment (the omitted category) or earnings.29
         The models summarized in Table 7 also control for the duration of the program,
using a simple dummy variable for whether the program lasted longer than 9 months.
Program duration can be seen as a rough proxy for the cost of the program, as
information on cost effectiveness is very sparse in most of the surveyed studies. Our
estimates do not indicate any systematic advantage for longer programs -- indeed
across all the specifications the coefficient is negative, though statistically insignificant.

27
   The median and 75th percentiles of the effect size distribution for female participant groups,
conditional on a positive impact, are 0.25, and 0.46 respectively. By comparison, the corresponding
statistics for the combined male and mixed gender participant groups are 0.15, and 0.27.
28
   We also estimated separate program effect models for different types of participants -- those from the
regular UI system versus long term unemployed or disadvantaged groups. We found a significant positive
coefficient for female participants in the models for both UI recipients and the long term unemployed.
29
   Estimates from interacted models that allow different effects of the dependent variable at different
time horizons (not reported in the table) show that the positive coefficient associated with the use of exit
hazards is largely confined to short term impacts.




                                                    23
d. Randomized versus Non-Experimental Designs
       A longstanding concern in the ALMP literature (e.g., Ashenfelter, 1987) is the
unreliability of non-experimental estimators. This concern led to a series of large scale
experiments in the U.S. designed to test job training programs (Bloom et al., 1997;
Schochet, Burghardt, and Glazerman, 2001) and a large literature comparing
experimental and non-experimental estimates for the same program (e.g., Lalonde,
1986; Smith and Todd, 2005).
       One simple way to assess these concerns is to compare the magnitudes of the
estimated effects from papers based on experimental designs to those from non-
experimental designs. To do this, we include a simple indicator for an experimental
design in the models in Table 7. In the program effect models (columns 1 and 2) the
coefficient of the dummy is very small in magnitude (less than 1.0 ppt) and
insignificantly different from zero. Likewise, in the main OP models (columns 3-4) the
coefficient is small in magnitude. It is a little larger in magnitude when the OP models
are restricted to the set of studies with estimated program effects (column 5) but
relatively imprecise, perhaps reflecting the relatively large number of parameters
included in the model relative to the sample size or the uneven distribution of
experimental evaluations across program types. We conclude from this analysis that
there is little or no evidence that results from experimentally-based designs in the
recent ALMP literature are "less positive" or "less significant" than results from non-
experimental designs.


e. Publication Bias and p-hacking
       A related concern, widely discussed in the meta analysis literature (e.g.,
Rothstein, Sutton, and Borenstein, 2005) is that the set of estimated program impacts in
the available literature contain a systematic positive bias, either because analysts only
write up and circulate studies that show a positive effect (so-called file drawer bias) or



                                            24
because they choose specifications that tend to yield positive and significant effects (so-
called p-hacking).
        A standard way to look for evidence of publication bias is to examine funnel
plots of the relationship between the estimated program effects and their precision
(Sutton et al., 2000). Figures 3a, 3b, and 3c present these plots for the program effects
for employment in our sample, restricting attention (as in Figures 2a-2c) to estimates
that have a corresponding sampling error available. For reference, we also show the
boundaries of the “t=2” relationship in each graph.30 Contrary to the inverted funnel
pattern typically uncovered in the meta analysis literature (e.g., Doucouliagos and
Stanley, 2009; Havranek, 2015; Wolfson and Belman, 2015), there is a lot of dispersion
in the estimated program effects at all three time horizons, even among studies with
high levels of precision, suggesting that the variation in the estimates is not just a result
of sampling error.
        A more formal test for publication bias is to regress the estimated program
effect from a given study and specification on the associated sampling error of the
estimate and other potential control variables. Using the notation of Section IVa, the
regression model is:
                          b = Xα + θ P─1/2 + ν                                          (4)
where ν represents a residual. The estimate of θ is interpreted as a test for asymmetry
in the funnel plot relationship between the estimated program effects and their
precision: if the sample contains more imprecisely estimated large positive effects than
large negative effects, θ will be positive. Stanley (2008) suggests that the model be
estimated by weighted least squares, using the precision of each estimate (i.e., its
inverse sampling variance) as a weight. If sampling error is the only source of residual
variation in (4) this will lead to efficient estimates.

   Since t= P b, the “t=2” relationship is P= 4/b which is a pair of hyperbolas centered around the y axis
in a funnel plot.




                                                    25
        Estimation results for this model are presented in Table 8. We present
estimates from four specifications estimated by unweighted OLS and precision-weighted
least squares.31 The results give no indication of publication bias. The unweighted
estimate in column 3, for example, which is based on a model that includes our richest
set of controls, implies that a study with a 1 percentage point larger standard error for
the estimated program effect on the probability of employment will have about a 0.01
percent point larger estimated program effect. The corresponding weighted estimate
suggests a slightly larger 0.03 percent point larger estimate, but is less precise.
        We suspect that there are at least two explanations for the apparent lack of
publication bias in the ALMP literature. The first is that ALMP evaluations are often
conducted in close co-operation with the agencies that operate the programs. In such
settings researchers cannot simply shelve papers that show small or "wrong signed"
impacts. They may also find it hard to choose among specifications to obtain a more
positive program effect. A second factor is that referees and other researchers have no
strong presumption that ALMP's necessarily "work", or that a finding of a negative or
insignificant effect is uninteresting, since many important papers in the field (e.g.,
Lalonde, 1986; Heckman and Hotz, 1989) report small or negative impacts of ALMPs.
        Our models also control for two other features of a study that may be
informative about the presence of publication bias: whether it was published, and the
number of citations it received (measured from a Google Scholar search in Spring
2015).32 The coefficients associated with both variables (shown in Table 7) are small
and insignificant across all specifications, confirming that there is no tendency for more
positive studies to be published or to be more highly cited.


f. Are Some Programs Better (or Worse) for Different Participant Groups?

31
   The estimated precision of the estimates in our sample ranges from 0.026 to over 50,000. To stabilize
the estimates we Winsorize the precision weights at the 10th and 90th percentiles.
32
   To account for lags in the citation process we model citations as the rank within the distribution of
citations for papers written in the same year.




                                                   26
           A longstanding question in the ALMP literature is whether certain participant
groups are "better matched" to specific types of programs (for an analysis in the
German context see Biewen et al. 2007). We address this in Table 9, which presents
separate models for the program effects from different types of ALMPs.
           As a benchmark column 1 presents a baseline specification fit to all 5 program
types, with dummies for the program types (not reported) and controls for the intake
group, the gender group, and the age group.33 The (omitted) base group is comprised of
mixed gender and age groups from the regular UI rolls. In this pooled specification the
estimated effects for females and long term unemployed participants are significantly
positive, while the coefficient for older participants is significantly negative, and the
coefficient for young participants is negative and marginally significant.
           Columns 2-6 report estimates for the same specification (minus the controls for
the type of program) fit separately to the estimated effects for each of the 5 program
types. Comparisons across these models suggest that long-term unemployed
participants benefit relatively more from "human capital" programs (i.e., training and
private sector employment), and relatively less from "work first" programs (i.e., job
search and other programs). In contrast, disadvantaged participants appear to benefit
more from work first programs and less from human capital programs. Female
participants also appear to benefit relatively more from training and private sector
subsidy programs, while the relative effects for youths and older participants are not
much different across the program types.
           Overall these results suggest that there may be potential gains to matching
specific participant groups to specific types of programs, though the small sample sizes
for most of the program types must be noted. Attempts to expand the power of the
analysis by using OP models for the sign and significance of the program estimates lead




33
     This is a simplified version of the specification reported in column 2 of Table 5 and column 1 of Table 7.




                                                       27
to generally similar conclusions as the program effect models reported in Table 9 with
only modest gains in precision.


g. Effects of Cyclical Conditions
        Another longstanding question in the ALMP literature is whether programs are
more (or less) effective in different cyclical environments.34 One view is that active
programs are less effective in a depressed labor market because participants have to
compete with other, more advantaged workers for a limited set of jobs. An alternative
view is that ALMPs are more effective in weak labor markets because employers
become more selective in a slack market, increasing the value of an intervention that
makes workers more job-ready.
        Three previous studies have investigated ALMP effectiveness over the business
cycle. Kluve (2010) uses between-country variation in a small European meta data set,
while Lechner and Wunsch (2009) and Forslund et al. (2011) analyze programs in
Germany and Sweden, respectively. All three studies suggest a positive correlation
between ALMP effectiveness and the unemployment rate.
        To provide some new evidence we added two alternative contextual variables to
our analysis, representing the average growth rate of GDP and the average
unemployment rate during the years the treatment group participated in the program.
Since growth rates and unemployment rates vary widely across countries, we also
introduced a set of country dummies that absorb any permanent differences in labor
market conditions across countries. The effect of these dummies is interesting in its own
right because the shares of different program types and participant groups also vary
widely across countries, leading to the possibility of bias in the measured effects of
program types and participant groups if there are unobserved country specific factors
that affect the average success of ALMPs in different countries.

34
 A related question is whether program externalities are bigger or smaller in weak or strong labor
markets. This is addressed in the experiment conducted by Crepon et al. (2013).




                                                   28
       The results of our analysis are summarized in Table 10. For reference column 1
presents a benchmark specification identical to the simplified model in column 1 of
Table 9. Column 2 presents the same specification with the addition of 37 country
dummies. The addition of these dummies leads to some modest but interesting
changes in the estimated coefficients in the meta analysis model. Most notably, the
coefficients associated with job search assistance (JSA) and "other" programs both
become more negative, indicating that these programs tend to be more widely used in
countries where all forms of ALMPs are relatively successful.
       Column 3 presents a model that includes the control for average GPD growth
rate during the program period. The coefficient is negative and marginally significant
(t=1.7) providing suggestive evidence that ALMPs work better in recessionary markets. A
model that controls for the average unemployment rate shows the same tendency
(coefficient = 0.006, standard error = 0.007) though the effect is less precise.
       A concern with the specification in column 3 is that the average number of
program estimates per country is small (many countries have only 2 or 3 estimates)
leading to potential over-fitting. To address this, we estimated the models in columns 4-
6, using only data from the four countries that account for the largest numbers of
program estimates - Denmark (17 estimates), France (20 estimates), Germany (147
estimates) and the U.S. (16 estimates). As shown in column 4, our baseline specification
yields coefficient estimates that are quite similar to the estimates from the entire
sample, though the relative impacts of JSA and other programs are more negative in
these 4 countries.
       Columns 5 and 6 present models that add the average GDP growth rate and the
average unemployment rate, respectively, to this baseline model. These specifications
suggest relatively important cyclical effects on ALMP effectiveness. For example,
comparing two similar programs operating in labor markets with a 3 percentage point
gap in growth rates, the program in the slower growth environment would be expected
to have a 0.1 larger program effect.



                                             29
       To illustrate the variation driving the results in columns 5 and 6, Figure 4 plots
the annual GDP growth rate in Germany along with the mean program effects in
different years, grouping program estimates by the year that the program was first
operated. We also show the number of program estimates for each year, which varies
substantially over time. The figure shows the counter-cyclical pattern of program effects
is mainly driven by large positive effects of programs implemented in the early 2000s
during a period of slow growth.
       Although policy makers have to decide whether to increase spending for active
programs and enroll more participants knowing only current business cycle conditions, it
is also of interest how labor market conditions at the time of program completion are
related to the program effects. In Appendix Table 5 we estimate alternative
specifications that control for the GDP growth rate and unemployment rate at the
beginning and after the end of the program period. These estimates suggest that ALMP
programs tend to be particularly successful if participants are enrolled in a program
during a downturn and exit the program during a period of favorable economic
conditions.
       While the evidence in Table 10 suggests a countercyclical pattern of program
effectiveness, it is worth emphasizing that the explanation for this pattern is less clear. It
is possible that the value of a given program is higher in a recessionary environment. It
is also possible, however, that the characteristics of ALMP participants, or of the
programs themselves, change in a way that contributes to a more positive impact in a
slow-growth/high-unemployment environment.


V. Summary and Conclusions
       We have assembled and analyzed a new sample of impact estimates from 207
studies of active labor market policies. Building on our earlier study (CKW), we argue
that it is important to distinguish between impacts at various time horizons since
completion of the program, and to consider how the time profile of impacts varies by



                                             30
the type of ALMP. We also study the importance of participant heterogeneity, and look
for evidence that specific subgroups may benefit more or less from particular types of
programs. Finally, we study how the state of the labor market affects the measured
effectiveness of ALMPs.
       With regard to the impacts of different types of ALMPs, we find that the time
profiles of "work first" style programs that offer job search assistance or incentives to
enter work quickly differ from the profiles of "human capital" style training programs
and public sector employment programs. Human capital programs have small (or in
some cases even negative) short term impacts, coupled with larger impacts in the
medium or longer run (2-3 years after completion of the program), whereas the impacts
from work first programs are more stable. We also confirm that public sector
employment programs have negligible, or even negative program impacts at all time
horizons.
       With regard to different participant groups, we find that female participants and
those drawn from the pool of long term unemployed tend to have larger program
effects than other groups. In contrast, the program estimates for youths and older
workers are typically less positive than for other groups. We also find indications of
potential gains to matching different participant groups to specific programs, with
evidence that work first programs are relatively more successful for disadvantaged
participants, whereas human capital programs are more successful for the long term
unemployed.
       With regard to the state of the labor market, we find that ALMPs tend to have
larger impacts in periods of slow growth and higher unemployment. In particular, we
find a relatively large cyclical component in the program estimates from four countries
that account for one-half of our sample. We also find suggestive evidence that human
capital programs are more cyclically sensitive than work first programs.
       Our findings on the relative efficacy of human capital programs for long term
unemployed, and on the larger impacts of these programs in recessionary



                                            31
environments, point to a potentially important policy lesson. As noted by Krueger, Judd
and Cho (2014) and Kroft et al. (2016), the number of long term unemployed rises
rapidly as a recession persists. This group has a high probability of leaving the labor
force, risking permanent losses in the productive capacity of the economy. One policy
response is countercyclical job training programs and private employment subsidies,
which are particularly effective for the longer-term unemployed in a recessionary
climate.
       Methodologically, we find a number of interesting patterns in the recent ALMP
literature. We find that the estimated impacts derived from randomized controlled
trials, which account for one-fifth of our sample, are not much different on average
from the non-experimental estimates. We also find no evidence of "publication bias" in
the relationship between the magnitude of the point estimates from different studies
and their corresponding precision. We do find that the choice of outcome variable used
in the evaluation matters, with a tendency toward more positive short term impact
estimates from studies that model the time to first job than from studies that model the
probability of employment or the level of earnings.
       Finally, we conclude that meta analytic models based on the sign and
significance of the program impacts lead to very similar conclusions as models based on
program effects. We argue that this arises because much of the variation in the sign and
significance of estimated impacts across studies in the ALMP literature is driven by
variation in estimated program effects, rather than by variation in the corresponding
sampling errors of the estimates.

Note: see text for description of sample. Study refers to an article or unpublished paper. PPS refers to a
program/participant subgroup (e.g., a job search assistance program for mixed gender youths). Estimate refers
to an estimate of the effect of the program on the participant subgroup at either a short‐term (<1 year after
completion of the program), medium term (1‐2 years post completion) or long term (2+ years post completion)
time horizon. A9Job search assistance programs include sanction programs. "Other" programs include those
that combine elements of the four distinct types.

Notes: Change in estimated effect size in column 1 represents the difference between the estimated medium term and short term effects on the
probability of employment for a given program and participant subgroup (PPS). Changes in columns 2 and 3 are defined analogously. Change in
sign/significance in column 4 is defined as +1 if the short term estimate is significantly negative and the medium term estimate is insignificant, or if the
short term estimate is insignificant and the medium term estimate is significantly positive; 0 if the sign and significance of the short term and medium
term estimates is the same; and -1 if the short term estimate is significantly positive and the medium term estimate is insignificant, or if the short term
estimate is insignificant and the medium term estimate is significantly negative. Changes in columns 5 and 6 are defined analogously. Standard
deviations (clustered by study number) in parenthesis.

Notes: Sample size is 857 program estimates, except column 5, which is based on 352 estimates for which
program effect on probability of employment is also available. Standard errors (clustered by study) in
parentheses. Models in columns 1‐6 are ordered probits, fit to ordinal data with value of +1 for significantly
positive, 0 for insignificant, ‐1 for significantly negative estimate. Estimated cutpoints (2 per model) are not
reported in the Table. Coefficients of additional control variables are reported in Table 7. Model in column 6 is
estimated with fixed effects controlling for program participant subgroups. Model in column 7 is a linear
regression with fixed effects for program participant subgroups.

Notes: Entry in each row and column corresponds to estimated coefficient of sampling error of estimated
program effect from a different specification. Models in column 1 include only a constant and dummies for
medium term and long term time horizon as additional controls; models in columns 2, 3 and 4 include same
controls included in specifications in columns 2, 4 and 5 of Table 5, respectively. Unweighted models are fit by
OLS. Precision‐weighted models are fit by weighted least squares using Winsorized inverse sampling variance
of estimated program effect as weight. Weight is Winsorized at 10th and 90th percentiles, respectively,
corresponding to values of 19.2 and 10000, respectively. Standard errors, clustered by study, in parentheses.
