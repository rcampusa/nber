External Imbalances in an Advanced, Commodity-Exporting Country: The Case of New Zealand

                                             ABSTRACT

During the last three years New Zealand has faced increasingly large external imbalances. The current
account deficit has increased from 4.3% of GDP in 2003 to almost 9.0% of GDP in 2005. During
the same period the countrys net international investment position (NIIP) went from a negative level
equivalent to 78.5% of GDP to negative 89% of GDP. In this paper I analyze the potential consequences
of New Zealands external imbalances. More specifically, I investigate what is the probability that
New Zealand will undergo a costly adjustment characterized by an abrupt and large current account
reversal. I find that to an important extent the (very) negative NIIP and (very) large current account
deficit may be explained by New Zealands very close economic relationship with Australia. The
econometric results suggest that the rapid growth in the deficit during the last few years has (greatly)
increased New Zealands vulnerability to contagion. It has also increased the advantage of the countrys
current floating exchange rate regime.

I. Introduction

        During the last three years New Zealand has faced increasingly large external
imbalances. 1 The current account deficit has increased from 4.3% of GDP in 2003 to
almost 9.0% of GDP in 2005. During the same period the country’s net international
investment position (NIIP) has gone from a negative level equivalent to 78.5% of GDP to
negative 89% of GDP. Also, some of the most important macroeconomic variables –
including interest rates and the exchange rate – have experienced a higher degree of
volatility than in other commodity countries such as Australia and Canada. Much of the
growth in New Zealand’s external imbalances has been fuelled by a rapid real estate
boom that has allowed consumers to withdraw significant amounts of money from their
homes’ equities, and increase consumption.2 These developments have generated
concerns among experts and observers. According to a recent article in the Financial
Times (March 31st, 2006, emphasis added):


        “Countries with large external imbalances such as Iceland and New Zealand, as
        well as Hungry…Turkey, Australia and South Africa, are seen as most vulnerable
        as foreign investors head for the exits.”3


        In an effort to cool down the economy, and to reign-in the rapid growth of
housing prices, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has raised its official policy interest
rate (the OCR) several times since January 2003. At 7.25%, New Zealand currently has
one of the highest policy interest rates in the world. According to JP Morgan’s Global
Data Watch, in mid-2006, only Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippines and Turkey, among all
large countries monitored by the investment banks, had higher policy interest rates than
New Zealand.
        Although during the last few months the macroeconomic picture has changed
somewhat – the NZD has weakened and increases in housing prices have moderated – a

number of important policy questions remain. Perhaps the most important one is whether
the very large current account deficit of 9% of GDP is sustainable. If it is not – as many
analysts have argued --, the next question is how will adjustment look like. Will it be
smooth and gradual, and thus with little or no real costs? Or, will it be abrupt and severe?
Another way of putting this issue is whether New Zealand faces a (relatively) high
probability of experiencing a “sudden stop” in capital inflows, and an abrupt reversal in
the current account deficit.4
         Other important policy issues are related to the relationship between economic
policy and external imbalances. In particular, has macroeconomic policy contributed to
the creation of these external disequilibria? And, has monetary policy lost some of its
power in the last few years? This latter question emerges from the fact that, in spite of
the increase in the OCR policy rate by 225 basis points between January 2004 and
December 2005, longer term rates – including interest rates on mortgages -- have barely
changed. A central question, thus, is whether New Zealand should contemplate some
changes in its monetary policy framework, and/or on monetary policy implementation.
Other specific questions that have emerged from recent economic developments and
debates include:


     •   Is the higher volatility in exchange rates and interest rates observed in New
         Zealand the result of a lack of synchronization between the New Zealand
         business cycle and the business cycle in the major economies (e.g. the G-3), or is
         it a reflection of structural weaknesses in New Zealand, including the fact that it
         is a very small, very open, commodity-exporting economy?
     •   Does the close economic relationship between New Zealand and Australia play a
         role in explaining the large and persistent imbalances?
     •   Should a small country such as New Zealand adopt the Greenspan view on asset
         prices, and ignore a property boom when conducting monetary policy?




4
  The most recent IMF reports on New Zealand ask wheterh the current account poses macroeconomic risks
to New Zealand; IMF (2006a, 2006b). On “sudden stops” and external adjustment see, for example,
Edwards (2004) and Calvo et al (2004).
                                              3


       The purpose of this paper is to analyze the potential consequences of New
Zealand’s external imbalances. A particularly important issue addressed in the paper is
the possible nature of future external adjustments. More specifically, I investigate what
is the probability that New Zealand will undergo a costly adjustment characterized by an
abrupt and large current account reversal. This is an important question, since, as I argue
in Section II, there are strong indications that the current magnitude of the external
imbalance in New Zealand is not sustainable through time. In order to achieve
sustainability, the current account deficit will have to decline by 3 to % percentage points
of GDP. It makes a difference whether this adjustment is gradual or abrupt; there is
ample evidence that suggests that abrupt current account adjustments (or reversals) are
costly, in terms of lower GDP growth. I deal with the question of the probability of
experiencing an abrupt adjustment in the following way: I analyze the main
characteristics of countries that in the past have suffered “sudden stops” and abrupt
current account reversals. More specifically, I use random-effect probit models to
estimate the determinants of the probability of experiencing a major reversal. Once that
is done, I estimate the estimated probability of reversals using New Zealand specific data
at different points in time: I compute this probability using New Zealand data for the
early 2000s -- when the current account deficit was 2.8% of GDP, a figure slightly lower
than what many analysts consider to be sustainable -- and 2006, when the current account
deficit is expected to be 9& of GDP. This exercise allows me to evaluate whether,
according to this model, the probability of New Zealand experiencing an abrupt and
costly reversal has increased significantly in the last few years. The paper also deals with
monetary policy and its effectiveness in a context of large external deficits.
       The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section II I analyze the evolution
of New Zealand’s current account balances during the last two decades (the starting point
of the analysis is 1985, when the NZD was floated). I deal with real exchange rate
trends, and with the evolution of different external accounts. I focus on the recent
evolution of New Zealand’s net international investment position (NIIP), and I discuss
some recent computations on the sustainable level for New Zealand’s current account. In
Section III I provide an international comparative analysis of New Zealand’s current
account balance. I show that the persistence and magnitude of New Zealand’s deficit has
                                                    4


virtually no comparison in the world. I also provide some computations on the
consolidated current account deficit of Australia-New Zealand. I show that although this
consolidated deficit is still large from an international perspective, it is smaller than the
current New Zealand deficit. Section IV asks whether New Zealand’s large external
imbalances should be a cause for concern. Recent evidence presented in Calvo et al
(2004), Edwards (2004, 2004a, 2005a, 2005b) and Frankel and Cavallo (2004) suggests
that countries that experience sudden declines in capital inflows and/or abrupt current
account reversals have suffered significant reductions in the rate of economic growth. In
this section I use a multi-country data set to evaluate the probability that New Zealand
will face an abrupt reversal in its current account in the near future. Finally, in Section V
I offer some concluding remarks. In this concluding section I touch briefly on other
policy options, including the merits of New Zealand and Australia having a common
currency.


II.     Twenty Years of Current Account Balances and the Exchange Rate Behavior
in New Zealand
        In this section I analyze the evolution of New Zealand’s current account and trade
weighted real exchange rate. The analysis starts with 1985, the year New Zealand
adopted a floating exchange rate. The section is divided in three parts: 5 First,
(Subsection II.1) I discuss the evolution of the real exchange rate (RER) and current
account during the last two decades. I argue that it is possible to divide the last twenty
years of RER behavior into seven distinct phases. Second, in Subsection II.2, I discuss
the most recent data on New Zealand’s current account, including its sources of
financing. Here I point out that in New Zealand, as opposed to the U.S. for example, the
income account (which measures net interest, dividend, profits remittances and transfers
to the rest of the world) has been the main source of disequilibria. More recently,
however, New Zealand has experienced an important deterioration in its trade account
balance. In Subsection II.3 I deal with the recent evolution of New Zealand’s net
international investment position.

   An interesting question – but one that is beyond the scope of this paper – is to compare exchange rate
volatility (both unconditional and conditional) in New Zealand to that of other commodity currencies such
as the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar.

II.1   The Current Account Deficit and Seven Phases of Real Exchange Rate
Behavior in New Zealand
       In Figure 1 I present quarterly data for New Zealand’s current account balance as
percentage of GDP, as well as on the evolution of the trade-weighted index of the NZ
dollar real exchange rate for the period 1985-2005. In this Figure – as in the rest of this
paper --, an increase in the RER index represents a real exchange rate appreciation, while
a decline in the index captures a depreciating trend. Several interesting features emerge
from Figure 1:


           •     First, it shows that deficits have been a “normal” state of affairs in New
                 Zealand for the last 20 years. In fact, going back for another ten years,
                 one finds that in the second half of the 1970s current account deficits
                 exceeded the 12% of GDP mark!
           •     Second, this Figure shows that while recent deficits have been very large
                 indeed – in the order of 9% of GDP in late 2005 --, they have historical
                 precedents. Current account deficits reached that level (briefly) in early
                 1986.
           •     Third, in the last twenty years there have been four episodes of
                 retrenchment in the current account deficit.
                    o The first of these retrenchment episodes took place between March
                         1986 and March 1989, when the deficit shrunk from 8.7% of GDP
                         to a mere 0.7% of GDP; this has been one of the largest current
                         account reversals in the modern economic history of advanced
                         countries.
                    o The second external adjustment episode was brief and modest, and
                         occurred between June 1990 and December 1991, when the deficit
                         went from 4.2 to 2.8% of GDP.
                    o The third retrenchment was in the September 1997-June 1999
                         period; the deficit declined from 6.7 to 4.0% of GDP.
                                             6


                  o And the final deficit reduction episode took place during June 2000
                        and December 2001, when the deficit declined from 6.5% to 2.8%
                        of GDP.
           •   It is interesting to note that two of the current account retrenchment
               episodes discussed above were significant, exceeding 3.5% of GDP; these
               adjustment episodes, however, were stretched over a period of several
               years.
           •   Figure 1 also shows that during the period under study the RER index
               experienced significant movements: its mean was 91.0, its minimum 71.3,
               and its maximum was 108.0. The standard deviation of the RER index
               was 8.9.
           •   Figure 1 shows a pattern of mild negative correlation between the trade-
               weighted real value of the NZ dollar and the current account balance.
               Periods of strong dollar have, overall, tended to coincide with periods of
               (larger) current account deficits. The contemporaneous coefficient of
               correlation between the (log of the) RER index and the current account
               balance is –0.22; when lead-lag structures are considered, the correlation
               coefficient declines. This correlation between the trade weighted value of
               the currency and the current account is lower in New Zealand than in the
               U.S., where the contemporaneous correlation coefficient is -0.53, and the
               three quarters lagged correlation is -0.60. This may be explained by the
               fact that in New Zealand the main component of the current account
               deficit is the incomes account, while in the U.S. it is the trade account. In
               New Zealand the simple contemporaneous correlation between the (log of
               the) real exchange rate and the trade account to GDP ratio is -0.41.


       An analysis of the data in Figure 1 indicates that it is possible to distinguish seven
distinct phases in New Zealand dollar real exchange rate behavior for the twenty-year
period 1985-2005. A brief analysis of these seven phases provides a summary of the
history of New Zealand’s external sector since the inception of floating in 1985:
                                      7


•   Phase I: March 1985-December 1985. This phase was very short and
    includes the early months of floating. It was characterized by a steep
    accumulated appreciation of the NZD of 17.3%. During this short phase the
    current account deficit was very large.
•   Phase II: December 85-December 86. This was also a very short phase.
    During these 12 months the NZD experienced a 9.4% cumulative
    depreciation. During this phase the current account deficit began to decline.
•   Phase III: December 1986-June 1988. This is the last of the “short” phases
    that occurred during the early years of floating. During this period the NZD
    real exchange rate experienced a rapidly appreciating trend. The trough-to-
    peak change in the index was 22.3%. Real exchange rate volatility –
    measured as the standard deviation of the monthly log differences of the RER
    index – was 0.023. Interestingly, during this phase the NZD strengthen in real
    terms at the same time as the current account deficit was declining in a very
    significant fashion.
•   Phase IV: June-1988-March 1993. This is the first of four “long” phases in
    RER behavior; it is a depreciating phase. As may be seen from Figure 1,
    between December 1988 and September 1990 the RER was quite stable,
    having reached a (temporary) plateau of sorts. At that point, however, the
    depreciating trend resumed. The peak-to-trough accumulated change in the
    trade weighted RER index during this period was -22.4%. During the early
    part of this Phase the current account deficit widened. Starting in late 1990,
    however, the deficit stabilized at slightly below the 4% of GDP mark. During
    this period the standard deviation of the monthly log differences of the RER
    index was 0.022.
•   Phase V: March 1993-Match 1997. This is phase is characterized by a
    trough-to-peak real exchange rate appreciation of 28.9%. The strengthening
    of the currency was accompanied by a significant widening of the current
    account deficit. Interestingly, during this phase real exchange rate volatility
    declined significantly; the standard deviation of the monthly log differences of
    the RER index was 0.011. This is significantly lower than (real) exchange
                                              8


           rate volatility in other commodity countries such as Canada and Australia
           (Edwards 2006).
       •   Phase VI: March 1997-December 2000. This is phase is characterized by a
           trough-to-peak real exchange rate depreciation of 32.4%. During the early
           part of this phase the current account deficit retrenched to 3.9% of GDP in
           December 1998. It then widened until it reached 6.5% in June 2000. During
           this period unconditional real exchange rate volatility increased to 0.023.
       •   Phase VII: December 2000-December 2005: This phase lasted the longest.
           During this period the real exchange rate appreciated by an impressive 51.5%,
           and real exchange rate volatility increased to 0.029. From the third quarter of
           2001 through December of 2005 the current account deficit increased steadily
           from 2.8% of GDP to almost 9% of GDP. During this phase the real
           exchange rate index experienced its highest degree of volatility, with a
           standard deviation of the log difference of 0.033.


II.2 Decomposing the Current Account Balance
       Data Decomposition: In Figure 2 I go beyond the current account, and I present
data from 1987 through 2004 for: (a) the balance of trade of goods and services as a
percentage of GDP; (b) the income account, also as a percentage of GDP, and (d) the
transfers account as a percentage of GDP.
       A number of important facts emerge from these figures. First, as Panel A shows,
until September 2004 the trade account was mostly in surplus. There were only two brief
periods (in 1990 and 1999-2000) when there were small deficits – below 1% of GDP.
However, since December 2004 (and until the time of this writing) the trade deficit has
increased significantly, reaching its highest level since the adoption of floating exchange
rates. This recent emergence and prominence of the trade deficit suggests that in the
recent years there may have been a structural change in macroeconomic relations in New
Zealand. The recent work by Kim, Hall and Buckle (2004) and Munro and Sethi (2006)
suggest that a structural change in the economy’s ability to “smooth consumption,” may
indeed have occurred. I discuss this issue in greater detail in Section IV of this paper.
                                                     9


        Second, as may be seen in Figure 2.B, the incomes account has experienced very
large deficits, and throughout most of the period under study it explains, more than fully,
the current account deficit. Only in the last year or so the income account deficit has
been lower than the overall current account deficit. The historically very large deficit in
the income account in New Zealand is a reflection of the very large negative NIIP, a
subject that I discuss in some detail in Subsection II.3. An important question, and one
that I explore below, is to whether New Zealand’s large negative incomes account
balance is related to the close economic ties between New Zealand and Australia.
        Finally, Panel C in Figure 2 shows that the transfer account has exhibited a
relatively stable surplus throughout the period under study.
        The Evolution of Savings and the Current Account: The worsening in the trade
balance since, approximately 2002, coincides with a significant decline in net household
savings; this, in turn, has been associated to a rapid increase in housing prices.6 In Figure
3 I present data on the evolution of net savings for the period 1972-2005.7 Several trends
are apparent from this Figure. Net national savings have experienced a declining trend.
While during the early 1970s net national savings hovered around the 6% of GDP mark,
during the last few years they have averaged less than 4% of GDP. More impressive
than this, however, is the fact that (net) household savings have declined very drastically
since the mid 1990s, and in particular since 2002. This rapid collapse in household
savings has been partially offset by a rapid increase in government savings – which have
recently surpassed 6% of GDP – and by a recovery of corporate savings since the mid
1990s. As pointed out above, the drastic decline in household savings has been related to
a rapid increase in housing prices and, thus, in household wealth (See Robinson, Scobie,
Hallinan, 2006)). It is precisely for this reason that a number of analysts have argued that
a moderation in New Zealand’s current account deficit will require a decline in housing
prices.8 This situation has also prompted the question of whether the Reserve Bank of
New Zealand should explicitly take into account real estate prices when conducting

monetary policy.9 In the light of low savings, a significant fraction of expenditure
financing has taken place through the offshore capital market, via the issuance of New
Zealand dollar denominated bonds – sometimes referred as Eurokiwis, NZD Eurobonds,
and NZD Uridashis.10


II.3 The Evolution of New Zealand’s Net International Investment Position and the
Financing of Recent Current Account Deficits
        The counterpart to the large current account deficits of the last thirty years has
been an increasingly negative Net International Investment Position (NIIP). Figure 4
presents the evolution of New Zealand’s NIIP since 1970. The data have been taken
from Lane and Milesi-Ferreti (2006); when alternative New Zealand data sources are
used the results are similar: For instance according to New Zealand official statistics the
in the period 2001-2005 the NIIP was -76%, -80%, -79%, -82%, and -86%, respectively.
These figures are not very different from those depicted in Figure 3.11 Table 1 provides
greater detail on the recent evolution of the NIIP, as well as of its most important
components; naturally, the year-to-year changes in the different components of the NIIP
provide information on the recent sources of financing of the current account deficit.
Table 2 presents data on the recent evolution of this financing. As pointed out above,
during the last few years an important fraction of foreign financing to cover the current
account deficit has been obtained in the offshore bond market or market for NZD
denominated Eurobonds (Eurowiwis) or NZD denominated Uradishis, purchased by
retail investor in Japan (Drage et. al. , 2005; IMF 2006a, 2006b).
        As I discuss in some detail in Section III of this paper, New Zealand’s NIIP is one
of the most negative (relative to GDP) in the world. As a point of comparison the NIIP in
the U.S. is currently -30% of GDP, and that of Australia is – 57%; see Table 6 below for
details. The NIIPs of most other advanced countries are, in fact, positive, denoting that
these are net creditor countries. Figure 4 shows that in spite of some wave-like

   This question is not unique to New Zealand. It has been addressed several times in recent discussions on
U.S. monetary policy. See, for example, Ben Bernanke’s “The Global Savings Glut and the U.S. Current
Account Deficit,” Speech delivered on March 10, 2005. It may be found at:

   Using the Lane and Milesi-Ferreti data has two advantages. First, they provide long time series, and
second, it is easier to make comparisons across countries.

movements, New Zealand’s NIIP has exhibited a declining trend through time, becoming
increasingly negative.
        In a recent important paper Munro (2005) discusses the evolution of the NIIP in
New Zealand during the last few years. Her most important findings may be summarized
as follows:
                •   The increasingly negative NIIP of the last few years has been the result
                    of private sector investment.
                •   New Zealand’s public sector net international investment position
                    (including the New Zealand Superannuation) is virtually zero.
                •   The importance of bank loans has increased very significantly as a
                    source of external liabilities. Indeed, these higher bank loans have
                    financed the real estate boom of the last few years.
                •   Given the currency composition of international assets and liabilities,
                    New Zealand is not subject to significant “valuation effects” stemming
                    from exchange rate changes.
                •   In the last few years the maturity of New Zealand’s external liabilities
                    has declined.


        Modern analyses of current account sustainability are based on the notion that in
equilibrium the ratio of the NIIP to GDP (or to some other aggregate) has to stabilize at
some level.12 The level at which the NIIP to GDP ratio will stabilize will depend on the
attractiveness of the country’s assets to international investors. If the international (net)
demand for the country’s securities – including debt and equity – is high, the NIIP to
GDP ratio will stabilize at a high rate. The opposite will be true if this international
demand is low. The sustainable current account to GDP ratio will, then, depend on this
long term stable NIIP to GDP ratio, and on the country’s long term trend rate of real
growth and equilibrium rate of inflation. The relationship between the equilibrium and

Zealand, see Munro (2005).

stable ratio of NIIP to GDP – which I will denote as γ -- and the sustainable current
account deficit ( SCAD ) may be written as follows:13


(1)               SCAD = γ ( g T + π ),


where ( g T + π ) is the nominal rate of growth of trend GDP, g T is the long run trend real
rate of growth of GDP and π is the long run steady-state inflation rate (which I assume
to be equal to the long run international rate of inflation). According to this simple and
yet powerful equation, the sustainable current account deficit will depend on both the
international demand for the country’s assets γ and the country’s nominal rate of growth.
γ , of course, is not an invariable number; as pointed out above, it is a variable, whose
value changes through time, depending on the perceived riskiness and/or attractiveness of
the country in question.
         Munro (2005) presents calculations for the SCAD under alternative values of the
long run steady state NIIP ratio and nominal rate of growth. Munro’s computations are
reproduced in Table 3. The results in this Table are particularly interesting, in that they
point out that even if the NIIP stabilizes at a significantly more negative level than the
current -89%, and if nominal growth is very high by historical standards (say, 5.5% on
average), the sustainable current account deficit is still significantly smaller than the
current 8.9% of GDP. The implications of these calculations are simple, and yet very
important: even under an optimistic scenario, where the (negative) NIIP stabilizes at a
significantly more negative level (relative to GDP), and economic growth is very high,
New Zealand will have to go through a substantial adjustment process where the current
account deficit will have to decline significantly. For instance, if from Table 3 one takes
the combination of a NIIP of -120% of GDP and nominal growth of 5.0% of GDP, the
“sustainable” current account deficit is 5.7% of GDP; this means that adjustment will
have to exceed 3% of GDP. But what is perhaps more telling is that these figures
indicate that under rather small changes in the key parameters, the magnitude of the

changes in γ .
                                               13


external adjustment required to bring the current account deficit in line with its long run
sustainable level would be nothing short than brutal. Take, for example, the case where
the steady state NIIP is -80% (still a remarkably high figure from international standards)
and nominal growth is 5%. This combination implies a SCAD of 3.8% of GDP, more
than 5 percentage points below its current level!
        A key question that emerges from this analysis – and one that I address in great
detail in Section IV of this paper – is whether this external sector adjustment is likely to
be gradual (and thus largely harmless from an economic point of view), or abrupt and
costly. That is, the question is whether international investors will slowly reduce the rate
at which they add New Zealand securities to their portfolios, or whether this process will
come to an abrupt and sudden end. Before turning to this important issue, however, I
tackle two important questions: (1) I analyze New Zealand’s external position in an
international comparative context, and I show that New Zealand’s case is quite unique.
And (2), I analyze the way in which New Zealand’s special economic relationship with
Australia affects the NIIP and current account statistics. I address these two questions in
Section III of this paper.


III. The New Zealand Current Account in an International Comparative Context
III.1 International Comparisons
        How large are New Zealand’s recent current account deficits, from a comparative
point of view? How does the persistence of deficits compare with that of other countries?
And, how large is the (negative) net international liabilities position in New Zealand
when compared, from a historical vantage, to that of other advanced countries? In Table
4 I present data on the distribution of current account balances in the world economy, as
well as in six groups of nations – Advanced, Latin America, Asia, Middle East, Africa
and Eastern Europe – for the period 1971-2004. As may be seen, at almost 9% of GDP
New Zealand’s deficit is very large from a historical and comparative perspective. It is in
the top decile of deficits distribution for all advanced countries in the first thirty years of
floating. As the data in Table 4 suggest, at this point New Zealand’s current account
balance looks more like a Latin American or Asian country, than like an advanced nation.
                                                      14


         During the last 30 years a number of advanced countries, in addition to New
Zealand, have had current account deficits in excess of 5% of GDP: Australia, Austria,
Denmark, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Malta, Norway and Portugal. What is
interesting, however, is that very few advanced countries have had current account
deficits in excess of 9%: the only cases are Ireland in the 1970s and early 1980s; Malta;
New Zealand; Norway and Portugal.
         What sets New Zealand truly apart is the historical persistence of its large current
account deficits. In Table 5 I present a list of countries with “persistently high” current
account deficits for 1970-2004. In constructing this table I define a country as having a
“High Deficit” if, in a particular year, its current account deficit is higher than its region’s
ninth decile.14 I then defined a persistently high deficit country, as a country with a
“High Deficit” (as defined above) for at least 5 consecutive years.15 As may be seen in
Table 5 the list of persistently high deficit countries is extremely short; only two of them
are advanced countries, one of which is New Zealand during the 1980s. This illustrates
the fact that, historically, periods of high current account imbalances have tended to be
short lived, and have been followed by periods of current account adjustments. At the
end of 2006 it is likely that U.S. will be added to this list; this would be quite remarkable,
since it would be the first large country – either advanced or developing – to ever make it
into this category. It is important to notice, however, that even if in 2006 New Zealand
still has a very large deficit, it will still not be classified as a new “persistently high
episode.” The reason for this is that it requires five years of being in the top 10% of
deficits.
         The importance of the data on persistence in Table 5 is that they show that
countries that run very large deficits don’t do that for very long periods of time.
Countries that move to the “High Deficits” category stay there for short periods of time.
Their external accounts adjust, and then move back to having a more “normal” deficit. A
key question is the nature of this adjustment. As a number of authors have found out,
countries that go through abrupt and sudden adjustments tend to experience significant


14
    Notice that the thresholds for defining High deficits are year and region-specific. That is, for every year
there is a different threshold for each region.
15
    For an econometric analysis of current account deficits persistence see Edwards (2004). See also
Taylor (2002).
                                                     15


declines in growth.16 On the other hand, countries that experience a smooth adjustment
do not suffer significant costs in their real economies.
         In Table 6 I present data on net international liabilities as a percentage of GDP for
a group of advanced countries that have historically had a large negative NIIP position.17
The data are taken from the comparative data set compiled by Lane and Milesi-Ferreti
(2006). The picture that emerges from this Table confirms that New Zealand represents a
unique case in terms of its external position; together with Iceland, it currently has the
largest negative NIIP among advanced countries. Moreover, New Zealand’s NIIP is
significantly higher than that of other advanced nations.18 As pointed out in the
preceding section, the level at which the NIIP ratio stabilizes determines – jointly with
other variables, such as the potential or trend rate of growth, and inflation – the
sustainable current account deficit. According to equation (1) above, if, for example,
New Zealand’s NIIP stabilizes at 100% of GDP, trend growth is 3.5% and inflation is
1.5%, the sustainable current account deficit (SCAD) is 5% of GDP, four percentage
point below it 2005 level.


III.2 New Zealand’s Close Economic Relation with Australia and the External
Accounts
         An important characteristic of the New Zealand economy is its (increasingly)
close relation to Australia. This is particularly the case with respect to investment in
certain industries and sectors. For instance, Australian investors are the predominant
owners of New Zealand’s banking sector. An important consequence of this close
relationship is that it has an impact on the external accounts, and may make the situation
appear more difficult than what it really is. At the heart of this issue is the treatment in


16
    Frankel and Cavallo (2004).
17
    For the U.S. the data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. For the other countries the data are,
until 1997, from the Lane and Milessi-Ferreti data set. I have updated them using current account balance
data. Notice that the updated figures should be interpreted with a grain of salt, as I have not corrected them
for valuation effects.
18
   During March-May 2006 international investors began to question the sustainability of Iceland’s
external accounts. This resulted in a decline in the demand of Iceland securities and in a drastic loss in
value of the currency. The central bank was forced to face this situation by substantially hiking interest
rates. See, for example, Bloomberg, “Iceland’s Central Bank Raises Key Rate to 12.25%,” May 18, 2006.

Balance of Payments accounting of reinvested earnings. These are automatically (and
simultaneously) recorded as an outflow in the investment income account and an inflow
in the capital account. This means that if firms use retained earnings as a recurrent
source for financing their expansion in the normal course of their business activity, the
external accounts will reflect a large current account deficit.
         As a way to gauging the importance of the “Australian connection” in explaining
the magnitude and evolution of New Zealand’s current account deficit I analyzed the
consolidated Australia-New Zealand NIIP, as well as the behavior of New Zealand’s
current account deficit with Australia.19
         Table 7 presents New Zealand’s NIIP, explicitly detailing Australia’s net holdings
of New Zealand assets. Three main points emerge from this table: first, New Zealand’s
NIIP vis-à-vis Australia is negative and equivalent to 24% of GDP; second, the share of
the bilateral NIIP relative to Australia (as a proportion of total NIIP) doubled in merely
four years; and third, the vast majority of Australia’s holdings of New Zealand assets are
FDI (almost 50%). This fact is particularly important, as it provides support to the
notion discussed above regarding the long-run and ingrained relationship between the
two countries. In particular, the predominance of FDI suggests that Australian
investments in New Zealand are unlikely to be subject to moody and knee-jerk reactions,
and/or to sudden stops.20
         Table 8 presents the consolidated NIIP for Australia-New Zealand. As may be
seen, at – 61% of GDP the combined NIIP is still negative and large. It is, however,
significantly smaller than New Zealand’s NIIIP (89%).21 Figure 5 presents the evolution
of the current account deficit between New Zealand and Australia, and Figure 6 displays
the components of the bilateral current account deficit between New Zealand and
Australia. As may be seen, during the 2000-2003 the bilateral deficit with Australia more
than explained the aggregate deficit. Also, Figure 6 shows that the bilateral investment
income deficit is the more important component of the bilateral imbalance between New

   I am grateful to Anella Munro for discussing with me this issue and, in particular, for providing me with
the calculations on the Australian-New Zealand external accounts.
20
   Whether that is the case of other investments is less clear-cut.
21
   Naturally, it is larger than Australia’s NIIP of 57% in 2005. However, since New Zealand economy is
smaller than the Australian economy, the increase in the combined NIIP relative to Australia’s is not too
large.

Zealand and Australia. The main conclusion of this “consolidated analysis” is that once
the trans-Tasman relationship is taken into account, New Zealand’s external imbalances
don’t look as large; they are still significant, but not as large as they appear when the
aggregate data are considered.


IV. Should New Zealand’s Large External Imbalance be a Cause for Concern?
           In the preceding Sections I have analyzed New Zealand’s external conditions. Six
aspects stand out from this analysis.
      •    First, New Zealand has historically exhibited very large current account deficits.
           According to official New Zealand data the average deficit for the two first
           decades of floating was 4.8% of GDP. The smallest deficit was 0.7% of GDP in
           March 1989, and the largest was 8.9% of GDP, a level achieved in December
           2005. According to IMF data the average deficit was somewhat larger, at 5.4%
           of GDP. But deficits have not only been large, they have also been persistent. As
           shown in Table 5, New Zealand has been one of the few countries in the world
           that has had “persistently high” deficits.
      •    Second, at this time New Zealand has one of the highest current account deficits
           in the world. In 2005, among the advanced countries, only Iceland and Portugal
           had comparable deficits.22
      •    Third, the most important component of New Zealand’s large current account
           deficit is the investment income account. In contrast with the U.S., until recently
           New Zealand’s trade balance was in surplus. Only in 23004 the trade balance
           turned into a deficit.23
      •    Fourth, New Zealand’s NIIP is one of the most negative among advanced nations.
           In part, this negative NIIP is attributable to the special relationship between New
           Zealand and Australia. However, even when data for these two countries are
           consolidated the NIIP is very high from a comparative perspective.
      •    Fifth, New Zealand’s bilateral current account deficit with Australia is very high.
           During 2001-2003 this bilateral deficit explained more than 100% of the overall

22
     Recent data suggests that in 2006 Spain will be added to this group.
23
     This assertion refers to the recent time. During 1999-2000 the trade balance was slightly negative.
                                                    18


         current account deficit. The most important component of this bilateral deficit is
         the investment income account. This reflects the fact that Australian nationals
         have very large investments in New Zealand, and is (partially) the consequence of
         the accounting treatment given to retained earnings.
     •   Sixth, most analysts believe that New Zealand’s sustainable current account
         deficit is significantly lower than its 2005 level. Although it is almost impossible
         to know what the precise level of the sustainable level is, most studies put it at
         between 4.5% and 5.5% of GDP.24 This number is approximately 4% of GDP
         lower than the current account balance in 2005.


         Given the points made above, it is reasonable to ask whether the current very high
deficit of the current account is a cause for concern. A number of authors – most notably
Max Corden (1994) have argued that very large current account deficits “don’t matter,”
as long as they are the result of higher (private sector) investment and not the
consequence of higher public sector deficits. This is known as the “Lawson Doctrine,” or
as the “consenting adults” view of the current account. Since for many years New
Zealand has run significant fiscal surpluses, this view implies that the large current
account deficit of the last few years should not be a cause for concern. According to this
view adults know what they are doing, and thus are unlikely to overreact. This means
that the likelihood that there will be a sudden change in sentiments in capital markets is
small, as is the probability of either a “sudden stop” or an abrupt and costly “current
account reversal.”
         An elegant way of empirically addressing the question of whether large external
deficits are worrisome is to investigate if they are consistent with intertemporal
optimizing models that posit that savings and investment decisions (and thus the current
account) are the result of optimal decisions by the private sector. An important and
powerful implication of intertemporal models is that, at the margin, changes in national
savings should be fully reflected in changes in the current account balance (Obstfeld and
Rogoff 1996). Empirically, however, this prediction of the theory has been


24
  See Munro (2005) for a discussion on alternative estimates for current account sustainability in New
Zealand.
                                                      19


systematically rejected by the data.25 Typical analyses that have regressed the current
account on savings have found a coefficient of approximately 0.25, significantly below
the hypothesized value of one. Many numerical simulations based on the intertemporal
approach have also failed to account for current account behavior. According to these
models a country’s optimal response to negative exogenous shocks is to run very high
current account deficits, indeed much higher than what is observed in reality. Obstfeld
and Rogoff (1996), for example, develop a model of a small open economy where under
a set of plausible parameters the steady state trade surplus is equal to 45 percent of GDP,
and the steady state debt to GDP ratio is equal to 15.26 The common rejection by the
data of the intertemporal (or Present Value) model of the current account has generated
an intense debate among international economists. Some have argued that there is a
group of “usual suspects” explain this outcome (Nason and Rogers 2006); others have
argued that the problem resides on the low power of traditional statistical tests
(Mercereau and Miniane 2004).
         In a recent paper using New Zealand quarterly data for 1982-1999, Kim, Hall and
Buckle (2004) find that the implications of the intertemporal, present value model, of the
current account cannot be rejected. More specifically, they find that there is no evidence
of consumption-tilting towards the present in New Zealand. The authors’ main
conclusions from this research are:


         “[1] Despite substantial deterioration in New Zealand’s current account deficits
         during the late 1990s, its current account movements over our sample period as a
         whole have been consistent with its intertemporal budget constraint and hence its
         formal external solvency condition has been satisfied; (2) The data is not
         consistent with consumption-tilting towards the present; (3) The current account
         paths predicted by our intertemporal optimisation models have satisfactorily
         reflected the actual directions and turning points for the consumption smoothing
         component of the current account.” (p. 25-26).


25
   See, for example, Ogaki, Ostry and Reinhart (1995), Gosh and Ostry (1997), and Nason and Rogers
(2006).
26
    Ostfeld and Rogoff (1996) do not claim that this model is particularly realistic. In fact, they present its
implications to highlight some of the shortcomings of simple intertemporal models of the current account.
                                                     20



These empirical findings led the authors to conclude that the available evidence suggests
that the large deficits are no cause for concern. The large imbalances were the result of
optimal decisions, and would revert themselves smoothly in due course.
         The Kim, Hall and Buckle (2004) paper, however, did not include data for the
2000-2005 period, when the current account deficit widened significantly. In a recent
paper Munro and Sethi (2006) revisit this issue, and provide new results for the
estimation of the present value model of New Zealand’s current account using data for
1982-2005. Their results support those of Kim, Hall and Buckle (2004), and indicate that
the main implications of the present value model cannot be rejected. However, these new
results by Munro and Sethi (2006) also suggest that the recent deterioration of the trade
account is not consistent with the long-term solvency condition. An important
implication of this finding is that New Zealand’s external sector will have to go through a
significant correction.
         In this Section I take a somewhat different approach to the question of whether
the large current account deficits in New Zealand should be a cause for concern. I use a
broad multi country data set to investigate the determinants of the probability that a
country experiences a sudden and large “current account reversal”. I then use data on
New Zealand to evaluate how likely it is that the country will face such a reversal in the
near future. I also analyze the evolution of the estimated probability of a current account
reversal in New Zealand during the 1999-2005 period.27
         The importance of analyzing the likely nature of New Zealand’s future adjustment
stems from the fact that abrupt current account reversals have, historically, been
associated with interest rates spikes, higher inflation, rapid currency depreciation and,
more importantly, a significant decline in the rate of GDP growth.28 According to
Edwards (2005a), reversals have historically been associated with real depreciation
ranging between 15% and 40%, and interest rates increases in the 240 to 570 basis points

27
   The latest IMF reports on New Zealand (IMF 2006a, 2006b) analyze whether the large current account
deficit poses risks for the country. Although there is no empirical investigation, the authors of the report
review work on reversals. On the bases of that review the IMF (2006b”, p. 11) conclude that “the current
account deficit poses no immediate threat to macro stability.

comparison of GDP growth in New Zealand during reversal and non-reversal years.

range. I addition, regression analyses in Edwards (2005b) indicate that countries that
experience large and abrupt current account reversals have had, on average, a decline in
GDP per capita growth that ranges from 2.5% to 5.5%.


IV.1    Data and Empirical Model
         In this study I define a “current account reversal” (CAR) episode as a reduction in
the current account deficit of at least 3% of GDP in a one year period.29 In Table 9 I
present data on the incidence of current account reversals for six groups of countries. As
may be seen, for the overall sample the incidence of reversals is 17.2%. The incidence of
reversals among the advanced countries is smaller, however, at 5.3%. The advanced
countries that have experienced current account reversals during the period under study
are:
              •   Austria (1978, 1982),
              •   Canada (1982, 2000),
              •   Finland (1976, 1977, 1993),
              •   Greece (1986),
              •   Iceland (1978, 1983, 1986, 1993),
              •   Ireland (1975, 1982, 1983),
              •   Italy (1975, 1993),
              •   New Zealand (1975, 1976, 1983, 1988),
              •   Norway (1978, 1980, 1989),
              •   Portugal (1982, 1983, 1984, 1985),
              •   Switzerland (1981).30


         As may be seen, during the last 35 the New Zealand experienced abrupt and
significant current account reversals on four occasions; only Iceland and Portugal have



29
   Later I also discuss results obtained when alternative definitions of reversals are considered in the probit
analysis.
30
   In the analysis the basic cross-country data were obtained from the IMF’s International Financial
Statistics, and from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. The figures may be slightly
different from national sources’ data. See Edwards (2005b) for alternative definitions of reversals.

experienced as large a number of reversals.31 It is interesting to notice that the average
rate of growth of per capita GDP in New Zealand during the four reversal years – 1975,
1976, 1983 and 1988 – was negative: -0.91%. This is significantly lower than the
average growth for the “non-reversal” years: 1.5%.32 Moreover, in New Zealand,
average real GDP per capita growth was also negative (-0.26%) one year after the
reversals.
        In the regression analysis reported in this Section I focus on countries with a GDP
in 1995 of at least USD 52 billion. This allows me to focus on a group of countries that
are somewhat homogeneous. However, in the discussion presented below I also discuss
results obtained when a large group of countries is included in the analysis. The basic
empirical model is a variance component probit, and is given by equations (2) and (3):



                                   1,            if ρ tj* > 0,

(2)               ρ tj     =

                                   0,            otherwise.



(3)               ρ tj*    =    αω tj + ε tj .



Variable ρ tj is a dummy variable that takes a value of one if country j in period t

experienced a current account reversal (as defined above), and zero if the country in
question did not experience a reversal. According to equation (2), whether the country
experiences a current account reversal is assumed to be the result of an unobserved latent
variable ρ tj* . ρ tj* , in turn, is assumed to depend linearly on vector ω tj . The error term

ε tj is given by given by a variance component model: ε tj = ν j + µ tj . ν j is iid with zero

mean and variance σ ν2 ; µ tj is normally distributed with zero mean and variance σ µ2 = 1 .

31
   In its recent report on New Zealand the IMF (2006b) analyzes whether the reversal in Finland in 1993
(as well as the milder adjustment in Sweden) offer lessons for New Zealand.
32
   See Edwards (2004) for a treatment regression analysis of the effects of reversals on GDP growth.
                                                      23


The data set used covers 44 countries, for the 1970-2004 period; not every country has
data for every year, however. See Edwards (2005b) for exact data definition and data
sources.
           In addition to the random effects model, I also estimated fixed effects and basic
probit versions of the probit model in equations (2) and (3).33 One of the advantages of
relying on a probit model, such as the one described above is that they are highly non-
linear. More specifically, the marginal effects of any independent variable on the
probability are conditional on the values of all covariates. This means that if the value of
any of the independent variables changes, the marginal effect of any of them on the
probability of the outcome variable will also change.
           In determining the specification of this probit model I followed the literature on
external crises, sudden stops and reversals. In the basic specification I included the
following covariates, which have data for a large number of countries and years:34


           •   the ratio of the current account deficit to GDP, lagged one period.
           •   The lagged ratio of the country’s fiscal deficit relative to GDP.
           •   An index that measures the effect of “contagion.” This index is measured as
               the relative occurrence of sudden stops in the country’s reference group of
               counties. It is calculated, for each year and group, as the proportion of
               countries that experienced a “sudden stop.” In this calculation data for the
               country in question are excluded. In that sense, then, this “contagion” index
               measures the relative occurrence of sudden stops in the county’s immediate
               reference group. For New Zealand the reference group is the “advanced
               countries.” In the case of New Zealand, for 1970-2004 the contagion variable
               has an average value of 0.064, and a standard deviation of 0.047. The lowest
               value of the “contagion” variable for New Zealand is zero (obtained in several
               years) and the highest is 0.19 (1973 and 1995). I expect the coefficient of this
               “contagion” variable to be positive, reflecting the fact that when a similar
               country experiences a “sudden stop,” capital flows to the country in question


33
     In the ‘basic probit” estimation, the error term is assumed to have the standard characteristics.
34
     See, for example, Frankel and Rose (1996), Milesi-Ferreti and Razin (2000) and Edwards (2002).
                                                     24


             will tend to decline increasing the likelihood of a massive current account
             correction.35
         •   Change in the logarithm of the terms of trade (defined as the ratio of export
             prices to import prices), with a one year lag.
         •   The country’s initial GDP per capita (in logs). This measures the degree of
             development of the country in question. If more advanced countries are less
             likely to experience a reversal, its coefficient would be negative.


         In addition to the base estimates with the covariates discussed above, I also
estimated a number of regressions that in addition included (some combination) of the
following covariates:36


         •   The one-year lagged rate of growth of domestic credit. This is a measure of
             the monetary policy stance.
         •   A dummy variable that takes the value of one if that particular country had a
             flexible exchange rate regime, and zero otherwise.
         •   An index that measures the extent to which the country is dollarized. If
             countries subject to “original sin” – that is, countries that are unable to borrow
             in their own currency are more prone to experience current account reversals,
             its coefficient should be positive. The data for this index were taken from
             Reinhart, Rogoff and Savastano (2003).
         •   An index that measures cases of significant real exchange rate appreciation.
             This index takes the value of one if in a three year period the accumulated real
             exchange rate appreciation exceeds 30%.
         •   And, an index that takes the value of one if the country in question is a
             “commodity country,” and zero otherwise.


         Unfortunately, it is not possible to analyze formally the way in which the close
relationship between two countries -- such as the one between New Zealand and
35
   There are six groups. Five of them are strictly regional, while the sixth refers to “advanced” nations and,
thus, covers more than a region. New Zealand belongs to the “advanced” countries group.
36
   Most of these variables have a lower number of observations than those in (a)-(e) above.

Australia --, affects the probability of a current account reversal. There are no readily
available data on cross-country assets holdings such as that discussed in Section III.2 of
this paper. However, it is possible to perform some indirect tests on the way in which the
trans-Tasman relationship between New Zealand and Australia is likely to affect the
probability of a hard landing or abrupt current account reversal. I do this in Sub-Section
IV.X below, where I discuss the role of FDI on these probabilities.
IV.2 Basic Results
         In Table 10 I present the basic results obtained from the estimation of this probit
model for a sample of 44 countries. In equations (10.1) and (10.2) the coefficients of
both the current account deficit and the fiscal deficit are significantly positive, indicating
that an increase in these imbalances increases the probability of the country in question
experiencing an abrupt current account reversal. All the other regressors in equations
(10.1) and (10.2) have the expected signs, and are significantly estimated at conventional
levels. The results confirm the presence of a “contagion” effect, and that a deterioration
in the terms of trade increases the probability of a reversal. These results also indicate
that counties with a higher (log of) GDP per capita have a lower probability of a reversal.
When these equations were estimated using a fixed effects procedure, the results were
very similar.37
         In equations (10.1) and (10.2) the fiscal and current account deficits variables
were introduced separately in the estimation. In equation (10.3) I present estimates when
both variables are included in the same probit equation. As may be seen, in this case the
coefficient of the (lagged) current account deficit continues to be positive and significant.
However, the coefficient of the fiscal deficit ceases to be statistically significant. This
result is rather intuitive: higher fiscal imbalances that are not associated with a
deterioration of the external accounts, do not affect in a significant way the probability of
an abrupt current account reversal.38 Equation (10.4) indicates that countries with a
flexible exchange rate regime have had a lower probability of experiencing an abrupt and
significant current account reversal.

37
   In the fixed-effects estimation I used dummies for the different regions. In this case (the log of) initial
GDP became insignificant. The reason for this is that the regional dummies capture income per capita
differentials.
38
   The significant positive coefficient of the fiscal deficit in (10.2) is picking up the effect of the omitted
current account variable.
                                              26


       In equations (10.5)-(10-6) I report estimates with additional covariates. The
results are suggestive and confirm that countries with flexible exchange rates have been
less likely to experience an abrupt current account reversal; they also indicate that a more
expansive monetary policy has had a positive – although statistically marginal -- effect on
the probability of a sudden current account reversal. Interestingly the commodity,
appreciation and dollarization variables are not significant in the estimation of the current
account reversal equations. All the estimated models presented in Table 10 performed
quite well; the pseudo-R2 ranged between 0.41 and 0.29.
IV.3 Robustness Analysis
       Standard robustness tests were performed, including estimating the equations for
alternative time periods, alternative data sets (larger number of countries). I also re-
estimated the model excluding outlier observations. Generally speaking, the results
obtained suggest that the results reported in Table 10 are robust to specification, time
period, country coverage, and the exclusion of “extreme values” of the different
variables. I also considered alternative specifications, and included additional variables
that (potentially) capture the extent of external imbalances.
       The results presented in Table 10 consider the current account deficit as the
measure of external imbalances, and don’t control by the country’s initial NIIP. That is,
it makes no distinction between countries with a large deficit and a very negative initial
NIIP, and one with a very large deficit and a low initial GDP. When the value of the
initial NIIP to GDP ratio was included as an additional regressor its coefficient was
negative, as expected, indicating that a more positive NIIP would tend to reduce the
probability of a current account reversal. However, the coefficient for this variable was
statistically insignificant. Moreover, its inclusion did not affect in any way the analysis
on marginal effects on probabilities reported in Sub-Section IV.4.
       As an additional robustness test I also considered alternative definitions of
“current account” reversals. In particular, I re-estimated the probits when a reversal was
defined as being a 4% reduction in the current account deficit in one year. The results
obtained – available on request – are very similar to those reported here. The main
difference is that when this stricter definition is used. The estimated coefficient of the
initial (log of) GDP per capita was significantly negative.

IV.4 Evaluating the Effect of a Larger External Imbalance on the Probability of a
Major Current Account Adjustment in New Zealand
       The results reported in the preceding Sub-Section show that larger external
imbalances – measured by the (lagged) current account to GDP ratio – have been
associated with a higher probability of experiencing an abrupt (and costly) current
account reversal. However, the probit estimated coefficients reported above are difficult
to interpret; it is not possible to know how the recent rapid growth in the current account
deficit has affected the probability that New Zealand will face a current account reversal.
       Marginal Effects: In order to address this issue in the Sub-Section I report the
estimated marginal effects (and standard error) computed from one of the probit
regressions reported above -- equation (10.4). The marginal effects are estimated as the
derivatives of the cumulative normal distribution with respect to the corresponding
regressor. These derivatives are then evaluated for given values of the independent
variables. An important property of probit models is that marginal effects are highly
nonlinear and are conditional on the values of all covariates. If the value of any of the
independent variables changes, the marginal effect of any of them on the probability of
the outcome variable will also change. In the exercise reported in this Sub-Section I
attempt to answer the following specific question: “At the margin, by how much have
increases in the current account imbalances affected the probability of an external crisis
in New Zealand.” In order to address this issue I follow a two steps strategy. First, I
evaluate the marginal effects at the values of the covariates that prevailed in New Zealand
in the early 2000. In particular, I use a value of the current account deficit of 2.8% of
GDP, which corresponds to the year 2001. (For the other covariates I use the following
values: Contagion=0.01; dlogtt=.03; logGDP0=9.43084; Flex=1). Second, I re-evaluate
the marginal effects using a significantly higher value of the external imbalance. More
specifically, I use a value of the current account deficit of 9% of GDP, which corresponds
to New Zealand’s deficit in 2005-06. In order to focus the analysis on the effects of the
external disequilibria, in this second evaluation I maintain the assumed values of the rest
of the covariates.
       The results obtained from the computation of marginal effects are presented in
Table 11. I present to sets of estimates -- “Early 2000,” and “High Imbalance.” The first
                                                      28


column contains the marginal effects obtained when equation (10.4) is evaluated using
the values of the covariate corresponding to New Zealand in the early 2000s.39 Four
results stand out from Column 1: (a) All, but one, of the marginal effects are significant
at conventional levels. (b) The marginal effect of the current account deficit is
significantly positive. Its point estimate, however, is rather low: a marginal increase in
the deficit from its initial value of 2.8% of GDP increases the probability of reversal by
only 1.2 percent. (c) For this specific configuration of values of the key variables, the
marginal effect of the contagion is rather large; the point estimate is 0.15, indicating that
an increase in sudden stops in similar countries increases the probability of a reversal
crisis by 15 percent. And, (d) according to the estimate for “flexible exchange rate” a
country that, with other things given, moves from a pegged to a flexible exchange rate
regime reduces its probability of a crisis by 4.4%.
         The marginal effects in the second column of Table 11 also correspond to
equation (10.4), but they have been evaluated for a value of the current account deficit of
9% of GDP. All other covariates continue to have the same values as in the first column.
The differences between the “High Imbalance” marginal effects in Column 2 and the
“Early 2000” marginal effects in Column 1 are very interesting and may be summarized
as follows:
                  •   The marginal effect for the current account deficit is four times higher
                      in the “High Imbalance” case (Column 2) than in the “Early 2000”
                      case (Column 1). The point estimate, however, is still on the low side:
                      0.050.
                  •   The most important difference between these two estimates has to do
                      with the marginal effect of “contagion.” A country with a 9% of GDP
                      current account deficit is significantly more vulnerable to contagion
                      than a country with only a 2.8% current account deficit (other things
                      being the same). The differences in the marginal effect for contagion
                      in these two estimates are indeed startling: the point estimate increases

39
   In these estimates the current account deficit – the variable of greatest interest – is given a value of 2.8%
of GDP; this corresponds to the current account deficit experienced by New Zealand in 2001. When
alternative specifications of the probit equation are used to evaluate the marginal effects, the results are
very similar to those discussed here.
                                              29


                   from 0.15 to 0.64. Interestingly, these marginal effects for contagion
                   are not very sensitive to the assumed value of the contagion variable
                   itself; when I repeated this exercise using a value of 0.0 for contagion,
                   its marginal effect was 0.14 for the “Early 2000” case and 0.63 for the
                   “High Imbalance” case.
               •   The marginal effect of the “flexible exchange rate” variable goes from
                   -0.044 to -0.13. That is, the benefits of adopting a flexible exchange
                   rate regime are three times higher for countries with (very) large
                   current account deficits than for countries with moderate deficits.


       The results discussed above suggest that, although a higher current account deficit
increases significantly the marginal probability of a reversal crisis, this is not its main
effect; indeed, its marginal effect is only 5%. From New Zealand’s point of view, the
main consequence of the recent increase in the current account deficit is a very significant
increase in its degree of vulnerability to contagion.
       The discussion presented above has focused on the marginal effects of changes in
the current account deficit on the probability of experiencing a current account reversal.
A related question – and one that is perhaps more relevant from a policy point of view in
New Zealand – is how the rapid increase in the current account deficit has affected the
overall predicted probability of an abrupt current account reversal in New Zealand. This
question is addressed in the last row of Table 11, where I report the predicted probability
for the “Early 2000,” and “High Imbalance” cases. As may be seen, the increase in the
predicted probability of an abrupt current account reversal is significant. It goes from 3%
in the “Early 2000” case – a scenario associated with New Zealand in the early 2000s --,
to 21% under the “High Imbalance” scenario.
       “Maxi” Current Account Reversals: The results reported in Tables 10 and 11 are
for current account reversals of at least 3% of GDP. Historically, however, a number of
countries have experienced more severe adjustments – say, 5% of GDP in one year. This
is usually the case when the international capital market turns viciously against a country,
forcing it to adjust severely. As Frankel and Cavallo (2004) and Edwards (2004) have
shown, these more severe reversals are more costly in terms of GDP collapse. In order to
                                                     30


address this issue I estimated random effect probit equations of the type of (3) an
alternative and stricter definition of current account reversal of 5% of GDP in one year.
The regression results are in Table 12; the estimated marginal effects and predicted
probabilities computed from equation (12.1) are presented in Table 13.
         As may be seen, qualitatively speaking the probit results are very similar to those
in Table 10 for the 3% definition of reversals. The signs of the estimated coefficients are
the same, and virtually the same variables are significant.
         The marginal effects and predicted probabilities, however, present some
differences. For every covariate the marginal effect is in Table 13 substantially lower
than in the previous analysis. As an illustration, under the “High Imbalance” case the
marginal effect of the (lagged) current account deficit is now a mere 1.4%. From a policy
perspective, perhaps the most important result in Table 13 refers to the predicted
probabilities of a “5% current account reversal,” for a New Zealand-like country. As
may be seen, the predicted probability in the “Early 2000” scenario is less than one
percent (0.6%); under the “High Imbalance” scenario the predicted probability of a “5%
current account reversal” is a mere 5%.
         The Role of FDI: An interesting question is whether a large FDI component in
capital inflows has an effect on the probability of experiencing a reversal. This is
potentially important, since New Zealand has traditionally had a large, positive and
steady flow of FDI – mostly coming from Australia. For the complete period, for
example, the mean FDI to GDP ratio for New Zealand was 3.0%, and the standard
deviation was 1.72. For all Advanced Countries the mean was 1.80% with a standard
deviation of 3.0%. When the FDI to GDP ratio is added to the random effects probit
equations, its estimated coefficient is negative and its p-value is 0.08.40 This suggests
that, with other things given, countries with a higher flow of FDI will tend to face a lower
probability of experiencing a current account reversal.
         In order to investigate further the role of FDI, I computed the marginal effects and
predicted probability of reversal under two assumptions for FDI behavior. The first
assumption is that the “high imbalance” – which as before is assumed to be characterized

40
    This result is obtained when the FDI to GDP ratio is added to the specification in equation (10.1). When
added to the other specifications in Tables 10 and 12, the results are similar. Notice that when this variable
is added to the regressions the number of observations falls by approximately 50%.
                                                       31


by a current account deficit of 9% of GDP – is fully financed by FDI flows. In the
second scenario, none of the “high imbalance” is financed by FDI flows.41 The results
obtained highlight illustrate of FDI. When the deficit is fully financed with FDI the
predicted probability of reversal is 12.1%; when FDI declines to zero, the predicted
probability increases to 27%. There is also an effect on the marginal contribution of the
current account deficit: when FDI fully finances the imbalance, a marginal increase in the
deficit raises the probability of reversal in 4%; when there are no FDI flows the marginal
effect of the deficit increases to 6%. These results shed some light on the importance of
the trans-Tasman relationship between Australia and New Zealand discussed in Section
III.2 of this paper. As may be seen in Table 7, the stock of Australian FDI represents
almost 50% of all FDI in New Zealand. Moreover, FDI is more than 60% of all
Australian assets in New Zealand. Given the centrality of Australian FDI in New
Zealand, and given that the probit analysis suggests that the trans-Tasman connection
will, overall, tend to reduce the probability of New Zealand facing a hard landing.42


V. Concluding Remarks and Summary
         This paper has dealt with a number of issues related to New Zealand’s external
accounts. I have shown that in a number of ways New Zealand’s situation is unique in
the world economy. The most important conclusions from the analysis may be
summarized as follows:
         •    During the last thirty five years New Zealand has been one of the few
              countries with persistently high current account deficits.
         •    During this period has also been subject to a number of adjustments, including
              some characterized by large and rapid current account reversals (1975, 1976,
              1983, and 1988).




41
    That is, in the first scenario the predicted probabilities and marginal effects are evaluated at values of the
current account deficit of 9% and of FDI of 9%; in the second scenario, the deficit is 9% and the FDI ratio
is zero.
42
    On the other hand, given the importance of the “contagion” variable in this analysis, if Australia herself
is subject to a “sudden stop”, New Zealand is highly likely to go through a hard landing and an abrupt
reversal. Assessing the likelihood that Australia will experience a sudden stop is beyond the scope of this
paper.

•   The recent -- 2005 and projected 2006 – levels of the current account deficit
    are very large, both from a historical and comparative perspective. Indeed, at
    9% of GDP, they are larger than most estimates of the “sustainable” current
    account deficit.
•   New Zealand’s large negative Net International Investment Position (NIIP) is
    currently 90% of GDP. This is a very large figure, both from a comparative
    perspective, as well as when compared with the evolution of the NIIP for New
    Zealand.
•   In contrast with the U.S. the main source of New Zealand’s current account
    deficit is not the trade deficit. Indeed, until recently the trade balance was in
    surplus. The main source of New Zealand’s current account deficit is the
    investment incomes account.
•   Having said this, in recent years the trade balance has turned into deficit,
    contributing to the large overall current account imbalance.
•   To an important extent the (very) negative NIIP and (very) large current
    account deficit may be explained by New Zealand’s very close economic
    relationship with Australia. In particular, the significant presence of
    Australian FDI in a number of sectors – including the banking sector –
    explains the large negative investment incomes account. (Remember that in
    balance of payments accounting, reinvested earnings of foreign owned
    companies are treated simultaneously as an outflow in the investment incomes
    account and as an inflow in the finance account).
•   Once the data are adjusted by the effects of the “Australian (or trans-Tasman)
    connection,” both the NIIP and the current account look less “threatening.”
•   However, even after making the “trans-Tasman” adjustment the current
    account balance appears to be significantly larger than what is sustainable.
    This implies that at some point in the future New Zealand will have to go
    through an external adjustment process. A key question is whether this
    adjustment will be gradual, and thus costless, or whether it will be abrupt and
    (very) costly.

•   In order to address this issue I estimated a number of probit models to analyze
    the determinants of the probability of facing an abrupt current account
    reversal. I evaluated these models using data for New Zealand in the early
    2000s – when the current account deficit was below 3% --, and in 2005-06,
    when the deficit is 9%.
•   The main result from this analysis is that the rapid growth in the deficit during
    the last few years has (greatly) increased New Zealand’s vulnerability to
    “contagion.” It has also increased the advantage of the country’s current
    floating exchange rate regime.
•   The evaluation of the “predicted probability” of experiencing an abrupt
    current reversal indicates that the results depend on the magnitude of the
    reversal in question. The probability of facing a “3% of GDP” reversal has
    increased to approximately 20%; on the other hand, the probability of facing a
    “5% of GDP” reversal as increased to (only) 5%.
