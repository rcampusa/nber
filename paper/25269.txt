Heterogeneity in Expectations, Risk Tolerance, and Household Stock Shares: The Attenuation
Puzzle

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper jointly estimates the relationship between stock share and expectations and risk
preferences. The survey allows individual-level, quantitative estimates of risk tolerance and of the
perceived mean and variance of stock returns. These estimates have economically and statistically
significant association for the distribution of stock shares with relative magnitudes in proportion
with the predictions of theories. Incorporating survey measurement error in the estimation model
increases the estimated associations twofold, but they are still substantially attenuated being only
about 5 percent of what benchmark finance theories predict. Because of the careful attention in
the estimation to measurement error, the attenuation likely arises from economic behavior rather
than errors in variables.

The source of heterogeneity in portfolio choices is an important question for household finance

(Campbell, 2006). Theories, such as consumption CAPM, predict that the share of risky assets

should be positively related to their expected returns, negatively related to their risk, and

positively related to investors’ risk tolerance. These theories also have quantitative implications

for the magnitudes of those relations. This paper assesses those implications by estimating how

heterogeneity in preferences and beliefs explain heterogeneity in household portfolios.

       In this paper we take a systematic attempt at quantitatively evaluating the implications of

benchmark financial theories by using better data and more careful statistical modeling. We build

a structural maximum likelihood model to estimate jointly quantitative measures of risk tolerance

and the perceived mean and variance of stock returns from high-quality survey data while taking

survey measurement error into account. We estimate their association with household stock

shares at the intensive margin. Our approach is made possible by new data on portfolio

composition for a large enough sample of stockholding households, combined with appropriate

measures of preferences and beliefs. Our data set was created by the Vanguard Research

Initiative (VRI) that combines administrative account data and survey responses for a large

sample of Vanguard account holders. The VRI has multiple features that make it especially well-

suited for estimation of the sources of heterogeneity in stock holdings.

       Section I summarizes related literature and discusses how our approach improves upon

previous analyses. Section II describes the VRI sample and the measurements of assets and

stock share. Section III describes how we measure preferences and beliefs. To get individual-

specific estimates of preference parameters, we use a modification of the Barsky, Juster,

Kimball, and Shapiro (1997) approach of eliciting risk tolerance from hypothetical gambles over

permanent income. To get individual-specific estimates of the moments of the perceived
distribution of returns, we use both the Manski (2004) approach of eliciting points in the CDF of

perceived returns together with individuals’ estimates of expected returns.

       Survey measures of preferences have considerable external validity (i.e., that preference

parameters explain a wide range of behaviors) and internal validity (i.e., test-retest validation and

consistence across different measures). See Barsky, Juster, Kimball, and Shapiro (1997),

Kimball, Sahm, and Shapiro (2008), Ameriks, Caplin, Laufer, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2011),

Dohmen, Falk, Huffman and Sunde (2010), Dohmen, Falk, Huffman, Sunde, Schupp, and

Wagner (2011), and Josef, Richter, Samanez-Larkin, Wagner, Hertwig, and Mata (2016) for

evidence both of external and internal validity. Recent evidence suggests survey measures of risk

preferences show more stability than measures based on small-stakes lottery experiments

(Lönnqvist, Verkasalo, Walkowitz and Wichardt, 2015). Similarly, probabilistic measures of

expectations have predictive validity (Hurd, 2009). See Manski (2017) for a summary of

progresses made in eliciting subjective expectations on macroeconomic variables including

equity returns. Carroll (2017) also stresses the role of expectations in explaining macroeconomic

fluctuations and hence the importance of correctly measuring them and understanding their

formation. This paper is the first attempt to measure both preferences and expectations and to use

them jointly to explain portfolio choices.

       Like many survey measures, preference and expectations are subject to response error.

This paper uses a unified procedure accounting for response error to produce unbiased estimates

of the subjective variables for both preferences and beliefs. Section IV combines these estimates

to explain the cross-section of stock shares. We find that the stock share is positively related to

the individuals’ perceived expected stock returns, is negatively related to their perceived

standard deviation of the returns, and is positively related to their risk tolerance. These




                                                  2
relationships are economically and statistically significant, they are robust across various

specifications, and they are substantially larger in magnitude than corresponding estimates that

do not take care of measurement error in the survey answers.

        At the same time, the estimated associations are only about 5 percent of what benchmark

theories predict. Some features of our estimates are in line with those implications: the signs and

also the relative magnitudes of the estimated coefficients conform to the predictions of theories.

They are substantially smaller in magnitude, though, a finding that we call the “attenuation

puzzle.” The empirical method advanced by this paper addresses measurement error in survey

measures of preferences and beliefs, so it establishes that this attenuation reflects actual gap

between benchmark portfolio choice theories and individuals’ behavior.



                                 I. Relationship to the Literature

Several papers estimated associations of household portfolio compositions with various measures

of beliefs and preferences. Not all of them yield results that can be weighed against the

quantitative predictions of finance theories. The results of those that do allow for such

comparisons suggest that beliefs and preferences, as measured by the data, are related to

household portfolios indeed, but those relations are substantially weaker than what benchmark

finance theories would suggest. Most studies analyzed associations at the extensive margin, i.e.,

whether households hold any stocks, primarily due to constraints on sample size. Yet theories

have the starkest quantitative predictions at the intensive margin, i.e., the share of stocks in the

portfolio of stockholders. Most studies either examine the role of beliefs or preferences but not

both.

         Vissing-Jorgensen (2003), Glaser and Weber (2005), Hurd, van Rooij and Winter

(2011), Hudomiet, Kezdi and Willis (2011), Amromin and Sharpe (2012), Hoffman, Post and

Pennings (2013), and Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales (2018) focus on expectations and show that

people with more optimistic expectations about future stock returns are more likely to hold

stocks. Barsky, Juster, Kimball and Shapiro (1997), Dohmen, Falk, Huffman and Sunde (2010),

Dohmen, Falk, Huffman, Sunde, Schupp, and Wagner (2011) and Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales

(2018) show that more risk tolerant individuals are more likely to hold stocks. Dominitz and

Manski (2007) and Hurd, Rooij and Winter (2011) show that individuals with higher levels of

stock market expectations and lower perceived risk are more likely to hold stocks. Kimball,

Sahm and Shapiro (2008) model the intensive margin. Kezdi and Willis (2011) and Dimmock,

Kouwenberg, Mitchell and Peijnenburg (2016) combine the extensive and intensive margins in

Tobit-type models and establish associations with risk tolerance, expectations and ambiguity

aversion, respectively. Weber, Weber and Nosic (2013) show that individual measures of risk

tolerance and expectations predict the share of stocks respondents invest in a hypothetical

financial portfolio but they do not consider beliefs. Hoffmann, Post and Pennings (2013) and

Merkle and Weber (2011) analyze the role of expectations and risk tolerance in trading behavior

of individual investors rather than the share of stocks in household portfolios. Brunnermeier and

Nagel (2008) conclude that understanding the determinants of the share of stocks in the portfolio

of stock market participants is very difficult.

       Several related studies investigated the role of wealth and past experiences in household

portfolios. See, for example, Vissing-Jorgensen (2003), Greenwood and Nagel (2009), Seru,

Shumway and Stoffman (2010), Malmendier and Nagel (2011), Calvet and Sodini (2014).

Another literature focuses on the role of preferences and beliefs in other household decisions.




                                                  4
Piazzesi and Schneider (2009) and Armona, Fuster and Zafar (2016) examine the role of

expectations on the housing market, while Bruine de Bruin, Manski, Topa, and van der Klaauw

(2011), Armantier, Bruine de Bruin, Potter, Topa, van der Klaauw, and Zafar (2013),

Malmendier and Nagel (2016), and Botsch and Malmendier (2017) investigate inflation

expectations.

       Our approach improves on the previous literature in multiple ways. First, the VRI sample

is a large sample of stock holders. Despite being drawn from the account holders of a single

company, the characteristics of the sample are broadly representative of the targeted population

of households with non-negligible financial assets. Unlike most studies that focus on the

extensive margin for stock holdings, this sample allows for meaningful inferences about the

intensive margin of portfolio choice.

       Second, the VRI survey includes batteries of questions that we purposely designed to

produce estimates of preference and belief parameters that should help to explain the cross-

sectional distribution of portfolio choices. These survey questions yield quantitative estimates of

individual-level moments of subjective returns distribution and of individual-level values of

preference parameters. These estimates can then be related to portfolio decisions in ways that are

quantitatively interpretable relative to benchmark economic models.

       Third, the design of the VRI allows careful consideration of response errors along a

variety of dimensions. These include errors in measuring stock shares in both survey and

administrative account data and errors in eliciting preferences and expectations from survey

responses. Few studies take survey measurement error into account in their estimation procedure.

Yet there is strong evidence that survey measures of preferences and beliefs are subject to

substantial response error leading to potentially severe attenuation bias (Kimball, Sahm and




                                                 5
Shapiro, 2008; Kezdi and Willis, 2011). These limitations may be in part responsible for why

estimated associations in the literature are so much smaller than what finance theories would

predict.

       These features—a large, broadly representative sample of stockholders together with

quantitative measurements of the potential sources of heterogeneity in stockholding—make the

VRI a unique platform for understanding why different households make different portfolio

choices.



                         II. VRI Data and Stock Share Measurement

                            A. VRI sample and wealth measurement

The Vanguard Research Initiative (VRI) consists of linked survey and administrative data of

account holders who have non-negligible financial assets at Vanguard, are at least 55 years old,

and use the internet to access their Vanguard accounts. This last requirement is necessary

because the VRI is an internet survey. The VRI is an individual level survey, but it includes

questions about household-level wealth and income as well as questions about spouses’ or

partners’ demographics and labor supply. The survey oversampled older account holders and

singles. The VRI draws respondents from two lines of business—individual account holders and

employer-sponsored account holders. The employer-sponsored are enrolled at Vanguard through

401(k) or similar defined-contribution accounts. While both individual and employer-sponsored

account holders are selected via ownership of a Vanguard account, the selection into individual

and employer-sponsored accounts is presumably quite different. We will present separate

estimates to get a sense of whether selection matters for our results. See Appendix A for more

details on the VRI surveys and sample.




                                                6
       There are features of the VRI that make it well-suited for this analysis. First, it has a new

approach to wealth and portfolio measurement. Second, it provides a larger sample of

respondents with relevant levels of assets and stock holding compared to leading surveys such as

the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). Third,

demographics of the VRI are nonetheless comparable to those with similar asset levels in the

HRS and SCF.

       The VRI survey measure of wealth is based on a comprehensive account-by-account

approach. The survey first asked about types of accounts respondents have (e.g. IRA, checking,

money market funds) and the number each type of account held by the respondent or her spouse.

For each account they indicated owning, the respondents were asked to provide the balance as

well as the share of stock-market assets. When finished with all accounts, respondents were

presented a summary table consolidating their responses and were invited to make corrections, if

any. Measuring wealth and stock shares account by account matches the way respondents keep

track of their own wealth, and it does not require them to sum balances across accounts to

provide total figures for asset categories that are familiar to economists but less so to survey

respondents. In contrast, the HRS and SCF—other leading surveys with state of the art wealth

measurement—use account-by-account approaches but only for selected sets of account types.

Item non-response in the wealth section of the VRI affects less than 1 percent of the

observations.

       Table 1 compares the VRI sample to the HRS and SCF. The HRS and SCF are nationally

representative samples (of those above age 50 in the case of the HRS). Table 1 compares the VRI

sample to the subsample of the HRS and SCF after imposing restrictions similar to VRI

eligibility: being at least 55 years old, having access to internet at home, and having at least




                                                  7
$10,000 financial wealth. The number of respondents in Survey 1 is substantially larger than the

VRI-eligible subsample of the HRS and the SCF. The difference in the number of respondents in

stock-holding households is even larger: the comparable samples have slightly over 1,000 stock-

holding households in the SCF and slightly over 2,000 in the HRS; the entire VRI sample has

more than 8,000 stock holders and the sample used in our analysis (those who completed all the

first three VRI surveys, see below) has more than 4,000.

Notes: For the HRS and SCF, the VRI-eligible subsamples are those who are not younger than 55, have
access to the internet at home, and have at least $10,000 in non-transactional accounts. Respondent-level
variables for the HRS refer to the financial respondents; for the SCF they refer to the household heads.
Variables in the VRI measured in 2013; HRS and SCF are from 2012 and 2013, respectively.
Respondent-level variables are {0,1} binary variables except for age. Summary statistics of the wealth
measures are shown in Table A1 in the Appendix. Table A2 in the Appendix shows the summary
statistics of the variables we use as controls in our analysis, together with the definition of those variables.
For more detailed comparisons with the HRS and SCF sample as well as for the effectiveness of the
account-by-account approach in producing unbiased estimates of assets with low response error, see
Ameriks, Caplin, Lee, Shapiro and Tonetti (2014).


        The demographic composition of the VRI sample is broadly similar to the parallel

subsamples of the HRS and the SCF. Average total wealth and average financial wealth in the


                                                       8
VRI are close to corresponding estimates from the SCF; the HRS averages are lower. The

average stock share in financial wealth among stock holders is very similar in the VRI and the

HRS; the SCF estimates are somewhat smaller. VRI respondents are slightly less likely to be

married, and they are somewhat older, more educated and more likely to be retired. The

differences in marital status, age and retirement are largely due to the fact that the VRI

oversampled older individuals and singles. 65 percent of the VRI sample is male, compared to 79

percent in the SCF and 56 percent in the HRS. Within households, men are overrepresented as

respondents: account holders in the VRI, financial respondents in the HRS, and household heads

in the SCF.

                                     B. Measuring stock shares

Our analysis focuses on the share of stock-market-based assets in total financial wealth.

Specifying stock share in financial wealth is standard in the literature. Alternative measures may

include housing wealth and human capital wealth in the denominator. We include such wealth

items as control variables in the analysis and show that their inclusion leads to very similar

results for the parameters of interest. We also show that our main findings are robust to

including housing wealth as either risky or safe assets in the risky asset share calculation.

          The VRI asks individual the share of stock held in each account. The stock share in

financial wealth is the weighted average of the stock shares of the accounts. Respondents who

did not answer all of the account-by-account stock share questions were asked the overall stock

share of their financial portfolio. Ninety-five percent of respondents answered all the account-by-

account stock share questions; the distribution of stock share is very similar across the two

groups.




                                                  9
       The VRI account data also allow us to calculate stock share using the administrative

records, but of course only for assets held at Vanguard. Appendix A compares the survey and

administrative measures of the stock share. Appendix B also presents the empirical results using

the administrative stock share as the dependent variable. Individuals might hold stocks

disproportionately at one provider or another, so there is no reason to expect portfolio theories to

obtain for holding at each provider. Yet, despite the fact that individuals at sample tend to have a

higher stock share at Vanguard, the results using the administrative share are quite similar to

those using the survey share.



                         III. Measuring Preferences and Expectations

                                   A. Measuring risk tolerance

Survey 2 of the VRI included Strategic Survey Questions (SSQs) that ask respondents to make

choices between hypothetical financial products under hypothetical situations. In this paper, we

use the VRI’s risk tolerance questions that pose gambles over consumption. These are based on

the questions used in Barsky, Juster, Kimball, and Shapiro (1997) and Kimball, Sahm, and

Shapiro (2008) that are implemented in the HRS. The VRI risk tolerance questions are refined

relative to those in the HRS to be more specific about the economic setting and to ask about

consumption rather than income gambles. The HRS uses lifetime income rather than

consumption because when the HRS questions were crafted, there was a concern that

consumption was too abstract a concept to implement in the survey. The VRI approach frames

the question in terms of consumption, the economically more-relevant flow. Earlier successes

with the SSQ approach suggest that it is possible to elicit the more precisely model-relevant




                                                 10
measure using a survey instrument that has both more detailed scenarios and comprehension

tests.

         The VRI SSQs ask about preference between the following two options:

     •   Having a certain level of consumption;

     •   Having double that level of consumption or having it fall by x% with a 50-50 chance.

The question then alters the downside risk x and repeats the question in order to partition

respondents into risk tolerance groups. There are some other differences between the VRI and

HRS questions. In the VRI, the same question is asked with two different levels of guaranteed

consumption for the safe option. Having two consumption treatments in this survey provides a

test-retest measurement that is instrumental for separating true preference heterogeneity from

survey response error. In contrast, Kimball, Sahm, and Shapiro (2008) relies on variation across

multiple survey waves, which assumes time-invariant preferences, an assumption not needed in

this paper. Additionally, using two different levels of guaranteed consumption allows

identification of non-homothetic preferences. The VRI questions are more specific about the

hypothetical situations to better assure that structural preference parameter estimates are

independent from respondents’ economic, health, and family conditions. Table A3 in Appendix

A gives the exact wording of the risk tolerance question in the VRI.

         The question is asked for two different levels of riskless consumption, $100K and $50K

per year, and downside risks of 1/10, 1/5, 1/3, 1/2, and 3/4. Table 2 shows the distribution of the

answers to the two questions. Most respondents have low tolerance for risk. About half of the

respondents chose the first two categories, indicating that they would not accept a risk of more

than 20% drop in their consumption to take a chance to double their consumption. Only a small

fraction chose the last two categories with a risk of more than a 50% drop. Overall, the




                                                  11
distribution is similar to the distribution of the answers to a similar question in the HRS except

that the fraction of respondents in the two extreme categories (0-10% and 75-100%) is slightly

lower in the VRI (see Kimball, Sahm, and Shapiro, 2008 for the HRS). The table also shows that

more respondents fall into the lower risk categories when riskless consumption is $50,000

instead of $100,000. We handle this increase in relative risk tolerance by positing a utility

function with a subsistence level of consumption.

       Following Barsky, Juster, Kimball, and Shapiro (1997) and Kimball, Sahm and Shapiro

(2008), we use the multiple responses to identify the heterogeneity of the preference parameter

and survey response errors. Estimation of a cardinal risk tolerance parameter requires specifying

a utility function. We assume that the flow utility function is a generalization of CRRA with a

subsistence level of consumption

                                                  (c +  )1−1/i
                                         ui (c) =                ,                                (1)
                                                    1 − 1/ i

where subscript i denotes heterogeneity across individuals, c is consumption, the negative of κ is

the subsistence level of consumption, assumed to be the same for all individuals, and θ is the risk

tolerance parameter. To allow for heterogeneity in both θ and κ and to allow for survey response

errors, we would need at least three responses for each respondent; the VRI asked only two.

Therefore, we allow for heterogeneity only in θ. We do allow κ to be a function of observed

covariates in specifications using those covariates (see Section IIIC). Appendix Tables B3, B4

and B10 show that the main results are almost the same when we use a CRRA utility function

(i.e., setting κ=0) as in Kimball, Sahm and Shapiro (2008), except that the estimated risk

tolerance parameter is lower.

       For this utility function, relative risk tolerance (RRTi) is

                                                       c +
                                          RRTi = i          i ,
                                                         c

where the risk tolerance parameter  i is relative risk tolerance in the  = 0 case. Empirically, the

coefficient of risk tolerance is very close to what is implied by  i , as the level of average wealth

(Table 1) and annual income before retirement ($90,000) are substantially larger than our

estimate of − . At levels of consumption implied by the average before-retirement income, the

difference is less than 20%, and its variation between individuals is small. See Appendix Figure

B1 for the relationship of relative risk tolerance and θ as a function of consumption.

       To parameterize the heterogeneity of the risk tolerance parameter, we assume that the

parameter is distributed lognormally in the population according to

                                  log(i ) =  + u i , u i ~ N (0, u2 ).                        (2)

We model the measurement error as a log additive term to the parameter, such that




                                                     13
                                    log(ij ) = log(i ) +  ij         for j = 1, 2
                                                                                                                  (3)
                                   ij ~ N (0, 2 j )

where  i is the true risk tolerance parameter for individual i,                 ij is measurement error, and  ij

is the error-ridden risk tolerance parameter that provides the basis for individual i’s response to

the jth question (c=$100,000 for j=1 and c=$50,000 for j=2). Thus, in answering question j given

the level of resource c and risk x that are associated with the risky gamble, the respondent

compares

                              1−1/ij                       1−1/ij                       1−1/ij

to determine whether to accept the risky gamble or not. Equation (4) translates each response

category in Table 2 into an interval of  ij . This approach generalizes that of Kimball, Sahm, and

Shapiro (2008) by allowing for non-homothetic preferences. (Ameriks, Briggs, Caplin, Shapiro,

and Tonetti (2018) also exploits multiple responses within survey to identify individual level

preference parameters for relating to decisions about long-term care and bequest. Ameriks,

Briggs, Caplin, Shapiro, and Tonetti (2017) estimates the same parameters for a representative

agent using a method-of-moments approach.) We carried out the estimation procedure jointly

for risk tolerance and stock market expectations, so will defer discussion of estimation until

Section IIIC below.

                               B. Measuring beliefs about stock returns

Survey 3 of the VRI asked about beliefs about the one-year return of the U.S. stock market,

represented by a stock market index such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).

Respondents had to answer three questions: the expected return on the stock market in the 12

months following the interview (m); the percent chance that the stock market will be higher in 12


                                                           14
months following the interview (p0) and the percent chance that it will be at least 20% higher

(p20). The exact wording of the questions is in Table A4 in the Appendix. (Bruine de Bruin,

Manski, Topa, and van der Klaauw (2011) and Armantier, Bruine de Bruin, Potter, Topa, van der

Klaauw, and Zafar (2013) examine the reliability of the percent chance questions for inflation as

well as how they relate to questions about point expectations of inflation.)

       Answers to the expected value questions were constrained to be integers. Answers to the

percent chance questions were constrained to be 5 point increments between 0 and 15 and

between 85 and 100, and they were constrained to be 10 point increments between 15 and 85 (the

set {0,5,10,15,25,35,45,55,65,75,85,90,95,100} ). Answers to percent chance questions tend to

be rounded to the nearest ten when they are not constrained, with an especially large fraction

answering 50 percent (Hurd, 2009). The VRI survey instrument requires people to round to other

values; in particular, they cannot give 50 percent probabilities. It also allows for finer rounding at

the tails, in line with the findings of Manski and Molinari (2010). The survey also requires that

p20  p0 . Respondents whose initial answer to p20 violated this constraint are reminded of the

constraint by the survey software and asked for a new reply to either p0 or p20 (or both). The

survey imposes no constraints on m versus p0 and p20. (A randomly selected half of the

respondents received the m question first, followed by p0 and p20, while the other half received

p0 and p20 first, followed by m. The distribution of the responses is slightly different across the

two sequences. Nevertheless, we find similar relationships between the belief measures and

portfolio choice from the two sequence groups.)

       Table 3 shows the summary statistics of the answers to the questions about the

distribution of stock market returns. The survey responses for expected returns (m) are

distributed around the historical average of 4 to 7 percent depending on sample period, and their




                                                 15
dispersion is moderate. In contrast, most answers to the probability questions are lower than the

historical probabilities, and they have substantial heterogeneity. (Individuals may use different

sample windows for inferring expected returns, see Malmendier and Nagel, 2011. The table

shows some different windows for realized returns. Average returns are quite variable owing to

the well-known problem of estimating the expected return on the market.) A non-negligible

fraction of the respondents gave a positive number to the expected return question (m) and a less

than 50 percent chance answer to the probability of a positive return (p0). Taken together these

answer patterns are consistent with many individuals implicitly applying a positive threshold

when they answer the p0 question (by thinking that the stock market goes up only if it goes up by

at least some positive amount). Glaser, Langer, Reynders and Weber (2007) document a similar

pattern when they compare stock market expectations elicited in terms of returns versus prices.

They label the phenomenon as “framing effect,” and our explanation can be viewed as a source

of such a framing effect. Note that, although skewed returns could explain the phenomenon we

observe, it is an unlikely explanation. The combination mi>0 and p0i<0.5 would correspond to

long positive tails, implying mean above the median and infrequent large gains. This skewedness

is the opposite of what one would expect from a “black swan” theory of infrequent stock market

crashes.

Notes: m is expected one-year ahead returns of the stock market index DJIA; p0 is the probability that the

Average (year on year changes divided by base year value, first days of July in each year), deflated using
the PCE chain price index (available beginning in 1959). Historical average values shown for m; the
fraction of years when positive or greater than 0.2 are shown for p0 and p20. 4414 observations.

         In order to use our data more efficiently and in a way that is more informative from a

theoretical point of view we map the three survey responses, m, p0, and p20 into a perceived

returns distribution. The procedure closely parallels that for the risk tolerance questions: the

survey responses are based on individual beliefs drawn from a distribution plus survey response

error. We assume that individual i believes that yearly returns follow a lognormal distribution

with individual-specific mean and standard deviation of log stock returns of μi and σi. Similar to

how we handle the cross-sectional distribution of the risk tolerance parameter, these parameters

are drawn across individuals as

                        i =  + u  i      ui     0   u2        uu  
                                       ,     ~ N    ,                          .
                         i =  + u i      u i  0  .                 u2                     (5)



Individuals answer the survey questions m, p0 and p20 based on their beliefs, but their answers

contain survey noise, that is, measurement error specific to the survey situation. Using the

structure of the survey questions on expected returns and the two points of the probability

distribution, applying the assumption of lognormal returns, and adding survey response error

yields

                                       mi = i +  mi ,  mi ~ N (0, 2m )                             (6)

where mi , p0i , and p20i are the error-ridden latent variables that determine survey responses.

Survey error is assumed to be independent across the three answers, with mean zero except for

p0 where its mean is  , which allows for the documented gaps between m and p0. An

interpretation of  is that, on average, respondents answer the question about positive returns

(p0) as if they had some positive threshold in mind instead of zero (  ( − /  i ) ,   0 ). The

survey responses are transformed versions of latent variables mi , p0i , and p20i because of

rounding. Recall that the VRI probability scale is for rounded responses. Similarly, as discussed

above, the risk tolerance questions yield discrete responses. In the following subsection we

discuss how our estimation procedure handles this issue.

        C. Joint estimation of heterogeneity in stock market expectations and risk tolerance

Given the models of heterogeneity in preferences and beliefs (equations (2) and (5)) and the

structural interpretation of the survey questions together with the additive survey response errors

((3), (4), (6), (7) and (8)), we can now move to estimation of the model. The parameters to be

estimated are   { ,  ,  , u , u , u ,  ,  ,  1,  2 ,  m ,  p } . We allow for  ,  ,

 , and  to vary with covariates. Additionally, we allow the beliefs about returns to be

correlated with risk preference, so the covariates of  and               include the latent  i .

        Note that the variables mi , p0i , and p20i in (6), (7), and (8) are before rounding. Actual

survey response mi is a rounded version of mi as mi is restricted to take an integer value.




                                                        18
Survey responses p0i and p20i are to take a value from the set

{0,5,10,15,25,35,…,75,85,90,95,100}, we assume that p0i and p20i are rounded to the closest

values allowed for each response. Also note that the survey does not allow for p20i to be larger

than p0i . Hence when we observe p20i = p0i , we consider the possibility that the survey

response error actually generated p20i  p0i but after imposing the constraint we observe the

equality in the actual responses. Together with interval responses, these formulae tell the range

of survey response error terms that generate the responses of individual i that we observe, given

i ,  i , and  i .

         Let Z i be the set of responses from respondent i to the five questions used for the

estimation and [ kilow (i ,  i ,i | Zi ),  kihigh (i ,  i ,i | Zi )] (for k = 1 ,2 , m, p0 ,and p20 ) be the range

of survey responses error term that is consistent with the observed response for each question

given the latent preference and belief parameters, calculated from (3), (4), and (6)-(8). Then the

individual likelihood function for respondent i is calculated as:

so that this affects only the third digits of the  and       estimates throughout the estimated

distribution of  i . Also note that, for technical purposes, we left-truncate the distribution of  i

capture potential dependence of the belief parameters on the preference parameter.)

        We calculate Li ( | Zi ) using the Gaussian quadrature approximation. See Appendix C

for the detailed algorithm.

the estimates of the statistical model with covariates.


        Table 4 shows key estimated statistics of the distribution of preferences and beliefs based

on the estimated statistical model of preferences, beliefs, and response error. Table B1 in the

appendix shows the estimates of the underlying parameters of the model. The subsistence level


                                                     20
of consumption (−κ) is estimated to be $17,000. The negative value of κ generates decreasing

relative risk aversion as in the basic/luxury good model of Wachter and Yogo (2010). The design

of the SSQ does not allow heterogeneity in κ to be readily identified, although it tightly identifies

its mean. The estimated mean of the risk tolerance parameter (θ) implies low risk tolerance on

average. A respondent with the mean level of θ and κ has relative risk tolerance 0.34 (relative

risk aversion 2.9) when the consumption level is $100,000. In terms of the SSQ question, she

would be indifferent between a fixed consumption of $100,000 and the 50-50 gamble of

doubling that consumption and losing 20 percent. There is a considerable heterogeneity in risk

tolerance. At the 25th percentile of risk tolerance parameter, the point of indifference is the

downside risk of losing 13 percent; at the 75th percentile the point of indifference is the

downside risk of losing 29 percent. These numbers indicate higher levels of risk tolerance than in

a representative sample of Americans older than 50 years of age. Kimball, Sahm and Shapiro

(2008) estimate the corresponding risk tolerance percentiles (25th, 50th and 75th) to imply

indifference to 7, 12 and 20 percent of downside risk, respectively.

       Beliefs about mean stock returns are in line with historical mean returns, on average.

Beliefs about standard deviation are slightly lower than the historical value of 0.16.

Heterogeneity in perceived mean returns (μ) is substantial, with the lowest 25 percent believing

expected returns to be 2 percent or less and the top 25 percent believing 10 percent or more. At

the same time, estimated heterogeneity in the perceived standard deviation of stock returns (σ) is

small, perhaps because it is easier for people to estimate the second moment of the returns

distribution than the first moment, as pointed out by Merton (1980).

       According to our estimates heterogeneity in preferences and beliefs are weakly related.

More risk tolerant respondents believe that stock returns are slightly higher, but we don’t find




                                                 21
association of risk tolerance and beliefs about the standard deviation of returns. Beliefs about the

mean and the standard deviation of returns are weakly positively correlated. Preferences and

beliefs are significantly related to observable right hand side variables in our sample (Table B2

in the Appendix). However, when interpreting these associations, one has to keep in mind that

the VRI sample is selected on wealth and stock ownership. For example, sample selection may

explain the negative correlation of wealth and stock market expectations. Almost all households

in the VRI sample have nonzero stockholding. With fixed costs of stock market participation

wealth should matter at the extensive margin on top of expectations. As a result, we expect

wealthier stockholders to have lower expected returns than less wealthy stockholders.

       Based on the estimated distribution summarized in Table 4, 17 percent of the population

expects negative stock returns. As we will see, this part of the population holds less stock than on

average, but still has substantial stock market exposure. Symmetrically, 17 percent expect returns

to be larger than 12 percent, rates of return that should make people hold the vast majority of

their wealth in stocks given the distribution of risk and risk preferences. Though this part of the

population holds more stock than on average, very high stock shares are uncommon. Taken

together, these facts suggest that expectations are correlated with stock shares in an attenuated

fashion, a finding that our analysis will verify in the next section.

       The Table 4 results take into account substantial estimated survey noise. The parameters

of the survey noise distributions are presented in Appendix Table B1. To understand the

magnitude of noise, consider the differences in terms of the survey responses of individuals with

the estimated averages of latent preferences and beliefs, one without measurement error and one

with a positive standard deviation unit shock of measurement error. A one standard deviation

unit measurement error in the first risk tolerance SSQ would make the survey response imply a




                                                  22
point of indifference of a 38% drop of consumption instead of the 20% implied by an error-free

answer. A one standard deviation unit measurement error in the second risk tolerance SSQ would

make the response imply an indifference point of 27% instead of 17%. One standard deviation

unit measurement error in the response to the expected stock returns question would result in a

response of 14% instead of 6%; one standard deviation unit measurement error in the stock

market probability answers would change p0 responses to 67% from 48% and p20 responses to

25% from 12%. The estimated bias of the measurement error in the p0 response (ψ) suggests

that, on average, people think of positive gains only when they exceed 4 percent when answering

the p0 question. Allowing for covariates (Appendix Table B2), ψ is estimated to be substantially

less negative among more educated and wealthier people, indicating that their threshold value is

closer to the nominal threshold zero.

          D. Estimating individual-specific cardinal proxies of risk tolerance and beliefs

In the previous sections, we show how to separately identify the true heterogeneity in

preferences and beliefs and the survey response errors in the survey measures of them. In this

subsection, we explain how we construct the individual-specific belief and preference parameters

based on those estimates that are immune from the standard effects of using generated

regressors.

1. Constructing individual-specific preference and belief parameters

Using the estimation results we calculate individual-specific proxy variables ˆ i , ˆ i and ˆi .

These proxies are the expected values of the corresponding latent variables: the individual-

specific expected value and standard deviation of the distribution of stock market returns

perceived by the individual ( i ,  i ) , and the individual-specific latent risk tolerance parameter

(i ) . They are expected values conditional on the individual's responses to the survey questions


                                                  23
on stock market returns ( mi , p0i , p20i ) and to the SSQ’s with the two hypothetical gambles. To

get these expected value of the latent individual-specific parameters conditional on the survey

response and the statistical model, there are two steps. First, the distribution of the latent

variables conditional on the observed responses can be obtained from the likelihood function

using Bayes’ theorem. Second, integrating out this function yields the individual-specific proxy

            ˆ  {ˆ , ˆ ,ˆ } ) as the conditional expectations of the latent variables given the
variables ( i     i    i   i

2. Using individual-specific preference and belief parameters in regressions

Our aim is to use the survey-based estimates of individual-specific parameters to explain

heterogeneity in portfolio choice. In contrast with classical measurement error that is

uncorrelated with true values but correlated with measured values, the error in the proxy

variables is the error of optimal prediction, which is uncorrelated with measured values. Thus,

when entered on the right-hand-side of linear regressions, this type of non-classical measurement




                                                                     24
error does not induce attenuation bias in the regression coefficients of these proxy variables (see

Kimball, Sahm and Shapiro, 2008).

       When the regressions include other covariates as well the OLS estimates are unbiased if

the proxies are estimated conditional on those covariates, too. We therefore estimate two sets of

proxies. The first set is conditional on the survey answers to the risk tolerance and the stock

market belief questions only. The second set is conditional on other covariates as well. We use

the second set of proxy estimates as right-hand-side variables in regressions that also include

those covariates. In the next section, we present such regressions to explain portfolio behavior

based on our estimates of preferences and beliefs.



                       IV. Explaining Heterogeneity in Portfolio Choice

                          A. Stock share and answers to survey questions

Before turning to the regressions based on our structural estimates of the latent preferences and

beliefs, we investigate the relationship between the stock share of household portfolios and the

raw survey responses. Figure 1 shows non-parametric regressions of the stock share in total

financial assets on the survey answers to expected stock market returns (mi), the average between

the probability that the stock market would go up and that of an increase of 20 percent or more

(( p0i + p 20i ) / 2) , the difference between those two (p0i – p20i), and the answer to the risk

tolerance question with income level $100,000. (Figure B2 in Appendix B shows the analogous

non-parametric regression results on p0i and p20i separately.)




                                                  25
                       Figure 1. Stock Share versus Raw Survey Responses

                           A                                                  B




                               C                                               D




       The results indicate a positive relationship between the stock share of household

portfolios and expected stock market returns (mi) and the mean of the two probability responses

(( p0i + p 20i ) / 2) . The stock share is also positively related to the difference between the

responses to the probability questions (p0i – p20i), suggesting a negative relationship with

perceived risk of stock returns. Finally, the stock share is monotonically positively related to the

answers to the risk tolerance question except for the last categories that has relatively few

responses, suggesting a monotonic positive relationship with risk tolerance. Hence, the



                                                  26
relationship between the raw survey responses and the stock share has the direction benchmark

theories of portfolio choice would suggest.

       We also estimate linear regressions with the survey measure and the administrative

measure of stock share as alternative left-hand-side variables and the same right-hand-side

variables entered with and without the control variables that include detailed measures of

demographics, education, employment, income, wealth, as well as background risks of long-term

care and longevity. The results are included in Tables B5 and B6 in the Appendix. The results

imply similar relationships of stock share with the survey answers with or without the control

variables. The magnitudes of the associations are difficult to interpret because not all measures

have a cardinal interpretation and because of the presence of survey noise. These problems are

addressed in the next section.

              B. Stock share and cardinal proxies of expectations and risk tolerance

Our more structural analysis has two goals. First, it relates the stock share of household

portfolios to cross-sectional heterogeneity in preferences and expectations in a way that is related

to portfolio choice theory thus making magnitudes easier to interpret. Second, it aims at

incorporating survey noise in the estimation thus reducing its effect on the estimated magnitudes.

This is a structural analysis in the sense that it makes use of additional assumptions in order to

relate stock shares to heterogeneity in latent preferences and expectations. The analysis is still

reduced form in the sense that it aims at uncovering associations without claims for causality.

Nonetheless, since the explanatory variables are proxies that have cardinal interpretations

relevant for economic theories, they potentially convey much more information than the

relationship of raw survey responses to economic outcomes.

       Start from a general function of the solution of optimal stock share




                                                 27
                                             si* = s* ( i ,  i ,i ,  ; xi , ui )                             (11)

where μi and σi are the beliefs of person i about the mean and the standard deviation of one-year-

ahead stock returns, θi is the risk tolerance parameter, xi is a vector of wealth, demographic

variables and other risk factors that are measured in our data, and ui combines all unobservables.

We assume that unobservables are independent of observables.

       The relative deviation of s* around its mean value is related to relative deviations of the

other variables around their mean values, holding values of xi constant by

                     si* − s*                i −       −      −
                                  0 + 1          + 2 i   + 3 i   +  4 ' xi + ui .                          (12)
                       s*                                         

The coefficients approximate the first derivatives of the function around the mean values, with

1 = s* /  ,  2 = s* /  and 3 = s * /  , where the tilde denote relative differences from

mean values. This approximation is a way of log-linearizing the function that allows

observations with nonpositive values of some of the variables, which is relevant for μi in our

case. We linearize about the risk tolerance parameter rather than relative risk tolerance to avoid

the ambiguity that relative risk tolerance depends on the level of consumption.

       We estimate (12) using the observed stock share                       si to approximate the target stock share

si* and the individual proxies ̂i , ̂ i , and ˆi approximating the latent variables i ,  i , and  i

as described earlier. We estimate the equation by OLS both with and without covariates. (We do

not use a Tobit-type procedure to account for the truncation at 0 and 1 because there are very few

observations (less than 2 percent of the sample) at these boundaries.) When we control for

covariates in the stock share equation, we enter the structural parameters that were estimated

conditional on the same covariates. Kimball, Sahm, and Shapiro (2008) show that it is necessary



                                                              28
to construct the proxies conditional on the same covariates as included in the main regression to

deliver unbiased coefficient estimates. As the proxies are generated regressors, we estimated the

standard errors by bootstrapping the entire estimation procedure including the structural

estimation of the model underlying the proxies. We estimated two versions of each regression:

one with the survey measure of the share of stocks in total financial wealth on the left hand side

and one with the administrative measure of stock share in wealth held at Vanguard. The main

results using the survey measure of stock shares are in Table 5.

        The estimates show that the share of stocks is positively related to the perceived mean of

stock market returns, negatively related to the perceived standard deviation of stock market

returns, and positively related to the risk tolerance parameter. The estimated coefficients are

precisely estimated for the expected return ( ̂i ) and risk tolerance ( ˆi ) variables and somewhat

less precisely estimated for the standard deviation of returns ( ̂ i ). The coefficients are very

similar whether we enter them with or without the covariates. The results are similar using the

administrative measure of stock shares as the dependent variable except for smaller and less

precise estimates for risk tolerance (see Appendix Table B7).

Notes: Stock share in total financial wealth (survey measure) are regressed on proxies for the expected stock returns,
perceived standard deviation of stock returns, and the risk tolerance parameter. For the first two columns, right-
hand-side variables are the optimal cardinal proxies ( ̂ i , ˆ i , and ˆi ) calculated from (10). For the next two
columns with the error-ridden proxies, the right-hand-side variables are the raw survey answers to the stock market
expectation question (mi), a crude transformation of the probability answers to approximate perceived risk defined as
 i = 0.2 (  ( p ) −  ( p ) ) , and the median value of the CRRA risk tolerance parameter that corresponds to the

answers to the first set of the risk tolerance questions (  set to zero). (The parameter  i is not defined if the
denominator is zero so we imputed 0.2 for the denominator for such observations to obtain  i = 1 , which is larger
than the maximum of the non-imputed values. This imputation affects less than 10% of the observations. Alternative
imputations that replace the denominator with other values yield very similar estimates.) All variables are expressed
as relative differences normalized to their mean values (as specified in equation (12)). Control variables: married,
male, age, whether respondent comes from the employer-sponsored subsample, education (below college; college;
MBA; PhD, other higher degree); log financial wealth, log wage, dummy for owning a house, log annuity income
(Social Security and DB pensions) for retired, log expected annuity income for non-retired; dummy for retired, log
home stock; subjective probability of needing long-term care, and longevity expectations. Bootstrap standard errors
in parentheses. See Appendix Tables B8 and B9 for full results including coefficients of covariates.



         According to the point estimates, a one percent higher perceived mean is associated with

one twentieth of a percent higher stock share; a one percent higher perceived standard deviation

is associated with around one tenth of a percent lower stock share; and a one percent higher risk

tolerance parameter is associated with one thirtieth of a percent higher stock share. Converting

the relative magnitudes to absolute ones, our estimates imply that for the stock share to be higher

by 1 percentage point expected returns need to be higher by 2.1 percentage points, the perceived




                                                            30
standard deviation needs to be lower by 2.4 percentage points, or the risk tolerance parameter

needs to be higher by 0.24.

       Comparing our estimates to the literature is not straightforward as most papers do not

have cardinal proxies for the expectations and risk tolerance variables, and those that do estimate

functional forms that are different from ours. Wherever we can make the comparison we find

magnitudes that are very similar to our estimates. The closest to our specification are the

estimates of Amromin and Sharpe (2012). On a sample of stockholders with positive expected

returns they regress the log of the stock share on the log of their proxies of μ and σ. Their point

estimates are +0.04 and -0.11, respectively. These magnitudes are very close to ours. The results

of the Tobit model of Vissing-Jorgensen (2003), estimated on a sample of investors, imply that

one percentage point higher returns expectations are associated with about 0.5 percentage point

higher equity share. Kezdi and Willis (2011) estimate a coefficient of 0.3 in a truncated

regression model estimated on a representative sample with stock shares on the left hand-side.

Our log-linearized estimates imply that, around its mean, a one point difference in μ is associated

with a 0.45 percentage point difference in stock shares. In a Tobit model of stock shares that

combines the extensive and intensive margins Kimball, Sahm and Shapiro (2008) find a small

magnitude for the association with the cardinal proxy of risk tolerance.

       The columns labeled “error-ridden proxies” in Table 5 show results of analogous

estimations that do not account for measurement error in the survey answers. Instead of the

cardinal proxies ˆi , ˆi ,ˆi , these regressions include the raw survey answers to the stock market

expectation question (mi), a crude transformation of the probability answers to approximate

perceived risk, and the median value of the CRRA risk tolerance parameter that corresponds to

the answers to the first set of the risk tolerance questions. (See note to Table 5 for the precise



                                                  31
definitions of these error-ridden proxies.) The coefficient estimates are qualitatively similar to

the baseline results reported in column (1) and (2) of Table 5, but the magnitudes are

considerably attenuated. The absolute values of the point estimates are one third to one half of

the baseline estimates. These results are consistent with substantial measurement error in the raw

survey answers. They show the importance of taking into account measurement error in the

construction of the proxies and in using them in econometric models.

                             C. Alternative samples and specifications

The findings are similar for different subsamples and specifications. Appendix Tables B11 –

B18 present complete results. This section discusses them briefly.

       Our sample is drawn from two groups of Vanguard clients: those with employer-

sponsored plans and those with individual accounts. We can gain insight into whether the

selection of being a Vanguard customer affects the results. For employer-sponsored plans, the

employer selected Vanguard. For individual accounts, the individual selected Vanguard. Self-

selection on unobserved attributes is arguably substantially less severe for the employer-

sponsored sample. Appendix Tables B11 and B12 show estimates of the same regression as the

first two columns of Table 5. Estimated coefficients are quite similar across sample suggesting

that individual-level selection of Vanguard is not driving the results.

       Appendix Tables B13 and B14 show results for individuals with at least 50 or 70 percent

of their financial wealth at Vanguard. These individuals are more selected toward Vanguard, but

also may have better measurements owing to higher engagement with Vanguard or having

accounts spread over fewer providers. The results are again similar.

       Appendix Table B15 shows results for individuals who have some directly-held stock.

This subsample result is again similar. Appendix Table B16 shows results by education levels.




                                                 32
In the survey data, MBAs show less attenuation with respect to expected returns. There are no

other differences by education.

        Appendix Table B17 shows that the results are similar even if we include housing wealth

either as a safe asset or as a risky asset in the calculation of the share of risky assets.

        Finally, the columns labeled “Administrative stock share” in Appendix B show the

results for using the fraction of stocks in assets held at Vanguard using the administrative

account measure. The results in the text (and those in Appendix B labeled “Survey stock share”)

use the stock share of all assets from the survey response. In brief, there is little difference in the

results across the measures of stock shares. Appendix Table B18 confirms that the difference

between the two stock share measures is not correlated with the estimated beliefs and only

marginally correlated with the estimated preferences.

                      D. Interpreting the magnitudes: The Attenuation Puzzle

How might one evaluate the estimates relative to an economic model? The simplest model of

Merton (1969) with CRRA utility would imply that the coefficient on log μ should be 1, the

coefficient on log σ should be -2, and the coefficient on log θ should be 1 again. The same

implications hold if we modify the utility function in the Merton model to incorporate the

subsistence level of consumption as in equation (1) above, or if we include deterministic labor

income (Merton, 1971). The Merton model is based on strong assumptions: it requires

continuous rebalancing, no background risk, and it allows for unlimited leverage and short sales.

We therefore investigate whether adding these realistic features would move the predictions of

the benchmark model more in line with what we observe in the data. Appendix D has an analysis

of a more realistic lifecycle model. It shows, for the purposes of the cross-section regression

explaining portfolio choice, the Merton model is a very good approximation.




                                                   33
       The relative magnitudes of the estimated coefficients reported in Table 5 are remarkably

close to these theoretical implications of the Merton benchmark. In the regressions on the survey

measure of stock share, the coefficient on the (approximately log-linearized) expected value and

risk tolerance proxies are close to each other, and the coefficient on the standard deviation proxy

is close to be negative two times their magnitudes. At the same time, the magnitudes are much

smaller than in the benchmark model: each estimate is about one twentieth of what a simple

theory implies.

       In principle, the attenuation bias may arise from classical errors in variables on the right

hand-side or appropriate non-classical errors in the left hand-side variable. Recall that our

measures of beliefs and preferences already take care of substantial survey noise that arise from

noisy responses conditional on the latent variables. While it is of course possible for those latent

variables to exhibit additional noise, due to, for example, mood effects, that noise would have to

be extremely large for the observed attenuation. The magnitude of the attenuation and its similar

strength across the coefficients call for an explanation beyond these measurement issues.

       We can represent the substantially attenuated association of stock holding with beliefs

and preferences by expressing observed stock shares as a linear combination of the individual

optimum si* and the average stock share s plus additional heterogeneity

                                 si =  si* ( i ,  i ,  i ) + (1 −  ) s + vi                   (13)

where λ is the weight on the individual optimum given beliefs and preferences, (1- λ) is the

weight on the average stock share, and vi is heterogeneity in stock shares due to other factors.

This model can be viewed as a simple statistical representation of the attenuation. It can also be

interpreted as a behavioral model, in which investors consider the possibility that everyone else

may choose the average stock share even if their own beliefs and preferences imply a different



                                                      34
choice, and their decision combines the two. Such behavior could also account for the finding

we discussed earlier that those who report negative expected returns in the survey continue to

hold stock and those who are very optimistic do not have extreme exposure to the stock market.

        Expressing equation (13) in deviations from averages, denoting the coefficients of the

log-linearized optimal stock share by  0 and decomposing heterogeneity due to other factors

into observed and unobserved parts yields

                                          V. Conclusion

This paper uses a distinctive measurement and analytic strategy that combines high-quality

measurement of portfolio shares, preferences about risk, and beliefs about returns in an attempt

to explain heterogeneity in the composition of household portfolios. The approach uses

purposely-constructed measures to elicit measures of preferences and beliefs that have

quantitative interpretations. This paper does find that risk preference and moments of the

subjective returns distribution—both mean and variance—do have a role in understanding why

portfolio choices differ. Relative to each other, the magnitudes of the coefficients on expected

returns, perceived risk, and risk tolerance are in proportion with the predictions of benchmark

theories. That the survey measures of preference and belief do align with portfolio choices

provides external validation of our approach to measuring them.

        The size of the estimated associations of the risk and belief parameters is, nonetheless,

substantially smaller in magnitude than benchmark theories would suggest. We call this finding

the “attenuation puzzle.” Our methods produce risk and belief parameters that measure the

precise, quantitative variables that should explain portfolio choice. Moreover, the statistical

procedure deals with measurement error in these parameters, which is one most obvious source

of such attenuation. Hence, the attenuation cannot be dismissed because the measures of

preference and belief are only loosely related to what people have in mind when choosing their

portfolio.




                                                 36
        Instead, the attenuation puzzle exists because people behave in ways that deviate

substantially from what standard finance theories prescribe. Those theories say that people

should react strongly to their preferences and beliefs. For example, changes in their beliefs

should lead to a substantial reallocation of their portfolios, possibly with frequent transactions.

Moreover, many people with mild risk aversion should hold levered portfolios (see, for example,

Ayres and Nalebuff, 2010). All of these prescriptions run counter to standard household finance

advice, most of which suggest buy and hold strategies of portfolios with stocks between zero and

100 percent. Typical life cycle funds offer those kinds of portfolios, too, and none of the more

extreme ones standard finance theories imply for many investors. Perhaps the way to make sense

of the attenuation puzzle is to recognize that people do react to their own preferences and beliefs

when choosing their investment portfolios, but that reaction is greatly damped because of the

advice they receive (either from their advisors or from their peers; see Arrondel, Calvo-Pardo,

Giannitsarou and Haliassos, 2017, for the effect of peers on portfolio choice) and the products

offered, combined with limited attention to their own portfolios, strong inertia in portfolio, and

sensitive beliefs.
