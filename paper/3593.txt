         THE EFFECTS OF PENSIONS AND RETIREMENT POLICIES
                 ON RETIREMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION

                               STRACT


    A structural retirement model is estimated using data for

tenured, male faculty employed in the 1970's at 26 high quality

private colleges and universities.   Simulations of raising and

then abolishing the mandatory retirement age suggest very large
increases in full time work by faculty members in their late 60's

and early 70's.   Simulations also suggest that early retirement

incentive programs would offset only a small fraction of the
increase in work due to changes in mandatory retirement, and that

rents created by these programs exceed savings from induced early

retirements, with salaries of replacements further adding to
costs.

    The Effects of Pensions And Retirement Policies On Retirement In Higher Education.

                      By Alsn L. Oustmsn and Themes L. Steinmeier*


         Exits through retirement ere one of the importann labor market flows which

    ahape the sge structure of faculty, and help to determine the quality end coats

    of higher education. As a         result of perceived pressures from demographic


    changes,    as well as in reaction to a series of policy initiatives,            including a

    legal requirement that mandatory           retirement be eliminated in higher education

    after 1993, institutions of higher education have become increesingly interested

    in predicting and influencing retirement behavior of faculty, while exerting

    more control over the associated costs of compensation.

         Life cycle, structural econometric models of retirement have been used to

    analyme    analogous policy issues       at the national level (Fields and Mitchell,
    1984, Oustman and     Sreiniseier, 198ia,     Lumsdaine, Stock and Wise, 1990). These

    models     iirst spec ify and    eat imate the various components of the opportunity set.
    Then, based on the subsequent retirement behavior of those facing alternative
    opportunities, the patameteta of the utility function which underlie the
    tetitement decision ate estimated. Once the compunenta of a structutal
    tetitement model ate estimated, effects on retatement nutcames of policy changea
    may be     simulated (e.g.,     Ouatman and   Steinmeiet, lOll, iOSlb and fotnnnoming).
          In the present paper,        we   apply these techniques to analyce retirement
    aebaoror of     the   ena cc     ma1e    acalty employed or re iring n the 1ate 1970 a

    colleges     and universities in the country.          The estimated model fa used to

    analyte     the effects of early retirement incentives and changem in mandatoty

    retirement rules.       Although the sample is nat fully representative of higher

     education,    and the data are over a decade old, theme are the beet data available

where    t(t)        andL(t)            are consumption and leisure at time                   t,   and   T   is the

relevant       time horizon.            X      includes         age and a constant, which effect the

relative       weight of       leisure        in the utility function at time                t,    end   /   is   the

associated vector of parameters, which is presumed to be constant across both

time and individuals,                 5      (vich     &   -C   1) and         are time-invariant stochastic

terms reflecting, respectively, the elasticity of substitution between

consumption and leisure for each individual and the relative weight that the
individual places on leisure.

        This utility function is maximized with respect to consumption and leisure,

subj   ect to the lifetime budget constraint

                                 J    5tt       {y[L(t),t)         -   t(r))   dt   =


where     y[ ] .     is the function celaring compensation to leisure (end hence to                                work

effort)    ,
               and    r       is the real interest                rate.     The compensation function reflects

the effects of wages,                pensions,         end social security, with the effects of

pensions and social security calculated as the difference in the present value

of benefits attributable                     to additional work.

        The data used in the structural retirement analysis pertain to arts and

sciences faculty employed by these schools on December 31, 1975,                                    to retirees

from these schools from the 1973-74 academic year through the end of 1978, and

to the pensions and retirement programs reported by these schools in August,
1979.    For each faculty member employed ever the covered period, the following

information ia provided in the eurvey:                   date of birth; ccx; date of entry into

tenured track atatua; indicatora of tenure atatus; date of tenure; nine-month

salary rate; full or part-time status;                date il retirement, departure or

termination,         if appropriate; whether, in the case of a departure, it was due to

mandatory retirement; and other information about the faculty member.

Importantly,         however,   no information is available            on health status.          Each school

is identified.          For the 1979 period, pension plan provisions, early retirement

and flexible         retirement policies are reported for each school in separate COFHE

documents.       (These data have also been used by Blackburn and Schiftman, 1980,

and Southworth and Jagmin, 1979).               For later simulations, we have obtained

descriptions of these plans for 1989 direotoy trom the schools.

include retired worker benefits,           spouse benefits,                and survivor beneiita.

Required faculty pension contributions ate subtracted from wages.

        In   1979,    normal retirement (NE)        ,,ga    was 85 in 18 of the COFHE schools in

the sample,      66 in 1,       68 in 5, and   0    in     2.    From 1979 to 1989,      me    median nornal

retirement age remained at 65, hut five s-hoila reduced the normal retirement

age from 70 or 68 to 65.            Nardatory retirement (ER) ago was 65 in                   5   schools,   is

in 5 schools,         70 in 9 schools,    and   7   dId not report a mandatory retirement oga.

By 1989, mandatory retirement age was 70 at all 28 schools.                          Separate inS rro'i           -




is   also provided on the acmua application of mandatory retirement to each of
the cases in the sample       (Southworth and Jagmin,   1979).   Table   1   indicates   by   age

range the percentages of retirements which were mendatory.

    At seven      schools,   early retirement (ER) supplements were generally

available in 1979, and at 4 achools they were available on an ad hoc basic.                   The

availability of these programs has spread rapidly over time.             For the 1979

sample of twenty six schools,       at rho plan's early retirement age, pension wealth

amounts to 5.9 times yearly earnings.        At normal retirement age, the wealth-

yearly earnings ratio rises to 6.0 to one, and at mandatory retirement age,

pension wealth averages 6.6 times yearly earnings.          By   1999, formal early

retirement programs were available at 23 of 29 schools reporting to COFHE, with

ad hoc programs at      the other 6.

     Table    2   highlights the accrual of pensions and any early retirement

bonuses.     In calculating rho accrual profiles,       the table uses the average birth

date and wage profiles by institution and then weights the results by the number

of tenured faculty at each institution.         It can be seen from Table 2 that even


though we are dealing with defined contribution plans,           early retirement programs

available    at the schools create aignificant spikes in the accrual profile.

     The preratirement period is the five ysato preceding the year before

eligibility for early retirement benefits.         The ik spike is computed over rho

year in which eligibility for early retirement heneito is obtained, and the hR

spike is computed over the year before eligibility fot normal retirement

benefits is obtained.        Early Retirement is the period between the periods for

computing the ER spike and hR spike.         Finally,   Late Retirement is the period

between attaining eligibility for normal retirement benefits and mandatory

retirement.

     The sharp inctementa in the accrual rates reflect the attainment of

eligibility for eatly or normal retirement benefits, where eligibility is


                                            4
accompanied by a bonus.       In one plan,   for example,      those retiring early receive

60 percent of yearly salary between age 62 and 65.              On average, coveted

individuals hired at age 35 become eligible far a supplement worth 1.5 years of

salary when they reach the early retirement age.

      The survey also provides informarion on whether the individual was working

part time at the end of the survey or at the date of retirement, if earlier.                    If

more than lOt of retirements from a school are from part time work, partial

retirement is     aaaed   to be generally available at the school1.

      Consider now the structure of the dependent retirement variable.                 For many

of   those   in the sample,   it is possible to determine a sequence of outcomes for

six years.     For those who have retired,       there is information     on status just

before retirement. However,        the sample of retirees from COFHE schools is not a

true panel.      For those who were partially retired as of Oecember 31, 1978, the

duration of partial retirement is not reported.               Iniormation is not provided

indicating who partially retired after having left a state in which they worked

full-time    and whose lifetime job at the university involved part-time work,               In

an effort to distinguish partial retirees who reduced work effort from full-CImo

from those who were only part-time employees             during prime working age, the

sample   includes only tenured faculty.          An examination of the frequencies of

retirement and partial retirement between the ages of 40 and 60, indicates that

early leaving and part-time       work by tenured faculty are not very important in

the sample.      (The frequency   distribution of retirement sequences for the six

years covered by the survey are reported in an Appendix and in a report to the

Oepartment of Education, both of which are available on request.)

                                   II. Empirical    flq4gy
       Parameter eatimates     from the model are presented in Table 3, with

asptoric standard errors indicated in parentheses below each                 figure,    y and   p


are parameters of the distribution of        6    and   E.   The data were fit   to males in

                                             5
cohorts born from 1909 through 1912.            The estimation procedure follows Oustmsn

and Steinmeiet (l986a)      ,   with   one modification.     Those who retired before 1974

were not included in the sample.            Accordingly,     the estimation procedure attempts

to correct for selection due to prior retirements using early retirees               fcom

younger cohorts,      a correction that was not requited in our earlier work.              The

parameters are significant at standard levels2.               COFHE faculty retired later

than did workers coveted by the Retirement History Survey. By age 64, 39% of

healthy males in the RES without a pension had left full-time work, while only

14%    of all faculty in   the COFHE sample had.           These differences are reflected in

differences in the estimated constant,           but the coefficients estimated for the

effeots    of aging ate similar for the two        samples.      This suggests that although,

for any given opportunity set, the levels            of retirements ate higher in the 00FH

sample, the changes in retirement rates induced by a given incentive will be

similar.

       Simulation is accomplished by applying monte carlo techniques. For each

observation, five random draws ate taken for the stochastic terms                5   and         in
the utility function.           Table 4 simulates the percentages wotking full and part

time   by age using the pensions and         social security rules in place during the

sample period.       The percentages resulting       from a simple non-parametric hazard

model ate presented for comparison.            The model simulates the substantial drop in

work effort during the petiod fairly well, although it has some trouble

capturing the large increase in part time work after age 65.

       Table   S   presents the results of simulations which raise the mandatory

retirement age, holding other aspects of the compensation profile the same.                      The

first colwsn in the table uses the actual mandatory retirement ages observed in

the sample, while the following two columns raise the minimum mandatory

retirement age to 70 and eliminate it, respectively. Reflecting the frequency

with which individuals worked until mandatory retirement, as reported in Table
1,   these simulations suggest massive incteases            in full time work by faculty

members in their late go'5 and early 70's.              As a word of caution,   the

simulations in column    3   take us outside the age range of observetion for those

in the sample.     For that reason, and becauae we do not heve information on

health status, those results should be inerprered with some rare.

       Table 6 reports the effects of early rerirement supplements in conjunction

with the abserved 1969 pension plans, all of which specified age 70 as the

mandatory retirement age.       The first column simulates the plans with no early

retirement supplements, and the second column includes              the observed supplements

for each school,     A comparison of the two columns indicates           that if the early

retirement provisions in the pensions available              in 1989 were abolished, there

would be little overall efiert on obaerved early reriremenr behavior,                 These

incentives are ceak enoug:. rar        ci,   average    rrey had lirrle discernible impact on

retirement ouroomes

       The third column of the table examines rhe eifeurs oi uniiormly 'idopting

one school's    1989 early   retirement plan, whi h provides up to 40 perceur (1.331

per year of service)    of salary either up ro five years or until age 70,

whichever is sooner.      For this plan we find rhar there is some further reduction

in full rime work by faculty over 63               hut the effect is relatively ,cnall.    Inus

early retirement incentive plans do nor appear to be very efreorive, at least in

the COFHg schools.

       When the costs of the reriremeno plan are simulated, three elements crc of

importance:     the rent paid    '
                                     those   w'n    would have retired at younger ages on inc

basis of unchanging reriremenr honavior'              the reduction in costs due to

accelerated retirement by some highly paid faculty; and the cosim of replareuenr

faculty.      Our calculations (shown in the appendix,           available on request)

 indicate   that rents exceed the savings due to early rerirement, so that even

 ignoring the costs of replacement faculty,             this type of early retirement
incentive    plan will net be cost aaving.

                                   III. Conclusions

     The data used in this study ate old, are not etriotly longitudinal, ate

missing key pieces of infotmation,     on health status, family sttuoture, field of

specialization,    and post-retiteaent behavior outside the primary employer,      and

apply only to a limited and not representativesample of colleges and

universities. These limitations mean that the findings from this etudy ehould

be applied with osution.     Nevertheless,   the preceding analysis indicates     the

feasibility of adapting recent innovations in the retirement litetatute for

analysis    of retirement policies by institutions of higher eduoation.

     Simulations suggest that for the COFNE schools,      extending end then

eliminating mandatory retirement will lead a significant number of faculty to

postpone retirement.

     Some institutions of higher eduostion are oonsidering early retirement

incentive    programs which will have costs and benefits that are very sensitive to

the induced retirement responses.      For these plans to be oost saving,   the


savings     from induoing earlier retirement by higher paid senior faculty must

exceed    the costs from rents aooumulating on the basis of unohenging retirement
behavior end repleoement costs.      Cur   calculations suggest thsy will not.     An

obvious     alternative option whioh eight be considered in en effort to influenoe

faculty retirement is the adoption of a defined benefit plan, whioh is offered

at many public institutions of higher education,       and whioh nan create even

stronger early retirement incentives3.

     The effects of retirement incentives       crested by innovative retirement

programs,     the associated program costs, and implications of related policy

initiatives,     may all be analyzed with analytical tools that are currently

available. All that is required is the availability of the required dmta,

This paper is part of the NBER programs     in Labor Studies and Aging.   Any

opinions expressed are solely those of the authors.

1.   Although our estimates assume that partial retirement involves a reduction io

official hours at work, it is also possible that minimum hours coostraints may

be less binding in academia than elsewhere,

2. There were five observations in which individuols retired the year before

becoming eligible for early retiremeot bonuses worth an additional one or two

year's salary.     In a model such as the one used in this paper,   such an eveut

would occur only if the coefficient on age in the utility function were

implausibly high, implying almost no response of retirement behavior to economic

incentives. Since these five retirements may well be due to health problems

which,   in the absence of information on health status, cannot be controlled icr,

and since these observations would dominate     the rc:sulrs if they were included

these five observations are excluded from the sample.

3.   Defined benefit plans may carry special risks for those private institutions

which are highly dependent on endowment iocome, sod thus face correlated risks

in insuring their faculty against variation in returns to pension assets because

low returns may occur when the institution is least able to pay.      Moreover,

implications of defined benefit plans for penalties to mobile faculty,      who face

en up or out system, should be more carefully analyzed than they have been in

the higher education literature.

The Wage Equations.

       The dependent variable in Table Al is full-time, nine aonth salary of all

tenured males undet the age of 65.       Yeats of age and its square and years of

service and its square appear aa explanatory variables in all equations, and

have the expected effects.

       In Table Al, eight dummy variables have also been included,      one for each


year of probation (i.e., each year in the nontenured ranks at the institution),

with the final category for 7÷ years.          The omitted category is a six year

probation period.      A rero probation period means that the hiring is directly

into tenured status, and so forth.       Lateral hires clearly enjoy significantly

higher salaries.

       Grouped dummyvariablea measuring the probation period are also interacted

those who were hired  at  snore  senior level clearly en)oy highor   salaries, they
also experience  slower  growth in salaries.
     Twenty five  school  dummies group together all tenured faculty in each

school.    The largest and higheac paying of the twenty aix institutions is rhe

Retirement    Outcomes: Descriptive Data.

       Table A2, which includes only male tenured faculty,       reports on rho

 frequencies for sequences of retirement stares that are observed in the maple.

                                          13
Outcomes are reported over six obsearions, from the end of celendar yeat 1973

through the end of calendar year 1978, while the age of reference used is as               of
1974.

        These dare reveal that until age 60, there is virtually no retirement.

Among men, 97 percent of the 50 to 54 year olds in 1974 remain at full-time work

through 197g.       While 2.6 percent work parr-rime,        that is abour the same parcenr

that is found at younger ages.

        Over the period of observation among those 55 to 59 years of aga in 1974,

rha fraction remaining at full-rime          work over the next five years falls to 69

percent.     The fraction reporting any pert-time work rises ro 5.4 percent.           The

sharpest transitions are observed among those who were 40 to 64 in 1974, with

the number remaining at full time work by December of 1976 felling to 33

percent.     18.1 percent in this age group report some parr-rime work.          For those

who were 65 to 69 in the first year for which reported informericn is eveileble,

only 2.8 percent remain at full-rime work by December of 1978.

        Consider    some basic problems with the date,       which we deal with in our

report to the Department of Sducetion,             upon which rhis article is based.   The

RP.RRRR    eequence does not appear in the dare.         That means ther any iecnlry   who

bed   retired prior to     1974   will nor   be included in the   dete. This omission    is
important for older feculry.          Some   related sequences are also censored. There
are   problems in determining the derails of any sequence           that included part-time

work prior to the leer period observed.              If the lest period of work is full-

time, we essuee thet all previous periods were,             although there may be some rare

exceptions.        But when the lest period is pert-time work, the nature of the

remainder of the sequence cennot be deduced,             end rhet means we will heve no

direct information on duretion of pertiel retirement.

        Also the sequences sey nothing about the neture of work eftec leaving the



                                              14
main job.   We can only attribute a default level of utility to wotk when not on

the main job, but cannot diatinguiah among individuala on the basis of

activities once having left the primary employer.

     Retirement flowa (transition rates) between any two years conform to flows

from the states of full-time,   part-time or retired to these same three states in

the following year.   Reverse   flows, from part-time work to full-time work and

from full-retirement to part-time work and full-time work are ruled our, so thar

retirement is an absorbing state.    Therefore, the probability of being retired

in a later year, giver, retirement in an earlier year, is 1.

     As seen from the bottom    rows of each panel   in Table   A2, there is incomplete

information on all sequences which involve a period of partial retirement, and

in addition,   due to the scheme for data collection, anyone who retired before

1974 is lost to the sample.
