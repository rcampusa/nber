1.   Introd'ction

      The extent to which a firm's capital structure influences

capital accumulation has long been a contested theoretical and empirical

issue. On the theoretical side work by Stiglitz [21], King [15],

Feldstein, Green and Sheshinski [8], Auerbach [2] and Brock and

Turnovsky [4] has investigated how alternative financing sources affect

the capital stick selected by the firm. However, in these papers it

is assumed that the capital stock can be intantaneously adjusted so

that capital is treated as a variable factor of production.

       There is another view (see Lucas [17], Gould [10], Nussa [19]

and Treadway [24]) which postulates that the process of capital

accumulation involves the firm incurring adjustment costs. In this

framework capital is not instantly variable but rather it is a quasi—

fixed factor, which is altered by the investment decisions. Investment

functions are generated, which are increasing functions of the demand

price of installed capital.

       In this paper, by integrating the two approaches, we are able to

analyze the influence that the capital structure exerts on investment

undertaken by the firm. We develop a model with two quasi—fixed

factors——the standard plant and equipment (P&E) capital and research and

development (R&D) capital. We are able to characterize the behavior of

investment over time and establish the existence, uniqueness and

stability of the long run equilibrium.

       Financial and real decisions are interrelated in the sense that

the firm determines its debt—equity ratio, capital accnulation and

labor requirements by maximizing the initial share value. We then
                                                                              2



establish that this program is equivalent to finding the debt—equity

raLio which minimizes the cost of capital and labor requirements

which maximize net operating revenues. The firm then uses the maximized

net operating revenues and the minimized cost of capital to determine

the real investment demands and thereby its capital accumulation plans.

       The growth of the capital stocks Is governed by the difference

between the marginal values of Installed to uninstalled capital. The

higher the marginal value of installed relative to uninstalled capital

the greater the demand for investment. The value of the marginal product

denotes the value of installed capital, while the marginal installation

costs and the cost of capital characterize the value of uninstalled

capital. The latter depends on the level of investment, the debt—equity

ratio, the interest and depreciation rates and the price of investment

products. The value of the maginal product, depends ,n the stocks of

the quasi—fixed factors, the relative price of the variable factors of

production and the product price.

      Most studies on R&D treat it as a variable input in the production

process (see Nadiri [20] and Grlliches [11] and the references cited

Liierein).   Recently,   though, Nadirl and Bftros [21] developed a partial

cdjustment model with R&D and Schankerman and Nadiri [22] constructed

a model with R&D as the sole quasi—fixed factor. In this paper we

derive, from intertemporal maximization, and estimate investment demand

functions for two quasi—fixed factors, P&E and R&D capital. Moreover,

in none of these studies was the purpose to determine the influence

of alternative financing sources on capital accumulation.
                                                                             3




      Empir .al evidence for the proposition that financial concerns

a fect R&D investment is mixed. There are only a few studies which have

examined the impact of the capital structure on R&D (see Elliot [6] and

Howe and McFetrldge [13].) However, in both of these studies an

intertemporal maximizing model of firm    behavior   was not the basis for

the estimated equation and, in particular, for the hypothesized

relationship between capital stiucture and R&D.

      Research examining the influences of financial behavior on

investment in plant and equipment has recently been undertaken by Engle

and Foley [7], Von Furstenberg [28], Von Furstenberg, Malkiel and

Watson [29] and Summers [24). These studies, relying to various

degrees on a dynamic model of the firm,   have   shown that industry and

sectoral investment demand is significantly affected by changes in the

share market values.
                                                      .
      Our empirical results, based on a pooled time series, cross—

section sample of 49 firms, suggest that the debt—equity ratio exerts

a significant but small impact on P&E and R&D investment. In both

cases the effect is quite inelastic. In addition, for an increase in

the debt—equity ratio, the short—run response for both types of

investment are quite similar. As time evolves, however, the effect on

P&E becomes relatively stonger, with the long—run result that the

percentage decrease in P&E capital is substantially greater than for

R&D capital.

      Tests were conducted to determine cross—section variations and

cross—equation correlations. We found that the disturbance terms for

the R&D and P&E investment functions were correlated. Moreover, there
                                                                          4



were interfirm differences in these equations. Interestingly, the

firms which exhibited distinct P&E investment demands were not the same

group with differences in R&D.investment. Therefore, the majority of

firms did not have an identical pair of P&E and R&D Investment demand.

      In section 2 the model is developed, section 3 deals with the

short run equilibrium, while sectIon 4 pertains to the dynamics and the

long run equilibrium. The empirical work bgIns In section 5, with the

model implementation, and in section 6 we describe the data. Section 7

contains the econometric results and we then conclude.



2. The Model

      To begin our analysis of the firm's investment and financing

decisions, we assume the technology is governed by


(1)          y(t) =
                      F[Kp(t)Kr(t)L(t))
                                                                                                            5



where y(t) is output, F is the twice continuously differentiable

production function, with positive and diminishing marginal products;

K(t) is the stock of plant and equipment (P&E); K(t) is the stock of

research and development (R&D); L(t) is the labor services input. All

variables are evaluated in period t.

      We assume that the services emanating from the capital stocks are

proportional to the stocks themselves.

      The flow of funds of the firm is



(2)                   p(t)y(t) —           w(t)L(t)        —   A[I(t)]         —
                                                                                   E[Ir(t)]
                      -                    +    B(t)   +   s(t)     -   D(t)    = 0
                           rb(t)B(t)

where p(t) is the output price; w Ct) is the wage rate; A is the twice

continuously differentiable trictly convex P&E ros"s investment cost

function with A(O) =           A'(O)        =   0,   A1 >      0,   A" >   0 for 1(t) > 0;       E is the

twice continuously differentiable R&D gross investment cost function with

E(0) =   E'(0)    =   0,   E' >   0,       E" > 0 for 1(t) >                            is the interest
                                                                         O;rb(t)
rate on corporate debt; B(t) is the change in the value of outstanding

debt, s(t) is the value of new sharesand D(t) are dividends.2

      The firm accumulates P&E and R&D according to



(3)                                K =1 —6K,K(0)>0

where 0 <        < 1, 0 <         < 1,      are the fixed depreciation rates for P&E and

R&D respectively.3
                                                                                          6



      In the determination of share accumulation, we assume as in

Auerbach [2] and Feldstein, Green and Sheshinski [8] that the rate of

return on equity is dependent on the debt—equity ratio. The larger the

debt—equity ratio the higher the rate of return that the shareholders

require. We formulate this feature by



(5)                        r + H(v)          =   D/pN   +   pip,
where r is the net rate of return, H(v) is the premium required by

shareholders when the firm undertakes to issue bonds, where v =                    B/pN
and H' >   0,   H" >

      The rate of return on shares is comprised of the dividends per

share plus (minus) any capital gains (losses). Let S =                  pN,   so

S =        + p14 and by the definition ofswe must have s =                         then
                                                                          p5N
equation (5) can be rewritte as



(6)                        S =     [r   +   H(v)]   S — D +   .
The corporate share value changes by the return on existing shares plus

any new   share   issues minus any distributions to the shareholders.

      We assume that the firm maximizes the initial value of equity,

which means that decisions are made in the interest of the shareholders.

The initial value is obtained by solving for S(0) from (6);



(7)                S(0)    f   e            rdu[D - H(v)S     - s]dt.
                                                                                                 7



The initial share value equals the present value of the stream of

Hividends minus both the premium paid to shareholders when there is

outstanding' debt and any dilution from new share issues.

        The program for the firm is obtained by maximizing the right side

of equation (7) subject to (1), (2), (3), (4) and (6). The Hamiltonian

for this problem is

There are, in addition toequations (3) and (4), the transversalityand

the Legendre—Clebsch (or second order) conditions.

        Let us investigate the nature of the firm's intertemporal plan.

First, we can see that the determination of the real and financial

decisions are recursive. The debt—equity ratio is found from (9.4),

(9.7) and (9.8). This debt—equity ratio minimizes the cost of capital.

The firm then utilizes this cost of capital to determine the real

capital accumulation paths.

       To establish the above conclusion note from (9.4) that 1 —                            =
                                                                                        q4       —q3
where q4 is the cost per dol,Jçar of equity, -q3 is te cost per

dollar of debt. From (9.2) (or (9.3)) 0 <
                                                             q4
                                                                   <   1.   Thus the cost of

financing a dollar of real capital is divided between the debt and

equity instruments, since 1 =                 +
                                     -q3           q4.

       By combining (9.7) and (9.8) and since q3 =
                                                   q4,


(10)                      r + H(v)        =        +     H' (1 +   v).

The adjusted rate of return on equity equals the interest rate on

corporate debt adjusted for the marginal premium needed in light of the

higher debt—equity ratio. Equation (10) is a single equation which can

be solved for one unknom, the debt—equity ratio. This debt—equity

ratio minimizes the cost of capital. Define r(v) =             [r   +   H(v)   •'•

                                                                                     vrb]/
(1 +    v)   as the cost of capital. Minimizing r with respect to v yields

                                    =         + Ht
                                         rb

where r0 is the minimwn cost of capital. Substituting r° into the

definition of ,r yields equation (10) -         Notice that if rb and r are constant
then the debt-equity ratio isconstant for all time.

        Second, the labor input decision given by (9.1) is devoid of any

intertemporal considerations. Since 1 —              > 0,   at each instant the

value of the marginal product is equal to the factor price. The

implication is that we can carry out our analysis in terms of operating

and capital decisions. First, the firm maximizes net operating

revenues, given the capital stocks and prices. This step yields a labor

input demand which depends o1the stocks, Qf, P&E, R&D.,.?nd w/p. To see

The solution can be denoted as L = g (K, K, w/p).

        Substituting the input demand function into the net operating

revenue equation, yields the indirect variable profits function



    R(K, K, w /p) =       p   F(K, K, g(K, K, wlp)) — w g(K, Kr w/p).



Using the indirect variable profits function and the minimized cost of

     We can summarize the firm's program in the following manner. First

it determines the labor requirements, conditional on the stocks of R&D

and P&E, by maximizing net operating revenues. Second, the debt—equity

decision is taken which miniiizes the costof .capitl. Finally, the.

real investment demands and the capital accumulation plans are deter-

mined (by using the maximized net operating revenues, the minimized cost

of capital) through maximizing the present value of the flow of funds

associated with the two types of real capital.



 3. ihe Short—Run Equilibrium


     The short—run equilibrium for the firm is denoted by equations

(9.1), (9.2) and (9.3). These equations are independent of each other

because labor does not involve any intertemporal considerations and the

investment costs oriy depend on their respective investment flow.

     Consider the labor demand. If we assume that increases in the

stocks of P&E and R&D increase the marginal product of labor, then with
                                                                                        11



 diminishing marginal products, increases in the stocks increase labor

 demand. In addition, an increase in the real wage decreases labor

 requirements. Thus



 (11)                L =   g(K,   K, w/p);g1 >0, g2 >0,          g3
                                                                      0.




         The short run investment demand functions for P&E and R&D are given

 by (9.2) and (9.3) respectively. We find' that,



 (12.1)                       I =   I(q/i    —
                                                 q4)
                                                       I' > 0



 (12.2)                                      —         J' > 0.
                             'r =   J(q2/l       q4)


Gross investment demand is forward looking and each one is an increasing

function of its respective demand price and a decreasing function of the

per dollar cost of financing the additions to the real capital stocks.

An alternative interpretation of equation sot (12) is that with the

price of uninstalled capital normalized to unity, 1 -
                                                                      q   is the

marginal cost of uninstalled capital. Hence investment is an increasing

function of the marginal value of installed capital relative to the

marginal cost of uninstalled capital. Therefore gross investment isv.

determined by a mechanism similar to Tobin's [23 1                (see also Abel [ii
and   Hayashi    [121)     "q" theory where, in our context,              =
                                                                      q       q1/l—q4
and q     =
              q2/l-q4.

4. The Dynamics and the Long—Run Equilibrium


        In order to be able to characterize the dynamic behavior of the

firm and the long—run equilibrium, we must investigate equation set (9).
                                                                                                              12
First, equation (10) suxnina±jzes equations (9.4), (9.7) and (9.8).

Second, differentiating (9.2) and (9.3) with respect to time results in

 (13.1)                         q4 A' - (1 -                         +              0
                                                           q4)A"I        q1=

 (13.2.)                        q4 E' - (1 —                  E"I +             =    0.
                                             q4)                          q.2



 substituting (9.2), (9.8), (10), and (11) and (14.1) into (9.5) provides

  is with the differential equation for P&E investment

  (14) A"(I) I = (rb + H'(v) +                        6)A'(I)        —
                                                                         PF(K           K, g(K, K, v/p)).

  One interpretatio" 0F             equation          (14) is that when the rtarainal return on

  new capital, which is (rb +                 H' + cS)A',          exceeds the marginal value of exist--

  ing capital, which is PFI                   then    gross investment increases such that Ii,> 0.

  The converse holds when the marginal return on existing capital exceeds that

  on new capital. Clearly, when the marginal returns are equal no additional

  gross investment is undertaken.

        Similarly we can determne the differential equation for R&D

 investment, by using (9.3), (9.8), (10), (11) and (13.2) in (9.6),

 (15)      E"(Ir)Ir =       (rb     +   H'(v)     +   n)   E'(Ir)    —
                                                                         PFr(1(p) Kr) g(K, K, vip)).

 Notice     that since the debt-equity ratio is determined from (10) then the

 remaining endogenous variables affecting the path of P&E investment is the

 P&E investment flow and                the   two types of real capital.

        ihe dynamic behavior of the firm can now be summarized into four

 fqu:ions, (3), (4), (14) and (15). Let us first determine whether or

 not there exists a unique long—run equilibrium. Suppose K =                                            = 0
                                                                                                   Kr

 then I =
           p
                 K ,
                  p
                       Ir       K r, and so I =
                                                       p
                                                              Ir     0. Thus at K = K
                                                                                           p   r
                                                                                                   =    0,

 equations (14) and (15) become

 (16)          (rb +   }i'(v)   -   ó)A'      (   K)    =   PF(K,        Kr) g(K, K, w/p))



 (17)          (rb +   H'(v) +n)E' (Kr) =
                                                            PFr(Kp)Kr) s(K Kr) w/p)).
                                                                                 13



The long—run equilibrium levels of the real capital stocks are those

which simultaneously solve equations (16) and (17). Let us denote these
            e   e
values as (K , K ).
                p r
       The immediate problem is to find the unique solution. To this end

we differentiate (16) and (17),


        dK .                             pr
                                        (F F -F F )
                                                     prU                 >0.
           r p=0 EFPPFU —
                                   F     —
                                              (rb+   H'+ )(A" ó FU/p)]

                                   —
(19) —p
        dK .           =   EFrrF        F2—   (rb + H' + )(Et' r F/p)]
                                                                         >0.
           rr                      (F         —
                                                  pr U)

Hence in (Kr K) space equations (16) and (17) define direct

relationships between the real capital stocks which is illustrated in

Figure 1. Moreover, from (16) as K + 0 since A'(O) = 0 and by assuming

F(O, K, L)            0 then the locus, defined by (16), in,tersects the

K — axis.         From equation (17), as Kr + 0 since E'(O) = 0 and by

assuming Fr (K, 0, L) > 0 then the curve intersects the Kr —             axis.
       In order for there to exist a unique long—run equilibrium the

curves depicted in Figure 1 must intersect only once. A set of

sufficient conditions for this to occur are that


(20)
                        F&_ F> FpFr•_ Fpr F i =                  ' r.
If th marginal products of each of the inputs diminish in sufficient

magnituie, then the above inequalities are satisfied. We then have



         dK   .

                       <1,dKYK >1
           r p=O               r r=0


and therefore a unique long-run equilibrium.

           The stability of the long—run equilibrium is illustrated in

Figure 2. Figure 2 is a four quadrant diagram which contains Figure 1

in the (K, K) space. The two remaining spaces to analyze are

(I, K) and (I, K).

        First consider (I, K). From equation (3), we find --p =                                1   >0,

       =   —6   < 0    and therefore



                                   = 1/is >        0.
(21)
                           p p0

The K = 0 locus is a straight line through the origin with the slope of

1/6 and above the line K <            0, while below K > 0.
                       p                                              p

        Next, from equation (14) at I =                     0,   Kr = Ke and with the conditions

defined by (20),

                              F    (rb +H'+is)
(22)
                dK .      =                                  A<0.
                 p p=o        p(F F —
                                PP'           F
                                              P    ,    )
                   K=Ke
                    r r


Hence the I = 0 locus is negatively sloped. In addition, since

F(0, K, L) > 0 and at I = 0,A' =                                  +   H' + 6)   >   0 then the I     0
                                                       PF/(r
locus intersects the I — axis. To determine the movement when the firm
                     p
is off the I = 0 curve, we know from (14) that


        pKr=K: = FUA"             [FPPFU —                  >    0.
                                                  F:Q]
Therefore I > 0 for points above the I = 0 locus and I < 0 for points
          p                                                 p                       p
below the curve. In a similar fashion we can derive the nature of the

 5. The Empirical Implementation


       The equations summarizing the dynamic behavior of the firm are

denoted by (3), (4), (14) and (15). We assume that (3) and (4) are

non—stochastic and use these equations to define the stocks of P&E and

R&D respectively. In order to carry out the estimation of equations

(14) and (15), we must specify the investment cost functions

E(I), the function denoting the premium on the rate of return to

shareholders, when debt financing is used, H(v), and the production

function F(K, K, L). We define
                                                  -

equations in terms of the logarithms of the investment flows.                          The

solution to these equations depends on the time paths of the debt-equity

ratio, the prices, the interest rate, output and the capital stocks.

For simplicitly, as •in other dynamic models (see Morrison and Berndt

[18]), we assume static expectations.8 Hence (27) and (28) are first

log 1    with   constant coefficients.9 The solutions

 From equations (31) and (32) we have established that investment (for

 either P&E or R&D) in any period depends directly on its past value,

 inversely on the financing costs (represented, in particular, by the

 debt-equity ratio) and directly on the utilization of the existing

 stock, as represented by the sales -to asset ratio.1'




 6. The Data


       Annual data on several variables were collected from a variety of

sources indicated below for the period 1959—1966 for forty—nine firms.

The selection of firms was dictated by the availability of consistent

time series data on R&D expenditures and the stock of R&D. The pooled

Lime—series cross section sample was designed to provide a richer set of

information in which to estimate the functions under consideration.
                                                                          20



     The list of variables and their construction are: Plant and

equipment (K) is the measure of net stock generated by a perpetual

inventory formula


                     K(t) =    1(t)   + (1 — 6)   K(t — 1)


where 1(t) equals actual expenditures on plant and equipment deflated

by the price of investment in P&E. Investment in P&E and its associated

price (p) were obtained from the McGraw—Hill data series, with the

depreciation rate for each firm calculated by summing over time

depreciation allowances divided by the gross plant and equipment and

then dividing this sum by the number of time periods. The stock of

R&D (Kr) was obtained from a similar procedure,



                     K(t)      rr(t) ÷ (1    n)K(t

Investment   in R&D (I) and its associated price (p) were obtained from
McGraw—Hill data series and we arbitrarily chose rj = .1 to measure the

depreciation rate for the stock of knowledge. Debt (B) was obtained

from Standard and Poor's data series for long term corporate debt.

Equity (S) was also obtained from Standard and Poor's series for the

closing common share price multiplied by the number of outstanding

common shares. Sales (py) figures were obtained from the Nc—Graw Hill

data series.


 7. The Empirical Results


     In order to render equations (31) and (32) stochastic, we add a

random disturbance term   to   each equation. Moreover, to reflect the fact
                                                                                     21




that the equations can vary among the firms in the sample, because of

technological differences, we add to A and B parameters which are

firm—specific. Thus (31) and (32) become,



(33)                 log I(j,t) =       A(j)   + A1 log I(j,t—l) + A2 log   v(j,t)

                                      + A3 log v(j,t) log I(j,t-l)


                                      + A4
                                             p(j,t)K(j,t-l) + u(j,t)


 (34)                log I(j,t) =       B(j)   + B1 log Ir(Jt_l) + B2 log v(j,t)


                                      + B3 log v(j,t) log 'r (j,t—l)

                                                                        pr

       The estimation results for P&E investment are presented in Table

1. In this estimation we have assumed that a0(j) =                                b0(j) =
                                                                         a0(k),               b0(k)
for j,k =   1,... ,49.     Initially we impose the restriction that the

equations are identical across firms. In Table 1 there are two sets

of estimates. The first row refers to the results from estimating

equation (33) and the second row refers to a restricted version with

       a2, which implies that c =            1       in equation (23), and so A2 =            in
                                                                                         A3
equation (33). We see that all estimates have the correct sign and

the equation fits the data quite well. In addition, from the

unrestricted equation, we are unable to reject the hypothesis that

A2 = A3.    Thus, imposing the restriction we see from the second row

that all estimates are significant. In particular, increases in the

debt—equity ratio do indeed decrease P&E investment.

       Due to the presence of the interaction between agged investment

and the debt—equity ratio the elasticity varies over the sample. The

formula for the short—run elasticity is


                         slog I(j,t)
(35)           ev =                      =                log I(j,t—1))

value of the short—term elasticity is -              .028, while the mean value in

the long run is —.193. Thus, in the short run an increase in the

debt—equity ratio of 1% leads to a decrease in P&E investment by .028%,

while in the long run an increase of 1% leads to a decrease in the P&E

capital stock by —. 193%.           As expected, the long—run elasticity exceeds

the short—run. Moreover, both effects are inelastic, with the short—run

highly inelastic, but nevertheless significant.

      Turning to the results for R&D investment, we see from Table 2

that the estimation of the restricted version of equation (34) elicits

significant coefficients with the correct sign. Once again the fit is

quite strong. An interesting feature is that changes in the debt—equity

ratio do indeed exert a significant impact on R&D investment. The

short—run elasticity is

impact of a percentage Increase In the debt—equity ratio causes the

percentage decrease in P&E investment to be approximately 65% greater

than the percentage decrease in R&D investment. As time passes, the

spread in percentage changes enlarges, such that in the long run the

mean value of P&E capital elasticity with respect to the debt—equity

ratio is approximately double the R&D capital elasticity.

        Differences in investment demand functions among firms can arise

through the different production technologies. In order to account for

any cross section variations, we drop the assumption that the intercepts

in equations (33) and (34) are the same for all firms. In our sample

the 49 firms are classified into 10 different 2—digit SIC groupings.

Hence we introduce 9 binary variables into the regression equations.

The 10 different firm groupings are represented as 10 different

equations, for each investmentcategory,'with the èqution differences

reflected through the binary variable coefficients.

       The single equation estimates of this covariance model for the

restricted version of the P&E investment equation are presented in

Table 3. We find that the nonbinary variable coefficients have the

correct sign, they are significant and the fit is good. The coefficient

on the debt—equity ratio is —.005 as opposed to —.008 as found in Table

1. Thus, the mean value of the short—run elasticity is now —.017 and

the mean value for the long—run is —. 103.      The introduction of cross

section variations in P&E investment has caused the effects emanating

from changes in the debt—equity ratio to become weaker. This occurs

in the short and long runs with the short—run elasticity falling by 40%

and   the long—run decreasing by roughly 47%.

     With respect to the interfirm differences we see that there is

a suggestion of cross section variation arising from groups 3, 4 and 8

represented respectively by the binary variables d2, d3 and d4.

      Table 3 also shows the restricted R&D Investment demand estimation.

The fit, signs, significance and values of the nonbinary variable

coefficients is similar to those found in Table 2. In addition, unlike

the case for P&E the mean value of the short—run elasticity has not

changed, it is still —.017. The mean value of the long—run elasticity

Is now —.06. Therefore, we find that the long—run effect of a change

In the debt—equity ratio, as for P&E, has significantly decreased with

the introduction of cross section differences. Interestingly, a 1%

increase in the debt—equity ratio causes the same decrease, in the

short run, for P&E and R&D investment. However, as time evolves the

effect on P&E capital increases relative to the effect on R&D capital,

such that in the long run the debt—equity elasticity of P&E is 72%

larger than for R&D.

      The binary variables also illustrate that groups 5, 7 and 9

(as represented by d4, d6 and d8) exhibit technological differences

such that their R&D investment demand equations are distinct from the

cross section average.. In fact, with group 9 d8 =   .750, and therefoe
the distinct technology for this group causes the intercept in its

R&D equation to be —.049 + .750   .701, which is significantly above

the average value of —.049.

      We have proceeded in the estimation as if the P&E and R&D

investment equations are independent of each other. However, as they

are both derived from the same dynamic program characterizing firm
                                                                             29



behavior, it seems reasonable to expect some stochastic relationship to

be present between the equations. Thus, we drop the assumption that

EEu ut] = 0 and now assume that E[u u] = a   I, where a     is the
   pr                              pr      pr          pr
covariance between the disturbance terms of the two investment equations.

      Equations (33) and (34) are now seemingly unrelated regression

equations and are jointly estimated by maximum likelihood to account for

the cross equation correlation among the disturbance terms. We also

include the binary variables to account for the cross section

differences within each equation. The estimates are presented in

Table 4.

      The effect of changes in the debt—equity ratio on P&E investment

in the short run is the same as when the equations were estimated

separately, that is, —.017. However, the mean value of the long—run

elasticities is now —.088. Ths shows a significant decline in the

long—run magnitude from the single equation estimate of —.103. The

effects on R&D do not change when joint estimation is undertaken. The

short— and long—run elasticities are, respectively, —.017 and —.06.

Therefore, we can summarize our findings on the debt—equity effects

in the following way. An increase in tb ratio initially causes the

same response on P&E and R&D investment. As time passes, though, the

P&E effect becomes relatively larger, and indeed in the long run the

effect is about 47% greater for P&E compared to R&D capital. Nevertheless,

for both types of capital the effects, both short— and long—run, are

highly inelastic.

      In the context of joint estimation, cross section variations have

also become significant for both types of investment. For P&E, groupings
                                                                             30.

3, 4 and 8 exhibit differences from the cross section average.

Groupings 3 and 4 invest in P&E more than the average. Indeed, the

intercept term for group 3 is more than twice as large as the average.

The investment for group 8 is smaller, with an intercept of —.189

compared to the average of .296.

      R&D investment shows interfirm differences. As observed in single

equation estimates, group 9 invests in R&D substantially more than the

average. Now we also find a tendency for groups 5 and 7 to significantly

vary from the average, with theirR&D investment levels larger. A

final interesting result is that, not only are there cross section

differences, but the firms that have different P&E investment demand

functions are not those which have difference R&D investment demand

functions. Taken together, the package of P&E and R&D equations for

each grouping appears to be qu'ite



8, Conclusion

      In this paper we developed a dynamic model of firm behavior which

integrates real and financial decisions. The firm, at each instant,

determines its labor requirements, the debt—equity ratio and the real

investment demands for plant and equipment and research and development.

Although the firm determines these elements simultaneously by maximizirg

the initial value of equity, in effect the decision process is

sequential. The debt—equity ratio is found by minimizing the cost of

capital and the labor input emanates from the maximization of net

operating revenues. Gathering these two parts permits us to

characterize the accumt1ation of the real capital stocks.
                                                                          33



      The estimated equations derived from the theoretical model have

the property that investment demand depends on the lagged Investment

flow, the cost of additional capital (as reflected by the debt—equity

ratio), and the utilization of the existing capital stock as measured

by the sales to asset ratio for each particular type of real capital.

The equations were estimated to account for the statistically

significant cross equation and cross section differences. For both P&E

and R&D the debt—equity ratio significantly affects the investment

demands and the elasticities are highly inelastic. In addition, the

effect is stronger for P&E than for R&D capital in the long run, while

the effects on P&E and R&D investment are quite similar in the short

run.The impact of a percentage Increase in the debt—equity ratio causes

the percentage decline in P&E capital to be approximately one and one

half times the percentage decrase in R&D.

           1. We can view P&E investment costs as reflecting a constant

price, p. and installation costs. The latter are represented by
                                                                                C(I)
which is increasing and strictly convex. Thus, A(I)
                                                                    pI + C(I).
Following the discussion of Mussa [19] the installation costs are

internal, although separable from the capital stocks and labor.

           2. We assume that the lending and borrowing interest rates on

corporate debt are identical. In addition, we assume that there is

only one type of bond and share.

           3. Henceforth we drop the symbol (t) for notational convenience.

           4. The function 11(v) summarizes, in a simple way, the

bankruptcy costs resulting from the firm's choiceof a debt—equity

ratio. See Gordon [9] and Linner [16].

           5.       We assume that F   > 0, so that now all cross partial
                                    pr
derivatives are positive.

           6. We cannot illustrate the dynamic path of the firm because the

I = 0      locus depends on I , K and K ,      while   the I      0 locus depends
 p                           p   p     r                    r
on I , K and K

           7. The functions satisfy the properties needed in the

specification of the model. The production function is a first order

logarithmic approximation to any arbitrary production function and we

do not restrict the degree of returns to scale.

           8. An alternative would be to use equation set (12) which

relates P&E and R&D investment respectively to q                q111 — q4 and
     =          —         These-are the shadow pricesdefining Tobin's q's for
         q2/1       q4.
                                                                           35



each type uf capital. However, in order to obtain observable variables

or the shadow prices, the share value of the firm (S) must be

homogeneous of degree 1 in the capital stocks, labor services and the

investment flows (see 1-Iayashi [12] and Summers [24]). This implies

that the technology must exhibit constant returns to scale, unit

adjustment costs are homogeneous of degree 0 in the respective

investment flow and capital stock, and the debt to asset ratio is fixed.

Clearly, at the firm level, the assumption of constant returns to scale

is quite restrictive. In addition, the fixed debt—asset ratio abstracts

from the financing decision and its influence on capital accumulation,

which we are attempting to test.

       9. The static expectations assumption yields investment

equations which are of the accelerator variety. In our context the

accelerator is in terms of the'logarithmsof investmett. For the

theoretical development of the accelerator model see Treadway [27]

and for empirical surveys see Eisner [5] and Jorgenson [14].

      10. We are treating (rb + 5 + y) and (rb + ri + y) as parameters.

This seems reasonable given that the terms do not vary over the firms,

and 5, r and y do not vary over time. In addition, rb is relatively

constant over this period.

      11. In the "q" approach to estimating investment functions It

has been found that investment is related to the lagged value of q

rather than to the contemporaneous value (see Summers [24]). This

result is not predicted by the theory and indeed may be quite

troublesome. The reason is that by relating investment to the lagged

value of the   ratio   of the shadow prices of installed to uninstalled

capital involves an assumption concerning the firm's expectations, which

is not explicitly accounted for in the theory.
