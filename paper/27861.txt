                                         ABSTRACT

We incorporate regime switching between monetary and fiscal policies in a general equilibrium
model to explain three stylized facts: (1) the positive stock-bond return correlation from 1971 to
2000 and the negative one after 2000, (2) the negative correlation between consumption and
inflation from 1971 to 2000 and the positive one after 2000, and (3) the coexistence of positive
bond risk premiums and the negative stock-bond return correlation. We show that two distinctive
shocks---the technology and investment shocks---drive positive and negative stock-bond return
correlations under two policy regimes, but positive bond risk premiums are driven by the same
technology shock.

                        THE BOND MARKET AND FISCAL-MONETARY POLICY                                       1

                                            I. Introduction

     Empirical studies have documented the time-varying correlation between returns on the
market portfolio of stocks and those on long-term (5-10 years) nominal Treasury bonds
(Campbell et al., 2016; Christiansen and Ranaldo, 2007; Guidolin and Timmermann, 2007;
Baele et al., 2010; David and Veronesi, 2013; Gourio and Ngo, 2016). This correlation was
positive before 2000 but turned negative afterwards (Panel A of Figure 1).1 At the same
time, the correlation between consumption growth and inflation also changed sign around
2000 from negative to positive (Panel B of Figure 1). In addition, the risk premiums of long-
term nominal Treasury bonds remain positive before and after 2000 as shown in Section
II.

       Panel A: Stock-bond return correlation           Panel B: Consumption-inflation correlation

Notes: Panel A of this figure reports the correlation between the value-weighted market return and the
return on the 5-year (zero coupon) nominal Treasury bonds from 1971 to 2018 in annual frequency. The
correlation is estimated based on daily returns for each year. We use the data on the 5-year zero-coupon
Treasury bonds from G¨  urkaynak et al. (2007), which begins in 1971. Panel B displays the correlation of
real consumption growth and inflation (the consumption-inflation correlation). The correlation in year t
is computed with the data within the 5-year period (i.e., [t 2, t + 2] centering at t). Real consumption
growth is based on quarterly real personal consumption expenditures per capita, and inflation is based on
the quarterly GDP deflator. Both data series are obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.


     To account for the sign changes observed in both the financial market and the real economy,
we develop a general equilibrium framework that incorporates a regime switching from the
monetary regime (the M regime) to the fiscal regime (the F regime). We follow Leeper et al.
(2017) and model the M regime as active monetary policy and passive fiscal policy and the

 Campbell et al. (2020) run a Quandt Likelihood Ratio (QLR) test for an unknown break date based on
the relationship between inflation and the output gap, the relationship between the nominal Federal Funds
rate and the output gap, and the relationship between returns on stocks and long-term bonds for the sample
from 1979Q3 until 2011Q4. They find that the break occurred in 2001Q2, 2000Q2, and 2000Q4, respectively.
Thus, we follow Campbell et al. (2020) and choose 2000 as the break year.

F regime as active fiscal policy and passive monetary policy. Monetary policy is modeled as
a simple Taylor rule, in which the short-term nominal interest rate reacts to inflation and
output gap positively. The policy rate reacts to inflation more than one-for-one under active
monetary policy, while less than one-for-one under passive monetary policy. We follow Leeper
(1991) and model fiscal policy as a lump-sum tax rule that reacts to government outstanding
debt and output. Under passive fiscal policy, lump-sum taxes increase proportionately (in the
present value) with government spending to satisfy the government budget constraint. Under
active fiscal policy, the government budget constraint also holds, but taxes do not increase
su ciently to finance government spending; as a result, prices increase with government
deficits to reduce the real debt burden.
  Our general equilibrium framework is a new Keynesian model with four structural shocks:
the technology shock defined as a shock to neutral technology (NT), the investment shock
defined as a shock to the marginal e ciency of investment (MEI), the monetary policy (MP)
shock, and the fiscal policy (FP) shock. In addition to technology shocks, Justiniano et al.
(2010) and Kogan et al. (2017) show that MEI shocks as investment shocks, not investment-
specific technology (IST) shocks, contribute significantly to business cycle fluctuations and
economic growth. Moreover, as shown in Papanikolaou (2011) and Kogan and Papanikolaou
(2013), these investment shocks command significant risk premiums in financial markets. We
calibrate the model to match moments of key macroeconomic and financial variables and
show that technology and investment shocks, not monetary and fiscal policy shocks, are the
critical structural shocks in yielding the following key results:
    1. Both the positive stock-bond return correlation and the negative consumption-inflation
       correlation are driven by the technology shock under the M regime.
    2. Both the negative stock-bond return correlation and the positive consumption-inflation
       correlation are driven by the investment shock under the F regime.
    3. The negative stock-bond return correlation coincides with positive bond risk premi-
       ums under the F regime.
  Since the seminal work of Sargent and Wallace (1981) and Leeper (1991), a growing
literature has studied the joint behavior of monetary and fiscal authorities. We extend
the standard new Keynesian model (Smets and Wouters, 2007) to incorporating this joint
policy behavior as well as a recursive preference with habit formation to generate realistic
risk premiums. We show that the mix of the M and F regimes is essential to account for
the aforementioned correlation patterns and risk premiums. A positive technology shock,
as a positive supply shock, causes both output and consumption to increase while driving
down prices. The resulting consumption-inflation correlation becomes negative. The rise in
consumption and the persistent fall in the short-term nominal interest rate as a reaction to
falling inflation lead to higher stock prices and higher prices of long-term nominal Treasury
                     THE BOND MARKET AND FISCAL-MONETARY POLICY                               3

bonds. As a result, the stock-bond return correlation is positive in response to a technology
shock. Under the M regime, the interest rate falls more than inflation and thus the real
interest rate falls as well. A fall in the real interest rate further stimulates output and
consumption. Active monetary policy amplifies the eect of the technology shock and makes
this shock a dominating force behind both the negative consumption-inflation correlation and
the positive stock-bond return correlation. On the contrary, under the F regime, the nominal
interest rate falls less than inflation due to passive monetary policy and as a result the real
interest rate increases in response to a positive technology shock. Therefore, the stimulating
eect of the technology shock is largely muted and this shock becomes unimportant for
determining the correlations between consumption and inflation and between returns on
stocks and on long-term bonds.
  Under the F regime, the investment shock becomes the dominating force for generating
the stock-bond return and consumption-inflation correlations. A positive investment shock,
as a positive MEI shock, makes a transformation of investment into capital more e cient.
In response to this positive demand shock, both output and investment increases but con-
sumption decreases in the short run as an intertemporal substitution for higher consumption
in the long run. The dominating eect of decreased consumption in the short-run causes
stock price to fall. An increase in output leads to an increase in tax income and a decrease
in the debt-to-output ratio. With active fiscal policy, taxes do not respond to a fall of the
debt-to-output ratio. Thus, a combination of higher output, higher tax income, and lower
debt-to-output ratio reduces government deficits. It follows from the government budget
constraint that the price level must fall to make the real value of government debt more
valuable. The falling price level leads to a reduction in the nominal interest rate following
the Taylor rule, and as a result, bond prices go up. Hence, under the F regime, the investment
shock causes negative stock-bond return correlation and positive consumption-inflation.
  Consistent with the empirical observation, risk premiums of long-term Treasury bonds
remain positive under the F regime in the model while the stock-bond correlation is negative.
The key to this result is that the dynamics of the pricing kernel, thus risk premiums, in the
model are driven mainly by the technology shock, regardless of the policy regime. Since
stock and bond risk premiums are both positive under the technology shock, positive bond
risk premium and negative stock-bond correlation coexist in the F regime.
  Our paper belongs to a growing body of literature studying the asset pricing implications
of government policies in a general equilibrium framework, which includes, in addition to
the works discussed above, Andreasen (2012), Van Binsbergen et al. (2012), Rudebusch and
Swanson (2012), Dew-Becker (2014), Kung (2015), Li and Palomino (2014), Bretscher, Hsu
and Tamoni (2018), and Hsu, Li and Palomino (2019). The papers most closely related to
our work are Song (2017), Campbell et al. (2020), and Gourio and Ngo (2016), all of which

provide explanations for the sign change in the stock-bond return correlation. Taking the
sign change of the consumption-inflation correlation around 2000 as exogenous, Song (2017)
argues that an increasingly active monetary policy is the main reason for the sign change in
the stock-bond return correlation. In our paper, the sign switch of the consumption-inflation
correlation is endogenously determined in general equilibrium, where fiscal policy plays an
indispensable role. Campbell et al. (2020) argue that the sign change in the stock-bond
return correlation is driven by the changing relationship between output gap and inflation,
while the latter is exogenously imposed. We focus on the economic mechanism with a mix of
both active fiscal and active monetary policy that endogenously generates the time-varying
correlations of both macroeconomic and financial variables. Gourio and Ngo (2016) propose
a general equilibrium framework to explain the sign change in the correlation between stock
returns and inflation during the zero lower bound (ZLB) period after 2008, but are silent on
the bond market, which is the main focus of our paper.
  The unique contribution of our paper is to model the simultaneous sign changes of the
stock-bond return and consumption-inflation correlations as driven by the relative impor-
tance of technology and investment shocks under two dierent policy regimes. Under the
M regime, the eect of the technology shock on these two correlations dominates that of
the investment shock; while the opposite is true under the F regime, because the eect of
the technology shock is largely muted by passive monetary policy. Narrative accounts of
U.S. monetary-fiscal policy history as well as previous empirical studies indicate that the
post-2000 period is consistent with the F regime, while the 1971-2000 period is consistent
with the M regime (Davig and Leeper, 2011). By incorporating these two policy regimes in a
general equilibrium framework, our model provides a coherent explanation for the changing
correlation patterns in both macroeconomic and financial variables, as shown in Figure 1.
  Campbell et al. (2020)'s framework can generate the negative stock-bond correlation, but
it also produces negative bond risk premiums. Unlike typical one-factor asset pricing models
such as the CAPM, our model has multiple fundamental shocks and a nonlinear pricing
kernel. Consistent with the empirical data, our model is capable of generating positive risk
premiums in long-term bonds, even when the stock-bond return correlation is negative. We
show that a switch from the M regime to the F regime is crucial in achieving the simultaneous
negative stock-bond return correlation and positive bond risk premiums.
  In summary, the technology shock drives negative stock-bond correlations and positive
consumption-inflation correlations under the F regime, while the investment shock drives
positive stock-bond correlations and negative consumption-inflation correlations under the M
regime. These results are robust to alternative preferences--such as the CRRA and recursive
preferences without habit formation--and to an expanded model with many fundamental

shocks. Lastly, all our results hold when the nominal interest rate is at the ZLB, which is
an extreme case of the F regime.
  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses stylized facts and policy
regimes in detail. Section III presents the general equilibrium framework with a regime
switching between monetary and fiscal policies. Section IV proposes a solution method
for our regime-switching model, calibrates this model to U.S. macroeconomic and financial
variables, and discusses the asset pricing implications of the model. Section V discusses the
robustness of our model outcomes. Section VI oers concluding remarks.

                        II. Stylized facts and policy regimes

  In this section, we discuss how to reproduce the stylized empirical facts that our theo-
retical model aims to explain and how to model the two policy regimes from 1971 to 2018.
Appendix A provides details of the data used to reproduce these stylized facts.

II.1. Stylized facts. The key facts that motivate this paper are constructed as follows.
     · The annual correlation between returns on the stock market, proxied by the stock
       market index, and returns on nominal (zero-coupon) Treasury bonds of 5-year ma-
       turity was 0.28 in 1971-2000 and      0.32 after 2000, as shown in Panel A of Figure
       1. The annual correlations are computed using daily returns on the stock market
       index and on the 5-year Treasury bonds. For nominal Treasury bonds with longer
       maturities, the correlation statistics are very similar.
     · The annual correlation between consumption growth rate and inflation was              0.32
       in 1971-200 and 0.16 in the post-2000 period, as shown in Panel B Figure 1. Real
       consumption growth is computed with quarterly real personal consumption expen-
       ditures per capita, and inflation is the change of quarterly GDP deflator. To obtain
       accurate annual correlations, we calculate the consumption-inflation correlation of
       year t using the data within the 5-year window [t      2, t + 2] centered at t.
     · Both the stock market index and nominal Treasury bonds of 5-year maturity earned
       positive risk premiums before and after 2000, even though the CAPM beta of the
       Treasury bonds, which has the same sign as the stock-bond return correlation, turned
       negative after 2000. Figure 2 shows that the cumulative returns on the stock market
       index and the Treasury bonds are both higher than that on the 1-month Treasury
       bills throughout the entire 1971-2018 period, indicating positive bond risk premiums
       both before and after 2000.

II.2. Policy regimes. Monetary policy is modeled as

             rt   r=   r ( rt 1   r) + (1   r )[  (t   ) +        y   yt ] +   r er,t   ,   (II.1)

where rt is the log value of the short-term nominal interest rate, and r is the steady state.
The policy rule has an interest-rate smoothing component captured by                                                             r ( rt 1       r). The
interest rate responds positively to both inflation t                                               , where   is the central bank's
targeted inflation, and output growth                                          yt , where yt is the log value of detrended output.
That is,     (>              0) and             y (>    0). The monetary policy--MP shock is er,t  IIDN (0, 1). If
monetary policy is active, the interest rate increases more than inflation, i.e.,                                                               > 1; if
monetary policy is passive,                                 < 1.
  The fiscal authority faces the government's budget constraint that equates taxes and newly
issued debt with government spending and debt payments. In the standard new Keynesian
model (Davig and Leeper, 2011; Bianchi and Ilut, 2017), fiscal policy is modeled as

     t      = & (  t                     1     ) + (1         & ) [ &b ( b t   1   b) + &g (gyt    g y ) + &y ( y t       y )] +       e ,t ,     (II.2)

where t is the ratio of lump-sum taxes to output, bt                                          1   is the ratio of government debt in
the previous period to output, gyt is the ratio of government expenditures to output, y is the
steady state of output, and e ,t  IIDN (0, 1) is the fiscal policy--FP shock. The coe cients

outstanding government debt (&b                         1), fiscal policy is active. In this case, the price
level must adjust so that the government budget constraint is satisfied. For example, prices
would need to rise to reduce real government liabilities when the government's income (taxes
plus new debt issuances) are insu cient to cover its spending and liabilities. Therefore,
passive fiscal policy does not influence macroeconomic fluctuations except for through the
level of outstanding government debt, while active fiscal policy influences the price level,
which in turn aects other macroeconomic variables.
  Immediately after the World War II, the Federal Reserve adopted policy to support high
bond prices without responding to inflation--an extreme form of passive monetary policy
(Woodford, 2001)--until the Treasury Accord of March 1951. Through the Korean War
(June 1950 - July 1953), monetary policy accommodated fiscal policy by financing govern-
ment debt (Ohanian, 1997). From mid 1950s through the Kennedy tax cut of 1964 into the
second half of the 1960s, fiscal policy was active, paying little attention to the government
debt. Another prolonged period of active fiscal policy began with President Bush's tax cuts
in 2002 and 2003, followed by drastically increased government spending and tax cuts en-
abled by the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of early 2009 around global financial crisis. Because the yield data on long-term Trea-
sury bonds are fragmentary prior to 1971, we focus on the changes in macroeconomic and
financial dynamics around 2000, when a mix of monetary and fiscal policies switched regime.
  Following Leeper et al. (2017), we term a mix of active monetary policy and passive fiscal
policy "the M regime" and a mix of active fiscal policy and passive monetary policy "the
F regime." According to Sims and Zha (2006) and Davig and Leeper (2011), monetary
policy remained largely active after 1971 until 2000. When allowing fiscal policy to switch
regime, Davig and Leeper (2011) show that monetary policy became passive after 2000 to
combat the 2000 and 2007 recessions with active fiscal policy. These empirical results are
consistent with the narrative account of U.S. economic policy history. In the next section, we
incorporate regime switching between monetary and fiscal policies in a dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium (DGSE) model and discuss the model's asset pricing implications.

                                                   III. Model

  Our model follows Smets and Wouters (2007), Leeper (1991), and Bianchi and Ilut (2017).
We focus on four structural shocks that are most commonly used in the macro-finance
literature: the technology shock, the investment shock, the MP shock, and the FP shock.

growth rate of investment-specific technology faces the constant µ =                                             log   t.   Thus, the
                                                    +                +
                                                   zt
growth rate of the economy is µ                         =       log zt .   The intermediate goods industry is assumed
to have no entry and exit. A fixed cost ' is chosen so that intermediate goods producers
earn zero profits in the steady state.

  The producers take the nominal rent of capital service Pt rt and nominal wage rate Wt as

where       measures the elasticity of substitution among dierent labor types. The inter-
mediate goods producers employ the homogenous labor service for the production. Labor
contractors are perfectly competitive, and their profit maximization leads to the demand
function for labor type j as

  Labor unions face Calvo (1983)-type wage rigidities. In each period, with probability
w , labor union j cannot reoptimize the wage rate of labor type j and sets the wage rate

The risk-free short-term interest rate is given by e                 rt
                                                                          = Et [Mt+1 ]. Appendix B shows that
the log pricing kernel can be written as

                       mt+1 =  log                 ch,t+1       (1         )~
                                                                            ru,t+1        t+1 ,                  (III.18)
             1
where  =     1
                  and r
                      ~u,t+1 is related to returns on the household's wealth portfolio, the
dividend of which equals consumption minus the disutility of labor in monetary terms. The
pricing kernel depends not only on the current (habit-adjusted) consumption growth, but
also on the long-term growth of wealth under the recursive preference.

III.7.2. Returns on stocks. The definition of stock returns follows Abel (1999), where a stock
is a claim to consumption raised to the power , Ct , and                          > 1 is the leverage ratio. Since
dividend growth in the data is more volatile than consumption growth, the leverage ratio                               is
needed to create a wedge between dividend and consumption. The stock price and nominal

The stock return depends positively on the current and expected future consumption growth.
Under the assumption of the log normal distribution, the expected excess return can be
written as
                                                   
                             log Et ers,t+1   rt

III.7.3. Return and yield on the long-term bond. The gross nominal return on a long-term
bond, Rb,t , is given by
                                                        1 + Pb,t

                                                          Pb,t 1
The expected excess bond return is
                                                     
                        log Et erb,t+1          rt
                                                        =      covt (mt+1 , rb,t+1 ) ,            (III.23)

where rb,t+1  log Rb,t+1 . The yield t on this bond is given by 1/Pb,t                    (1   ) and the
eective duration is 1/(1        /(1 + t )). See Appendix C for the derivation.
  To understand the return and yield on a long-term bond in our model, we derive an
analytical expression for the risk premium of a zero-coupon, long-term bond with maturity
                                                        (n )
of n periods. The log return on this bond, rb,t+1 , can be written as3
                                                   "                #
                               h (n )     i               n 1
                                                          X
                         log Et erb,t+1 rt = covt mt+1 ,      rt + s .                            (III.24)
                                                                          s=1

Intuitively, nominal bonds are risky for investors if the bond price falls when the marginal
utility rises, the latter of which can be driven by lower consumption growth or/and lower
returns on wealth.4 The bond price falls when the expected risk-free interest rate (up to
maturity) rises. Thus, positive covariance between the marginal utility and future interest
rates until maturity implies positive bond risk premium, as indicated by Equation (III.24).

                                    IV. Results and analysis

IV.1. Solution method. The regime-switching DSGE model is solved with the method
proposed by Foerster et al. (2016). We can express the linearized system in the form of

                               As t x t   = B st x t1       +     st "t   +  t ,
                               n n n 1       n n n  1           n k k 1    n s s1

where xt is a vector stacking up all the variables including endogenous and exogenous vari-
ables (forward-looking and lagged ones) in the model, t is a vector of expectational errors,
and "t is a vector of fundamental IID shocks. The solution for the regime switching model
takes the following form:

                            xt =     V st      F1,st xt 1       +     Vst G1,st "t .

  Selecting an initial starting point for the solution is the most critical and challenging task.
Without a proper starting value, the solution often does not converge (Farmer et al., 2011;
Bianchi and Ilut, 2017). In this paper, we propose a new procedure of randomly generating
3See Appendix D for detailed derivations.
4The  dividends of the agent's wealth portfolio in our model are not consumption streams, but a combination
of consumption and labor income because of the presence of leisure in the utility function.

starting points that can lead to a speedy convergence of the solution. The procedure is
based on the constant-parameter model in which the policy regime is fixed at all times. For
h regimes, there are h constant-parameter models. For each constant-parameter model, we
have the corresponding solution form

IV.2. Calibration. We calibrate the model to match moments of key macroeconomic and
financial variables. Table A.1 lists the calibrated values of structural parameters. The steady
                                                                +
state growth rate of the economy µz is set to 0.0044, and the steady state growth rate of
the investment-specific technological change µ is set to 0.0017, implying that the average
annual growth rate of the economy is 1.76%. The steady state or targeted inflation rate,   , is
0.65%, which means that the targeted annual inflation rate is 2.66%. Government spending

is calibrated to 18% of total output. Following the convention in the macro literature, we
set the power on capital in the production function, , to 0.33; the depreciation rate on
                                                       w
capital, , to 0.025; and the wage markups,                 , to 1.05. The long-term bond parameter  is
calibrated to 0.9627 so that the duration of the bond is 5 years. The preference parameters
are taken from the long-run risk literature: the elasticity of intertemporal substitution               is
set to 1/1.2, and the risk aversion parameter               is set to 60 so that the Sharpe ratio implied
by the model (1.82) is close to that in the data (2.11). The Frisch elasticity of labor supply
  is set to 1 as in Christiano et al. (2014). We set the habit parameter bh to 0.85, which is
within the wide range of values estimated from the literature. The objective discount factor
  is chosen to yield a 4.64% annual risk free rate.
  Policy rule parameters in the two policy regimes are set according to the estimated values
in Bianchi and Ilut (2017). In the M regime, monetary policy responds strongly to inflation
with         = 2.7372,   y   = 0.7037, and   r   = 0.91; fiscal policy passively adjusts to changes in
government debt with &b = 0.0609, &y = 0.3504, &g = 0.3677, and & = 0.9844. In the F
regime, monetary policy is passive with                = 0.4995,     y   = 0.0152, and   r   = 0.6565; but
                                                                                         5
fiscal policy is active with &b = 0, &y = 0.3504, &g = 0.3677, and & = 0.8202.
  Persistence and standard deviation parameters for the shock processes, presented in Panel
D of Table A.1, are calibrated to the estimated values in Christiano, Motto and Rostagno
(2014) and Justiniano, Primiceri and Tambalotti (2011), whose model structure and shock
processes are very similar to ours.
  We solve the model using the method discussed in Section IV.1 and generate the moments
of key macroeconomic and finance variables. These moments are presented in Table 1,
along with the corresponding moments in the data. Data moments are computed with the
quarterly sample from 1971Q1 - 2018Q4. Among the model moments, the computation
of the equity premium and long-term bond premium are based on the covariance of the
simulated stochastic discount factor mt+1 and excess returns on equity and bond, rs,t+1                 rt
and rb,t+1      rt , according to equations (III.21) and (III.23). These equations hold exactly if
mt+1 , rs,t+1 , and rb,t+1 follow the multivariate normal distribution.6 The transition matrix
P between the M and F policy regimes is set to
                                       "           #
                                         0.98 0.02

                                         0.02 0.98
where the element pij = P r(st = i|st        1   = j ) is the probability of switching from regime j to
regime i. Regime 1 corresponds to the M regime, and regime 2 to the F regime.

5Leeper  (1991) shows that any value of &b less than 1/RB 1 would lead to passive fiscal policy, where RB
is the return on government debt. In the fiscal policy literature, however, it is standard to set &b = 0.
6We solve our model up to the first order approximation. Terms of the second and higher orders have
negligible eects on the covariance. See Appendix D for a detailed analysis.

Notes: This table reports first and second moments of key macroeconomic and financial variables. Column 1
displays the variable names. Columns 2 and 3 report the annualized mean and standard deviation (in percent)
in quarterly data. Columns 4 and 5 report the corresponding simulated mean and standard deviation from
the model.

  As shown in Table 1, all moments of macroeconomic variables--consumption, investment,
inflation, and short rate--are matched quite closely. For moments of financial variables, our
model accounts for a half of the observed excess return on a nominal 5-year Treasury bond
and one-third of the observed excess return on the market portfolio. This turns out to be a
reasonable success for such a small scale new Keynesian model, which is intended mainly to
transpire economic intuition.

IV.3. Variance decomposition. Table 2 reports variance decomposition of key macroeco-
nomic and financial variables under the M and F regimes in our calibrated regime-switching
model. Under the M regime, the variations of stock returns, nominal long-term bond re-
turns, consumption growth, and inflation are driven mainly by the technology shock (70.28%,
75.96%, 63.73%, and 71.95%). Under the F regime, the investment shock drives a major-
ity of variations of these variables (71.84%, 92.53%, 57.34%, and 82.14%). The technology
shock, however, drives all the variations of the pricing kernel under both M and F regimes--
almost 100%. The eects of monetary and fiscal policy shocks are negligible in both M and
F regimes. These results are crucial for understanding regime-dependent dynamics of the
consumption-inflation correlation, the stock-bond return correlation, and stock and bond
risk premiums.
  The correlation of two variables driven by multiple fundamental shocks depends on the
relative importance of each shock in contribution to the fluctuations of these variables. As
Appendix E shows, the correlation of stock and bond returns (rb and rs ) can be written as

Notes: This table reports the one-quarter-ahead forecast error variance decomposition of the key variables in
the regime switching model: excess return on stock (rs r), which is a claim on consumption, excess return
on 5-year nominal bond (rb r), growth rate of consumption ( c), inflation ( ), and nominal pricing kernel
(m). The second to fifth columns are contributions of the technology shock, investment shock, monetary
policy shock, and fiscal policy shock. The numbers before and after the slash (/) represent percentage
contributions of the corresponding shocks in the M and F regimes.

where Vs,e is the contribution of shock e to the variance of rs , S (hs,e ) equals 1 if the sign
of the impulse response of rs to shock e, hs,e , is positive and equals                     1 otherwise, Vs,e
and S (hs,e ) are defined similarly for bond return rb , and ns is the number of shocks. As
Equation IV.4 shows, the stock-bond return correlation is determined by a fundamental
shock that contributes most to the variances of stock and bond returns (i.e., shock e that
has the largest values of Vb,e Vs,e ). The same argument applies to the consumption-inflation
correlation. Thus, the variance decomposition results reported in Table 2 imply that the
signs of the consumption-inflation and stock-bond return correlations are dominated by the
technology shock under the M regime and by the investment shock under the F regime.
  The risk premiums of stock and bond depend on the covariances between the pricing kernel
and the returns on stock and bond, as shown in Equation III.21 and Equation III.23. Be-
cause the pricing kernel variation is dominated by the technology shock under both regimes,
the risk premiums of stock and bond are mostly determined by the technology shock as
well. In the next several subsections, we discuss the dynamic responses of financial market
and macroeconomic variables to the two most important structural shocks, technology and
investment shocks, and show that our results are qualitatively consistent with the observed
stylized facts.

sponses of excess returns of stock and bond, the nominal interest rates, consumption growth,
and inflation to a one-standard-deviation positive technology shock in the M (blue solid lines)
and F (red dashed lines) regimes.7 In response to a positive technology shock, consumption
rises, but inflation falls; because the technology shock is a supply shock. In response to the

falling inflation, the nominal interest rate declines under the Taylor rule. Stock prices rise
with rising consumption, and bond prices rise with falling nominal interest rates. Therefore,
the technology shock leads to a negative consumption-inflation correlation and a positive
stock-bond return correlation.
   The variance decomposition in Table 2 shows that the pricing kernel is almost solely
determined by the technology shock under both regimes. Because the technology shock
is a persistent shock (shock on the growth rate of the technology level), both the current
consumption and return on wealth go up in reaction to a positive shock, resulting in a large
drop in the pricing kernel. Consequently, the risk premiums of stock and bond are positive
regardless of the policy regime.
   Figure 3 shows that stock and bond returns rise in larger magnitude under the M regime
than under the F regime. The nominal interest rate is more responsive to the fall of inflation,
amplifying the eects of the technology shock. Consequently, consumption rises more and so
do stock prices in the M regime than in the F regime. There is a more persistent fall in the
interest rate under the M regime. Figure 3 shows that the negative eect of the technology

Notes: This figure plots the impulse responses of key macro and finance variables in the model after a one-

shock on the nominal interest rate lasts up to 20 quarters in the M regime, while it lasts
only 10 quarters in the F regime.
   The price of a long-term bond depends not only on the current nominal interest rate,
but also on nominal interest rates in all horizons until the bond maturity. Therefore, the
excess bond return in the M regime rises much more than it does in the F regime, because of
the larger and more persistent fall in nominal interest rates in all horizons. These dynamic
responses are consistent with the variance decomposition reported in Table 2: a much higher
percentage of variations in stock and bond returns, consumption growth, and inflation are
explained by the technology shock in the M regime than in the F regime.

IV.5. Impulse responses to the investment shock. Figure 4 presents the impulse re-
sponses of excess stock and bond returns, consumption growth, inflation, and the nominal
interest rate to a one-standard-deviation positive investment shock in the M (blue solid
lines) and F (red dashed lines) regimes.8 A positive investment shock means a more e cient
transformation of investment into capital, generating higher demands for investment goods,
i.e., the investment shock is a demand shock. Both output and investment increase, but
8The    impulse responses of other variables to a positive investment shock are plotted in Figure A.8.

consumption decreases in the short run, as an intertemporal substitution for higher con-
sumption in the long run. Stock prices fall in general, due to the dominating eect of falling
consumption in the short run.
  In the M regime, general prices rise first in response to higher demands for output and
then fall after about 5 quarters. With the Taylor rule, the nominal interest rate similarly
rises in short horizons but then falls in horizons longer than 12 quarters. Because the price
of a long-term bond depends on the interest rate in all horizons until the bond maturity,
the overall eect of a positive investment shock on long-term bond prices turns out to be
positive. Therefore, the investment shock generates a negative stock-bond return correlation
and a negative consumption-inflation correlation in the M regime.
  In the F regime, however, inflation falls sharply and persistently after a positive investment
shock. With active fiscal policy, an increase in output leads to an increase in tax income
and a decrease in the debt-to-output ratio, and taxes do not respond to the fall of the debt-
to-output ratio. A combination of higher output, higher tax income, and the lower debt-to-
output ratio reduces government deficits. It follows from the government budget constraint
that the price level must fall to make the real value of government debt more valuable. With
the Taylor rule, the nominal interest rate falls over all horizons, resulting in a large increase
of the long-term bond price. Higher tax income further depresses consumption. As a result,
the responses of both stock and bond returns to the investment shock are larger in the F
regime than in the M regime, although the directions of these responses are the same under
both regimes. The most important finding is that the consumption-inflation correlation turns
positive in the F regime in response to the investment shock. These dynamic responses are
consistent with the variance decomposition results reported in Table 2: the investment shock
dominates the dynamics of stock and bond returns, consumption growth, and inflation in
the F regime.




IV.6. Discussion. We summarize the above analysis as three main findings:

   (1) The stock-bond return correlation is positive in the M regime, mainly driven by the
       technology shock; this correlation is negative in the F regime, mainly driven by the
       investment shock.
   (2) The consumption-inflation correlation is negative in the M regime, mainly driven by
       the technology shock; this correlation is positive in the F regime, mainly driven by
       the investment shock.
   (3) Risk premiums of stocks and nominal long-term bonds are always positive in both
       the M and F regimes, mainly driven by the technology shock.

Notes: This table reports the correlation matrix of financial and macroeconomic variables with all four
shocks in the baseline model. The variables include the excess return on stocks (rs r), the excess return
on the 5-year nominal bond (rb r), inflation ( ), consumption growth ( c), and the pricing kernel (m).
The numbers before and after the slash (/) represent the correlations in the M regime and the F regime.



  It is informative to relate these findings to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). In an
economy where the CAPM holds, a negative correlation between returns on the nominal long-
term bond and on the stock market implies negative excess bond risk premiums. However,
as Fama and French (1993) show, the CAPM fails to explain empirical data. As shown in
Belo et al. (2017), the CAPM also fails in models with multiple fundamental risks like ours
or in models with the nonlinear pricing kernel.9 In our model, because the risk premiums of
stocks and long-term bonds are driven by the technology shock in both the M and F regimes,
they are always positive regardless of regime. By contrast, the stock-bond return correlation,
which has the same sign as the market beta of the long-term bond, turns negative in the F
regime, because it is mainly driven by the investment shock in this regime. Such a coexistence
of positive bond risk premium and negative stock-bond correlation is an innovation of our
work relative to others.
  The above analysis is confirmed by the simulation-based correlation matrix in Table 3 of
the excess stock and long-term bond returns, inflation, consumption growth rate, and pricing
kernel in both the M and F regimes, under the baseline model with all four shocks. The
stock-bond return correlation is 0.51 under the M regime and                    0.52 under the F regime;
the consumption-inflation correlation is         0.73 under the M regime and 0.05 under the F
regime; and the correlation between the pricing kernel and returns on stock (bond) are
always negative under both the M and F regimes,                  0.66 and       0.37 ( 0.79 and        0.19),
indicating positive risk premium in stock (bond).


9Bai et al. (2018) show that the CAPM can fail even in models with only one fundamental shock containing
disaster risk, because disaster risk generates a highly nonlinear pricing kernel.

V.1. The F regime at the zero lower bound (ZLB). The ZLB is an extreme case of the
F regime, where the policy rate does not react to economic fluctuations at all, i.e.,                     and
 y   are equal to zero. To keep the model tractable and avoid the computational di culty,
we do not include additional preference or inflation shocks to create the ZLB environment
endogeneously. Instead, we assume the ZLB scenario exogeneously, in which the policy rate is
almost constant at its steady state level (i.e.,       r   = 0.99 and       =   y   = 0).10 The parameters
in the fiscal policy rule are the same as in the F regime of our baseline model. Although
the standard new Keynesian model generates some unpleasant features at or close to the
ZLB,11 the negative correlation between returns on stocks and nominal bonds is robust to
the value of    .   In fact, as shown in Figures A.1 and A.2, both the investment shock and
the technology shock generate a negative stock-bond return correlation at the ZLB for the
following reason. Stock prices fall in response to a positive technology shock because of the
lower consumption growth when the ZLB binds. As a result, the bond and stock returns
move in opposite directions. Table A.2 reports the correlation matrix when the economy
is constrained by the ZLB in the F regime. As one can see, the positive stock-bond return
correlation and negative consumption-inflation correlation in the M regime and the negative
stock-bond return correlation and positive consumption-inflation correlation in the F regime
continue to hold.


V.2. Alternative preferences. In our baseline model, we use a recursive preference with
habit formation to generate risk premiums with reasonable magnitude. We show in this
section that the relation between key correlations and policy regime is robust to alternative
preferences.


V.2.1. CRRA preference. Figures A.3 and A.4 display the impulse responses to technology
and investment shocks in both policy regimes with the constant relative risk aversion (CRRA)
preference. These results are qualitatively similar to those under the recursive preference in
the baseline model. Specifically, a positive technology shock leads to an increase in returns on
stocks (consumption claims) and the long-term nominal bond in both policy regimes, while
a positive investment shock leads to opposite movements in these two returns. Panel A of

10Under  this particular setup, the policy rate does not respond to inflation and output changes at all, but
only fluctuates with moderate monetary policy shocks.
11When
            is smaller than a certain threshold, the model implies that consumption and output respond
negatively to a positive technology shock. Because the policy rate is kept constant, lower inflation caused by
a positive technology shock leads to higher real interest rate, which has a significant contractionary impact
on the economy. This is one of the most important criticisms of the new Keynesian model with the ZLB.

Table A.3 shows that the positive stock-bond return correlation and negative consumption-
inflation correlation in the M regime and the opposite in the F regime still hold under the
CRRA preference.

V.2.2. Recursive preference without habit. We solve a model under a recursive preference
without a habit formation. Figures A.5 and A.6 report the impulse responses to technology
and investment shocks in both policy regimes. Panel B of Table A.3 presents the correlation
matrix under the recursive preference without the habit. The impulse responses and the
correlation matrix are qualitatively similar to those of the baseline model.

V.3. An extended model with nine shocks. We extend our baseline model to include
five additional shocks that are commonly used in the macro-finance literature: a transitory
productivity shock, an investment-specific technological (IST) shock, a price markup shock,
a wage markup shock, and a labor supply shock. We then calibrate the model to match
moments of key macroeconomic and financial variables.12 Table A.6 presents the stock-
bond return correlation and consumption-inflation correlation under each shock alone and
Table A.7 presents the correlation matrix of key variables in the presence of all 9 shocks.
Figures A.7 to A.15 report the impulse responses of key financial and macro variables under
each of the nine shocks.
  All newly added shocks, except the IST shock, imply positive stock-bond return correlation
in the M regime, and all of them imply negative stock-bond return relation in the F regime.
The impact of technology shock dominates that of the IST shock in our calibration, and thus
the dependence of the stock-bond return relation on policy regimes continues to hold in the
9-shock model. In terms of the consumption-inflation correlation, all newly added shocks
imply a positive correlation in the M regime, and all but the transitory productivity and
price markup shocks imply a negative correlation in the F regime. Our calibration indicates
that the investment shock continues to dominate the consumption-inflation correlation in
the F regime.
  In short, the added shocks do not change the dependence of the stock-bond return and
consumption-inflation correlations on policy regimes in the baseline model as shown in Ta-
ble A.7. In addition, stock and bond risk premiums remain positive under all policy regimes.

                                           VI. Conclusion

  We apply a new Keynesian model with the recursive preference to interactions between
monetary and fiscal policies to account for (1) the positive stock-bond return correlation
and the negative consumption-growth correlation during 1971-2000 when monetary policy
was active and fiscal policy was passive (the M regime), and (2) a sign change of these two

correlations after 2000 when monetary policy was passive and fiscal policy was active (the F
regime). Moreover, our model generates positive risk premiums of stocks and bonds in both
policy regimes, consistent with the data. The key mechanism we find is that technology
shocks drive the fluctuation of the economy in the M regime while investment shocks are
a driving force in the F regime. Our findings lay a structural foundation for a general-
equilibrium framework that bridges financial markets and monetary-fiscal policies.

  The yield of the long-term bond with decay coe cient  is  = 1/Pb (1 ) where Pb is the price of the
bond.

It's easy to show that for continuously-compounded yield ~    = ln(1/Pb + ). The consol bond has no finite
maturity, however, we can compute its duration. The duration of the consol is given by

definition, the expected yield and return on a consol bond is given by

                              Appendix E. Correlation of two endogenous variables
   Under loglinear approximation, any endogenous variable r (log deviation from its steady state value) can
be written as
                                           rt+1 = A(s)xt + H (s)Et+1
where xt+1 is vector of the state variables, Et+1 is the vector of exogenous shocks, and A(s) and H (s) are
coe cient matrices depending on regime s. The correlation between any two variables r1,t+1 and r2,t+1 is
given by

sign of h1,e . Similar definitions apply to h2,e V2,e , and S (h2,e ).

                                             Appendix F. Additional shocks
    Instead of assuming a constant growth rate of relative price of investment good (µ ), total factor
productivity(! ), substitutability among dierentiated intermediate goods and labor( p and w ), and disu-
tility of working(aL ) as in the baseline model, now we assume that they face exogenous shocks and follow
AR(1) processes with persistence x 's and standard deviation x 's.13
    The growth rate of relative price of investment good, µt , evolves as follows:
                               µt = µ (1      ) +  µt          1   +          et ,   and et  IIDN (0, 1),                               (F.1)
where et denotes the investment-specific technology (IST) shock.

  Calibrated parameter values of the shock processes and the resulting simulated moments of key macro and
financial variables are presented in Table A.4 and Table A.5, respectively.
