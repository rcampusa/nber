                                             ABSTRACT

We analyze a unique episode in the history of monetary economics, the 2016 Indian "demonetization."
This policy made 86% of cash in circulation illegal tender overnight, with new notes gradually introduced
over the next several months. We present a model of demonetization where agents hold cash both
to satisfy a cash-in-advance constraint and for tax evasion purposes. We test the predictions of the
model in the cross-section of Indian districts using several novel data sets including: the geographic
distribution of demonetized and new notes for causal inference; nightlight activity and employment
surveys to measure economic activity including in the informal sector; debit/credit cards and e-wallet
transactions data; and banking data on deposit and credit growth. Districts experiencing more severe
demonetization had relative reductions in economic activity, faster adoption of alternative payment
technologies, and lower bank credit growth. The cross-sectional responses cumulate to a contraction
in employment and nightlights-based output due to demonetization of 2 p.p. and of bank credit of 2
p.p. in 2016Q4 relative to their counterfactual paths, effects which dissipate over the next few months.
These cumulated effects provide a lower bound for the aggregate effects of demonetization. Our analysis
rejects money non-neutrality using a large scale natural experiment, something that is yet rare in the
vast literature on the effects of monetary policy.

1    Introduction
Despite an impressive body of literature on the effects of monetary policy, large scale natural
experiments remain rare. In this paper we study a unique episode known as demonetization.
On November 8th, 2016, the government of India unexpectedly declared 86% of the exist-
ing currency in circulation illegal tender, effective at midnight. Printing press constraints
prevented the immediate replacement of the demonetized currency with new notes, with the
result that cash that could be used in transactions declined sharply. Moreover, the arrival
rate of new currency notes varied tremendously across geographic areas. Demonetization
occurred in an otherwise stable macroeconomic environment and did not affect other hall-
marks of monetary policy such as the overall liabilities of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
or the target interest rate.
    We have two main findings. First, we reject money neutrality by providing well-identified,
statistically strong evidence of an effect of money on output in the cross-section of Indian
districts. Second, we shed light on why cash matters. In the New Keynesian synthesis
(Woodford, 2003), money serves only as a unit of account and outcomes depend only on
the interest rate set by monetary policy, with the details of the money supply essentially
irrelevant. During demonetization, cash declined while the sum of cash and checking deposits
remained stable and market interest rates changed little. We therefore conclude that in
modern India cash plays a special role in facilitating transactions.
    We first present a model of demonetization to guide the empirical analysis. In the model,
agents hold cash for two reasons. Firstly, because of a cash-in-advance (CIA) constraint
requiring money holdings to pay for expenditures, along the lines of Lucas (1982), Lucas and
Stokey (1987), and Svensson (1985). Secondly, because holding cash reduces the effective
tax rate by facilitating tax evasion. Demonetization in the model amounts to a forced
conversion of cash into less liquid bank deposits, which in the presence of downward wage
rigidity generates a decline in output, employment, and borrowing by firms. Households also
switch to non-cash forms of payment to attenuate the impact of the cash shortage.
    We then provide empirical evidence of the effects of demonetization. National time se-
ries aggregates alone cannot answer this question because they have limited coverage of
the informal, cash-intensive sector of the economy, because the episode constitutes only
a single observation, and because other economic shocks occurred during the period. In-
stead, we study the consequences of demonetization in the cross-section of Indian districts.
Using a comprehensive data set from the RBI containing the geographic distribution of de-
monetized and new notes, we construct a local area demonetization shock as the ratio of

                                              1
post-demonetization to pre-demonetization currency in an area. We present both narrative
and statistical evidence that these demonetization shocks occurred essentially at random
with respect to local economic activity.
    We study outcomes drawn from a number of different data sets, many of which have not
previously been used in academic research. We first show that districts that experienced
more severe demonetization shocks had much larger contractions in ATM withdrawals. The
link between currency availability and cash withdrawals both validates the usefulness of our
geographic shock measure and provides prima facie evidence of a cash shortfall.
    We next show that demonetization had an adverse effect on real economic activity. Offi-
cial data on economic activity at a subnational level and at high frequency do not exist. We
use a new household survey of employment and satellite data on human-generated nightlight
activity to measure demonetization’s effects at the district level. Importantly, these variables
capture both formal and informal sector economic activity. Both variables reveal econom-
ically sharp, statistically highly significant contractions in areas experiencing more severe
demonetization shocks. The effects on real economic activity peak in the period immedi-
ately following the announcement and dissipate over the next few months as new currency
arrives. In terms of magnitude, both variables map into a difference in output of roughly 4
percentage points between districts at the 10th and 90th percentile of the demonetization
shock in the period immediately after the announcement. These results reject neutrality of
money during demonetization.
    Our third set of results demonstrate the adoption of alternative forms of payment tech-
nology in response to demonetization. While the difference in output across districts is
substantial, it is far less than the roughly 50 percentage point inter-decile difference in the
amount of currency replaced. In our model, this can occur if households endogenously found
ways around using money to conduct transactions, for example by switching to alternative
payment methods like debit cards, credit cards, and e-wallets or by convincing retailers to
open an informal line of credit or to accept old notes. We use data on the transacted value of
two leading electronic payments methods, e-wallet and point-of-service cards, to show that
this substitution occurred. This pattern also corroborates our identifying assumption, as a
confounding non-demonetization demand shock would instead induce positive comovement
across all payments mechanisms and output.
    Finally, experiencing more severe cash shortages had higher deposit growth as house-
holds could not withdraw money from their bank accounts. Credit growth in these areas
nonetheless slowed, providing additional corroborating evidence of an effect on real activity.


                                               2
    Our results imply that the decline in cash lowered the growth rate of economic activity by
at least 2 p.p. in the quarter of demonetization. To reach this number, we first cumulate the
cross-sectional effects on employment and nightlights over districts. Next, we argue that this
calculation provides a lower bound for the aggregate consequences of the cash decline. Such
a lower bound arises in our model due to cross-district trade. Combining these two results
yields a decline in nightlights-based economic activity and of employment of 3 p.p. or more
in November and December of 2016 relative to the counterfactual path, which translates into
a decline in the quarterly growth rate of 2 p.p. or more. Similarly, the effect on credit implies
a 2 p.p. or more decline in 2016Q4.1 We conclude that in modern India cash continues to
serve an essential role in facilitating economic activity.
    We review related literature next. Section 2 contains institutional details of demonetiza-
tion. Section 3 presents the model and empirical predictions. Section 4 describes the data,
the construction of the geographic demonetization shocks, and the conditions for causal in-
terpretation of the analysis. Section 5 presents the cross-sectional results. Section 6 discusses
the aggregate implications.

Related literature. A few early studies have used descriptive statistics (RBI, 2017b;
Krishnan and Siegel, 2017) or simple time series methods (Aggarwal and Narayanan, 2017;
Banerjee and Kala, 2017) to infer the effect of demonetization on the Indian economy. We in-
troduce a number of new data sets and a cross-sectional empirical approach to more credibly
identify the causal effects of the policy. Methodologically, this approach relates to a bur-
geoning literature using cross-sectional, regional variation to study macroeconomic topics,
as reviewed in Nakamura and Steinsson (2018) and Chodorow-Reich (2019). This literature
has so far avoided the topic of monetary policy because monetary policy is determined at
the national (or higher) level. In contrast, our setting contains large cross-regional variation
in the change in money. Ramey (2016) offers a forceful critique of time series studies of the
effect of money on output as restricted to studying small changes in policy. Similar to Velde
(2009) who traces the effects of large, overnight diminutions of coins in 18th century France,
we study a sudden and very large decline in currency.
    Our empirical results provide support for theoretical traditions which view money as
essential in that the presence of money makes possible superior allocations. We follow Lu-
cas (1982), Lucas and Stokey (1987), and Svensson (1985) in modeling the need for money
through a cash-in-advance (CIA) constraint. The “new monetarist perspective” (Williamson
  1

and Wright, 2010) instead introduces asymmetric information, limited commitment, and lack
of double coincidence of wants to create a problem which money alleviates.2 Agrawal (2018)
provides a model of a demonetization episode in this tradition. As noted by Kocherlakota
(1998), any mechanism that creates a record of transactions (“memory”) can substitute for
money in a new monetarist economy. We document empirically one such substitution – the
switch to e-wallet and POS payments technologies. Our model incorporates such substitu-
tion through an endogenous threshold for the CIA constraint, making it immune along this
dimension to an otherwise clear example of the Lucas critique (Lucas, 1976) applying.3 In
independent work, Crouzet, Gupta, and Mezzanotti (2019) also examine the adoption of
alternative payment technology during demonetization and, like us, find persistent effects of
demonetization on e-wallet use. Whereas their paper focuses on the network externalities of
payment technologies, we emphasize the interplay between adoption of alternative means of
payment and the effect on output.
    Last, our paper sheds light on a debate around the possible benefits of a cashless economy.
Rogoff (2016) articulates the societal costs of cash including putting a floor on the nomi-
nal interest rate and facilitating illegal activity and tax evasion. Nonetheless, he cautions
that any phase-out of cash should take place slowly and with ample anticipation to allow
households to adopt other forms of payment. Our results accord with these prescriptions.


2       Demonetization
On November 8, 2016, at 8:15pm local time, the Prime Minister of India announced in an
unscheduled national televised address that the two largest denomination notes, the 500
($7.5) and 1000 rupee ($15) notes, would cease to be legal tender, to be replaced by new
500 and 2000 notes. Effective at midnight, holders of the old notes could deposit them at
banks but could not use them in transactions. The stated objectives of the policy were to
target black money, reduce corruption, and remove fake currency notes (Modi, 2016). In the
service of these objectives, the government placed deposit limits on customers who did not
comply with “Know Your Customer” norms and set a deadline of December 31, 2016 for the
return of old notes.4

     Lagos and Zhang (2018) argue theoretically that monetary models without money are generically poor
approximations even to highly developed credit economies.

     Alvarez and Lippi (2009) examine the impact of financial innovation on the demand for cash.

     The December 31st limit applied to ordinary note holders. Non-resident Indian citizens could continue
to deposit old notes until June 30, 2017. Customers who did not comply with the KYC norms could deposit
a maximum of Rs 50,000. While all commercial banks and urban cooperative banks were allowed to accept

Notes: The figure plots the value of old 500 and 1000 notes (before November 8, 2016) and new 500 and
2000 notes (after November 8, 2016) as a share of total currency in circulation on November 4, 2016 using
the currency chest data described below.


    Figure 1 shows the path of large (500 rupee and above) legal tender denomination notes
as a share of total pre-announcement currency outstanding, using the currency chest data
described below. The old 500 and 1000 notes accounted for 86% of pre-demonetization
currency. To maintain secrecy prior to the policy’s announcement, the government and RBI
did not print and distribute a large quantity of new notes before the announcement. Printing
press constraints then prevented the government from quickly replacing more than a fraction
of this total with new notes. Thus, total currency declined overnight by 75% and recovered
only slowly over the next several months.
    While the slow replacement of notes led to a decline in currency, it did not affect the
overall size of the RBI’s balance sheet or market interest rates. The immediate consequence
was to increase deposits at commercial banks as households deposited old notes but could
not freely withdraw new notes due to the cash shortage.5 The RBI initially required banks
deposits in old currencies, district cooperative banks (DCCBs) were prohibited to do so.
   5
     As we later show, the supply of new notes in a geographic area determined the total amount of with-
drawals by households in that area. There were also legal limitations on withdrawals from individual ac-
counts. The exchange of old for new notes was initially restricted to Rs 4000 ($60) per person per day, cash
withdrawals from bank accounts were initially limited to Rs. 10,000 ($150) per day and Rs 20,000 ($300)
per week, and withdrawals from ATM machines were initially restricted to Rs 2000 ($30) per day per card
(RBI, 2016). These limits were progressively relaxed and finally removed on January 30, 2017. The RBI
carved out exceptions for special circumstances such as weddings. In addition, demonetized notes could be
used to pay for certain transactions such as utility bills or to buy airline or train tickets. In total, there were

to hold these deposits as reserves at the RBI by increasing the cash reserve ratio to 100%
on all incremental deposits received between September 16 and November 11. Since these
reserves paid no interest while banks continued to pay positive interest on their deposits, on
December 6 the RBI withdrew the increase in the reserve ratio and instead absorbed the
deposits by issuing short-term Market Stabilization Bonds (MSB).6 Figure 2 shows the overall
stability of RBI liabilities and the initial increase in commercial bank deposits, later replaced
by MSB issuance.7 The stability of total liabilities also reflects the near total restoration of
demonetized notes to the RBI, contrary to expectations early on that the inability to deposit
black money might lead to the liquidation of a portion of the RBI’s currency liabilities.8
21 separate press releases specifying rules changes issued by the RBI in November alone. Banerjee, Breza,
Chandrasekhar, and Golub (2018) document general confusion about deposit and withdrawal limits caused
by these many rules changes. Our focus in this paper concerns the total cash available for withdrawal and
not how account limits affected the distribution of withdrawals across households.
   6
     MSBs are interest-paying government bonds sold by the RBI specifically to absorb liquidity and take the
form of reverse-repo transactions. Technically, the RBI raised the ceiling on the quantity of MSB transactions
it would conduct. In the peak months of demonetization (November and December 2016) the bonds took
the form of ‘cash management bills’ with maturities of between 14 and 42 days.
   7
     The currency liabilities shown in figure 2 decline more gradually than the sharp drop in legal tender
shown in figure 1. The difference occurs because demonetized notes remained liabilities of the RBI until they
were exchanged for deposits or new notes or the time window to return them closed.
   8
     According to RBI (2018), 99% of total 500 and 1000 notes in circulation prior to demonetization were
returned to the RBI. Moreover, the demonetized notes came back fairly quickly. Recall that most people
had until December 31, 2016 to return their old notes. Using the currency chest data described below, we
find that 69% of the notes were returned by the end of November; 87% of notes were returned by December


                                                                            6

Thus, demonetization amounted to a conversion of household and business assets from cash
into bank deposits and a corresponding exchange of currency for obligations to commercial
banks on the liabilities side of the RBI’s balance sheet.
    Figure 3 plots a number of policy and market interest rates around demonetization. Not
only did demonetization not coincide with any changes in the official policy rates (repo and
reverse repo) used by the RBI, but private rates also changed little. Thus, the swap between
two forms of RBI liabilities occurred without a corresponding change in market interest
rates. Moreover, while households deposited their cash into banks, they could freely access
these funds in the form of cheques, debit cards or credit cards. The only restriction was on
spending using cash. This is the sense in which the Indian demonetization episode speaks
directly to the specialness of cash.


3     Model
In this section we present a model of demonetization to generate testable cross-sectional
implications and to bound the aggregate impact of demonetization. Unlike mainstream
models, in our model an unanticipated fall in cash is not associated with a change in market
interest rates, and we model the endogenous response of alternative forms of payment to
15; and 97% of notes were returned by the end of December.


                                                                  7
a cash shortage, both integral features of demonetization. The environment is a closed
economy comprised of a continuum of identically sized regions indexed by i. The agents are
households, firms, banks, and the government. Each region produces a non-traded good and
a unique variety of a good ω which is traded freely across regions. We will consider both
perfect labor mobility and perfectly immobile labor. An important friction is downward
nominal wage rigidity owing to which equilibrium employment can fall short of inelastically
supplied labor.


3.1       Setup
Households Households consume traded and non-traded goods. There are two stores of
value, cash M and interest earning deposits D. Households hold cash because of a cash-
in-advance (CIA) constraint along the lines of Lucas (1982), Lucas and Stokey (1987), and
Svensson (1985) and because holding cash facilitates tax evasion and reduces the effective
tax rate. Households in each region supply N̄ units of labor inelastically. They choose

     Equation (2) gives the CIA constraint wherein a fraction 0 < κ (fi,t ) ≤ 1 of consumption
spending requires a cash payment. This cash payment can be made using any money holdings
                                                                         M
brought into period t from t − 1, Mi,t−1 , and cash transfers Ti,t          received from the government
at time t. The cash share κ depends on adoption of a finance technology fi,t . This variable
encompasses a broad range of actions that households can undertake when cash is scarce
including switching to alternative payment methods like debit cards, credit cards, and e-
wallets and convincing retailers to open an informal line of credit or to accept old notes.
Adopting the technology entails a utility cost (time and effort) h (fi,t ). We assume κ(0) =
κ̄, κ0 (fi,t ) ≤ 0, h(0) = 0, h0 (fi,t ) > 0, h00 (fi,t ) ≥ 0. With these assumptions, households invest
in the financing technology only when the CIA constraint binds. However, the CIA constraint
does not necessarily bind when Rt > 1 because of the tax advantage to holding cash.

Banks and Firms Perfectly competitive banks take deposits and lend to firms and to the
government at interest rate Rt . Market clearing requires i Afi,t di + Agt = i Di,t di, where Afi,t
                                                           R                R

is lending to firms and Agt is lending to the government. Firms in both the tradable and non-
tradable sectors are perfectly competitive. Each firm faces a working capital constraint where
                                                                                   f
a fraction ϕ of the wage bill needs to be paid in advance. Firms take a loan Bi,t     = ϕWi,t Ni,t
from the bank for this purpose. The production function for either good is Yt = Nt . With
                                                             N
perfect competition price equals marginal cost, PtT (ω) = Pi,t = (1 + ϕ(Rt − 1))Wi,t .

Downward Wage Rigidity As in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016), nominal wages are
downwardly rigid: Wi,t ≥ γWi,t−1 . When the constraint does not bind Ni,t = N̄ , yielding the
complementary slackness condition (N̄ − Ni,t )(Wi,t − γWi,t−1 ) = 0 when labor is immobile
across regions and (N̄ − Nt )(Wt − γWt−1 ) = 0 when labor is mobile. Kaur (forthcoming)
suggests γ = 1 in India, in which case nominal wages never fall.

                                                                                             M

3.2     Demonetization
Appendix A characterizes a pre-demonetization steady state in which the CIA constraint does
not bind due to the tax advantage of holding cash. At the start of period 0 the government
(unexpectedly) announces that only a fraction of cash that households carry into period 0
is legal tender and can be used for transaction purposes and requires the remaining cash
be deposited at the pre-fixed interest rate of R−1 . This policy forces households off their
deposit Euler equation (A.3). At the start of period 1 demonetization ends and the money
supply returns to the level required for full employment. There is no uncertainty following
the announcement of the demonetization shock.
    We first give an analytical solution for a uniform demonetization across all regions and
when households do not have access to the finance technology, κ0 (f ) = 0. We assume a
sufficiently sharp demonetization that the CIA constraint binds in period 0.10 Appendix A
contains proofs of the propositions.

Proposition 1 Uniform demonetization with constant κ
Let Z = M0s /M−1 s
                    = M0 /M−1 where 0 < Z < 1 so that the CIA binds and the wage constraint
binds, that is κ̄P0 C0 = M0 and W0 = γW−1 . If Z is sufficiently low relative to the downward
                               η−1
rigidity of wages,11 Z · κ̄(1+ϕ(β −1 −1)) < γ, then:



                                            Y0    N0   Z         η−1

                                                                       f
                                             B0f         ϕN0          B−1
 2. Bank lending to firms declines:              =                  <     ,                              (5)
                                             P0    (1 + ϕ(R−1 − 1))   P−1
 3. Wages and prices satisfy:                W0 = γW−1 , P0T = P0N = (1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))γW−1 . (6)
  10
     As long as the CIA binds we can solve for the outcomes in period 0 without the solutions for period 1
and beyond because interest rates are pre-fixed at R−1 and the deposit Euler and money Euler equations
are irrelevant. Verifying the conditions under which the CIA binds requires the full dynamic solution as
shown in appendix A. Due to one-sided wage rigidity, multiple values of M in period 1 induce a return to full
employment. We choose the minimal such value, which requires an equilibrium wage W1 > γW0 = γ 2 W−1
at which the downward wage rigidity is not binding. If γ ≈ 1 then M1 ≈ M−1 and the cash to GDP ratio
returns to the pre-demonetization level.
  11                                             η−1
     The CIA does not bind in period -1 if κ̄(1+ϕ(β −1 −1)) > 1 (see appendix A). Therefore, Z/γ must be

sufficiently less than 1. The condition does not depend only on Z/γ because the nominal wage when the
CIA binds is different from when the CIA does not bind.



                                                     10
   The proportional decline between output and Z in equation (4) arises because of the
binding CIA constraint M0 = κ̄P0 C0 , which tightly links cash in period 0 to output Y0 = C0 .12
The ratio of money holdings to labor income falls, η0 < η−1 , owing to which the effective
tax rate rises, τ0 > τ−1 , but this is not distortionary because of perfectly inelastic labor
supply. The shadow interest rate, which is the interest rate consistent with the deposit
                              λ0
Euler equation, rises: R0s ≡ βλ 1
                                  = (1−ντ1 (η0 )) > (1−ντ1(η−1 )) = R−1 .
   We next consider the case where the decline in M is not uniform across regions, as
we exploit in our empirical work. The government reduces the supply of cash in region i
                                      s             s
in a proportion Zi ∈ (0, 1), i.e. Mi,0    = Zi M−1     . We assume households cannot undo the
heterogeneous distribution of cash across regions through financial markets.

Proposition 2 Non-uniform demonetization with constant κ
If the drop in each region is sufficient to make the CIA constraint and wage constraint bind
in all regions, that is, κ̄Pi,0 Ci,0 = Mi,0 and Wi,0 = γW−1 ∀i, then:

   1. Regions with higher Zi have smaller declines in output:
                    Yi,0    Y0T (ω) + Yi,0
                                        N
                                             αZ + (1 − α)Zi           η−1
                          =                =                ·                     ,                     (7)

   2. Firm borrowing falls less in regions with higher Zi :
                                          f
                                         Bi,0         ϕYi0
                                              =                   ,                                     (8)
                                         P0     (1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))
   3. Wages and prices satisfy:         Wi,0 = γW−1 , P0T = Pi,0
                                                              N
                                                                 = (1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))γW−1 .              (9)

    The impact of the idiosyncratic component of the money shock is decreasing in the
size of the traded sector; as α → 1 there is no cross-regional variation in output. Regional
employment tracks regional output. Because of downward wage rigidity, the wage is equalized
across regions regardless of labor mobility. Firm borrowing is increasing in Zi . If all banks
operate nationally then there is no necessary relation between local firm borrowing and loans
extended by local banks. If however banks or firms face a (vanishingly) small cost to forming
a cross-region lending relationship and banks have perfect internal credit markets, then there
is a greater decline in credit creation by bank branches located in a region with a smaller Zi .

    Starting from the binding CIA constraint M0 = κ̄P0 C0 , we substitute the equilibrium conditions P0 =
                                                                                               M−1

         to arrive at equation (4). As is clear, while in our setup P0 is sticky downwards because of the
downward wage rigidity, any nominal friction that keeps P0 from falling will result in a similar expression.

    Finally, we allow for endogenous κ. The endogenous κ breaks the unit elasticity between
M and output in equation (4). In the absence of a closed form solution, we provide a
numerical illustration of how fi,0 varies with Zi .13 Figure 4(a) shows that regions with a
larger drop in cash adopt more financial services. Financial services make the effective cash
shortage Zi /κi,0 smaller than the measured cash shortage Zi and, because of the selection
effect, there is less heterogeneity in the effective cash shortage across regions, as depicted in
figure 4(b). Overall, the cross-sectional relationship between cash and output is attenuated.
    To summarize, the model predicts that districts experiencing more severe demonetization
will have: (i) relative reductions in employment and output; (ii) faster adoption of alternative
payment technologies; and (iii) lower bank credit growth. In addition, trade linkages make
cross-sectional estimates a lower bound for aggregate effects.

4     Data and Summary Statistics
4.1     Data
We merge several data sets, many of which have not previously been used in academic
research. The variety of data sets allow us to report both financial and real outcomes
including coverage of the informal sector. Our main geographic level of aggregation is the
district. India contains approximately 600 districts which partition the country. Table 1
summarizes the data sets used.

Currency shocks. We construct geographic demonetization shocks using currency chest
records maintained by the RBI. A currency chest functions as a warehouse of currency notes
for the RBI but is physically located in and administered by a commercial bank. There are
approximately 4000 chests spread across the country. A chest may receive newly printed

notes either directly from one of the 19 RBI issue offices or from one of approximately 600
“hub” chests. Each chest in turn sends currency to and receives currency from individual
commercial banks located in its geographic vicinity. Thus, all newly printed notes available
for withdrawal from a commercial bank first pass through the correspondent currency chest.
    Our data consist of daily cash flow accounting statements reported by each currency
chest, separately by note denomination. Table 2 provides an example for a hypothetical
chest after demonetization has occurred. The statements report the opening quantity of
notes at the chest (Open), new notes remitted directly by an RBI office (Remittances),
notes received from other chests (DI), deposits of notes by commercial banks (Dep), soiled
notes sent back to an RBI office for destruction (Soiled), notes sent to other chests (DO),
withdrawals of notes by commercial banks (W it), and the closing quantity of notes at the
chest (Close). We additionally define N D = DI − DO as net diversions of currency received
from other chests. We aggregate the chest-level data to the district level.
    We define the demonetization shock in district i at date t post-demonetization, Zi,t , as
the value of non-demonetized currency in the district as of date t divided by the total value
                                                              new
of currency in the district before demonetization. Letting Mi,t   denote the value of all new
notes received in district i as of date t post-demonetization, Mi1000 and Mi500,old the value
of demonetized 1000 and 500 notes, respectively, from district i (i.e. the value of notes in
chests or in circulation as of November 8), and Mismall the pre-demonetization value of small
notes, we can express Zi,t as:

                                            new
                                           Mi,t + Mismall
                             Zi,t =                                  .                       (10)
                                      Mi1000 + Mi500,old + Mismall

1000 notes, Mi1000 , as the sum from the day after demonetization to the last day in our
data set, January 31, 2018, of the value of 1000 notes returned to RBI offices plus any 1000
notes remaining in a chest as of that date, and demonetized 500 notes, Mi500,old , by summing
the value of 500 notes returned to RBI offices.15 Finally, we do not directly observe the

     This measure spikes temporarily when a chest receives notes from an RBI issue office which it subse-

operator to 500 notes as defined in equation (12) because the data do not distinguish between net diversions
of new and demonetized 500 notes. Our results are quantitatively robust to not applying this operator to
the 2000 notes.
  15
     We cannot include the January 31, 2018 balance of old 500 notes in the measure of Mi500,old because the
data do not distinguish between balances of old and new 500 notes. Likewise, soiled 500 notes returned after
demonetization may contain some new 500 notes, explaining why we truncate the summation at the end of
December 2017. While these factors imply Mi500,old is measured with error, we believe such measurement

stock of small notes before demonetization. Instead, we make the assumption that, pre-
demonetization, all notes of denomination 500 and below flow through currency chests at
the same rate, and use the relative gross flows (withdrawals and deposits) and the stock of
500 notes to construct Mismall as shown in equation (17). Under this assumption, the cross-
district mean large note share equals 89%, very close to the pre-demonetization national
share of the stock of large notes as reported by the RBI.16
    We apply a few filters to remove districts with implausible demonetization shocks: we
drop observations with Zi,t < 0, Mi500,old ≤ 0, or where tp=Nov 9, 2016 W it2000

0 or differs from Mi,t by more than a factor of 3. That is, we require that new currency
arriving in a district be non-negative, that we observe a positive quantity of old 500 notes,
that cumulative deposits of 2000 notes by commercial banks not exceed cumulative with-
drawals, and that cumulative withdrawals net of deposits (i.e. net new 2000 notes actually
received by commercial banks) not differ from arrivals of new 2000 notes by too much.17
Applying these criteria removes 47 of 589 districts which collectively contain less than 3% of
demonetized currency.

Employment. We obtain data on employment status from Consumer Pyramids starting
in January 2016. Unlike countries such as the United States, India does not have a govern-
mental monthly household survey or a monthly survey of establishments.18 The Centre for
Monitoring the Indian Economy, a private organization, conducts a nationally representative
household survey referred to as Consumer Pyramids, which includes questions on employ-
ment status similar to those asked in the Current Population Survey (CPS) in the United
States. Specifically, an individual counts as employed if on the day of the survey or the
error is small. Moreover, the vast majority of cross-sectional variation in currency replacement comes from
                                                                          2000
1000 and 2000 notes, not 500 notes. A regression of ln Zi,t on ln(Mi,t         /Mi1000 ) for t =December 2016 yields
                              500,new     500,old
an R2 of 0.84. Adding ln(Mi,t         /Mi,t       ) to the regression raises the R2 only slightly to 0.88.
   16
      We use the currency flow rate of 500 notes because of the possibility that some 1000 notes were used
for storage and therefore did not flow through chests at the same rate as other notes. Nonetheless, using
the average flow of 500 and 1000 notes yields an alternative Zi,t which has a correlation of 0.999 with the
measure defined in the text. Yet another alternative assumes all districts have the same share of large notes
of 0.87 as reported by the RBI for the national economy. Table B.2 in the online appendix reproduces our
main results using this alternative measure and shows our main findings remain unchanged.
   17
      Cumulative withdrawals net of deposits may differ from new arrivals of notes because currency withdrawn
by a commercial bank in one district may go to a customer who re-deposits the notes in a bank in a
different district. However, large discrepancies between the measures are rare and signal some restriction on
withdrawals which we do not observe.
   18
      In April 2018 the Central Statistics Office began reporting monthly employment counts for formal sector
firms based on administrative tax records, with data back to September 2017. The non-coverage of the
demonetization period or of informal sector employment make these data inappropriate for our analysis.


                                                        16
day prior, the individual (i) did any paid work, (ii) was on paid or unpaid leave, (iii) was
not working because his/her workplace was temporarily shut down for maintenance or labor
dispute but expected to resume work within 15 days, (iv) owned a business in operation, or
(v) assisted in a family business. The survey covers roughly 110,000 adults (persons 15+)
per month, comparable to the sample size (although not the coverage rate) of the CPS.19
    We construct district-month measures of employment and population by aggregating the
individual observations using the survey weights. This step introduces four complications.
First, while the survey has national representation, it does not field in every district in every
month. Rather, it uses a rotation schedule wherein each primary sampling unit (a town or
village) with households in the sample gets visited once every four months. This pattern
means that most districts appear in the sample only once every four months, with larger
districts surveyed more frequently. The typical month therefore contains observations drawn
from roughly 150 districts. For this reason, we pool over adjoining months to increase the
sample size. Second, the survey is in the field continuously over the course of a month and we
do not know the exact interview date for each respondent. We exclude November 2016 from
the analysis since responses in that month mix pre-demonetization and post-demonetization
outcomes. Third, the survey weights do not aggregate to estimates of district population
that are consistent across months. We therefore use the ratio of total employed to persons
15 and older as our main outcome. Finally, we weight regressions using this variable by the
number of individual-level observations in the district to reflect the aggregation step.

Nightlights. Our second measure of real activity following demonetization is the change
in nightlight intensity. Nightlight intensity refers to low-light imaging data collected by
satellite and filtered to measure the quantity of artificial (i.e. human-generated) light in an
area. Such data have been used to augment official measures of output and output growth
and to generate estimates for areas or periods where official data are unavailable (Henderson,
Storeygard, and Weil, 2012). In our context, nightlight intensity could reflect shops closing
early because of a lack of customers or lower activity in factories which usually operate after
dark.
    We use the VIIRS DNB data collected by NOAA using the Suomi National Polar Part-
nership satellite, which was launched in 2011 (Elvidge, Baugh, Zhizhin, Hsu, and Ghosh,
  19
    The survey shares other similarities with the CPS and the Survey of Income and Program Participation
(SIPP), such as the use of a stratefied sampling design (based on the 2011 Census) and a rotation structure
wherein individual sampling units enter the survey every four months. The survey does not include any units
from the following states or union territories: Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura,
Meghalaya, Sikkim, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Lakshadweep and Daman and Diu.

                                                    17
2017). Despite the filtering, some stray light remain in these data. NOAA provide annual
composites which contain additional processing to remove such stray light. We follow World
Bank (2017) in removing cells (roughly 0.5km2 ) for which the annual average of the data
differ substantially from the annual composites and then aggregating to the district level.
The resulting data are monthly frequency and contain substantial seasonality. We seasonally
adjust the data in both levels and logs by regressing nightlights on district-specific linear
time trends and month categorical variables over the period April 2012 to March 2016,
remove the month-specific factors, and then keep the series for each district (unadjusted,
adjusted in levels, adjusted in logs) with the smallest variance. This procedure uses only
data from before demonetization to perform the seasonal adjustment. Finally, we aggregate
the monthly data to quarterly to remove very high frequency volatility, dropping October
2016 from 2016Q4 so that 2016Q4 is (almost entirely) post-demonetization.

ATM/POS. We obtain monthly data for the period January 2016 to June 2017 on the
value of ATM withdrawals and point-of-sale (POS) transactions by PIN code from National
Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an umbrella organization set up by the RBI to
operate retail payments systems. A POS terminal is a device which enables payment by
credit or debit card over a telephone line or internet connection. We aggregate the data to
the district level using a concordance file from the post office. Where a PIN code covers
multiple districts, we assign the district based on the location of the main post office in the
district.

E-Wallet. We obtain monthly indexes of the total value of e-wallet transactions by district
from a wallet company for the period September 2016 to July 2017. E-Wallet technology
functions similar to pre-paid cards.20

Bank deposits and credit. We obtain publicly available end-of-quarter data on bank
deposits and credit outstanding by district from the RBI Quarterly Statistics on Deposits
and Credit of Scheduled Commercial Banks. These data come from branch-level reporting.
Therefore, district-level deposits correspond to deposits in accounts opened at branches
within the district. Likewise, district-level credit means loans granted by loan officers at
branches within the district regardless of the location of the borrower.

    The wallet company issued the following disclaimer:“Wallet company shared only normalized data on
payments to merchants at an aggregate level for academic research. No user data has been shared in any
form. Wallet company does not have any role in drawing inferences of the study and the views expressed in

                                                   18
GDP and population. We obtain district-level measures of GDP, sectoral GDP, and
population from Indicus, a private data firm, and use these data to convert various series
to a per capita basis and as control variables below. For all three variables we use data
from 2015, the last year of data available. We obtain national quarterly seasonally-adjusted
nominal and real GDP from OECD.21


4.2       Summary Statistics
Table 3 reports cross-district summary statistics for December 2016, March 2017, and
June 2017. The median district in December 2016 had currency equal to 42% of its pre-
demonetization level. Essentially all districts experienced a contraction, with the 90th per-
centile district at 70% of its pre-demonetization level. At the other extreme, the 10th per-
centile district had currency equal to only 33% of its pre-demonetization level. By March
2017, currency in the median district had recovered to 83% of its pre-demonetization level
and by June 2017 the median district had no net contraction remaining. Thus, in the first
few months demonetization affected essentially all areas of India but with varying intensity,
and by summer 2017 the shock had mostly been undone.


4.3       What Determines Geographic Variation in the Shock?
The next section reports cross-sectional correlations of outcome measures with the demone-
tization shock. Causal interpretation of these correlations requires that the variation in de-
monetization intensity be uncorrelated with the no-demonetization baseline paths of the out-
come variables, similar to the parallel trends assumption required in difference-in-difference
estimation.
    As a starting point, the demonetization shock Zi,t could vary across districts because of
variation in the pre-demonetization share of large notes or because of variation in the arrival
rate of new notes. In fact, table 3 shows that the pre-demonetization share of large notes
varies little across districts, with a standard deviation of si of 4 percentage points and an
interdecile range of 83% to 95%. As a result, essentially all of the variation in Zi,t comes
from variation in the replacement rate of demonetized notes; the correlation of Zi,t and an
alternative measure that sets the large note share to the national level of 0.87 reported by
the RBI is above 0.99.

      The Indian Ministry of Statistics does not publish a seasonally-adjusted measure of quarterly GDP.

    Figure 5 shows a map of the demonetization shock in December 2016 by district, with
districts with larger shocks shaded darker. The RBI offices in some states appear to have
received more new currency notes than in others. We address the spatial correlation in what
follows by clustering standard errors by state.
    A violation of parallel trends could occur if the RBI steered new notes toward areas with

secularly growing or shrinking currency demand. However, the narrative record does not
support the supposition that the RBI allocated new notes geographically in a manner deter-
mined by local economic conditions, at least for the first few months after demonetization.
The official post-partum of the episode contained in the RBI’s 2017 annual report (RBI,
2017a, p. 132) starts by acknowledging “the logistical difficulties in supplying banknotes to
all currency chests in a short span,” suggesting that logistical factors may have played a role
in the geographic distribution. It continues: “Fresh notes were distributed to every Issue
Office in accordance with a planned allocation. The Regional Office-wise allocation of notes
was revised during the last quarter of 2016-17 [calendar quarter 2017Q1] based on the SBNs
[demonetized notes] deposited and cash supplied in issue circles during the demonetization
period.” The RBI has not made public the particulars of the “planned allocation,” but its
sophistication would have been limited by the secrecy surrounding the policy prior to its
announcement as very few officials even within the government knew of the policy ahead
of time. Moreover, the RBI in October 2016 could not have known the precise geographic
distribution of existing 500 and 1000 notes in circulation. The next sentence of the report
indicates that the RBI did not begin to incorporate real-time feedback concerning the ge-
ographic distribution of demonetized notes or other currency demand factors until early in
2017. Thus, the narrative record comports with treating the geographic distribution of the


                                              21
demonetization shock as “as good as random” at least through December 2016 and probably
afterward as well.
    Finally, we look for statistical patterns that would suggest a distribution of new notes in
a way correlated with our outcome variables. In the next section, we report figures showing
the correlations of outcomes and the demonetization shock before November 2016 and find no
evidence of pre-trends in the data. Here we report correlations of the log of Zi,t in December
2016 with other variables in our data set: 2015 GDP per capita, the 2015 share of GDP
in agriculture, the distance from the district to the closest RBI office, bank penetration,
population density, and demonetized notes per capita. The largest bivariate correlation is
with demonetized currency per capita – more currency-intensive areas experienced slower
replacement rates. This pattern could reflect a desire by the RBI to smooth the per capita
allocation of new notes across areas or simply that the RBI did not know the geographic
distribution of old notes in real time. There is no reason it would cause a violation of
the parallel trends assumption. In what follows we will report specifications which control
directly for GDP per capita, the agriculture share of GDP, and population density.


5    Cross-sectional Results
In this section we use the geographic variation in the net drop in cash due to demonetization
to document the following results: (i) demonetization caused cash shortages, as evidenced by
a sharper decline in ATM withdrawals in areas with larger shocks; (ii) economic activity, as
measured by employment rates and nightlights, fell in these areas relative to areas experienc-
ing smaller shocks; (iii) these areas adopted alternative forms of payment; and (iv) deposits
increased more and credit fell in these areas. These results, which come from disparate data
sources, together provide a consistent account of the effects of demonetization.
    We emphasize at the outset three important advantages of the cross-sectional approach.
First, it holds constant other policies or shocks affecting the whole economy around the
period of demonetization. Moreover, even if other policies or shocks had differential effects
across subnational areas, the cross-sectional approach will still uncover the causal effect of
demonetization as long as the demonetization shock is uncorrelated with the geographic
footprint of these other variables. Second, instead of a single time series with a possible
break in November 2016, the geographic variation in demonetization intensity generates a
large sample with varying treatment intensity. The large sample makes possible tighter
inference. Third, the cross-sectional comparison isolates the component of demonetization

due to the temporary unavailability of currency. While we believe this aspect to have been
the dominant channel, in the next section we discuss other possible channels which might
apply at the aggregate level.


5.1     Cross-sectional Specification
Our empirical specification is:

                        (yi,t − yi,baseline ) = β0,t + β1,t zi,treatment + Γt Xi + i,t ,                 (18)

where yi,t denotes the natural logarithm of an outcome variable in district i, yi,baseline denotes
the log of the variable in the period immediately preceding demonetization (October 2016 for
monthly frequency data and 2016Q3 for quarterly frequency data), zi,t = ln Zi,t is the log of
the demonetization shock, zi,treatment is set to zi,t for t ∈ {November 2016, December 2016}


                                                       23
and the December 2016 value for all other periods, and Xi is a vector containing any con-
trols. The coefficients β1,t trace out the cumulative response at various horizons t to the
demonetization shock in December 2016.
    We offer three comments on specification (18). First, this specification cannot disentangle
contemporaneous from lagged effects of the demonetization shock in months after December
2016. Rather, the coefficient β1,t reflects both the persistence in zi,t which makes zi,treatment
correlated with zi,t for months after December 2016 and true lagged effects of zi,treatment
on outcomes. We do not attempt to separate these effects because of the possible concern
raised above that the distribution of new notes after December 2016 reflected contemporane-
ous factors and because in any case the stability of the rank of a district in the cross-sectional
distribution of shocks over time yields too little variation to separately identify contempo-
raneous from lagged effects.22 Second, some of the dependent variables used in the analysis
have wide tails. The log-log specification helps to reduce sensitivity to outliers. We further
trim observations with dependent variable in the the top and bottom 0.5% of the distribution
in the period of analysis. Third, we cluster standard errors by state to account for the spatial
correlation in Zi,t shown in figure 5. This level of clustering results in about 30 clusters.23
We follow the advice of Imbens and Kolesár (2016) and apply the “LZ2” correction to the
standard errors and compute confidence intervals using a t-distribution with degrees of free-
dom suggested by Bell and McCaffrey (2002).24 Imbens and Kolesár (2016, table 4) present
Monte Carlo evidence that the resulting confidence intervals have good coverage even with
as few as five clusters or unbalanced cluster size.

(proportionally) fewer new notes had sharper declines in ATM activity. The left panel

     For example, the Spearman rank correlation of zi for December 2016 and March 2017 is 0.80.

     India consists of 29 states and 7 union territories and we use the term “state” in the main text to
refer to either. We assign districts in Telangana to the same cluster as districts in Andhra Pradesh (the
former was carved out of the latter in 2014 and both states share a single RBI regional office located in
Hyderabad), have no currency chest data for the territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and exclude the
territory of Chandigarh because it has Zi,t < 0. Therefore, the regressions that follow have a maximum of
33 clusters. In specifications controlling for 2015 GDP per capita, we further drop the two union territories
of Daman & Diu and Lakshadweep due to lack of GDP data.
  24
     The LZ2 correction applies a small sample adjustment that exactly corrects for finite sample bias in the
sample counterpart of E[i,t 0i,t ] when the true sampling distribution of i,t is i.i.d. The degrees of freedom
for the t-distribution are chosen such that under homoskedasticity the first two moments of the distribution
of the error covariance matrix coincide with the first two moments of a chi-squared distribution.

 Notes: The left panel presents a scatter plot of the log change in ATM withdrawals between October 2016
and December 2016 and the log demonetization shock. The light blue circles show the raw data and are
sized proportional to 2015 district GDP. The dark red circles average observations into 30 quantile bins of
the currency shock. The dashed line gives the best fit line. The right panel reports the coefficient and 95%

provides a non-parametric representation of the data. The vertical axis gives the log change
in ATM activity from October 2016, the last full pre-demonetization month, to December
2016, the first full month following demonetization. The horizontal axis shows zi,t , the
log of the average daily value in December 2016 of the demonetization measure described
by equation (10). Each blue circle corresponds to a district, with the size of the circle
proportional to 2015 district GDP. The red circles show the (unweighted) means of the
change in ATM activity for each of 30 quantile bins of zi,t . Thus, the figure overlays a
“binned scatter plot” on top of the raw data. The dashed red line shows the best fit line.
    The right panel of figure 6 reports the coefficient from estimating equation (18) with no
covariates in Xi for each month from November 2015 to June 2017. Thus, the value for
December 2016 gives the slope of the best fit line in the figure in the left panel. The dashed
lines show the (point-wise) 95% confidence intervals.
    The figure shows a statistically strong, positive correlation between the arrival of new
currency by December 2016 and ATM withdrawals. The link between money supply and cash
withdrawals validates the usefulness of our geographic shock measure and provides prima
facie evidence of a cash shortfall in which households are off their money demand curve. The
near-zero values in the right panel for months before November 2016 indicate that districts
which experienced larger demonetization shocks exhibited parallel trend growth of ATM
withdrawals before the shock occurred. The cross-sectional impact of the shock on ATM
withdrawals is concentrated in December 2016 but remains through June 2017. In terms of

magnitude, the predicted difference in ATM withdrawals between districts at the 10th and
90th percentiles of the December 2016 shock distribution is 37 log points.
    Table 5 demonstrates the robustness of the cross-sectional pattern. Column (1) repro-
duces the slope coefficient from the left panel of figure 6. Column (2) adds covariates to the
regression: 2015 GDP per capita, the 2015 agriculture share of GDP, log population density,
and nine lags of ATM transactions growth. The lags of ATM growth control directly for any
pre-trends while the 2015 level of GDP per capita and agriculture share of GDP control for
basic features of the industrial structure of Indian districts. As shown in table 4, population
density correlates with the demonetization shock. Yet, inclusion of these covariates has little
effect on the coefficient on zi,t .
    Column (3) weights the regression by district GDP. The coefficient changes little. Weight-
ing would be appropriate if larger districts had less measurement error or if the effect of a
given amount of demonetization varied with district size (Solon, Haider, and Wooldridge,
2015). The stability of the standard error in the weighted specification militates against the


                                                      26
efficiency rationale. The small change in the point estimate suggests that weighting due to
heterogeneous treatment effects is unnecessary. Appendix B.4 further explores heterogeneous
treatment effects by interacting zi,t with other variables and shows economically small and
statistically insignificant interaction coefficients.

Employment and nightlights. Figure 7 and table 6 display our next main result – de-
monetization reduced real economic activity. The scatter plots in the left panels of figure 7
show non-parametrically that areas with larger declines in currency experienced sharper
declines in employment and in nightlight activity after demonetization occurred. The right
panels show no evidence of pre-trends and highly statistically significant post-demonetization
differences, which last into the spring of 2017 before fully dissipating as all areas get remon-
etized.25
    The magnitude of the effect on real activity is substantial. The predicted difference in
employment growth between districts at the 10th and 90th percentiles immediately after
demonetization is 4.0 log points while the predicted difference in nightlight growth is 14.0
log points.26 Based on both annual and long-term growth rate comparisons for a sample
of 188 countries, Henderson, Storeygard, and Weil (2012) argue for an elasticity of GDP
growth to nightlight growth of 0.3. Their estimate remains similar even for a sub-sample of
low and middle-income countries. Using this elasticity yields a predicted difference in GDP
of roughly 4.2 log points. It bears emphasizing that these two measures of economic activity
come from very different sources – a household survey of employment status and satellite
measures of nightlight activity – yet they suggest quantitatively similar declines in output.
The two measures together therefore provide powerful evidence of a link between money and
output during demonetization.27
  25
     Recall that the employment survey uses a rotation schedule such that each month contains data for only
about 150 districts. For this reason, the top left panel of table 6 pools observations from December 2016,
January 2017, and February 2017 in order to obtain a more complete sample of districts and the top right
panel shows coefficients grouping months with the same sample units. Because the data start in January
2016, the first point shown in the top right panel contains data from two rather than three months, explaining
the wider confidence interval around that point.
  26
     Technically, the predicted difference in the growth rate of the employment-to-population ratio is 4.0 log
points. Recall that the household survey data from which we calculate the employment-to-population ratio do
not permit measurement of the change in population. Assuming zero effect of demonetization on population,
the predicted difference in the growth rate of the employment-to-population ratio is also the predicted
difference in the growth rate of employment. We believe such an assumption to be reasonable given the
short time horizon over which demonetization occurred. Nonetheless, if in fact more severe demonetization
in an area led to worker outflows, then the effect on employment would be larger than the 4.0 log point
difference given in the main text.

  Notes: The top left panel presents a scatter plot of the log change in the employment-to-population
ratio relative to the last observation before November 2016 and the log demonetization shock and pools
observations from December 2016, January 2017, and February 2017. The bottom left panel presents a
scatter plot of the log change in nightlight activity between July to September 2016 and November-December
2016 and the log demonetization shock. The light blue circles show the raw data and are sized proportional
to 2015 district GDP. The dark red circles average observations into 30 quantile bins of the currency shock.
The dashed line gives the best fit line. The right panels report the coefficients and 95% confidence intervals
from estimating equation (18) for the period indicated on the horizontal axis.


   The remainder of table 6 illustrates the robustness of the employment and nightlight
results. Columns (2) and (5) show robustness to controlling for lagged outcomes and the
electricity consumption. Quarterly data on electricity consumption by district do not exist. Instead, we use
state-level data on electricity consumption and show (i) the cross-district relationship between nightlight
growth in 2016Q4 and demonetization severity also holds at the state level; (ii) there is a strong cross-state
relationship between nightlight growth and growth of electricity consumption; and (iii) after controlling
for electricity consumption, there is no relationship between nightlight growth and demonetization severity.
This last result is exactly what should happen if nightlight growth is related to demonetization only because
electricity consumption is related to demonetization.

 Notes: The dependent variable is the log point change from pre-demonetization to post-demonetization
multiplied by 10. In columns (1)-(3) the sample pools all observations from December 2016 to February
2017. In columns (4)-(6) the sample includes observations from December 2016, excluding districts in Uttar
Pradesh. Column (7) adds these districts to the sample. Columns (2), (3), (5), (6) additionally control
for lags of the dependent variable. Columns (1) and (2) weight the regression by the number of individual
observations in the district in the Consumer Pyramids data and column (6) weights the regression by district
GDP. Standard errors in parentheses clustered by state using the “LZ2” bias-reduction modification suggested
by Imbens and Kolesár (2016). ∗∗ ,∗ ,+ denote significance at the 1, 5, or 10 percent level based on a t-

level of GDP per capita and the agriculture sectoral share. Columns (3) and (6) show
robustness to weighting or not. For employment, we weight the baseline specification by
the number of individual-level observations in the district-month to reflect the construction
of the district employment variable from individual-level data. Column (3) shows that not
weighting increases the standard error substantially, consistent with a noisier measure of
employment for districts with fewer individual observations. Finally, our baseline sample for
nightlight activity only excludes districts in the state of Uttar Pradesh because they exhibit
implausible growth of human-generated nightlights between 2016Q4 and 2017Q1. Column
(7) shows that including these districts has essentially no effect on the estimated effect on

POS and E-Wallet. The next set of results in figure 8 and table 7 show the shift to
alternative payment technologies. Payments using both E-Wallet and POS increased more
in districts experiencing sharper declines in money following demonetization. Thus, while
these areas experienced declines in overall economic activity and ATM usage, they had faster
growth of alternative payments mechanisms. This pattern strongly militates against the
presence of an unobserved demand shock confounding our identification, as a pure demand
shock would induce positive comovement across all payments mechanisms and output. While
the e-wallet data start only in September 2016, limiting our ability to test for pre-trends,
the POS data show no differential adoption during the pre-demonetization period.
    Table 7 shows robustness to the usual specification perturbations. The e-wallet results
are highly robust and all statistically significant. The standard errors in the POS regressions
are much larger, such that the coefficient on zi,t is significant only at the 10% level in the
weighted specification.

Deposits and Credit. Figure 9 and table 8 report our final set of results covering bank
deposit and credit growth. We find evidence of bank deposits increasing and credit con-
tracting in areas experiencing more severe demonetization. The effect on deposits appears
short-lived while the effect on credit may be more persistent. Because banks have access to
internal credit markets and banks in more-demonetized districts experienced faster deposit
growth, we can interpret the contraction in lending in those districts as due to lower borrower
demand for credit. As a caveat to these results, recall that the credit variable corresponds
to loans made by banks within a district regardless of the location of the borrower. These
results appear broadly robust to alternative specifications.


6      Discussion and Relation to Aggregate Impact
The cross-sectional results establish that areas experiencing more severe demonetization
had sharper declines in ATM withdrawals, reduced economic activity, faster adoption of

    The median quarterly growth rate among districts in Uttar Pradesh in 2017Q1 was 64 log points, equal
to the 99th percentile quarterly growth rate for all other districts pooling over all quarters between 2015Q4
and 2017Q3. A possible explanation for the behavior of nightlights in 2017Q1 is that Uttar Pradesh held
statewide elections in February and March of 2017 and the ruling party accelerated electrification in the
run-up to the election.

cross-sectional patterns reject monetary neutrality and the cashless limit in the context of
India’s demonetization.
    We now turn to the effect on aggregate economic activity. We first report time series ag-
gregates around demonetization. Then, we discuss how the cross-sectional evidence informs
about the aggregate impact of demonetization.

6.1     Aggregate Time Series
Figure 10 plots time series aggregates around demonetization. The vertical line in each
figure shows the period in which demonetization occurred. In interpreting these figures, it is
important to keep in mind that other economic shocks and policies besides demonetization
also affected the global economy and India specifically during this period, factors that the
cross-sectional approach could ignore. Salient examples include the election of Donald Trump
on the same day as the demonetization announcement, a rise in the global price of crude
oil of 60% from January to October 2016, a better Monsoon rainfall than in the previous
year, increased uncertainty related to capital flows into Foreign Currency Non-Repatriable
accounts and accompanying exchange rate volatility in November 2016, and an overhaul of
the Indian sales tax collection system in the summer of 2017.

actions all exhibit essentially no growth in the periods before demonetization and then a
sharp contraction (ATM withdrawals) or increase (e-wallet and POS) exactly at the time
demonetization occurred. The scale of the changes in these variables – a 50% decline in
ATM withdrawals, a doubling of e-wallet transactions, and a sextupling of POS transactions
between October and December 2016 – seem difficult to attribute to any economic shock
other than demonetization.29
    In contrast, the variables representing aggregate real economic activity – GDP growth,
employment, and nightlights – do not exhibit clear patterns around demonetization, nor do

bank deposits or credit.30 The apparent insensitivity of GDP could reflect offsetting shocks
at the aggregate level. As well, and importantly, while the level of GDP includes an estimate
of informal sector activity derived from a quinquennial survey, quarterly changes in GDP do
not reflect any direct measurement of informal sector activity.31 The informal sector in India
  30
     Rural wage inflation (the only high frequency wage series available) and consumer price inflation remained
positive and showed no discernible change in trend around demonetization. This is consistent with the
model’s assumption of downward wage and therefore price rigidity.
  31
     The level of output of the informal sector in a base year is obtained from the quinquennial National
Sample Survey of Unincorporated Enterprises. The survey in use at the time of writing was conducted in
2010-2011. Output of the informal sector in subsequent years is projected forward based on other indicators.
For manufacturing, the indicator is the growth of formal sector manufacturing as measured in the Annual
Survey of Industries (when it becomes available) or the index of industrial production. For services, the
indicators are growth rates of sales taxes and service taxes, which reflect a combination of changes in
compliance and real activity (CSO, 2015). Thus, even annual GDP does not incorporate direct measures of
informal sector activity. In addition, quarterly GDP relies on a subset of the source data to allocate annual
GDP across quarters. These indicators, such as the monthly industrial production index, mostly cover
the largest formal sector establishments. Other high frequency economic indicators show sharper declines

in activity than does GDP (Goldman Sachs, 2017). As an additional complication, India does not report
seasonally-adjusted quarterly GDP. The data in figure

is estimated to account for 81% of total employment (ILO, 2018) and 44% of total output
(CSO, 2018) and is especially cash-intensive and therefore likely to have been affected by
demonetization. In fact, the government itself concluded that official GDP would understate
the impact of demonetization. CEA (2017, p. 19), the annual report written by the chief
economist of the Government of India, states: “Recorded GDP growth in the second half
of FY2017 will understate the overall impact [of demonetization] because the most affected
parts of the economy — informal and cash-based — are either not captured in the national
income accounts or to the extent they are, their measurement is based on formal sector
indicators. For example, informal manufacturing is proxied by the Index of Industrial Pro-
duction, which includes mostly large establishments. So, on the production or supply side,
the effect on economic activity will be underestimated.” Further, if demonetization pushed
some activity from the informal to the formal sector, official GDP could have spuriously
risen.
    Employment and nightlight activity better reflect the informal sector but have distinct
drawbacks at the aggregate level. For employment, the short time series of the data precludes
seasonal adjustment. For nightlight activity, changes in long-run factors such as electric ca-
pacity and measurement error in the procedure for removing stray light can generate changes
in nightlight activity unrelated to high frequency economic activity. Importantly, as long as
district-specific seasonal patterns in employment and the long-run and measurement error
components of nightlight activity growth are orthogonal to the demonetization shock zi,t , the
cross-sectional approach above remains valid despite these challenges (see appendix B.2 for
additional detail). These considerations all favor emphasis on the impact of demonetization
as revealed by the cross-sectional patterns.


6.2    Aggregate Implications of the Cross-Section
To assess the implications of the cross-sectional patterns for the aggregate impact of demon-
etization, we start by cumulating the cross-sectional effects over districts. This calculation
uses the cross-sectional coefficient to impute to each district the change in the outcome vari-
able relative to if no change in money balances had occurred, i.e. Zi,t = 1, and then sums
over districts. The calculation would exactly recover the national impact of the currency
shortfall if each district were an isolated entity. The formula for the cumulated effect in

                        i:Zi,t ≤1                                β1,t i:Zi,t ≤1 zi,t Yi,baseline
                                    P                          ≈      P                          ,         (19)

where Yi,baseline denotes the level of the variable in the pre-demonetization period. Intu-
itively, the cumulated decline is approximated by the regression coefficient multiplied by a
pre-treatment outcome-weighted average of the demonetization shock. Using the coefficients
shown in columns (1) and (4) of table 6, for employment this calculation yields a decline of
3.3 p.p., while for nightlights this calculation yields a decline of 12.0 p.p., which translates
into an output decline of 3.6 p.p. after applying the 0.3 elasticity advocated by Hender-
son, Storeygard, and Weil (2012). Appendix figure B.3 shows the counterfactual paths of
employment and nightlight activity implied by these totals.
    The preceding calculation assumes a log-linear relationship between the cash shortage
and outcome variables. While the scatter plots shown above appear consistent with such
linearity, we lack the power to test for a non-linearity or kink at small declines in cash
because essentially all districts experienced a large decline in currency. Assuming instead
a flat relationship (no effect of the cash shortage on outcomes) for cash declines of less
than 10% would change the implied decline in employment to 3.0 p.p. and the decline in
nightlights to 10.9 p.p.32
    The next step is to relate the quantity defined in equation (19) to the actual national
effect of demonetization. Two types of considerations arise. First, the impact of the currency
shortage found in the cross-section may differ from the impact in the aggregate. In the
context of the model in section 3, trade linkages across districts make the cumulated decline
in output a lower bound for the true aggregate decline. The lower bound arises because of
the tradeables sector; some of the demand shortfall in a local area gets exported to other
areas through trade linkages. This logic closely relates to theoretical results presented in
Nakamura and Steinsson (2014), Farhi and Werning (2016), and Chodorow-Reich (2019) in
the context of estimation of cross-sectional fiscal multipliers. In the demonetization context
the lower bound is especially sharp because national interest rates remained fixed and total
government liabilities did not change. Moreover, the model accommodates arbitrary labor
mobility without impacting the lower bound result because the downward wage constraint
  32
    Alternatively, we can attempt to adjust the district-level shocks by the fraction of demonetized notes
that had been used for storage by assuming constant chest velocity of notes not used for storage. Doing
so implies slightly smaller but still statistically significant aggregated declines in employment and nightlight
activity.



                                                           37
binds in all areas. More generally, higher labor mobility at the local than the national
level, which can make cross-sectional multipliers larger than the aggregate (Chodorow-Reich,
2019), cannot undo the lower bound in this case because our empirical labor market measure
— the employment-to-population ratio — already removes the component of the employment
change due to labor mobility.33
    Applying the lower bound result to the cross-sectional estimates for employment and
nightlights, we conclude that the cash shortage caused by demonetization generated a decline
in national economic activity of roughly 3 p.p. or more in November and December 2016
relative to a no-demonetization counterfactual.34 Similarly, the effect on credit implies a 2
p.p. or more decline in 2016Q4. These effects dissipate over the few months. Is such a
decline large? The magnitude of the peak effect on output is comparable to a roughly 200
basis point tightening of the monetary policy rate based on the median of estimates reviewed
in Ramey (2016) of econometric studies of U.S. data. Moreover, it rejects the cashless limit
wherein all that matters in the conduct of monetary policy is the interest rate. On the other
hand, the output decline is an order of magnitude smaller than the decline in cash itself.
This difference illustrates the Lucas (1976) critique in action – in response to a change in
policy, agents endogenously adjust (changing κ in our model) rather than passively obeying
a pre-existing CIA constraint.
    The second consideration in relating the cumulated cross-sectional results to the aggregate
involves effects of demonetization beyond the decline in currency. For example, demonetiza-
tion may have bolstered or curtailed confidence in the government or caused short-run supply
disruptions as economic activity migrated from the informal to the formal sector. Our evi-
dence speaks to the effect of the cash shortage caused by demonetization on cross-sectional
and aggregate outcomes; it does not inform about other possible channels which apply only
at the aggregate level or are orthogonal to the cash replacement shock. Abstracting from
these other channels, the lower bound result for the impact of the cash shortage points to an
absolute decline in economic activity at the end of 2016 not captured in official statistics.35
  33
     More precisely, the cumulation of the employment results imposes fixed population. If in reality some
workers moved from more-demonetized to less-demonetized regions, then the number in the text would
understate the employment decline.
  34
     The aggregated changes in ATM withdrawals, e-wallet transactions, and POS transactions from applying
equation (19) are also all smaller than the actual aggregate changes. However, some special factors apply to
these variables. Many ATMs temporarily went out of service to receive recalibration required to dispense the
new notes, independent of cash availability. Increasing returns to scale of payments technologies, information
network effects, and increased advertising all may have contributed to a common component of adoption of
alternative payments technologies across areas.
  35
     In the context of our model, aggregate economic activity must have declined if the wage constraint was



                                                     38
7     Conclusion
Using geographic variation in the severity of demonetization, we have shown that a sharp,
temporary decline in currency caused declines in ATM withdrawals, reduced economic activ-
ity, faster adoption of alternative payment technologies, and higher deposit and lower bank
credit growth in Indian districts. These cross-sectional patterns reject monetary neutrality
and the cashless limit in this episode.
    While certainly exotic, demonetization offers lessons for other settings. For example,
what economic costs would result from a country leaving the euro and having to print new
national currency? Or, in a country such as Sweden that already largely uses electronic
payment media, what would happen if the national payments network were to suffer an
outage? Our results point to the possibility of substantial economic disruption in these
events.
    Finally, we focus in this paper on the near term impact of demonetization. Our identifi-
cation strategy based on random shocks to the cross-section of districts best lends itself to
near term analysis. There may be longer term advantages from demonetization that arise
from improvements in tax collections and in a shift to savings in financial instruments and
non-cash payment mechanisms. Evaluating these long-term consequences requires waiting
for more data and an empirical strategy suited to the study of longer term effects.




binding. If trend growth in India was 1.5% per quarter (6% per year), then our estimates imply an absolute
decline in economic activity of about 0.5% (2% annualized) in 2016Q4 from the previous quarter. This
follows from the 3% decline in November and December and no impact in the pre-demonetization month of
October.

A      Model Proofs
We begin by stating all of the first order conditions for the household:

                     Ci,t :                             U 0 (Ci,t ) = (λi,t + κθi,t ) Pi,t ,   (A.1)

                      N                                    N N
                     Ci,t :                              Pi,t Ci,t = (1 − α)Pi,t Ci,t          (A.4)

                                                                T
                                                                  = αPi,t Ci,t                 (A.5)
                                                                     T        −σ
                  T                                       T          Pt (ω)         T
                 Ci,t (ω) :                              Ci,t (ω) =                Ci,t        (A.6)
                                                                       PtT

along with the complementary slackness conditions,

                                                             M

where λi,t is the Lagrange multiplier on the budget constraint and θi,t is the Lagrange mul-
tiplier on the CIA constraint. We use the functional form τ (ηi,t ) = eνητ̄i,t where 0 < ν < 1.


Pre-Demonetization Steady State
The economy in period −1 is in a steady state where because of tax evasion incentives        the
                                                                       1         1      ν τ̄
CIA does not bind, M−1 > κ̄P−1 C−1 . This requires that κ̄(1 + ϕ( β − 1)) < ν ln 1−β , that
is, that the tax rate τ̄ is sufficiently high relative to the interest rate and to the fraction of


                                                   1
spending that needs to be undertaken in cash absent any adoption of financing technology κ̄.
This assumption reflects the argument made by the Indian government that an important
fraction of pre-demonetization cash was ‘black money’ held for tax evasion purposes.

Proposition A.1 Pre-demonetization steady state
In period -1 all regions are in a symmetric zero inflation steady state with M s = M−1 , and

    1. The economy is in full employment:

                                       T     T                       N     N
                    N−1 = N̄ ,        Y−1 = N−1 = αN̄ ,             Y−1 = N−1 = (1 − α)N̄ .            (A.9)


    2. Real money balances are increasing in the level of consumption C and in the labor
       income tax τ̄ and decreasing in the interest rate R−1 = 1/β:
                                                                                             
                    M−1        η−1 C−1                              1              ν τ̄
                        =                  ,                 η−1   = ln                           .   (A.10)
                    P−1   (1 + ϕ(R−1 − 1))                          ν         1 − (1/R−1 )

    3. Nominal wages and prices are given by:

                                  M−1                                               M−1
                       W−1 =            ,      T
                                              P−1    N
                                                  = P−1 = (1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))               .           (A.11)
                                 N̄ η−1                                            N̄ η−1



With a constant level of money supply in the economy, the wage friction does not bind and
the economy is in full employment with a fraction α of labor employed in the traded sector
and (1 − α) in the non-traded sector.


Proof
Begin by assuming θ−1 = 0. We will later derive the parameter restrictions under which this
is the case. From the F.O.C. for cash in the steady state, we have that:
                                                                   
                                               1             ν τ̄
                                        η−1   = log
                                               ν            1−β
    From the definition of η it the follows that:

                                                     M−1
                                            W−1 =
                                                    N−1 η−1

                                                    2
    From the F.O.C. for consumption in a zero inflation steady state it follows that real
consumption is constant which implies that labor is constant. This further implies that
wages are constant so the downward nominal rigidity is not binding and the economy is in
full employment, i.e. N−1 = N̄
    Now, again using the definition of η−1 and the firms optimality conditions we have:

                           M−1                                           M−1
                  W−1 =          ,       T
                                        P−1    N
                                            = P−1 = (1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))
                          N̄ η−1                                        N̄ η−1
   As prices for both types of goods are the same, using the F.O.C. for tradable and non-
tradable goods we have that:

                                           N
                                          C−1   1−α
                                           T
                                              =
                                          C−1    α
                                         T     T     N     N     N     T
   Applying market clearing conditions, C−1 = N−1 , C−1 = N−1 , N−1 + N−1 = N̄ and
rearranging yields:

                               N                        T
                              N−1 = (1 − α)N̄ ,        N−1 = αN̄

   From where point 1 follows immediately. For the remaining part of point 2 take the
optimal price of the non-tradable good producer, multiply both sides by (1 − α)N̄ and use
the market clearing condition for this good:

                                                                 M−1
                           N
                          P−1  N
                              C−1 = (1 − α)(1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))
                                                                 η−1
   Using the bundling condition for non-tradable goods and rearranging yields point 2:

                                     M−1       η−1 C−1
                                         =
                                     P−1   1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1)
   It is only left to show that indeed θ−1 = 0. We may rearrange this last expression as:

                                                             M−1
                              P−1 C−1 = (1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))
                                                             η−1

   Now the cash-in-advance constraint being slack can equivalently be stated as:

                                     κ̄(1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1)) < η−1

   And substituting the value for η−1 :


                                                3
                                                                       
                                         −1          1           ν τ̄
                            κ̄(1 + ϕ(β        − 1)) < log
                                                     ν          1−β
   A restriction on parameters that we impose.


Proof of proposition 1
Start by assuming that both the cash-in-advance constraint and the downward nominal
rigidity are binding. Now using the cash-in-advance constraint, the bundling condition for
the non-tradable good, and the market clearing condition for this good we find that:

                                            P0N N0N
                                              κ̄     = M0
                                             1−α
                                               (1 − α)M0
                                      ⇔ N0N =
                                                  κ̄P0N

    Using the optimality condition for the producer of the non-tradable good, the nominal
rigidity, and the fact that interest rates remain constant, we can substitute for the price of
the non-tradable good and obtain:

                               M0           η−1
                         N0N =     ·                    (1 − α)N̄
                              γM−1 κ(1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))
                              Z         η−1
                             = ·                    (1 − α)N̄
                              γ κ̄(1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))

And through the same procedure:

                                      Z         η−1
                              N0T =     ·                   αN̄
                                      γ κ̄(1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))

Finally:

Now, real lending to firms is given by:

                                       =
                                   P0     1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1)

Similarly:

                                   B−1   αα (1 − α)1−α ϕN̄

                                   P−1    1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1)
Since N0 < N̄ ,

                                            B0f   B−1

                                            P0    P−1
    It is only left then to show that demonetization makes the downward nominal rigidity and
the cash-in-advance constraint binding. Multiplying both sides of the optimality condition
                                        N
of non-tradable goods producer by Ci,0    = N0N yields:

                            P0N C0N = (1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))N0N W0N .

Now, using the cash-in-advance constraint and the bundling condition for non-tradable goods
we find that:
                                  Mi,0
                          (1 − α)      = (1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))N0N W0
                                   κ̄
Since demonetization is homogeneous, regional trade balances remain at zero so we may use
the same procedure for tradeable goods to find that:

                                  M0
                              α      = (1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))N0T W0
                                  κ̄

Adding these two up, using labor markets’ clearing condition and rearranging yields:

                                                   M0
                                  W0 =
                                          κ̄(1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))N0

Now we derive the condition under which if N0 = N̄ then W0 < γW−1 :

                                         M0             γM−1
                                                      <
                               κ̄(1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))N̄    N̄ η−1
                                          η−1
                              ⇔Z                      <γ
                                  κ̄(1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))

Under this conditions N0 < N̄ and W0 = γW−1 as in point 3. Finally, for the cash-in-advance


                                                5
constraint to hold, we have that:

                                              κ
                                                 = λ0 + κ̄θ0
                                              M0
                                      λ0 (1 + τ 0 (ηi,0 )) = βλ1

Notice that we have used the fact that the cash-in-advance constraint is not expected to
bind in t > 0. From these two equations it follows that:

                                           1       βλi,1
                                    θ0 =     −
                                           M0 κ̄(1 + τ 0 (η0 ))

From the problem at t = 1 we have that:

                                                      η1
                                    λ1 =              −1
                                           (1 +   ϕ(β      − 1))M1

Now, rearranging, we find that θ0 > 0 may equivalently be written as:

                            M1                  βη1
                               >
                            M0   κ̄(1 + τ (η0 ))(1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))
                                         0


Then, given this parameter restrictions, the cash-in-advance constraint is binding at t = 0.


Proof of proposition 2
We will again start by assuming that the downward nominal rigidity is binding and then show
conditions under which this is the case. We now have that in every region the optimality
condition for the producers of the non-tradable good is given by:

                               Pi,0 = (1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))γW−1
                                                         M−1
                                    = (1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))γ
                                                         η−1 N̄
                                  N
Multiplying both sides by Ci,0 = Ni,0 , using the cash-in-advance constraint, and the bundling
condition for the non-tradable good yields:

                                   Mi,0                      M−1 N
                         (1 − α)        = (1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))γ       N
                                    κ̄                       η−1 N̄ i,0




                                                   6
Rearranging and using the definition of Zi :

                                   N       (1 − α)Zi        η−1 N̄
                                  Ni,0 =
                                               γ     κ̄(1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))

As wages are constant across regions, so are the prices for tradeable varieties which implies
      T          T
that Cj,0 (ω) = Cj,0 . Now, using the tradable good producers’ optimality condition, the cash-
in-advance constraint, and the bundling condition for tradable goods, it is possible to find
that:
                               α         (1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1)γ) T
                                  Zj,0 =                   Cj,0 (i)
                               κ̄              N̄ η−1
Integrating over j in both sides and using the market clearing condition for tradable variety
i yields:

                                      α      (1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))γ T
                                         Z=                    Ni,0
                                      κ̄           N̄ η−1
                                         T   αZ        η−1 N̄
                                    ⇔ Ni,0 =
                                              γ κ̄(1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))

                          T        N
Given these values for Ni,0 and Ni,0 , and the production functions, point 1 in the proposition
follows.
                                                  f
    Point 2 follows directly from the fact that Bi,0 = ϕγW−1 Ni,0 and P0 = αα (1 − α)1−α (1 +
ϕ(β −1 − 1))γW−1 . It is only left to prove that Wi,0 = γW−1 , i.e. the downward nominal
rigidity is binding. The complementary slackness condition is given by:

                                     (N̄ − Ni,0 )(Wi,0 − γWi,−1 ) = 0

From point 1 we have that if:
                                                               η−1
                              γ > αZ + (1 − α)Z̃
                                                         κ̄(1 + ϕ(β −1 − 1))

Where Z̃ = maxj Zj , then Wi,0 = γW−1 in every region i. With heterogenous money shocks
regions with lower money replacement rates enter period 1 with higher financial wealth.
The evolution of savings is given by Dj,1 − D0 = (Y0T (ω) − Cj,0  T
                                                                    (ω)) + (R0 − 1)D0 , where
(Y0T (ω) − Cj,0
            T
                (ω)) is the trade balance and (R0 − 1)D0 the interest earning on deposits from
the previous period.1 Because Y0T (ω) depends on aggregate demand and is the same across

      This is assuming that government lump-sum transfers in each region exactly equal the labor income tax

regions, but Cj,0  (ω)) is increasing in Z, regions with lower Z run trade balance surpluses
in period 0. This means that starting in period 1 low Z regions have permanently higher
wealth, and higher consumption by the amount of the interest earning on their deposits
( β1 − 1)Dj,1 . An alternative, would be to allow the government to use lump-sum taxes to
undo the dispersion in wealth in period 1. This would have no meaningful impact on the
period 0 solution.

equation (11) and equation (12). For comparison, the xs show the value of new notes as

both levels and differences.


B.2      Nightlights versus Electricity
Nightlight activity correlates with real economic activity because it reflects nighttime elec-
tricity use. Figure B.2 compares aggregate nightlight activity and total electricity use in the
quarters surrounding demonetization. Both variables fall in the quarter of demonetization.
However, only nightlight activity rebounds sharply in 2017Q1, demonstrating that nightlight
activity and electricity use can sometimes diverge.
    We now discuss why nightlight activity remains a valid measure for our cross-sectional
analysis despite the difficulties that arise in using aggregate nightlight activity to infer the
impact of demonetization. Let Yi,t denote total nightlight activity in district i in quarter t.

                                                                          10

 Notes: Seasonal adjustment of nightlight activity is done at the district level as described in the main text
of the paper. Seasonal adjustment of electricity is done at the aggregate level by regressing electricity on
four quarterly categorical variables and a linear time-trend.


We decompose nightlight activity into a number of factors:

                                                       Yi,t = Mi,t Ci,t Ui,t ,

where Ci,t denotes electric capacity and reflects long-run factors such as the degree of elec-
trification, Ui,t denotes utilization, and Mi,t denotes the component of nightlight activity
unrelated to economic activity (e.g. from not removing stray light or changing seasonal
patterns due to the satellite collection). For simplicity, we will refer to the component Mi,t
as measurement error. Let ∆ denote the difference operator, a lower case variable the log of
                                    P
the uppercase variable, and Yt = i Yi,t aggregate nightlight activity. Then it is clear that
∆yt could reflect growth in the high frequency component related to economic activity, ∆ut ,
the long-run component ∆ct , or measurement error ∆mt .
     Importantly, under our maintained assumption that severity of demonetization was as
good as randomly assigned, cross-sectional differences in nightlight activity growth isolate
the effect of demonetization on the high frequency business cycle component. Specifically, we
have that zi,t is uncorrelated with ∆mi,t and ∆ci,t . Therefore, the coefficient from a regression
of ∆yi,t on zi,t is equal to the coefficient from a regression of ∆ui,t on zi,t ; the regression
captures only the cross-sectional effect of demonetization on the component related to high
frequency economic activity.


                                                                11

 Notes: The dependent variable is the log point change in nightlights from 2016Q3 to 2016Q4 multiplied
by 10. Column (1) reproduces the baseline result at the district level. Observations in columns (2)-(4) are
collapsed to the state level and the regression is weighted by the number of districts in each state. Standard
errors in parentheses. ∗∗ ,∗ ,+ denote significance at the 1, 5, or 10 percent level.


    Finally, we use cross-sectional data on electricity use to validate the cross-sectional night-
light specification in the quarter of demonetization. Quarterly data on electricity use by
district do not exist. Instead, we use state-level data on electricity use to show that demon-
etization affects nightlight intensity because demonetization affects electricity consumption.
Table B.1 summarizes the results. Column (1) reproduces the baseline coefficient from the
cross-district regression in 2016Q4 of nightlight growth on the log of the demonetization
shock, z. Column (2) reports the same regression specification but after collapsing the data
to the state level. To make the specification comparable to the district-level specification,
we weight the regression by the number of districts in each state. The table shows a similar
magnitude of response when using cross-state variation. Column (3) regresses nightlight
growth on the growth rate of electricity use. The two variables are strongly correlated with
each other. Finally, column (4) estimates a horse-race regression. Controlling for electricity
growth makes the coefficient on demonetization essentially zero. This is exactly what should
happen if nightlight growth is related to demonetization only because electricity consump-
tion is related to demonetization. Thus, the effect of demonetization on nightlight use in the
cross-state regression goes entirely through its effect on electricity use.

B.4      Heterogeneous Treatment Effects
This appendix explores heterogeneous treatment effects. Specifically, for a variable Ii , we
first normalize the variable to have zero mean and unit variance in the regression sample and
then include both the level and the interaction of the normalized variable in the regression.
Thus, the coefficient on the interaction term has the interpretation of the additional effect
of the severity of demonetization for a district one standard deviation above the mean of the
interacted variable. We consider two proxies for financial sophistication and urbanization:
GDP per capita and population density. Neither interacts in an economically or statistically
significant manner with the severity of demonetization.

B.6              Measurement Error in the Demonetization Shock
In this appendix we show that measurement error would attenuate the empirical results
toward zero.
   Recall our baseline cross-sectional specification:

                                   ∆yi,t = β0,t + β1,t zi,treatment + Γt Xi + i,t ,                                     (B.1)

where ∆yi,t = ln Yi,t − ln Yi,baseline denotes the change in the natural logarithm of an outcome
variable relative to the period before demonetization, zi,treatment = ln Zi,treatment is the log
of the demonetization shock, and Xi is a vector containing any controls. We construct
zi,treatment by aggregating across currency chests in district i.
                                                                                        ∗
     Now suppose zi,treatment is a noisy measure of the true demonetization shock, zi,treatment ,

                                                                ∗

or from not observing individuals who deposit demonetized notes in banks in other districts
to try to circumvent deposit requirements. Thus, the true data generating process replaces

                                           i /Var zi,treatment + ei   ∈ [0, 1] as the attenuation
bias coefficient which is the contribution of the measurement error to the overall variance in
the measured demonetization shock (after partialling out covariates).
   Using equation (B.4), we see that the estimated coefficient from our baseline specification
                                                                              ∗
equation (B.1) is equal to the product of (1 − b) and the true coefficient β1,t . Since b ∈ [0, 1],
we have the result that measurement error due to misclassification of flows to currency chests
which serve multiple districts or location of deposited notes would bias our results toward
zero. The only assumptions made are that the mismeasurement is uncorrelated with the
true measure of cash shortage in each district and with the unobserved determinants of the
outcome variable.


B.7     Seasonality in CMIE Data
Insufficient historical coverage (data start in 2016) and the sampling pattern of the CMIE
data (not every district surveyed every month) make district-level seasonal adjustment of the


                                                      16
CMIE data impossible. However, any aggregate seasonal pattern is “differenced out” in the
cross-sectional estimation and affects only the constant term in the regression. There remains
the issue of district-specific seasonality. Such seasonality is classical left-hand-side measure-
ment error and will inflate the regression standard errors but not bias the point estimates.
Formally, let ∆si,t denote the (demeaned) district-specific log change in the seasonal factor
        ∗                                                                        ∗
and ∆yi,t  (demeaned) seasonally-adjusted employment growth, so that ∆yi,t         = ∆yi,t + ∆si,t
with E[∆si,t zi,treatment ] = 0. Comparing the two regression models:

                             ∗      ∗      ∗
                           ∆yi,t = β0,t + β1,t zi,treatment + Γ∗t Xi + ∗i,t ,              (B.5)
                           ∆yi,t = β0,t + β1,t zi,treatment + Γt Xi + i,t ,                (B.6)

it is apparent that the second equation is equivalent to the first with i,t = ∗i,t − ∆si,t .
                                                     
                             ∗                           ∗
Therefore, plimβ̂1,t = plimβ̂1,t , and Var β̂1,t > Var β̂1,t because the residual variance is
larger.
