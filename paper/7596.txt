                                                ABSTRACT
   Over the past 20 years, there has been a dramatic increase in the share of executive compensation
paid through stock options. In this paper, we examine the extent to which tax policy has influenced
the composition of executive compensation, and discuss the implications of rising stock-based pay
for tax policy. We begin by describing the tax rules for executive pay in detail and analyzing how
changes in various tax rates affect the tax advantages of stock options relative to salary and bonus.
Our empirical analysis leads to three conclusions. First, there is little evidence that tax changes have played
a major role in the dramatic explosion in executive stock option pay since 1980. Although the tax advantage
of options has approximately doubled since the early 1980s, options currently have only a slight tax advantage
relative to cash - approximately $4 per $100 of pre-tax compensation to the executive. A more convincing
story for the dramatic explosion in stock options involves changes in corporate governance and the market for
corporate control. For example, there is a strong correlation between the fraction of shares held by large
institutional investors and the fraction of executive pay in the form of stock options, a result that holds both
longitudinally and cross-sectionally. Second, we find evidence that the million dollar rule (which limited the
corporate deductibility of non-performance-related executive compensation to $1 million) led firms to adjust
the composition of their pay away from salary and toward "performance related pay," although our estimates
suggest that substitution was minor. We find no evidence that the regulation decreased the level of total
compensation. Third, we examine whether there is evidence for significant shifting of the timing of option
exercises in response to changes in tax rates. After replicating the Goolsbee (1999) result regarding tax-
shifting with our data for the 1993 tax reform, we show that no such shifting occurred in either of the two tax
reforms of the 1980s. Moreover, we find evidence that much of the unusually large level of option exercises
in 1992 was the result of the rising stock market rather than the change in marginal tax rates.

1.      Introduction
        Over the past 15 years, there has been a major change in the way that American
executives, particularly CEOs, are paid. For many executives, annual stock option grants are
now greater than cash compensation (salary and bonus). Annual changes in CEO wealth from
revaluations of stock and stock option holdings completely swamp cash compensation, and
provide substantial pay-to-performance sensitivity. All of this is a dramatic change from the
early 1980s when the median stock option grant to top executives was zero.
        In this paper, we examine the extent to which tax policy has influenced the composition
of executive compensation, and discuss the implications of rising stock-based pay for tax policy.
Because top executives manage assets worth billions of dollars, their compensation arrangements
and the incentives they face are of substantial importance to the performance of the U.S.
economy. Because top executives have very high incomes, their responsiveness to taxation has
important revenue and efficiency implications.
     We conduct a broad analysis of the taxation of executives. We begin by studying how tax
rates affect the degree to which options are favored relative to cash and how the tax advantage of
options has changed over time in response to changes in corporate, personal, and capital gains
tax rates. Although the tax advantage of options has approximately doubled since the early
1980s, options currently have only a slight tax advantage relative to cash — approximately $4 per
$100 of pre-tax compensation.
   We then analyze what we believe to be the three central policy questions regarding the
taxation of executive pay. First, we examine the extent to which the stock option explosion has
been influenced by the many changes in tax rates over the past 20 years. The evidence suggests
that changes in taxation have likely had a very modest influence on the option explosion.
Instead, changes in corporate governance, especially in the role of large institutional investors,
appear to have provided the main impetus for the increase in stock-based pay.
     Second, we examine the effectiveness of tax policies aimed at curbing what is deemed by
some to be excessive levels of executive compensation. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue
Code (the "million dollar rule") was enacted in 1993, which put a $1 million limit on the
deductibility (against corporate profits) of non-performance related executive pay. Although we
find evidence that this rule led to a shift in the composition of pay — away from salary and
toward more performance-related bonuses and stock options — our evidence suggests that the



                                                  1
magnitude of this substitution was small: We find no evidence that the million dollar rule
decreased total executive compensation.
   Third, we analyze the degree to which the tax code is efficient in raising tax revenue from top
executives. The stock option explosion has led to a new and important way for executives to
lowdttheir taxes in response to changes in tax rates: by timing their stock option gains. For
example, in 1993, it was widely reported in the press that well-known CEOs such as Disney's
Michael Eisner pushed their option gains into 1992 in order to avoid paying the higher personal
income tax rates implemented in 1993. In an important paper, Goolsbee (1999) argues that the
tax shifting between 1992 and 1993 was enormous, and the direct result of the increase in
marginal tax rates during this period. After replicating Goolsbee's evidence regarding tax-
shifting with our data for the 1993 tax reform, we show that no such shifting occurred in
response to either of the two tax reforms of the 1 980s. Moreover, our evidence indicates that the
stock market run-up in 1991 and 1992 was more import than the change in marginal tax rates in
causing the large option gains observed in 1992.
       This paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we discuss trends in the level and
performance sensitivity of executive compensation. In section three, we describe the tax and
accounting rules concerning executive compensation. In section four, we analyze how taxes
affect the degree to which options are favored relative to cash. In section five, we examine how
the tax advantage of options has changed over time. In section six, we provide evidence on the
effect of taxation on the composition of executive compensation. Section seven contains
empirical analysis of the million dollar rule. Section eight contains evidence on tax shifting and
option gains. Section nine concludes.


2. Trends in To.p Executive Pay
    In this section, we document how top executive pay has changed over time, and discuss how
this change has caused the sensitivity of CEO wealth to firm market value to increase
substantially. There has been a large increase in the level of CEO pay since 1980 and this
growth has been driven by the dramatic increase in stock option grants during this time (Hall and
Liebman, 1998). Although salary and bonuses nearly doubled over the period in inflation
adjusted terms, the mean value of stock option grants increased by 683 percent. The percentage
increase in the median stock option award can not be calculated because the median stock option



                                                   2
grant was zero in 1980. The median CEO did not receive an annual stock option grant until
1985. Today, nearly all top executives of large companies receive stock options and the average
stock option grant is now larger for most top executives than salary and bonus combined.
   The (inflation adjusted) growth rate of CEO pay since 1980 -- measured narrowly (cash pay
grew at an annual rate of 5        per year) or broadly (cash plus option grants grew at almost 9
                               percent
percent per year) or very broadly (total compensation, including stock and stock option
appreciation, grew at 11.5 percent per year) --has been large relative to virtually all other
groups. Indeed, the growth rate of CEO pay since 1980 has been high even relative to the pay
increases of other high-income earners. For example, the cutoff point for being in the top 0.5
percent of adjusted gross income (AGI) increased by about 3.7 percent per year, about half the
rate for direct CEO compensation (excluding stock and option appreciation). The only workers
who appear to have had faster compensation growth than CEOs are other "superstars." The
annual pay of professional baseball players increased by approximately 9.8 percent per year,
while that of professional basketball players rose by 13.9 percent per year.
    The increase in. stock options has led to a large increase in the equity holdings of top
executives, and this in turn has led to a dramatic increase in the responsiveness of executive
wealth to firm performance. Nearly all of the pay-to-performance sensitivity of executive
compensation comes from equity holdings; for a given increase in shareholder value, changes in
 the value of an executives stock and stock options are more than 50 times larger than changes in
 salary and bonus (flail and Liebman, 1998).
    As a concrete example, the estimates in Hall and Liebman (1998) imply that a 10 percent
 increase in firm value (of the median company in our sample) leads the company to increase the
 CEO's salary and bonus by about $25,000. However, this same 10 percent increase in
 shareholder value translates into $1.25 million increase in the value of the CEO's stock and stock

 option holdings.1
        The dramatic rise in the link between CEO wealth and firm performance can be seen in
 figure 1, which shows how two measures of this link have increasedsince 1980.2 The first


     1 Stock option grants are also very sensitive to changes in firm performance, mostly because many grants are
                                                                                           at-the money options are
 multi-year plans that hold the yearly number of options constant, and the same number of
 worth more when the stock price is higher and vice-versa. If stock option grant sensitivity is also included, then
 about 91 percent of pay-to-performance sensitivity comes from stock and stock option revaluations, 7 percent comes
 from stock option grant changes, and less than 2 percent comes from changes in salary and bonus. (Hall, 1999).
 2 Both measures include only the link created by CEO holdings of stock and stock options,and ignore the smaller


                                                         3
measure, the Jensen and Murphy (1990) sharing rate (shown on the left scale), is the change in
CEO wealth for a $1,000 change in firm value. The second measure is the change in CEO
wealth for a 10 percent change in firm value (see Baker and Hall, 1998). Since both measures
are strongly affected by firm size (the former has a negative correlation and the latter has a
positiv&dorrelation), the pay-to-performance changes over time are estimated with regression
(quantile) analysis that controls for changes in the distribution of firm sizes sample over time.
The figure, therefore, shows the increase in the pay-to-performance measures over timefor a
constant size firm, in this case a $1 billion firm (in constant 1998 dollars). The strikingfact is
that both measures of the pay-to-performance link have increased by nearly a factorof 10 since
1980. These pay-to-performance increases are even larger than those we reported in our earlier
paper that analyzed the period 1980 to 1994 because of the large increase in stock option grants
combined with the strong stock market performance in the 1994 to 1998 period.


 3. Tax and Accounting Rules
     Stock options give an executive the right but not the obligation to buy a share of the
 company's stock at a pre-specified price — the "exercise" or "strike" price." Typically, options
 can not be exercised immediately. That is, they vest (become owned by the executive, who can
 then exercise if he or she wishes) slowly over time. Common vesting periods are in the three- to
 five-year range, and options usually vest linearly (e.g. a four year option vests at 25 percent at
 the end of each year). An executive typically loses any unvested options upon departure.
 Although options may be exercised as soon as they vest, they do not have to beexercised until
 they expire or mature. Almost 85 percent of stock option plans have a termof exactly ten years,
 with virtually all of the remainder being in the five to ten year range. About 95 percent of
 options are granted "at the money" or at "fair market value," which means that the exercise price
 at grant date is set equal to the stock price at grant date. The remaining 5 percent areeither
 "discount" options (so called "in the money" options, where the exercise price is below the stock
 price at grant date) or "premium" options (so called "out of the money" options, where the
 exercise price is above the stock price at grant date). The holders of options typically do not
 have dividend rights or voting rights, even on vested options.3

    3.1 Tax Rules and Stock Option Compensation
   Unlike salary and bonus, stock option grants are typically an untaxed event at the time of
grant. For the most widely used options — Non-Qualified Stock Options (NQSOs) — executives
are taxed at the personal income tax rate on option profits (the difference between that stock
price and the exercise price times the number of options) when the options are exercised. The
company receives a parallel deduction against corporate income at that point. If the executive
continues to hold the shares after exercise, any subsequent appreciation is taxed at the capital
gains rate in the usual way. In 1993, an additional feature was added to the tax code (Internal
Revenue Code Section 162(M) that disallowed a corporate deduction for any executive pay
above $1 million that is not "performance based." While this rule affects executive salaries,
most bonuses qualify as performance based and standard stock options automatically qualify.
Therefore, this provision gives companies with highly paid executives an incentive to give more
pay in the form of bonuses and stock options, a subject we return to in section 7. A summary
description of the tax (and accounting) treatment of cash and option compensation is in Table I.
    A far less common type of option, which is estimated to account for about 5 percent of option
grants, is the Incentive Stock Option (ISO). While ISOs are similar to NQSOs in terms of their
design, they are crucially different in two respects. First, they have an annual cap of $100,000
per executive. Second, the tax treatment of ISOs is different. ISOs are completely untaxed at
grant or exercise. It is only at sale that the executive is taxed, and even then the executive is
taxed at the lower capital gains tax rate. The disadvantage is that the corporation never gets to
take a parallel tax deduction against corporate profits. Thus, ISOs become more attractive as the
personal tax rate increases and as the corporate tax rate and the capital gains tax rates fall.
       Two other related types of compensation, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights
are worth brief discussion. Both, however, are far less common than standard stock options.
Restricted stock is payment in the form of restricted shares, the restriction being that the shares
vest over time as with options. Unlike options, the shares typically have voting and dividend
rights. With regard to taxation, the executive is taxed at the personal rate on the value of the
restricted stock as the vesting restrictions lapse. However, the executive may choose to be taxed
at the grant date, in which case all subsequent appreciation is taxed at the capital gains rate. The
dividends paid to the executive are taxed at the ordinary rate in the usual way. The company



                                                  5
generally receives a parallel deduction equal to the amount of the executive's income when the
executive is taxed. Unlike stock options, restricted stock is not generally considered to be
"performance based" and is therefore subject to the million dollar rule (unless the vesting of the
restricted stock is performance based, which is sometimes the case).
       Stock' appreciation rights (SARs) are rights that replicate the payoffs of stock options
with a cash transfer. Thus, SARs are simpler than options in that there is no requirement to buy
and resell the stock in order to "cash out," SARs generally have the same tax treatment as
NQSOs, both to the individual and to the corporation. SARs are relatively rare, however,
because they have disadvantageous accounting treatment (described in the next section) relative
to stock options, and their main relative advantage vis-à-vis options has been essentially
replicated through broker-assisted cashless option exercises — whereby a broker makes a
"nanosecond" loan to the executive (to purchase and resell the stock) when the executive wants
to "cash in" on option profits. The tax and accounting treatment of ISOs, restricted stock and
SARs is summarized in Table 2.
       3.2     The Accounting Treatment of Options
       Unlike cash compensation, which is expensed against earnings, there is generally no
expense recognition (at grant, exercise, or sale) for options, whether they be NQSOs or ISOs. As
a result, compensation consultants often point out that stock options are the only form of
compensation that are free in an accounting sense, but still deductible for tax purposes. Stock
options do, however, lead to expense recognition if they are "discounted" ("in the money" at
grant date) or if the exercise price and number of options are not known at grant date. For
discount options, the difference between the stock price and the market price is expensed over
the vesting period. For options with variable terms (e.g. a variable exercise price, vesting that is
tied to performance), the options are marked to market and expensed during the time between
grant and exercise. Practitioners claim that the accounting treatment of options plays an
important role in the design of option program. Thus, plans that have "bad accounting" but are
thought by many to have attractive incentive features, are often not even seriously considered by
companies. Examples of such potentially attractive plans include indexed options (where a CEO
profits only if his finn's share price grows relative to some market or industry benchmark) and
option grants that are explicitly performance related, both of which would lead to expenses
against earnings.


                                                 6
        Unlike options, restricted stock and SARS do not generally receive favorable accounting
treatment. Restricted stock is generally expensed over the period in which the restrictions lapse
(usually the vesting period). The magnitude of the expense is the difference between the current
stock price and the executive's cost (if any). SARs are marked to market each period and the
difference between the stock price and the exercise price is expensed over the outstandingperiod
of SARs.


4.      The Taxation of Executive Pay: Cash versus Options
        Stock-based compensation performs two roles in executive compensation arrangements.
First, it helps align the incentives of the executive with the interests of the firm's shareholders.
Second, it often enables the firm to compensate the CEO in a way that is more advantageous
from a tax standpoint than paying the executive in salary and bonus.
     4.1 Agency Theory and Executive Compensation in the Presence of Taxation
     In standard agency theory models (Jensen and Meckling, 1976), agency costs are the result of
the separation of ownership and control. Managers do not have the same incentives as the
owners. The optimal incentive contract for managers balances the benefits of high-powered
incentives (linking the fortunes of owners and managers through stock and stock options for
example) with the costs of loading too much risk on risk-averse managers.
     The effect of taxation on the optimal contract (more precisely the share of compensation that
is performance related) is ambiguous (even in the absence of deductibility and deferral) because
there are offsetting effects. First, by reducing the share of corporate profits received by
shareholders, taxes diminish the importance to the shareholders of motivating the CEO. Taken
alone, this effect would imply that taxes would be expected to reduce the use of performance-
based compensation. Second, because the government shares in the income received by the
CEO, the variance of the CEO's income is reduced, raising his utility, and lowering the cost to
the firm of providing any given set of incentives. Third, because taxes will lead executives to
provide less effort for any given level of incentive based pay, the level of compensation that
must be provided to compensate the CEO for effort is reduced, for a given amount of incentive.
These last two factors make it cheaper for the firm to offer contracts to the CEO with large
incentive components when tax rates are higher, and should therefore increase the use of
incentive based pay. Since the net impact of taxation on the level of incentive-based pay is



                                                   7
ambiguous, agency theory provides no strong predictions about how taxation should affect the
optimal composition of option versus cash compensation.
         4.2     The Tax Advantages of Deferral
         While agency theory yields ambiguous predictions about the impact of taxes on the use of
options, therdare direct tax advantages of options since options provide executives with a way to
defer compensation and thereby lower their taxes. However, because options also lead to a
deferral of corporate tax deductibility, the tax advantages from a combined (executive and
corporate) perspective are not so straightforward. In this section, we analyze and measure the
tax advantages of stock options relative to salary and bonus compensation. We also analyze the
tax advantages of NQSOs relative to ISOs. In particular, we show how the tax advantages of
options change as personal, corporate and capital gains taxes change. We then show how the tax
advantages of options have changed over time in response to changing tax rates.
        The crucial tax difference between standard options (NQSOs) and cash payment is that
option payouts are deferred, and the two forms of compensation earn different rates of return
over the deferral period. Any analysis of the relative tax advantages of two compensation
instruments must consider the tax consequences both to the employer and to the employee —
what Scholes and Wolfson (1992) call the global contracting perspective. Thus, in order to make

valid comparisons between the two, we compare the tax burden to the executive, while holding
constant the post-tax cost to the company. By keeping post-tax employer costs (in NPV terms)
constant, any package that is preferred by the employee is tax advantaged in the global
contracting sense.
        Under this methodology, a comparison of the tax advantages of options and cash involves
comparing a pre-tax cash payment of P with an option payment that has the equivalent post tax
NPV to the company. For NQSOs, it is straightforward to show that a pie-tax payment of P to
an executive has exactly the same cost to the company as putting aside P for the purposes of
paying stock option payouts later. That is, if a company pays an executive P today, it will have
the same amount of money in N years as if it had put aside P today, let it accumulate at the rate
of return earned by the firm, and then paid it out (as compensation in the form of option gains4)
with any appreciation in year N.


4 This analysis is not unique to options. Any form of deferred compensation that enables executives to invest inside
the firm at a higher post-tax return or without paying capital gains taxes would have similar effects.


                                                        8
        Assume that the pre-tax profit rate is r, and the corporate tax rate is Tc. Then, if the
company pays P today, it receives a deduction today of P Tc, which yields


(1)             PT[l +r(1_Tc)]N

in N years, since the benefits of the tax deduction are invested in the company and receive the
after-tax corporate rate of return. Conversely, if the company puts P aside today, then it grows at
the after-tax corporate rate of return in N years to give a tax deduction of


(2)             P[l +r(ITc)INTc

which is the exact same value. Note that the equivalence of these two tax deductions is
analogous to the tax-benefit equivalence of front-loaded and back-loaded IRAs.
        An executive's payoff in N years from option profits is equal to P compounded at the
after-tax corporate rate times 1 — T, where T is the personal tax rate. Thus, the combined
payoffs in N years of the corporate deduction and the executive's post-tax payoff is:


(3)             P[1+rUTc)]NT +P[l+r(1Tj]N(1_Tp)

where the first term is the payoff from the corporate deduction and the second term is the
executive's payoff.
      The payoff to salary and bonus in N years is more complicated since an assumption must
be made about how the executive invests the original cash compensation. Forexample, if the
executive invests in an instrument with taxable interest (e.g. bonds), then the Nyear payoff from
an investment of P accumulates at the post-corporate-tax, post-personal-tax rate of return and is:


(4)    P(1 —Tn) [1 +r(1 —T)(l—T)] N


However, if an executive invests in (non-dividend paying) equities, the investment accumulates

at the higher post-corporate-tax rate of return, with the offsetting disadvantage that the capital
gains are taxed at the capital-gains rate in year N. So the executive receives



                                                  9
  (5)      p [1 +r(1—Tc)] N(1        Tp)Tcg [P(1-T)           [1 +r(1_Tc)}N_P(1_Tp)]


 where Tcg      is the capital gains tax rate.5


 Thus, putting the equations together, if an executive is paid cash, P, and investsyin bonds and 1-
 yin equities, the N year payoff (including the payoff to the corporation from thetax deduction)
 is:



 (6) P[1 +r(1-Tc)fTc+ y{P[1 +r(1 T)(1T)]N(l —T)} +

 The tax advantage of options versus salary and bonus, therefore, is the difference between the
 combined (corporate and executive) payoffs in equation (3) and the combinedpayoffs in
 equation (6).
          4.3         The Tax Advantage of Options
         We now turn to analysis of how changes in various tax rates affect the tax advantages of
options relative to cash compensation. We focus on the case in which the cash earnedby
executives is invested entirely in equities since equities are tax-favoredrelative to bonds. The
important conclusions of this analysis are not substantively different if we instead assume that a
portion of an executive's holdings are invested in bonds.
         4.3.1 The Tax Advantage of Options: Changing the Corporate Tax Rate
         Stock options are tax advantaged relative to cash simply because option payouts arc
deferred, allowing the executive to invest at the pre-personal tax rate of return (with no capital
gains tax at the end) rather than investing at the after-tax rate of return or paying the capital gains
tax. Since the advantage of being able to defer taxes is large when the corporate tax rate is low,
the tax advantage of options is larger when the corporate rate is low.


5 In practice, executives hold a combination of equities and bond-like instruments with taxable interest. Because
equities are tax favored, in the next section we simplify the analysis by assuming that executives hold
                                                                                                        only equities.
Alternatively, we could have assumed that executives hold only less risky bonds since bonds more closely match the
risk profile of a stream of tax savings. None of our empirical results aresubstantively affected by this
simplification.


                                                         10
           To illustrate this point, we define the tax advantage of options to be the dollar amount by
  which total after-tax option payoffs (to the corporation and the executive) exceed the total
  payoffs from salary, as defined by the difference of equations (3) and (6) assuming that P (the
  payment to the executive), is equal to $100 and yequals 0 (cash compensation is invested in
 equities). We use a ten-year horizon since most options have a ten-year term. We then cIculate
 how the tax advantage of options changes as the corporate tax rate varies from zero to 100
 percent, holding the personal tax rate and the capital gains rate fixed at 40 percent and 20 percent
 respectively (which approximates current rates).
          The top panel of Figure 2 shows the tax advantage of options relative to cash —
                                                                                                         precisely,
 the NPV of the total tax advantage of options for a $100 payment to the CEO — as
                                                                                                    the corporate
 tax rate changes. As expected, the tax advantage of options declines as corporate tax rates
 increase. At a zero corporate tax rate, the tax advantage of options has an NPV of $7. This
 value is about $3.5 at a corporate rate of 40 percent. When the corporate tax rate is 100 percent,
 the tax advantage of options completely disappears since the benefits of deferred compensation
 fall to zero since the after-tax return on equities (and therefore the discount rate) falls to zero.
The tax advantage of options is the NPV of the tax savings from avoiding the capital gains tax on
ten years of appreciation, which is why it is relatively modest even at the 40 percent corporate
rate.

         4.3.2 The Tax Advantage of Options: Changing the Personal Tax Rate
         Using the same assumptions as above (but this time holding the corporate rate at 40
percent, the capital gains rate at 20 percent and varying the personal rate), the tax advantage of
options declines as personal tax rates rises, as shown in the middlepanel of Figure 2. The tax
advantage of options is higher at low personal tax rates because the post-tax base that gives rise
to capital gains is higher and the advantage of avoiding the capital gains taxes is greater. The tax
advantage of options therefore declines linearly as the personal tax rate rises. At a 100 percent
personal tax rate, the executive receives nothing in eithercase, and by construction, the
company's tax deduction benefit is the same in NPV terms, so the tax advantage of options falls
to zero also.6




6 This is one place where ignoring bond investments has substantive implications. In particular, in the all-bond
case the tax advantage of options is nonmonotonic —. it rises and then falls -- as
                                                                                   personal tax rates rise.

 4.3.3 The Tax Advantage of Options: Changing the Capital Gains Tax Rate
         The tax advantage of options for various capital gains rates is depicted in the bottom
panel of Figure 2 under the same assumptions (this time holding both the personal rate and the
corporate rate at 40 percent, while varying the capital gains rate). The tax advantage of avoiding
the capital gains tax increases as the capital gains tax rate rises.


5.       How has the Tax Advantage of Options Changed over Time?
         The analysis so far has illustrated how the tax advantage of options varies with the
changes in tax rates. In this section, we show how the tax advantage of options has changed over
time as tax rates have changed.
         5.1     Top Marginal Tax Rates Over Time
         The evolution of the top marginal tax rates -- personal, corporate and capital gains -- from
1980 to 1998 is shown in Figure 3. In all cases, the top rate (the rate for taxpayers with the
highest incomes) is shown, which is not always the highest rate since various anomalies (such as
clawbacks of exemptions) sometimes lead to marginal tax rates that are higher than those for the
highest income taxpayers.
         The top personal tax rate was 70 percent in 1980, faIling to 50 percent in 1982 and 28
percent in 1988 following the 1986 tax act. The top marginal tax rate has since risen to 39.6
percent, but is effectively 42.5 percent since there is a 2.9 percent Medicare surcharge (paid half
by theemployer and half by the employee) that has no upper limit. The top corporate tax rate
has had only one significant change since 1980, falling from 46 percent before the 1986 tax act
to 34 percent following the act in 1988. The top corporate tax rate was increased to 35 percent in
1993. The top capital gains rate has fluctuated between 28 percent (approximately) and 20
percent since 1980, and is currently at 20 percent.
        5.2      The Evolution of the Tax Advantage of NQSOs
        The tax advantage of options relative to cash, defined in the same way as in section 4,
from 1980 to 1998 is shown in Figure 4. The calculations are done using the same assumptions
as before (i.e. N is ten years and cash is invested in equities) and the statutory top marginal tax
rates shown in Figure 3 are used. Due to the fall in corporate and personal tax rates, the tax

7 During the early 1980s, ihe maximum tax on earned income limited the marginal tax rate on the earnings of high
earners, so many executives did not face a decline in personal tax rates between 1981 and 1982. The empirical



                                                       12
  advantage of options increased sharply after the Tax Reform Act of 1986. This increase in tax
  advantage has largely been reversed in the 1990s as top personal tax rates havecrept back up and
  the capital gains rate has been reduced.
            Two key facts emerge from this analysis. First, there is currently only a moderate tax
  advantage to standard non-qualified stock options — on the order of $4 per $100 of compensation:
 This is because the tax advantages to the executive of deferring taxes are largely offset by the tax
 disadvantages to the company of not being able to deduct option expenses from taxable profits
 until the executive exercises the options. Second, although the 1986 tax act substantially
 increased the tax advantage of options, more than half of this increase has been reversed in the
 1990s.
            5.3    The Tax (Dis)Advantage of ISOs
            So far the analysis has focused on the tax advantages of NQSOs since they are so much
 more prevalent than ISOs, which account for only about 5 percent of option grants. The relative
 scarcity of ISOs can be explained both by their tax status and by theirper executive cap of
 $100,000 per year.
          Under what conditions are ISOs tax preferred to NQSOs? For a transfer P to an
 executive, the ISO is always tax preferred by the executive (since thecapital gains rate is lower
 than the personal rate) while the NQSO is always tax preferred from the company's perspective
 (since an ISO is not deductible). The key issue, however, is the relative advantages of the two
types of options from a global contracting perspective. Because ISOs are not deductible, the
company is indifferent between setting aside Pin the form of NQSOs today and setting asdie P
(1 - T) in the form of IS Os. (Since the NPV of the tax deduction for
                                                                      NQSOs is P T, the NPV of
thePpaymentis P—PTorP(l-T))
         Equalizing the post-tax cost of NQSOs and ISOs, we need only look at thepayoff of the
executive to determine the condition under which each is preferred. The payoff of NQSOs in N
years is:


(7)               P [1 +r(l—T3] (l—T)

The same payoff for ISOs is:


results in this paper are robust to assuming that executives faced a marginal tax rate of 50percent in 1980 and 1981.

     (8)            P (1 — T) [1   + r (hTj] N (lTcg)


  IS Os, therefore, are tax advantaged if:


 (9)                TpTcg> TcTcTcg

            Intuitively, ISOs are tax advantaged only if their advantage (the difference between the
 personal rate and the capital gains rate) is large enough to offset theircost (the disadvantage of
 not deducting at the corporate rate). Note, however, that the condition is not a simple
 comparison between the corporate rate the personal rate minus the capital gains rate (T -
 Ta).
            Figure 5 shows how the tax advantage of NQSOs relative to
                                                                         ISOs, has changed since
 1980 as tax rates have changed. Unlike the
                                            very modest changes (around 3 to 4 percent) in the
 relative tax advantages between options and cash shown in Figure 4, the relative tax advantage
 between NQSOs and ISOs has seen enormous swings. When the top personal rate was 70
 percent in 1980, ISOs were tax-favored by a margin of
                                                        greater than 6 percent. However, by 1982
 (following the 1981 tax acts that dramatically lowered the personal tax rate), ISOs became tax-
 disadvantaged by about 5 percent. By 1988 (following the 1986 tax act), ISOs became tax-
disadvantaged by about 18 percent, a dramatic swing. The raising of personal rates coupled
with a decrease in the capital gains rate has since reduced the tax disadvantage of ISOs to about
$4 per $100 of pre-tax compensation. Although hard data on ISOs are hard to come by,
practitioners (mostly compensation consultants) claim that ISOs were more popular prior to 1982
when they were tax advantaged. Although ISOs are less disadvantageous from a tax standpoint
relative to NQSOs than they were in the late 1980s, they are still disadvantageous, so it is not
surprising that they have not made a significant resurgence in recent years.


6.         Explaining the Increase in Option-based Compensation
           In this section, we analyze whether changes in tax rates affect the composition of
executive compensation, and consider the relative importance of tax factors and corporate
governance factors in explaining the increasing share of compensation paid in the formof stock



                                                   14
  options. The numerous changes in tax rates that have occurredsince 1980 provide an
  opportunity to assess whether executive compensation arrangements respond to tax incentives in
  the way that the tax avoidance model suggests. We test this model using a panel data set of
  CEOs in large publicly-traded U.S. corporations. Our identification of the tax effects relies on
 time-series variation in personal, corporate, and capital gains tax rates along with cross-sectional
 variation in corporate tax rates.
          6.1     Data
          We use a 15-year panel data set of CEOs in the largest publicly-traded U.S. corporations,
 which is described in Hall and Liebman (1998). The data set covers the years from 1980 through
 1994, and combines CEO compensation information from
                                                                    corporate proxies and 10-K filings
 with stock price and stock return information from CRSP, and accounting data from Compustat,
 In addition, some compensation data from the l970s were collected in order to construct
 measures of the value of stock options held by the CEOs in the firstperiod of the sample.8
         The feature that distinguishes our data from most other CEO data sets is that with our
 panel of yearly proxy data on option grants, option gains, and total options held, we are able to
 calculate the total value of all stock options held by the CEO at a point of time. More
 importantly, since we have the details about the stock options held (number, exercise price, time
to maturity, etc.), we can precisely calculate the change in thevalue of a CEO's stock option
holdings for a given change in firm value.
         6.2     Identification Issues
         The numerous tax changes over our sample period and the specific ways in which
changes in personal, corporate, and capital gains rates arepredicted to affect the composition of
CEO compensation give us unusually rich sources of identification. However, because many of
the changes in tax rates would be expected to affect all of the CEOs in our sample in a similar
way, we will need to pay particular attention to separating out the tax effects from
                                                                                    underlying
time-trends and other factors that changed over time. Controlling for underlying trends is
particularly important in this study because we are focusing on an outcome -- the use of stock
options — that has increased rapidly over the past two decades, and that
                                                                                 many practitioners


         We are grateful to David Yermack for providing us withsome of the data for the 1984 to 1991 period

believe was importantly affected by non-tax considerations. Thus the tax effects we are trying to
explain are deviations from a rising trend.
         We take two steps to try to separate out the tax effects from the underlying trend. First,
we include key non-tax factors that could potentially explain the increasing reliance on
performance-based compensation. It has been suggested that the dramatic increase in incentive-
based pay is the result of the remarkably poor shareholder returns during the 1970s, which
spurred the LBO and takeover movements of the 1980's. According to this story (Kaplan, 1997),
shareholders became much more powerful via the rise of institutional investors, even as the LBO
and takeover movements waned. Because the influence of institutional investors is thought to be
one of the most important mechanisms of strong corporate governance, we use the share of each
company's stock owned by institutional investors (defined as institutions with more than $100
million under management) as an explanatory variable.9 The percentage of shares owned by
large institutional investors increased from about 20 percent to almost 50 percent in 1994, an
upward trend that closely matches the sharp rise in the share of compensation in the form of
options. Indeed, in our sample, the annual average (over all of the firms in our sample) share of
stock owned by institutional investors has a correlation of 0.9 with the annual average share of
compensation paid in options.
        In addition, we include two other variables that proxy for stronger corporate governance.
The first is the size of the board. Evidence suggests that boards with smaller numbers of
directors reduce the influence of the CEO and better represent shareholder interests (Yermack,
1995). Board size fell by approximately 15 percent between 1980 and 1994. The second
variable is the fraction of the firm's board members who are inside directors or gray directors
(non-insiders who have business dealings with the company). Firms with fewer outsiders are
less likely to act in the shareholders interests, and we would predict that they would be lesslikely
to have performance-based compensation for their CEOs. The average percentage of inside and
gray directors has decreased from about 45 percent in 1980 to about 35 percent in 1994.
        Second, we allow for cross-sectional variation in corporate tax rates. Corporate marginal
tax rates vary because firms may be eligible for tax-loss-carrybacks and carryforwards,
investment tax credits, and the alternative minimum tax (see Auerbach, 1986; Auerbach and
Altshuler, 1.990; Auerbach and Poterba, 1987; Majd and Myers, 1987). Because these cross-

9. This variable is described in Gompers and Metrick (1998),


                                                       16
   sectional differences imply that different firms should respond differently to a given
                                                                                          change in
   tax rates, they potentially provide us with a way to isolate the tax effects. Firm-specific
   corporate marginal tax rates are notoriously difficult to calculate
                                                                      from publicly-available data.
   We use a trichotomous variable that equals zero if the firm has tax loss-carry forwards
                                                                                              and
   negative earnings in a given year, equals 0.5 times the statutory corporate rate if the firm has
  only one of those conditions, and equals the statutory rate if the firm has neither loss
  carryforwards nor negative earnings.'0
           The cross-sectional variation in the corporate tax rate may not be exogenous. Firms that
  perform poorly could face low marginal tax rates and also be particularly likely or
                                                                                  unlikely to
  provide performance-based pay. Because most of our specifications use fixed effects, the
  correlation we must be concerned about is between
                                                     changes in firm performance and changes in
 compensation. We deal with this by controlling forlagged firm stock market performance in
                                                                                             our
 regressions. This should eliminate spurious correlation between tax rates and compensation that
 is jointly caused by firm performance.
          6.3      Results
          The dependent variable in our regressions is the fraction of a CEO's total annual
 compensation (measured as the B]ack-Scholes value of
                                                        stock options grants plus salary and
 bonus) that comes from stock options grants. We choose this reduced-form specification
 because our interest is in the
                                composition of CEO compensation. However, the factors that
 affect the composition of compensation might also affect the levels, and it will be
                                                                                     important to
 keep this in mind in interpreting our results.

                                                            variable performs nearly as well as his recommended
simulated marginal tax rate. Piesko (1999) compares
                                                       marginal tax rates calculated from Compustat daLa with actual
marginal tax rates from firm tax returns. He finds that
                                                        simple binary variables are more reliable measures of the
marginal tax rate than are either the Graham or trichotomous
                                                              variable. We obtain substantively similar results when
we switch from the trichotomous variable to the binary variables
                                                                  recommend by Plesko.

                                         compensation paid in stock options is regressed on tax
  variables, corporate governance variables, contract-theory variables, and variables reflecting
  stock market returns. Both of the regressions in this table include firm fixed effects. In
                                                                                                 column
  I, the fraction in annual compensation paid in stock
                                                        options is regressed on the log difference in
 payoff (the combined payoff to both the firm and the
                                                         CEO) from receiving compensation in
 stock options rather than salary and bonus, where the payoff calculations are based
                                                                                          on statutory
 marginal tax rates. This variable is defined as the log difference between equation 3 and
                                                                                                equation
 6 in section 4. The coefficient on the tax variable is large and statistically significant
                                                                                            at the 95
 percent level. The point estimate implies that a one percent increase in the payoff difference
 between stock options and salary and bonus results in a 2.4 percentage point increase in
                                                                                               the share
 of compensation paid in stock options.
         The corporate governance variables all have the predicted sign. Firms with a
                                                                                         higher
 fraction of their shares owned by institutional investors, use more performance_based
                                                                                          pay (stock
 options). Firms with large corporate boards, or a large share of inside directors, are less
                                                                                             likely to
 use stock options.
        The two contract theory variables are the dollar change in CEO wealth
                                                                            per $1,000 change
in firm value (Jensen and Murphy, 1990) and the dollar change in CEO wealth
                                                                            per 10 percent
change in firm value (Hall and Liebman, 1998). As discussed in Baker and Hall (1998), these
two wealth sensitivity measures reflect two different concepts of how closely aligned the
manager's incentives are with the interests of the shareholders.
                                                                    In the regression they are meant
to measure how far the CEO's existing contract and
                                                     ownership of stock and stock options is from
the optimal level. The negative coefficients on the two variables suggests that firms that
                                                                                               are
below their optimal pay-to-performance sensitivity are more likely to give more stock
                                                                                            options in
the current period.

       The second column replaces the tax variable motivated by deferral advantages with the
three statutory rates. The corporate after-tax share has a positive coefficient, as
                                                                                      we would
expect, because the tax advantage of stock options increases as the corporate rate falls. The



                                                 18
  coefficient on the personal tax rate is small and
                                                     not statistically significant. The sign of the
  coefficient on the capital gains rate is the opposite of that predicted by tax avoidance
                                                                                            theory.
          Note that these results rely on time series variation alone. This is not a
                                                                                      very convincing
  test. Since the log difference in payoffs mostly rises over the time period covered in our
                                                                                                 sample
  as does the share of compensation paid in options, it ispossible that the tax variable is simply
  reflecting other factors that were changing over this time period that we have not included in our
 regression. Therefore, it is important to look at specifications that rely on cross-sectional
 variation in the tax variables.
         Table 4 contains specifications that rely on cross-sectional variation in corporate tax
 rates. The first column repeats the specification from column (I) of Table 3, but uses the
 trichotomous measures of firm corporate tax rates in place of the statutory rate in
                                                                                    calculating
 each firm's log difference in payoff from paying compensation in options rather than in
                                                                                           salary
 and bonus. As in the previous table, we find the positive coefficient on the log difference in
 payoff, just as the theory suggest. However, the coefficient estimate is now much smaller,
 suggesting that a one percent increase in the log difference inpayoff produces a one-tenth of a
 percentage point increase in the share of compensation paid in options.
        Introducing cross-sectional variation in the dependent variable does not eliminate the
 potentially spurious correlation over time between the tax variable and the share of compensation
paid in options. The second column of table 4 isolates the pooled cross-sectional variation in
corporate tax rates by adding time dummies and dropping the firm fixed effects. In this
specification, the coefficient on the tax variable is indistinguishable from zero. The coefficient
on the institutional variable continues to be large and statistically significant. The third column
includes both firm fixed effects and time dummies, which tests for a relationship between with in-
firm changes in the dependent variable and within-firm
                                                            changes in each explanatory variable. In
this specification, the coefficient on the tax variable is again indistinguishable from
                                                                                       zero. The
coefficients on the corporate governance variables are also statistically insignificant.
       The third column contains a specification that treats the Tax Reform Act of 1986
(TRA86) as a natural experiment. For firms and CEOs facing the statutory corporate tax rate,
TRA86 increased the relative payoff to paying compensation in options by 1.7
                                                                                  percent. For a
firm facing a zero marginal tax rate, it reduced the relative payoff by 4.5 percent. The reduction
occurred because TRA8G reduced the personal tax rate, making salary and bonus more attractive,



                                                 19
   while the decreased corporate rate had no effect on zero-tax rate firms. Thus,
                                                                                                    we would expect
   firms facing zero or low marginal tax rates to reduce their use of options after
                                                                                   TRA86, while
   firms facing the statutory rate would be expected to increase them, Few firms face
                                                                                         zero marginal
   tax rates year after year. Therefore, we try to distinguish between firms that often face low
                                                                                                 tax
   rates and firms that nearly always face the statutory rate. We define low tax firms as ones whose
  average marginal tax rate over the 1984 to 1986 period was below 0.24.12 Then
                                                                                     we ran a
  difference-in-differences regression to see if high tax firms increased their use of options
                                                                                                more
  than low tax firms. The interaction between
                                                post TRA86 and high corporate tax rates is the key
  variable. The estimated coefficient on this variable is positive, but small and not
                                                                                      statistically
  different from zero at the 95 percent level.
            It is important to note that in this specification as well, the main corporate
                                                                                                        governance
  variable, the share of the firm's shares owned
                                               by institutional investors, performs as theory
  would predict. The variable appears to be quite robust. Table 5 presents regressions of the
                                                                                                                     share
  of compensation paid in stock options on the fraction of the firm's shares owned
                                                                                                      by institutional
 investors. Since we have already established that these variables have a
                                                                            strong longitudinal
 relationship, the regressions here are designed to focus on the cross-sectional relationship
 between these two variables. The first and third columns present regressions
                                                                                                 using data only
 from 1994, and find a coefficient of roughly 0.2 (column 1 contains no other
                                                                               covariates, while
 column 3 includes all of the other non-tax covariates from the regressions in tables
                                                                                      3 an 4).
 Since the median share of a firm's stock owned by institutional investors in
                                                                              our sample rises
 from 19 percent in 1980 to 49 percent in 1994, this coefficient would imply that this factor
                                                                                               alone
 can explain 6 percentage points of the 23 percentage point increase in the median share of
compensation paid in options that occurred over this time period. Of course, this variable is only
one measure of the strengthening of
                                    corporate governance, so the total impact of improved
corporate governance could be greater. The second and fourth columns of the table use the
entire 1980-1994 sample, and include time dummies to isolate the cross-sectional
                                                                                                     correlations.
Again, there is evidence of a strong cross-sectional
                                                     relationship between the two variables,
although the coefficients are slightly smaller, perhaps reflecting a weaker corporate
                                                                                      governance



12 This cutoff was chosen after inspecting the distribution
                                                             of tax rates, and essentially separates firms thatare
always at or near the statutory rate from ones that are sometimes below it.

 role in the earlier period. In sum, there is a strong relationship, in both longitudinal and cross-
 sectional data, between the institutional investor variable and the options percentage variable.'3


 7.       The Million Dollar Rule
          In 1993 section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted, limiting the
 deductibility of executive compensation in excess of one million dollars, unless the
 compensation was performance related. Proponents of this legislation argued that it would slow
 the growth of executive pay and tighten the link between firm performance and executive
compensation.
         The new provision became effective for tax year 1994 and applies to the CEO and the
other four most highly compensated executives in each company. Pay that is performance
related such as stock-option grants and bonuses paid for meeting clear performance goals, is not
affected by this regulation, provided that it has been approved by shareholders. Thus, the main
impact of the provision is to limit the deductibility of salary in excess of a million dollars.
Woodlock and Antenucci (1997) studied the proxy statements of 376 firms and documented that
most firms responded to the new law by qualifying top executivepay as performance related.
Perry and Zenner (1999) identified 25 firms that reduced salaries from above $1 million to below
$1 million and found that 23 of the firms cited section 162(m) as their reason fordoing so.
         In this section of the paper we investigate whether this provision has affected the levelor
structure of executive pay, using the Execucomp data base, which contains information on the
highest paid executives in each of the firms in the S&P 500; S&P Midcap 400 and S&P
SmallCap 600. Between 1993 and 1998 the median salary of the Execucomp executives rose
from $230,000 to $306,000. The median value of total compensation (salary, bonus, and option
grants) rose from $470,000 to $882,000. Limiting the sample to CEOs indicates that the total
compensation of the median CEO rose from $1.1 million to $1.8 million over the period, while
the median salary rose from $441,000 to $550,000. Thus executive compensation clearly
continued to rise at a rapid rate after the implementation of the million dollar rule, though
perhaps at a slower rate than it otherwise would have.




13 The one specification in which the fraction owned by institutional investors is not significant is in column 2 of
table 4, a regression that includes both fixed effects and time effects.


                                                          21
            If the regulation affects behavior, it should have the largest impact
                                                                                  on firms whose
    executives are receiving salaries that are above the limit or just below it. Thus,
                                                                                        we might expect
    to see firms whose executives are
                                       receiving relatively high salaries to rely more heavily on
   performance-based pay and less heavily on salary in the years following the
                                                                                   regulation. Perry
   and Zenner (l999)ancl Livingston (1999) both find that this is the case. This
                                                                                     trend can be clearly
   identified in the Execucomp data set. For example, over the 1993 to 1998 period the median
   annualized growth rate of salary for executives whose 1993 salary was below $500,000
                                                                                                            in the
  previous year was 8.5 percent. For executives with
                                                                salary between $500,000 and $700,000 it
  was 6.4 percent, for executives between $700,000 and $850,000 it was 5.0
                                                                            percent, for
  executives between $750,000 and $1 million it was 3.1 percent, and for executives above $1
  million it was 0.0 percent.'4
           The observation that executives at lower levels of salary had higher
                                                                             growth rates is not
  very strong evidence of an impact of section 162(m), however, because it is possible that low-
  salary executives would have had higher growth rates even in the absence of the
                                                                                   provision. To
  explore whether this is the case, we use
                                          Execucomp data from both before and after the law
 change. Ideally, we wou]d want to have data from many years before the change to examine
 whether there is an underlying
                                pattern of faster salary growth for low-salary executives.
 Unfortunately, the Execucomp data begin in 1992 and therefore provide us with
                                                                               only the 1992-
 1993 growth rate in compensation to use as a baseline)5
          We run regressions pooling data from 1992-1993 through 1997-1998 of the
                                                                                                     annual
 percentage change in different forms of compensation
                                                                  on a variable, MILLION, that is designed
 to measure the likelihood that an executive's
                                                compensation will be affected by section l62(m).
We define MILLION as the minimum of! and of the executive's salary divided
                                                                                  by $1 million in
the previous year. Thus, any executive with salary at or above $! million would
                                                                                  receive a value
of 1, while an executive with a salary of $500,000 would be coded as a 0.5.16
                                                                                We include this
variable by itself and also interacted with
                                            a dummy variable (AFTER) that equals 1 for years
1994 and after. Thus the MILLION variable is designed to pick
                                                                 up any underlying relationship

                                              complete data between 1993 and 1998, 2708 had 1993 salaries below
$500,000, while only 35 had 1993 salaries above $1 million.
 15 The Hall-Liebman data set contains only
                                            a combined salary and bonus variable, making it impossible to use it to
analyze this issue.
16 We also ran the regressions (not reported)
                                              allowing for a non-linear relationship between MILLIONand
compensation growth and obtained substantively similar results.

           Table 6 contains our results. The first four columns are for all
                                                                               top executives, while the
  last four columns focus on CEOs. Columns I and 2 present estimates
                                                                               from robust regression for
  the percentage change in salary and the percentage change in total
                                                                           compensation (salary, bonus,
  stock grants, and stock option
                                   grants). In the salary growth regressions for all executives, the
  coefficient on MILLION is negative and
                                               significant, indicating that there is an underlying
  relationship between the level of executive compensation and its subsequent growth
                                                                                              rate. The
 coefficient on
                                        is negative as well, suggesting that the negative relationship
 between the level of salary and its
                                        subsequent growth rate intensified slightly after 1994. The
 relatively small magnitude suggests that an executive with a $1 million dollar
                                                                                       salary would see
 his salary grow at an annual rate that would be about 0.6
                                                               percent slower than an executive
 earning $500,000.
     In the second column the coefficient
                                            on MILLJON*yp is essentially zero, suggesting
 that any decrease in salary brought about by section 1 62(m)
                                                                was offset by increases in bonus and
 stock option grants. The results are similar for the median
                                                                regressions. There is some evidence
  of a very small slowdown in growth of salary for executives likely
                                                                        to be affected by section
  l62(m), but no sign of a change in total
                                           compensation. Taken together, this provides evidence of
  a very small substitution of "performancerelated
                                                      pay" for salary.
      The last four columns run identical tests but limit the sample to CEOs.
                                                                                 The interaction of
 MILLION*AFTER continues to be small and
                                                 negative in the salary regressions. In contrast, the
 impact of 162(m) on total compensation
                                            appears to be positive and fairly substantial (about 15
 percentage points per year) in these regressions. That is, the increase in bonus and stock
                                                                                              options
following the million dollar rule more than offset
                                                     the very small decline in salary.
     All of these conclusions should be
                                        interpreted somewhat cautiously because our data provide
us with only one pre-1993 control
                                    year. Nevertheless, the data are consistent with section
l62(m) having led to a very minor slow down in
                                                    salary growth, and one that is dramatically
smaller than what one would conclude without controlling for
                                                                  underlying differential salary


                                                 23
 growth rates at different levels of salary. Since total compensation for CEOs did not decline, and
perhaps increased, there is evidence of a minor substitution of performance-relatedpay for salary
 in response to the regulation.


8.      Executive Compensation and The Elasticity of Taxable Income
        Even if taxes have only a minor impact on executive compensation, the structure of
executive compensation is important for tax policy because high-income taxpayers are sources of
significant revenue and are the focus of important debates about the efficiency cost of taxation.
        Goolsbee (1999) has recently argued that executive decisions to exerciseoptions are
highly responsive to intertemporal differences in tax rates created by tax reforms. He claims that
much of the apparent decline in taxable income for high income taxpayers between 1992 and
1993 documented by Feldstein and Feenberg (1996) can be explained by executives shifting
option gains into 1992 in order to avoid the higher marginal tax rates that went into effect in
1993. By extension, he imp]ies that the high elasticities of taxable income with respect to
personal tax rates estimated by comparing the pre- and post-tax reform taxable income of high
income individuals reflect intertemporal shifting of income and not permanent effects of
taxation. If this is true, then the deadweight loss of taxation is lower, as is the cost of
progressivity.
       While Goolsbee presents comprehensive evidence that option gains were unusually high
in 1992, his identification of the impact of tax rates on the timing ofoption gains depends on
correctly specifying a counterfactual level of options that would have been exercised in the
absence of the tax change. He simply assumes a linear time trend. Thepurpose of Goolsbee's
time trend is presumably to account for the increasing use of options overtime. However, since
options typically require a vesting period of at least a couple of years, a much more direct
measure of expected option gains can be constructed, based on the total value of vested options
held by the CEO. Since options typically have vesting periods that exceed two years, this total
can be treated as exogenous, since it will not be affected by the tax changes.
       More generally, the value of options held by the CEO is likely to have amajor effect on
his exercise decisions. If his options are out of the money, he will not have gains to realize. If
there has been a recent run-up in the market, an optimizing CEO may exercise an unusually large




                                                  24
    amount of options in order to diversify his overall portfolio, and if
                                                                                  in-the-money options are
    about to expire, they will be exercised in the current
                                                                  year.
             Our evidence suggests that much of the apparent tax
                                                                   shifting can instead be attributed to
   stock market performance and the timing of past option grants. Using
                                                                              our 15-year panel, we
   replicate 000slbee's (1999) result for the 1993 period, but show that the impact of
                                                                                          taxes is not
   present in other time periods. Moreover,
                                              even the result for the 1993 period disappears when
   appropriate controls for past option grants and stock price appreciation
                                                                              are included.
           The top three rows of Table 7 present data on the taxable incomes of CEOs
                                                                                          in the Hall-
  Liebrnan sample. For these results our panel has been narrowed to include
                                                                                  only CEOs whose
  firm's fiscal years correspond with tax years. In addition, we
                                                                   create a balanced panel for each of
  the three tax-reform periods
                               by excluding any firm for which there are not complete data for the
  period surrounding the reform.
           The fourth row of the table shows that the 1993 tax act raised the
                                                                             top marginal personal
  income tax rate from 31.0 to 39.6
                                    percent effective for tax year 1993, with a further increase
  occurring in 1994 due to the uncapping of the
                                                 Medicare payroll tax. The top row of the table
  shows that taxable income was higher in 1992 than for
                                                          any other year in our sample (all data are
  in 1994 dollars). Option
                           gains were particularly high in 1992— more than double their 1991
 level and 68 percent higher than their 1994 level. These
                                                           patterns are consistent with Goolsbee's
 claim that taxpayers responded to the anticipated increase in
                                                               marginal tax rates by shifting gains
 into 1992.
          The evidence from the other two tax reforms is less clear,
                                                                   suggesting that there might be
 factors other than tax rates
                             determining the timing of option gains. ERTA 1981 reduced the top
 marginal tax rate from 70 percent in 1980 to 50
                                                 percent in 1982. However, there is no sign that
option gains were reduced in 1980 and 1981 and then increased in 1982.'
                                                                             There was a big
increase in option gains in 1983 however. Similarly, the highest
                                                                  year of stock option gains in the
period around 1986 was 1987, a strange year to take gains since
                                                                 taxpayers would have known
that the personal rate would be 10
                                   percentage points lower if they waited until the
      18                                                                            following
year.


 17 As we explained above, for executives
                                           covered by the maximum tax on earned income, there was not a decline in
tax rates between 1981 and 1982.
18 It is possible that the large stock market decline in October 1997
options earlier than they otherwise would have. However, an increasemay   have prompted some people to exercise
                                                                      in option exercises
                                                                                          typically follow stock

             What all the peak years of option gains have in common is that
                                                                                            they follow years of
    strong stock market performance. The fifth row of table 7 shows the
                                                                         average stock market return
    during the previous year for the firms in our sample. The large value of
                                                                             option gains in 1983
    followed a 35.5 percent increase in the stock market. The 1992 boom
                                                                          in option gains followed a
    46.6 percent increase in thdstock market; the more modest 1987
                                                                     peak in option gains followed a
    19 percent gain (and a 43 percent gain two years before)
           Strong stock market performance raises the
                                                          value of options available to exercise. The
   sixth row of the table shows the
                                     mean value of options held by CEO5 at the beginning of the
   year. All three of the peak years of option
                                                gains correspond with peak years in terms of the value
   of options available for exercise. Since stock market appreciation
                                                                         during the year also increases
   the value of options available to exercise later in that year, we need
                                                                          to account for current year

                               roughly negative one. Columns (5) through (8) show that this pattern
  was unique to the 1993 tax reform. Indeed, in the TRA86 regressions the

  following year's tax rate is positive and
                                              significant. Columns (9) and (10) pool all three reforms

          It is possible that the ease with which one can shift the
                                                                     timing of option gains is
 asymmetric. It may be harder to shift option gains forward in time since
                                                                                 some options expire and
 therefore must be exercised
                                 now. In addition, options were a much smaller portion of
 compensation in the early 1980s, so perhaps the ERTA 81 results are not
                                                                                 surprising.
Nonetheless, these results cast doubt
                                          on the proposition that this is the channel through which
spurious estimates of the elasticity of taxable
                                                   income have occurred for previous tax reforms, and
they suggest that we should look harder for

gains.

     market value and the value of the
                                         options held by the CEO at the start of the year. The two stock
     market variables strongly predict option gains, while the value of options held has
                                                                                           the correct
     sign in all of the specifications and is
                                           significant in the pooled sample even though it is highly
     correlated with the two stock market return variables. In contrast, the
                                                                             tax-timing explanation
     fails, even in thel993 period.
            It is important to realize that ourresults do not invalidate 000lsbee's
                                                                                 critique of claims

                                                                                      income are
  large. We have simply given an alternative explanation for why taxable incomes
                                                                                       were unusually
  high in 1992. However, our results do cast doubt on the conclusion that
                                                                             large timing shifts are
  ubiquitous and capable of explaining away the more careful estimates of taxable income
  elasticities that have been performed
                                        using micro data (e.g., Feldstein, 1995; Auten and Carroll,
  1995).
           One further point is in order. It is sometimes argued that the combination of
                                                                                         increased use
 of options and the booming stock market
                                                explains why federal tax revenues have been so much
 higher than expected during the 1990s.
                                          However, while large option gains increase revenue from
  the personal income tax, they produce offsetting deductions for
                                                                   corporations. The net impact on
 revenue is only the difference in the two marginal tax rates times the option gain. While
                                                                                             the gap
 between the personal rate and the effective
                                             corporate rate is non-trivia], the impact of large
 option exercises on total revenue is
                                      substantially smaller than the amount by which the exercises
 inflate personal tax revenue and reduce corporate tax revenue.


9.         Conclusion
          We have described the tax rules for executive pay in detail and analyzed how
                                                                                        changes in
various tax rates affect the tax advantages of stock options relative to
                                                                         salary and bonus. We find
that there is a moderate tax advantage to options —
                                                    currently about $4 per $100 in pre-tax
executive pay — and that changes in the tax advantage of
                                                          options over time have had at most a
modest impact on the composition of
                                      pay. Corporate governance factors, particularly the role of
large investors, appear to be more important in
                                                explaining the dramatic increase in option pay.
        In addition, our evidence suggests that more direct attempts to use tax
                                                                                policy to influence
executive compensation have had little effect. We find that the million dollar rule led
                                                                                         companies

to substitute performancebed
                                pay for salary. But our evidence suggests that this substitution
was quite modest, and there is no evidence that thetotal level of pay was reduced.
                                                                                   Overall,
although the stock-option explosion has dramatically increased the link between
                                                                                pay and
performance, this change is due almost entirely to nontax factors.
