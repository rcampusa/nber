 ASSET PRICES UNDER HABIT FORMATION AND CATCHING UP WITH THE JONESES


                                ABSTRACT

      This paper introduces a utility function that nests three classes

of utility functions:   (1) time-separable utility functions; (2)

"catching up with the Joneses" utility functions that depend on the

consumer's level of consumption relative to the lagged cross-sectional

average level of consumption; and (3) utility functions that display

habit formation.   Closed-form solutions for equilibrium asset prices are

derived under the assumption that consumption growth is i.i.d.      The

equity premia under catching up with the Joneses and under habit

formation are, for some parameter values, as large as the historically

observed equity premium in the United States.
