                                         ABSTRACT

Recent decades have seen the emergence of global value chains (GVCs), in which production
stages for individual goods are broken apart and scattered across countries. Stimulated by these
developments, there has been rapid progress in data and methods for measuring GVC linkages.
The macro-approach to measuring GVCs connects national input-output tables across borders
using bilateral trade data to construct global input-output tables. These tables have been applied
to measure trade in value added, the length of and location of producers in GVCs, and price
linkages across countries. The micro-approach uses firm-level data to document firms' input
sourcing decisions, how import and export participation are linked, and how multinational firms
organize their production networks. In this review, I evaluate progress on these two tracks,
highlighting points of contact between them and areas that demand further work. I argue that
further convergence between them can strengthen both, yielding a more complete empirical
portrait of GVCs.

1      Introduction
Recent decades have seen the emergence of global value chains (GVCs), in which production
stages for individual goods are broken apart and scattered across countries. Examples of this
“slicing the value chain” phenomenon are everywhere – from the production process for Apple
iPhones to Nutella hazelnut spread, to Boeing airplanes, to New Balance running shoes, and on,
and on. Hints of this GVC activity are easy to see in trade data as well. For example, multinational
firms are involved in upwards of 90% of US trade, the share of imported inputs in total materials
use has risen steadily around the world, and China has become “the world’s factory” by providing
incentives for the production of exports with imported inputs.
    Notwithstanding these anecdotes and scattered statistics, researchers have struggled to develop
a coherent empirical portrait of global value chains. One reason is that the national accounts were
not built for the task of measuring GVCs. While input-output accounts provide a rich descrip-
tion of value chain linkages across industries within a given country, they stop at the border: they
contain no information on how exports are used abroad, and they do not tell us anything about
how imported goods are produced. Similarly, firm census and customs data contain important
details about firm-level input sourcing and export participation, and thus their backward and for-
ward engagement in GVCs. However, they do so one country-firm slice of the value chain at a
time. At both the macro (input-output) and micro (firm) levels, conventional data sources lack the
information needed to map out the entire global production process and measure GVC linkages.
    Addressing gaps in the measurement of global value chains is important, both for advancing
our understanding of how the modern global economy works and for addressing policy questions.
Starting with positive concerns, GVCs influence the response of trade to frictions and may am-
plify gains from trade; they also change the nature of macro-spillovers across countries. At the
micro level, offshoring (one manifestation of GVC participation) is central to explaining firm per-
formance and labor market outcomes. From a normative perspective, GVCs alter government
incentives to impose trade protection and have implications for optimal monetary policy in the
open economy. Further, policymakers are already devoting significant attention to devising new
approaches to measuring global value chains and sorting out their policy implications.1
    Fortunately, there has been important progress in measuring global value chains on two fronts.
First, on the macro level, researchers have pushed to extend the input-output accounting apparatus
across borders, using disaggregate trade data to link existing national input-output tables across
countries.2 The resulting “global input-output tables” describe from whom each industry sources
    1 Forexample, see IDE-JETRO (2011), UNECE (2015), and Global Value Chain Development Report (2017).
    2 Though  research on global (linked multi-country) input-output tables has flourished in recent years, the basic
ideas are not new. The conceptual origins of global input-output tables date back to work on many-region input-output
models by Hollis Chenery, Walter Isard, Wassily Leontief, and Leon Moses in the 1950’s. Regional input-output


                                                         1
inputs from around the world and to whom each industry’s output is sold, whether as inputs to
downstream industries or to final end users. At the micro level, recent research has also devoted
increased attention to documenting firms’ input sourcing decisions, how importing is connected to
exporting at the firm level, and how multinational firms organize their production networks.
    In this review, I argue that these complementary research tracks are proceeding toward a more
complete description of GVCs. In Section 2, I start by describing how global input-output data
can be applied to measure the value-added content of trade, the length of global value chains and
the location of producers in them, and price linkages across countries. By collecting these results
in one place, I aim to clarify the links between them. In at least one instance, I extend existing
results: in Section 2.2.2, I provide a new value-added decomposition of gross exports. I also briefly
describe recent work that uses global-input output data to calibrate trade and macroeconomic mod-
els, and I discuss strengths and weaknesses of available data sources. Turning to firm-level data in
Section 3, I survey recent work on offshoring and input sourcing, joint participation exporting and
importing, and trade within multinational firms.
    Along the way, I emphasize points of contact between the macro and micro approaches to
measuring GVCs, building on the idea that aggregate input-output tables can (in principle, if not
in practice) be constructed by aggregating firm-level transactions data. Further, while the focus
of this review is primarily on measurement of GVCs, I address the theory of GVCs where theory
and measurement are connected to one another.3 In Section 4, I close the paper by arguing that
convergence between the macro and micro approaches to measuring GVCs can strengthen both,
and I highlight areas in which theory and measurement remain far apart.


2     A Macro (Input-Output) View of GVCs
This section lays out the input-output approach to measuring GVC linkages, which provides a
macro-level view of GVCs. I begin by presenting two building blocks of the input-output approach,
and then I discuss how they can be applied to measure trade in value added, characteristics of value
chains, and price linkages. As a complement to this measurement work, I discuss how input-output
data have been applied to calibrate trade and macroeconomic models. The section concludes with
a review of data sources, in which I evaluate strengths and weaknesses of existing data.
analysis continues to be a staple of the regional science literature (see Chapter 3 in Miller and Blair (2009)). Further,
Leontief (1974) described United Nations efforts to build global input-output tables in his Nobel Price Lecture.
   3 Due to space constraints, I also do not extensively discuss quantitative/empirical results on the causes and conse-

quences of the rise of GVCs (e.g., the determinants of value chain fragmentation, the consequences of offshoring for
labor markets, welfare gains from trade with GVCs, etc.). I touch on these issues only briefly to illustrate how better
measurement is enabling progress in addressing them.




                                                           2
2.1    Input-Output Preliminaries
Starting from the ground up, there are two basic building blocks of an input-output system. The first
is an accounting relationship that describes how gross output from each country (i, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N})
and industry (s ∈ {1, . . . , S}) is used by final or intermediate purchasers, as in yi (s) = ∑ j fi j (s) +
                  0
∑ j ∑s0 zi j (s, s ), where yi (s) is the value of gross output in industry s of country i, fi j (s) is the value
of final goods shipped from industry s in country i to country j, and zi j (s, s0 ) is the value of inter-
mediates from industry s in country i used by industry s0 in country j. The second is an accounting
relationship that defines value added, as in value added in country i and sector s, denoted vi (s),
equals the value of output less inputs used in production: vi (s) = yi (s) − ∑ j ∑s0 z ji (s0 , s).
    These industry-by-industry, country-by-country output accounting equations can be stacked to
form the global input-output system. Specifically, stack output into vector y, with S × 1 dimen-
sional block elements yi , collect intermediate shipments into matrix Z with S × S dimensional
block elements Zi j , arrange final goods shipments into N × NS dimensional matrix F with S × 1
dimensional block elements fi j , and put value added into vector v with S × 1 dimensional block
elements vi . Following convention, define a global input-output matrix A = Zŷ−1 , with block el-
ements Ai j = Zi j ŷ−1 j , where x̂ denotes a diagonal matrix with vector x along the diagonal. The
global input-output system can then be written concisely as:

                                                y = Ay + Fι,                                                 (1)
                                                 0    0       0
                                               v = y − ι Aŷ,                                                (2)

where ι denotes a conformable vector of ones (whose dimension differs depending on the context).


2.2    Trade in Value Added
This section provides an overview of how input-output tables have been used to study trade in
value added. I begin by presenting two value-added decompositions of final goods, which provide
complementary perspectives on how value added is traded on the consumption versus production
sides of the economy. I then discuss the value-added content of gross exports, presenting a new
decomposition of export content in the process. For clarity’s sake, I explain the main points in this
section using a two-country input-output system, and I comment on additional issues that arise in
many-country frameworks where appropriate.

2.2.1      Value-Added Content in Final Goods

Using Equation 1, the amount of gross output needed to produce final goods can be computed as:
                                                   " #
                                                    y1
                                                       = [I − A]−1 Fι,                                                          (3)
                                                    y2

where [I − A]−1 is the Leontief Inverse of the global input-output matrix. For any given vector of
final goods f, the calculation [I − A]−1 f returns the vector of gross output (from all countries and
industries) that is needed to produce those final goods, including both the value of the final goods
themselves and all the intermediate inputs that are (directly or indirectly) used in producing those
final goods. Value added embodied in f is then given by v̂ŷ−1 [I − A]−1 f, where v̂ŷ−1 is a matrix
with value-added to output ratios along the diagonal.
    Equation 3 can be used to measure trade in value added from two complementary perspectives.
First, final goods shipments can be decomposed based on the location in which they are consumed.
Alternatively, final goods shipments can be decomposed based on the location in which they are
produced. That is, mechanically Fι can be decomposed in either of the following two ways:
                                     " # " #          "           # "           #
                                       f11    f12       f11 + f12         0
                                Fι =       +        =              +                                                            (4)
                                       f21    f22           0         f21 + f22
                                     |     {z     }   |            {z           }
                                       consumption location             production location


Value-Added Exports Johnson and Noguera (2012a,b, forthcoming) decompose final goods by
location of consumption.4 The amount of value added from all countries required to produce final
goods consumed by country j is:
                                            "      #                    " #
                                             va1 j                       f1 j
                                                     = v̂ŷ−1 [I − A]−1       ,                                                 (5)
                                             va2 j                       f2 j

where vai j is the vector of industry-level value added from country i absorbed in country j.5 I refer
to the resulting value-added flows (vai j ) as value-added exports, because they track value added
from the country in which it is produced to the destinations in which it is consumed, analogous
to how gross exports track gross output from where it is produced versus sold. As a matter of
accounting, adding up value-added exports across all destinations yields total value added: vai =

                                                                                                               −1
   5 Equivalently,  vai j = v̂i ŷ−1                 −1
                                  i Li1 f1 j + v̂i ŷi Li2 f2 j , where Lik represent block elements of [I − A] , such that Lik fk j
is the amount of gross output from i needed to produce fk j . This representation emphasizes that value added from
country i is sold to country j embodied both in final goods shipped from i to j (fi j ) and in final goods that country j
buys from itself (f j j ).


                                                                 4
∑ j vai j .
     This description of the geography of production versus consumption of value added is useful
in various contexts. For example, canonical trade models are often written in value-added terms,
abstracting from the production of and trade in intermediate inputs. Value-added exports measure
trade flows in a manner consistent with this modeling approach.
     Comparisons between value-added and gross exports can also shed light on the role that global
value chains play in shaping gross trade flows. At the global level, the ratio of value-added to
gross exports is inversely related to the number of borders crossed during the production process
[Fally (2012)]. Thus, declines in this global ratio are evidence of the increasing cross-border
fragmentation of production.
     At the industry or bilateral level, gaps between gross and value-added trade flows hint at com-
plex features of value chains. While value-added exports are always smaller than gross exports
at the world or country-level, this is not true for individual industries or bilateral country pairs.
Value-added exports may exceed gross exports at the industry level, because a given industry can
export value added embodied both in its own exports and in the exports of downstream industries
(e.g., computer chips are exported directly, and embodied in exported computers). At the bilateral
level, a country may sell value added to a given destination both directly (embodied in its own
exports) and indirectly embodied in downstream, third-country final or intermediate goods (e.g.,
Japan can export value-added to the United States embodied in Chinese goods).

GVC Income Timmer et al. (2013), Timmer et al. (2014), and Los, Timmer and de Vries (2015)
use the decomposition of final goods by location of production to measure trade in value added
on the production side. Without loss of generality, let us focus on decomposing the value added
embodied in country 1’s final goods production, which is given by:
                                    "      #                    "          #
                                     gvc11                       f11 + f12
                                             = v̂ŷ−1 [I − A]−1              ,                                        (6)
                                     gvc21                           0

where gvci j is the industry-level vector of value-added from country i embodied in final goods
produced by country j. This decomposition allocates the value added embodied in final goods to
the source countries along the global value chain that supply it. Put differently, it traces income
generated in the production of final goods back to the countries in which that income is generated.
Drawing on language in Timmer et al. (2013), I will thus refer to it as a decomposition of GVC
income.6
   6 To  be clear, the nationality of income in this decomposition is defined by the location in which value is added, not
by the national ownership of the factors. While Equation 6 measures total income, income can be decomposed into
payments to different factors of production, such as high versus low skilled labor, using auxiliary data. See Timmer
et al. (2014) for example.


                                                            5
    This GVC income decomposition measures the domestic and foreign content of domestically
produced final goods. As such, it is conceptually linked to existing work on “offshoring” [Feenstra
and Hanson (1996, 1999)] and “task trade” [Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2007, 2008)]. In
this literature, the share of imported inputs in production as been used to measure the intensity
of offshoring. GVC income improves on this measurement approach in two ways. First, GVC
income takes into account the possibility that imported inputs include domestic content. Second,
GVC income also captures the multilateral nature of global value chains better than direct import
measures, in that it measures bilateral foreign content in a way that allows for content to travel
indirect routes (via third countries) from its source to where it is ultimately used in production.
    To make both these ideas concrete, consider trying to measure Mexican content in US-produced
cars, and suppose that the US uses imported engines from Mexico. The standard approach would
be to treat the share of imported engines from Mexico in the value of US cars as a measure of
offshoring to Mexico. The GVC income approach deals with two potentially important real-world
complications. First, the US might export inputs (e.g., spark plugs) to Mexico that are embod-
ied in Mexican engines. Second, Mexican engines might include value-added content from third
countries (e.g., steel from China). These higher-order input linkages would lead the conventional
import share measure to overstate how much Mexican value added is embodied in US cars. By ac-
counting for them, the GVC income approach would yield a more accurate breakdown of domestic
versus foreign content in US cars, and a more nuanced bilateral decomposition of foreign content
across ultimate source countries.

2.2.2    Value-Added Content in Gross Exports

While value-added exports and GVC income are both defined by decomposing value added content
embodied in final goods, there is a large and active line of work that focuses instead on decompos-
ing national content in gross exports.7 Chenery, Robinson and Syrquin (1986), Hummels, Ishii and
Yi (2001), and National Research Council (2006) used input-output tables to separate the “domes-
tic content” versus “import content” of exports. Because these early contributions used data for
one country at a time, rather than a complete global input-output system, they were largely silent
   7 Though   this particular decomposition has attracted much attention in policy circles and the extant literature, the
theoretical motivation for decomposing gross exports is not entirely clear. While domestic value added in exports (de-
fined below) can be thought of as the amount by which domestic value added would rise if home exports exogenously
increase, foreign value added in exports (again, defined below) does not have the same interpretation. The reason is
that the foreign value-added to output ratio depends on the level of home exports (foreign imports); In contrast, the
domestic value-added to output ratio can be held constant as home exports increase. This implies that one cannot
straightforwardly apply counterfactual arguments to interpret the meaning of foreign value added in exports. The
interpretation I provide for domestic/foreign value-added content in exports here sidesteps these issues by avoiding
counterfactual arguments in justifying the export decomposition. That is, the decomposition here is a manipulation of
accounting identities that hold in a given equilibrium.



                                                           6
about the exact relationship between the domestic/foreign content of exports and the nationality of
value-added content embodied in exports. Recent work by Johnson and Noguera (2012a), Koop-
man, Wang and Wei (2014), and Los, Timmer and de Vries (2016) has addressed these issues,
without resolving them fully. My objective in this section is to bring additional clarity to this issue.
    To start, I will reorganize Equation 1 to isolate exports for country 1:
            " # "          #" # "          #    " #
             y1     A11 0    y1    f11 0         x12
                =               +            ι+                         with   x12 = A12 y2 + f12 .         (7)
             y2     A21 A22 y2     f21 f22        0
                  |    {z  }      | {z }
                     ≡ A∗            ≡ F∗

This reorganization removes input shipments from country 1 to country 2 (A12 y2 ) from the the
global input-output matrix (A) and deposits them in exports (x12 ), thus leaving us with modified
input-output matrix A∗ .
   Similar to previous sections, I manipulate Equation 7 to compute gross output required to
produce x12 , and then premultiply by value-added to output ratios to compute the value-added
content embodied in country 1’s exports:
             "     #                      " # "                                           #

where xci j is the industry-level vector of value added from country i required to produce exports

country 1’s exports is ι xc11 , and total foreign value added in country 1’s exports is ι xc21 .
    Though I have used a global input-output framework to define domestic value added in exports
here, the resulting formula (somewhat surprisingly) predates the advent of global input-output
analysis. Chenery, Robinson and Syrquin (1986) and Hummels, Ishii and Yi (2001) define the
                                                                                              0
“import content of exports” – equivalently, “vertical specialization trade” (VS) – as VS ≡ ι A21 (I−
A11 )−1 x12 . The complement to the “import content of exports” is then the “domestic content of
exports” (DC), which equals exports less the import content of exports [National Research Council
(2006)]. It is straightforward to prove that DC is equivalent to domestic value added in exports:

             0              0                                       0                             0
    DC ≡ ι x12 − VS = ι [I − A11 − A21 ](I − A11 )−1 x12 = ι v̂1 ŷ−1          −1
                                                                   1 (I − A11 ) x12 = ι xc11 .              (9)

Thus, the literature has long been measuring domestic value added in exports, without explicitly re-
alizing it. Applying the “hypothetical extraction” method from the input-output literature to define
domestic value added in exports, Los, Timmer and de Vries (2016) reach the same conclusion.8
   8 Los,
       Timmer and de Vries (2016) define domestic value added in exports as true home GDP less what home
GDP would be in a counterfactual world in which x12 is removed (extracted) from the input-output system. This is


                                                       7
    The new aspect of the value-added analysis in Equation 8 is the definition of foreign value
added in exports. To interpret the elements of xc21 , note that [I − A11 ]−1 x12 is the vector of coun-
try 1 output needed to produce its exports, which means that A21 [I − A11 ]−1 x12 is the vector of
imported intermediate inputs used in production of exports. In turn, [I − A22 ]−1 A21 [I − A11 ]−1 x12
is the vector of foreign output needed to produce those inputs imported by country 1, so multi-
plying that output by v̂2 ŷ−1
                            2 returns the country 2 value added required to produce country 1’s
exports.
    An important point to note is that the amount of country 2 value added needed to produce
                      0
country 1’s exports (ι xc21 ) is not equal to the “import content of exports.” In particular, the import
content of exports can be decomposed into two terms:

                  0
                         h       0
                                      i
            VS = ι xc21 + VS − ι xc21                                                                              (10)
                  0
                         h 0                        0
                                                                                                  i
               = ι xc21 + ι A21 (I − A11 )−1 x12 − ι v̂2 ŷ−1
                                                           2  [I − A22 ]−1
                                                                           A 21 [I − A 11 ]−1
                                                                                              x12                  (11)
                     0          0
                 = ι xc21 + ι A12 [I − A22 ]−1 A21 [I − A11 ]−1 x12 .                                              (12)

The first term is just foreign value added in exports. The second term is a double-counting residual,
equal to the value of inputs imported by country 2 that are used to produce country 2 inputs that
are embodied in country 1’s exports.9
    To sum up this discussion, gross exports can be decomposed into value-added content as fol-
lows:
                          domestic VA foreign VA
                            z }| {      z }| {
                   0         0           0        0
                 ι x12 = ι xc11 + ι xc21 + ι A12 [I − A22 ]−1 A21 [I − A11 ]−1 x12 .             (13)
                                                 |               {z                }
                                                                   double-counting residual
                                            |                          {z                          }
                                                            import content of exports

This decomposition splits exports into domestic value-added content versus import content, and
then decomposes import content into foreign value-added content and a double-counting residual
resulting from round-trip trade in inputs.10 Though obvious in Equation 13, I will point out that
essentially equivalent to the operation in Equation 8, which does not actually involve any counterfactual calculations.
However, whereas Equation 8 includes both domestic and foreign value-added content, Los, Timmer and de Vries
(2016) compute domestic valued added in exports only, by zeroing out value-added to output ratios for country 2
(equivalent to setting v2 = 0). Consistent with footnote 7, it is not straightforward to define foreign value added in
exports via counterfactuals.
    9 To interpret this residual, recall that [I − A ]−1 A [I − A ]−1 x is the gross output from country 2 that is needed
                                                    22    21     11    12
to produce country 1 exports. Pre-multiplying this output by A12 yields the value if exported inputs from country 1
that are themselves used to produce country 1’s exports. These inputs are used up in the production process ultimately,
and so are not associated with value added that is attributable to any any source country. I discuss this interpretation
further in the Supplemental Appendix.
   10 This decomposition can be pushed further. For example, following Johnson and Noguera (2012a) and Los, Tim-

mer and de Vries (2016), the domestic value-added content of exports can be split into value-added exports (domestic


                                                           8
                                                                                                     0         0
gross exports exceed the total underlying value added content embodied in them: ι x12 ≥ ι xc11 +
 0
ι xc21 .11
    I will briefly make two remarks about this decomposition. First, while I have focused on a two-
country case here, this approach to measuring value-added content in exports can be applied to
bilateral trade as well. Using the many-country analog to Equation 7, one can compute the value-
added content embodied in any bilateral export flow (xi j ). One complication is that bilateral export
decompositions of this sort are not additive: if one computes the amount of value added from
country i in xi j and then computes the amount of value added from country i in xik , one cannot
simply add these together to obtain the amount of value added from country i embodied in the
total flow xi j + xik . The reason is that the appropriate A∗ matrix depends on the export flow being
decomposed, and thus is different depending on whether we decompose xi j and xik independently
or decompose the composite flow xi j + xik . Thus, care is needed to do the decomposition that is
most sensible for the question at hand.
    Second, the export decomposition in Equation 13 is different than the export decomposition
proposed by Koopman, Wang and Wei (2014). The origin of the difference is deceptively simple.
In Equation 8, I multiply exports by [I − A∗ ]−1 to compute output required to produce exports,
consistent with Los, Timmer and de Vries (2016). In contrast, Koopman et al. multiply exports by
[I − A]−1 . Interpreted as an attempt to compute output required to produce exports, the Koopman
et al. approach treats input shipments A12 y2 in two inconsistent ways: it includes them both in
exports and the input requirements matrix simultaneously. By including A12 y2 in exports only, we
uncouple the input-output system: given x12 , y1 does not depend on y2 directly. This implies that
one can work backward from gross exports to gross output, and from gross output to value added,
thus decomposing exports into value-added components in an economically meaningful way. I
discuss these mechanics further in the Supplemental Appendix.

2.2.3    Measuring Factor and Environmental Content

The same input-output techniques used above to measure value-added content can be readily
adapted to measure trade in factor and environmental content. To see this, note that the matrix
v̂ŷ−1 in Equations 5, 6, and 8 contains value added to output ratios – i.e., the value of payments
to primary factors per dollar (or any other currency unit) of output. In place of these value added
value added consumed abroad) versus re-imports of domestic value-added (domestic value added content in exports
that is ultimately consumed at home, embodied in re-imported foreign goods). Further, one can distinguish between
value added content embodied in final versus intermediate goods, as pursued by Koopman, Wang and Wei (2014) and
Los, Timmer and de Vries (2016). The exact decomposition one would want to use needs to be guided by the question
that requires an answer.
   11 This expression holds with equality when exports from country 1 consist entirely of final goods, so that x = f
                                                                                                                12   12
and A12 = 0. One way to understand this is that A = A∗ in this special case. Another is that the value of final goods is
equal to the underlying value-added content embodied in them.


                                                           9
to output ratios, one could substitute the ratio of factor quantities required to produce a dollar of
output to measure trade in factors, or environmental quantities (e.g., pollution or carbon emissions)
per unit of output to measure environmental trade.
    As above, one can measure trade in terms of the location in which factors are used in produc-
tion versus where they are consumed (like value-added exports), or measure the factor content of
final goods produced in a given destination (like GVC income), or measure the quantities of fac-
tors required to produce exports (like export content). Reimer (2006), Trefler and Zhu (2010), and
Puzzello (2012) focus on measuring net factor trade, which amounts to computing domestic fac-
tors required to produce value added exports less foreign factors required to produce value-added
imports (equivalently, factors embodied in a country’s production versus consumption). Similarly,
in the environmental literature, there is a debate about whether countries ought to commit to car-
bon emissions targets or carbon consumption targets, which would require measuring the carbon
content of final goods. In a related vein, Grether and Mathys (2013) use a global input-output
framework to compute the pollution terms of trade.


2.3    Measuring Location in and Length of Value Chains
Input-output tables have also recently been put to use to describe the length of the value chain and
the location (upstream versus downstream) of individual industries or countries in it. Following
the literature, I focus on explaining the essential ideas in a closed economy, which can then be
generalized to a many-country setting.
    To do so, I aggregate the global input-output framework across countries:

                                                   ȳ = Āȳ + f̄,                                         (14)
                                               0      0          0   0
                                         ȳ = v̄ + ι Āȳˆ = v̄ + ȳ B̄,                                   (15)

where ȳ = ∑i yi and f̄ = ∑i ∑ j fi j are gross output and final expenditure for the world, Ā = ∑i ∑ j Ai j ŷ j ȳˆ −1
                                                                                                                

is the industry-to-industry input-output matrix for the world, and B̄ = ȳˆ −1 Āȳˆ is a matrix that
records the share of output from industry i used by downstream j. Equations 14 and 15 can be
re-written as:
                                           −1
                                               f̄ = I + Ā + Ā2 + Ā3 + · · · f̄,
                                                                             
                               ȳ = I − Ā                                                                 (16)
                               0    0      −1       0
                                                  = v̄ I + B̄ + B̄2 + B̄3 + · · · .
                                                                                 
                             ȳ = v̄ I − B̄                                                                (17)

                                               −1                                −1
The second equality in each line replaces I − Ā    (the Leontief Inverse) or I − B̄    (the Ghosh
Inverse) with their geometric series expansions, effectively opening up the production process to
track value chain linkages one stage at a time.

                                                          10
    To interpret Equation 16, output can be decomposed into final goods plus the value of inter-
mediate inputs used up in the production process, where Āf̄ are inputs directly used to produce
final goods, Ā2 f̄ are the inputs used to produce the inputs, and so on. Equation 17 has a similar
interpretation: the value of output can be decomposed into direct value added in the sector from
which output originates plus value added from other sectors embodied in inputs sourced further
                               0
up the value chain, where v̄ B̄ is value added contributed one step back in the chain (direct value
                      0
added in inputs), v̄ B̄2 is value added form two steps back in the chain (direct value added in the
inputs those inputs), and so on.
    Both measures of length and position can be motivated with reference to these standard input-
output results. The core idea in both is that we can use the stage-by-stage descriptions of the
production process to “count” production stages – the number of stages that industry output transits
through prior to reaching final demand (using Equation 16), or the number of stages required to
produce an industry’s output (using Equation 17). While this counting idea has recently been
introduced into the international economics literature by Fally (2012) and Antràs and Chor (2013),
it was previously used in the input-output literature by Dietzenbacher, Luna and Bosma (2005) and
Dietzenbacher and Romero (2007) to characterize distance between industries (termed average
propagation lengths).
    Starting with value chain position, Fally (2012) and Antràs and Chor (2013) define an index
of whether industries are located upstream versus downstream in the value chain.12 Intuitively,
industries will be more downstream – i.e., close to final demand – when they produce final goods,
or inputs that are directly used to produce those final goods. Alternatively, industries will be more
upstream when they produce inputs that are used to produce inputs (or higher order versions of this
statement).
    Building on these ideas, let us say that final goods are one step away from demand, inputs
directly used to produce final goods are two steps away from demand, inputs used to produce
inputs are three steps away from demand, and so on. Further, let us weight the count by the share
of the value of output at each production stage in total output. Then, this yields the following index
of industry upstreamness:
                                                                                                        −2
                 U = 1ȳˆ −1 f̄ + 2ȳˆ −1 Āf̄ + 3ȳˆ −1 Ā2 f̄ + 4ȳˆ −1 Ā3 f̄ + · · · = ȳˆ −1 I − Ā
                                                                                                 
                                                                                                            f̄.   (18)

This index is a value-weighted count of the number of stages that output of an industry passes
through prior to reaching final consumers, so larger values of the index indicate that an industry is
further upstream.
  12 Thoughthe arguments used to develop the index differ in Fally (2012) and Antràs and Chor (2013), Antràs et al.
(2012) emphasize that the resulting indexes are equivalent. My discussion here follows Antràs and Chor (2013).

   One nice feature of this upstreamness index is that it has an intuitive link to standard results in
input-output analysis. Specifically, the upstreamness index can be re-written as:
                                            −2                   −1             −1

The upstreamness index is thus the row sum of the Ghosh Inverse matrix, which is a standard
measure of the strength of total forward linkages in the production process. That is, upstream
industries have stronger forward linkages.
     In a complementary vein, Fally (2012) develops a measure of production chain length. While
Fally develops this length index using a recursive argument, I present a counting stages argument
using Equation 17 here, paralleling the argument used above to define the upstreamness index.13
     Suppose that we count production stages backward for production of a given good, where direct
value added is stage 1, direct value added in inputs is stage 2, direct value added in inputs to inputs
is stage 3, and so on. And let us again weight this count using input use at each stage as a share of
total output. This argument yields the following weighted-count of the number of stages embodied
in industry-level output:

                             0      0            0              0               0

where the third line follows by recognizing that ι ȳˆ = v̄ I − B̄    and ȳˆ I − B̄   ȳˆ = I − Ā
[Miller and Blair (2009), Chapter 12].
    Again, the length index has a clean input-output interpretation: the length of an industry’s value
chain is equal to the column sum of the Leontief Inverse. In the input-output literature, column
sums of the Leontief Inverse are a commonly used measure of total backward linkages (the change
                        0
in total gross output (ι ȳ) resulting from a change in final demand in a particular industry). Thus,
length here is capturing the idea that downstream stimulus generates more intermediate demand,
thus total output, when value chains are longer.
    While I have defined position and length at the industry level (for a closed world economy),
these measures can be extended to the global input-output framework. For example, Fally and
Hillberry (2015) quantify the location of individual countries (or country-sector pairs) in Asian
  13 Starting from the observation that the number of stages embodied in a good is equal to one (the stage via which the

good itself is produced) plus the number of stages embodied in that good’s intermediate inputs, Fally (2012) defines
                                                                  0 −1

value chain length recursively as: N = ι + Ā N, so that N = I−Ā      ι, which is evidently the transpose of Equation
                                           0
20. Miller and Temurshoev (2017) treat N as a measure of “input downstreamness,” which measures the distance of
a given industry from primary factors of production (i.e., value added).

value chains, using a many-country (regional) input-output for Asia. Further, while the length
and upstreamness measures above are computed for industries, it is also possible to measure the
relative location and/or distance between industry pairs using similar weighted-count arguments.
Specifically, Dietzenbacher, Luna and Bosma (2005) and Dietzenbacher and Romero (2007) com-
pute the average number of stages it takes for a demand change (or value-added cost change) in
sector i to propagate to gross output in sector j (termed the “average propagation length”), which
Alfaro et al. (2015) use to test a model of firm boundaries.


2.4        Price Linkages and Trade Cost Aggregation
By linking production processes together across borders, global value chains give rise to price
spillovers – changes in unit costs or trade frictions upstream spillover over to influence the prices
of downstream producers. In this section, I illustrate how input-output techniques can be applied
to study these price linkages.
      As a reference point, let us start by examining price linkages in a stylized, multi-country model
of “roundabout production.” For simplicity, suppose that each country produces a single composite
good, that output is produced by combining intermediates with primary factors (e.g., labor) under
competitive conditions, and output from each country is used both as a final and intermediate
good. Further, let the production function be Cobb-Douglas, so output from country i is: qi =
Ai li1−αi ∏ j z jiji , with ∑ j α ji = αi .
               α

      The price of gross output in country i is then a function of factor costs and input prices:
                                            α                  1/(1−αi )
pi = (pvi /(1 − αi )) 1−αi ∏ j p ji /α ji ji , where pvi = wi /Ai         is the price of real value added
originating from country i and p ji = τ ji p j is the delivered cost of intermediates from country j,
where τ ji = 1 + t ji with t ji denoting ad valorem trade costs. Log changes in prices are given by:

                                     0 −1                          0 −1
                              h       i                     h       i h 0         0
                                                                                    i
                      ∆ ln p = I − A      [I − α̂] ∆ ln pv + I − A      A ◦ ∆ ln T ι,                                  (23)

where p and pv are N × 1 dimensional price vectors, A is a N × N dimensional (input-output)
matrix with elements αi j , α̂ is a N × N dimensional matrix with αi ’s along the diagonal, and T is
a N × N dimensional matrix with elements τi j .14
    The first term in Equation 23 captures the role of input linkages in transmitting “cost push”
   14 The log price change for output from country i is ∆ ln pi = (1 − αi )∆ ln pvi + ∑ j α ji [∆ ln τ ji + ∆ ln p j ], where
∆ ln pvi= ∆ ln wi − (1/1 − αi )∆ ln Ai . Equation 23 follows from stacking and manipulating these country-level equa-
tions. By way of notation, ◦ denotes the Hadamard (element-wise) product of matrices. Further, while I focus on log
price changes here (as in typical macro-applications), the same arguments obviously hold for log prices. These same
arguments hold for log-linearizations of more general price indexes (e.g., nested CES) indexes as well. One final note
is that, when trade costs are positive, the matrix A here is not quite the input-output matrix published by statistical
authorities – whereas published input-output data is reported in basic prices, expenditure shares α ji here ought to me
measured in purchaser’s prices. I will not belabor this issue, as it is not central to the story.

shocks across countries. The price of gross output from country i is a function of value-added
prices (“costs”) in all countries, where the weight that country i puts on country j’s value-added

                                                 h        i
price depends on input linkages via the matrix I − A          . The direct effect of a 1% cost shock in
country j is to raise its own gross-output price (by (1 − αi )%), and the rise in the price in country
 j’s gross output is transmitted forward to countries that use country j inputs in production, either
directly or indirectly embedded in inputs to their inputs. Thus, it is helpful to think of [I − α̂] ∆ ln pv
                                                                         0 −1
                                                                  h       i
as capturing the direct component of cost-push shocks, while I − A            [I − α̂] ∆ ln pv is the total
effect. In macro-applications, Auer, Levchenko and Saurè (2017) use this relationship to study the
propagation of cost shocks and synchronization of producer price inflation across countries, while
Bems and Johnson (2017) exploit it in defining value-added real effective exchange rates.
     The second term captures how the same cost-push mechanism governs the impact of upstream
trade
h 0 costs 0oni downstream output prices. The direct effect of changes in trade costs is given by
  A ◦ ∆ ln T ι, a weighted-average of changes in trade costs, with weights that depend on the
importance of individual inputs in production. These direct effects then trigger indirect effects, as
                                                             0 −1
                                                       h       i
they are passed downstream, again captured by the I − A           matrix. The total impact of changes
in trade costs on gross output prices combine these direct and indirect effects.
     Stepping back from this model-based discussion, there is a direct link between these results
and standard cost-push analysis in the input-output literature, and extensions thereof that have
been used to compute accumulated trade costs along the global value chain. To explain, I must
digress on the definition of value added. In the input-output literature (as in Section 2.1), “value
added” is typically defined as the difference between the value of output and the value of inputs
used, both evaluated at “basic prices” (the price sellers receive).15 This is an abuse of language:
value added in the national (production) accounts is defined as output at basic prices less the value
                                               0     0     0
of inputs used at purchaser’s prices, as in e v = y − ι Z̃ with Z̃ denoting the value of inputs at
purchaser’s prices. Recognizing this, I will re-write Equation 2 as:

                                                0     0   0        0    0
                                              v = y −ι Z = e
                                                           v + ι M,                                                   (24)

where M = Z̃ − Z is the gap between the value of inputs at purchaser’s prices and basic prices.
Typically referred to as the “margin” in input-output analysis, M is composed of transport margins,
border tariffs/subsidies, and other taxes/subsidies on input use.
   15 See Chapter 1 in Miller and Blair (2009) for example. Assuming that y and Z are both measured at basic prices,

as in typical input-output tables, Equation 2 matches this definition. In defense of this approach, this definition is close
to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), since GDP (final demand at purchasers prices) equals value added plus net taxes.
Then, ι 0 v equals GDP less the net margins that apply to final goods.




                                                              14
    Substituting Equation 24 into Equation 15, we can decompose the value of output as follows:

                0      0                0                    0                        0
                  v [I − B]−1 + ι M [I − B]−1 = e
               y =e                             v ŷ−1 [I − A]−1 ŷ + ι Mŷ−1 [I − A]−1 ŷ                            (25)

where the second equality follows from the relationship between Ghosh and Leontief inverses.
Then, margins here are a component of production costs, and they have both direct and indirect
impacts on the value of output, just like any other production cost. The total share of those margins
                             0                   0
in the value of output is ι M [I − B]−1 ŷ−1 =ι Mŷ−1 [I − A]−1 .16
    To illustrate how this result can be used for aggregating trade costs, suppose that M consists
entirely of tariffs. Then, the vector t records the share of trade costs in the value of output for all
                         0 −1 −1                 0 −1
                 h        i         0
                                          h        i h 0   0
                                                             i
countries: t = I − A           y M ι = I−A            A ◦ T ι, where T is a matrix of tariff rates.17
This has obvious parallels to how trade costs are aggregated in Equation 23, wherein upstream
tariffs have have both direct and indirect effects on costs for downstream producers.
    Taking this one step further, Miroudot, Rouzet and Spinelli (2013) define the cumulative tariff
as the direct tariff that j puts on i plus the accumulated burden of upstream tariffs:

                                                         0 −1
                                                  h       i h 0    0
                                                                     i
                                   cumtariff = T + I − A      A ◦ T ιι 0 ,                                            (26)

where the i j element of cumtariff is the cumulative tariff that j faces in importing from i. Put
differently, it is the increase in the cost of country i goods from country j’s perspective that results
from the entire structure of tariffs along the value chain.18
    This cumulative tariff concept, along with the representation of price linkages in Equation 23,
point to important uses of input-output logic to study shock propagation and the burden of trade
costs. That said, existing work in this area likely only scratches the surface of what is possible.
I will briefly mention two potentially fruitful areas for work. First, while the cumulative tariff
aggregates trade costs in terms of their impact on producer prices, one wonders about how one
   16 Starting from a Leontief price model, Muradov (2017) derives essentially the same result. I instead focus on
                                                                                                           0
decomposing the value of output directly. To link my formula to the Muradov’s exposition, note that ι Mŷ−1 collapses
a row vector of the cumulative tax paid as a share of gross output, so the share of taxes in the value of gross output can
                       0                   0
be re-written as m [I − A]−1 , where m is a vector of margin ratios.
                                                                 0 −1 −1                    0 −1 −1

posed into the tax rate on inputs versus the total value of inputs: M = (M Z) ◦ Z , where and ◦ indicate Hadamard
(element-wise) division and multiplication respectively, and M Z is a matrix of tax rates on purchased inputs.
   18 In computing cumulative tariffs, one might take care to distinguish input versus final goods tariffs, as in CT =

Tout put + I − A         A ◦ Tinput ιι 0 , where Tout put is the tariff applied on output sold to downstream users (either
input or final goods tariffs, depending on downstream use) and Tinput are input tariffs. I set Tout put = Tinput in the main
text, suppressing this distinction. Miroudot, Rouzet and Spinelli (2013) compute cumulative tariffs using final goods
tariffs in place of Tout put .

might aggregate trade costs so as to cumulate the impact they have on demand, either for gross
output or value added produced by a given country. Second, a venerable literature on effective
rates of protection considers how tariffs ought to be aggregated to measure total protection of do-
mestic value added.19 Echoing Anderson (1998), one needs a model to properly compute effective
protection, and thus more work on how value chains influence the mapping from gross tariffs to
effective protection in standard models would be useful. Both these areas for further work require
more attention to combining data with models, and so I now turn to a discussion of recent work
that does just that.


2.5     Input-Output Linkages in Trade and Macroeconomic Models
There are many positive and normative questions about global value chains that cannot be answered
by data alone. Though the focus of this paper is on measurement, I pause here to highlight work
that uses global input-output data to study the quantitative role of GVC linkages in international
trade and macroeconomic models.
     Input-output data have long been used to calibrate quantitative models of international trade.
The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) computable general equilibrium model, which includes
a rich set of input-output linkages, has been a workhorse for trade policy researchers and policy-
makers for over thirty years. Recent years have seen renewed interest in computable general equi-
librium models based on micro-foundations that yield gravity equations for trade. Caliendo and
Parro (2015) develop a quantitative Ricardian model with input-output linkages across industries
(see also Eaton et al. (2016) and Levchenko and Zhang (2016)), and Costinot and Rodríguez-Clare
(2014) discuss the role of input-output input linkages at length in their handbook article on quan-
titative trade models.
     While these models all include both cross-industry and cross-country input-output linkages,
they treat cross-country linkages in a stylized way: they assume that industry-level bilateral final
and intermediate trade shares are identical, and that the allocation of imported inputs across sectors
is the same as the allocation of domestic inputs. This amounts to applying two proportionality as-
sumptions, one at the border to split final goods and inputs and another behind the border to allocate
inputs across industries. In practice, neither assumption holds in available input-output data sets.
To match observed expenditure allocations exactly, one needs to introduce more flexibility – e.g.,
additional frictions or technology differences. Along these lines, Johnson and Noguera (forthcom-
ing) calibrate an Armington-style model to match expenditure patterns exactly in studying changes
in value-added exports over time, as do Caliendo, Parro and Tsyvinski (2017) in quantifying the
  19 Diakantoni    et al. (2017) extend the classic effective protection formula to use data on bilateral input linkages and
tariffs. Because their formula is based on the classic literature, strong (arguably implausible) assumptions are needed
to interpret it as measuring effective protection in general equilibrium.

    Fally and Hillberry (2015), Johnson and Moxnes (2016), and Antràs and de Gortari (2017) all
use global input-output data to calibrate/estimate models with sequential multistage production.
One important feature of all these models is that they seek to match differences in the pattern of
final goods versus input shipments across countries via endogenous decisions about where to locate
individual production stages given trade frictions. Further, Fally and Hillberry (2015) provide a
model-based analysis of production chain position, using the upstreamness measures discussed in
Section 2.3.
    Turning to international macroeconomics, Johnson (2014) uses global input-output data to cali-
brate an international real business cycle model with input-output linkages to study the propagation
of productivity shocks and the role of input trade in explaining the trade-comovement puzzle.20
Eaton et al. (2016) use a Ricardian model with input-linkages to evaluate the driving forces behind
the 2008-2009 trade collapse, while Eaton, Kortum and Neiman (2016) examine the role of trade
frictions in generating classic international macroeconomic puzzles. Reyes-Heroles (2016) uses a
similar model to quantify the role of declining trade costs in explaining increases in trade imbal-
ances over time. Also focusing on trade imbalances, Bems (2013) discusses how input-output and
value-added trade data can be used to properly calibrate multi-sector macro models.
    The takeaway from this brief tour of the recent literature is that measurement of input linkages
matters, because input linkages themselves matter for understanding both trade and macroeco-
nomic phenomena. With that in mind, I now turn to discussing the current state of data on global
input-output linkages.


2.6     Data Sources
In the past decade, there has been rapid progress in the measurement of input-output linkages
across countries. At present, there are at least six major sources of data – the Global Trade Analysis
Project (GTAP) Database, the IDE-JETRO Asian Input-Output Tables, the World Input-Output
Database, EXIOBASE, the Eora Database, the OECD Inter-Country Input-Output Tables – and
more in development (e.g., the Eurostat FIGARO project).21 While this paper is not the place to
exhaustively describe these data sources, I will touch on some features and shortcomings of them
below. Most of my commentary will focus on general data problems that researchers face in this
area, highlighting where progress has been made and where more work is needed.
   20 In related work, Duval et al. (2016) examine the role of value-added exports in explaining business cycle synchro-

nization. de Soyres (2017) studies the role of input trade in generating productivity comovement across countries, and
Steinberg (2017) studies the role of input linkages in explaining changes in portfolio home bias.
   21 Several of these research projects are described in a special issue of Economics Systems Research (Vol. 25, No.

1, 2013). See the introductory paper by Tukker and Dietzenbacher (2013) for a useful overview.



                                                          17
    To construct a global input-output table, one must collect and combine raw data from a variety
of sources, including supply and use data from country-level input-output accounts, time series
data on production and expenditure from the national accounts, disaggregate bilateral trade data,
and so on. These underlying data are imperfect, in several senses. In some cases, data is literally
unavailable: input-output data is unavailable for many countries for significant intervals of time.
At best, input-output data is produced for benchmark years only, which are often asynchronous
across countries. Technical features of the input-output tables (e.g., sector classifications, price
concepts used in recording data, etc.) also differ across countries, and input-output data can be
hard to reconcile with national accounts aggregates.
    For all these reasons, converting raw data to polished global input-output tables requires an
arduous data cleaning, reconciliation, and extrapolation process. There is no single right answer
to the many questions that must be addressed, so the major data sources all use a unique set of
methods for compiling their data. Going forward, it would be useful to know more about the con-
sequences of various decisions, and the possible scope for convergence in methods and statistical
infrastructure. Further, while existing data sources have been developed by academic research
consortia, more involvement by national and international statistical authorities to institutionalize
the data production process would have high value.
    Beyond these basic matters, there are three broad issues that deserve more attention. The first
two concern data coverage. The first is that input-output data sources currently cover the post-1990
period, due to the wider availability of input-output data for recent decades. While this period is
undeniably interesting, it is helpful to push backwards in time in order to gain perspective on
more recent developments. The OECD has collected input-output tables for selected countries
back to 1970, which have been used by Hummels, Ishii and Yi (2001) and Johnson and Noguera
(forthcoming) to measure vertical specialization and value-added exports over time. Further, the
IDE-JETRO Asian Input-Output Tables collect data for Asia back to 1985, prior to the emergence
of China as a regional economic power. More work to collect data and extend analysis of global
value chains backwards in time would be valuable.
    The second data coverage issue concerns aggregation. Most data sets have been constructed at a
level of aggregation that is higher than the level of aggregation available in primary sources, partly
to resolve industry concordance issues across sources, countries, and years. Nonetheless, it would
be useful to have more disaggregated data on GVC linkages, because policy decisions are often
made at a more disaggregated level than existing data allows us to analyze. As an extreme example,
trade policy is made at the tariff line level (with thousands of tariff lines), while standard data
sets have on the order of 40-50 industries. Developing methods to use all the disaggregated input-
output, production, and trade data that exists, perhaps along the lines that the Eora and EXIOBASE
projects have pursued, could be valuable for making the data policy relevant.


                                                 18
    The third general issue is there is less information in raw data sources about imported input
use than first meets the eye. To build an accurate picture of global value chains, we need to be
able to identify inputs in international trade data and then track those inputs to users behind the
border. Of these two issues, identifying inputs in trade data is relatively straightforward. The most
compelling approach is to use a classification scheme, such as the Broad Economic Categories
(BEC), to identify inputs versus final goods in disaggregated bilateral trade data.22 While this
approach is used by the WIOD dataset, other data sets use proportionality assumptions and/or
mathematical optimization algorithms to impute bilateral input flows. Further, bilateral services
trade data are problematic: services trade is measured poorly relative to goods trade, and there is
no analog to the BEC approach for services. Basic improvements in national statistical frameworks
are needed to address both these issues.
    Matters are arguably even more problematic behind the border.23 One problem is that the
“use table” in the input-output accounts – which tracks how commodities are used as inputs by
individual industries – does not distinguish between patterns of input use for domestically produced
versus imported goods/services. This implies that one must use assumptions (or data imputation
techniques) to decompose input use across sources. Most commonly, imported input use tables
are constructed using “proportionality” (alternatively, “import comparability”) assumptions, under
which imported inputs are allocated across sectors in the same proportion as domestic goods.24
Further, the proportionality assumption is naturally applied to total imports, so inputs from all
bilateral trade partners are treated in the same way. In plain language, the input-output segment of
the national accounts do not directly tell us how much imported steel is used in US car production,
nor whether imported steel from Canada versus Japan are used in the same way.
    A second problem is that imported inputs are assumed to be used with equal intensity in
industry-level production for domestic and export markets. When imported input intensity dif-
fers across firms within an industry, then using the average input intensity reported in input-output
tables to represent production techniques may lead to large biases in measurement of the value-
added content of trade and other GVC metrics. This problem is obvious for countries that have
large export processing sectors, as in Mexico or China for example. However, the problem is likely
  22 The   BEC system is designed to classify traded goods, themselves classified according to the Standard Industrial
Trade Classification or Harmonized System, into consumption goods, intermediate goods, and capital goods cate-
gories, as defined in the System of National Accounts. Eurostat advocates the use BEC-classified trade data for the
construction of imported input use tables in its Manual of Supply, Use and Input-Output Tables.
   23 As Horowitz and Planting (2009. p. 6-1) disconcertingly put it, “the estimation of transactions [flows between

establishments or from an establishment to a final user] is often referred to as ‘the art of input-output.’ ‘Art’ is needed
because of the paucity of data for measuring transactions in many areas.”
   24 Put differently, aggregate input use patterns in the “use table” are assumed to apply to both domestically produced

and imported inputs. This assumption is often applied in the data at a higher level of disaggregation than that of the
resulting published import use table, which means that proportionality does not hold in published data. Application of
proportionality at the highest level possible is desirable.



                                                           19
to be pervasive, because participation in exporting is strongly positively correlated with participa-
tion in importing at the firm level.
    Both these problems in tracking inputs behind the border obscure the microeconomic details
of global value chains. I will return to discuss how micro-data might be useful in dealing with
these problems in Section 4. With that objective in mind, I turn to micro-approaches to measuring
GVCs.


3       Micro-Approaches to Measuring GVCs
Alongside efforts to measure GVC linkages using input-output data, census data, customs data, and
firm surveys have been applied to advance measurement of GVC linkages at the firm level. At first
glance, this micro-approach to measuring GVCs may appear disconnected from the input-output
approach in Section 2. Under the surface, however, there are important points of contact between
the two research agendas.
      To tie the input-output and micro-data approaches together, it is useful to think through a hy-
pothetical disaggregation of the global input-output table. Instead of measuring industry-level
shipments, suppose that we could measure firm-to-firm transactions.25 That is, suppose that we
                                            0              0
observe input shipments from firm f in sector s in country i to firm f in sector s in country j:
       0      0
zi j (s , s; f , f ). Further, suppose that we observe shipments by firm f in sector s of country i to
                                                    0        0
final users in country j: fi j (s; f ). With zi j (s , s; f , f ) and fi j (s; f ), we could then build a global
input-output table at the firm level, in which columns describe how firms source their inputs (i.e.,
what inputs does each firm buy, and from which countries), while the rows describe where a firm
sells its outputs (to final of intermediate users, to which downstream firms, to which countries).
This hypothetical firm-level data would then aggregate up to industry-level input-output tables.
      This thought experiment helps explain how firm-level data can improve measurement of GVC
linkages. It also serves to identify limitations of firm-level data for understanding GVCs. A key
strength of firm level data is that we can observe transactions between firms and their foreign
partners, rather than infer them by combining industry-level information with trade data (as in
the input-output accounts). Further, firm-level sources capture heterogeneity in GVC linkages
across firms, which is obscured by aggregated industry-level data. I emphasize these strengths in
describing how firm-level data has been applied to measuring offshoring and/or input sourcing,
    25 Tosimply the discussion, I omit notation necessary to accommodate multi-product firms whose products span
multiple industries. Because multi-product firms are important in the data, empirical efforts to construct input-output
tables from firm-level data must confront complications that arise due to their existence. One challenge is that one
needs to observe shipments by firm and product within a country to construct aggregate cross-industry shipments, and
this data is not always available. A second challenge is that data on imported input use is recorded at the firm level,
but not broken down by the products for which it is used as an input.

vertical specialization in trade, and the GVC activities of multinational firms. Firm-level data is
also limited in some important respects. Most importantly, firm-level data do not contain the full
                                    0      0
set of firm-level shipments (zi j (s , s; f , f ) and fi j (s; f )) needed to map out the complete global
production process. I discuss these points of strength and weakness in more detail below, and
continue this discussion in Section 4.


3.1       Offshoring and Input Sourcing
Since the mid-1990’s, offshoring – the replacement of domestic sources of inputs and business
tasks with foreign (offshore) sources – has occupied a central place in the literature and policy
discussions. Feenstra and Hanson (1996, 1999) defined offshoring in terms of the share of foreign
inputs in total input use, and thus launched an important empirical literature on the consequences
of foreign input sourcing.26 While much of this literature has focused on the labor market impacts
of offshoring, I will define the offshoring and input sourcing literature broadly to encompass work
on the impact of imported inputs on general firm performance (e.g., productivity and growth) as
well.
    To maintain focus, I restrict my attention to recent work that has examined offshoring and in-
put sourcing at the firm level, which draws on the (relatively new) availability of data sets linking
firm-level variables (production, employment, materials use, and so on) to firm-level import trans-
actions.27 Connecting to the discussion above, these data sets allow us to observe either bilateral
                                                                                               0      0
or multilateral input purchases from foreign sources for individual firms – i.e., ∑ f 0 zi j (s , s; f , f ) or
                0      0
∑i ∑ f 0 zi j (s , s; f , f ), depending on the data source.28 Various lines of work exploit this granular
perspective on input sourcing to study the impact of imported inputs on firm prices, productivity,
revenue, and domestic employment.
    A common theme in this work is that a firm that imports is able to lower its unit costs, ei-
ther through access to lower cost inputs, a larger variety of inputs, or higher quality inputs.29
  26 As  discussed in Section 2.2.1, input-output based measures of domestic versus foreign value-added content in
final goods can also be used to measure offshoring, and in fact are conceptually consistent with prominent models of
offshoring and task trade. In particular, they account for the fact that foreign-sourced inputs may contain domestic
content, while domestically-sourced inputs may contain foreign content. Beyond this comment, I will not repeat this
discussion here, and instead I focus entirely on domestic versus foreign sourcing of inputs as in the literature.
   27 A few words on the scope of my discussion here are warranted. I omit work that measures offshoring at the

industry level, either using input-output data (as in Feenstra and Hanson (1996, 1999) and related work), or using firm-
level data aggregated to the industry level (as in Ebenstein et al. (2014)). I also largely omit work that examines the
impact of tariff changes on firm performance – in particular work that studies the impact of input tariff liberalization
on productivity or product growth at the firm level [Amiti and Konings (2007); Topalova and Khandelwal (2011);
Goldberg et al. (2010)]. All these studies have significant value for understanding the impact of GVC integration on
workers and firms; I omit detailed discussion of them only due to space constraints.
   28 While s denotes industries, transactions are often available at a level of commodity disaggregation (e.g., at the

Harmonized System 6-digit level) far beyond what is available in industry-level input-output data sources.
   29 While the literature has placed emphasis on offshoring, any shift from in-house to outsourced production lowers




                                                          21
These unit cost reductions lead firms to expand and appear more productive [Halpern, Koren and
Szeidl (2015), Blaum, Lelarge and Peters (forthcoming)], and they can induce further complemen-
tary cost-reducing research and development (R&D) investment [Bøler, Moxnes and Ulltveit-Moe
(2015)]. They may raise or lower domestic employment, depending on the substitutability of do-
mestic workers with imported inputs [Hummels et al. (2014)]. The fact that unit costs fall as firms
add foreign suppliers also yields complementaries in input sourcing across markets [Antràs, Fort
and Tintelnot (2017)]. Running this process in reverse, shocks that lead firms to drop foreign
suppliers (such as an exchange rate changes) can lead to reductions in firm and hence aggregate
productivity, as emphasized by Gopinath and Neiman (2014).
    One nice features of this collected body of work is that it has combined both structural and
reduced form methods to describe the role of input sourcing. For example, Bøler, Moxnes and
Ulltveit-Moe (2015) analyze the impact of a change in R&D tax credits in Norway, which was
capped in value such that only some firms were able to take advantage of the new tax credit. This
feature of the reform allows Bøler et al. to provide reduced form difference-in-difference evidence
that R&D complements importing at the firm level: firms incentived to undertake more R&D also
raise imports of intermediate inputs relative to control firms. Building on the model of endogenous
importing and structural estimation procedure developed in Halpern, Koren and Szeidl (2015),
Bøler et al. then structurally estimate a model with endogenous R&D and import decisions to
quantify total returns to R&D and imports, accounting for complementaries between them.
    Antràs, Fort and Tintelnot (2017) also combine structural estimation of their model with coun-
terfactual analysis, focusing on analysis of China’s post-2001 export surge. Specifically, they
benchmark the predictions of the model – that firms adding China as an import source in response
to the shock should also add additional domestic and import sources – to data, using both descrip-
tive statistics and regression analysis of changes in firm-level sourcing behavior.
    Finally, Hummels et al. (2014) exploits heterogeneity across firms in input sourcing patterns in-
teracted with shocks to transportation costs and export supply to generate firm-specific instruments
for the use of imported inputs. Using matched worker and firm data on employment and wages in
Denmark, they establish that offshoring is associated with contractions in domestic employment,
particularly for low-skilled workers, and a decline in the relative wage of low skilled workers.
    Returning to the broader theme of measuring global value chains, one shortcoming in this lit-
erature is that input sourcing is only a narrow slice of the firm’s overall GVC strategy, focused on
the firm’s decision about sourcing upstream inputs. Moreover, the term offshoring often evokes a
quite different idea: the movement of downstream stages (final assembly) to low wage locations,
or the complete closure of domestic production facilities. This downstream offshoring manifests
itself in an entirely different way in the data, either as firms shifting toward exporting inputs and
firm costs. See Fort (2017) for analysis of firm decisions about whether to fragment production at home or abroad.


                                                         22
re-importing final goods, as purchases of contract manufacturing from abroad, or as the closure
and transition of manufacturing establishments. Bernard and Fort (2015, 2017) touch on the last
dimension of this problem in their work on factory-less goods producers, who organize the produc-
tion process (providing R&D, management, and distribution services) and contract out production
to foreign firms. These issues are also discussed in work on multinationals and processing trade,
where we can observe (to an extent) whether exports are processed abroad and embodied in re-
imported final goods. More work on incorporating these additional perspectives on offshoring
with the input-sourcing based offshoring literature would be helpful.
     A second limitation of this literature is that it provides evidence only on the direct impact of
input sourcing decisions, but misses how higher order interconnections between firms matter for
understanding and quantifying the impacts of offshoring. For example, the cost reduction at a firm
that starts importing inputs is passed down through the value chain to firms that use that firm’s
output as an input. These interconnections lie at the heart of the hypothetical firm-level input-
output table discussed in the introduction to this section. They clearly operate behind-the-border
domestically, but they may also extend across borders – e.g. an auto parts supplier in Ohio may
lower costs by offshoring some production, which may then benefit a Canadian engine producer,
which ultimately supplies an engine to a car assembly plant in Detroit. I return to recent work that
is starting to address these linkages below.


3.2       Joint Exporting and Importing
Importers are exporters too. This is both an empirical statement – import and export status are
strongly positively correlated at the firm level – and an admonition to remember that exports are a
sign of participation in global value chains as well.
    To back the empirical statement, Bernard, Jensen and Schott (2009) and Bernard et al. (forth-
coming) document correlations in export and import status for the United States, emphasizing that
firms that both import and exports (while few in number) account for 90\% of US trade.30 This
correlation is not hard to rationalize from a theoretical perspective, at least qualitatively. First, to
the extent that firms face fixed costs in accessing both export and import markets, then the most
productive firms will naturally self-select into both importing and exporting. Second, exporting
and importing are complementary: importing lowers firm costs (raising revenue), making it easier
for firms to cover the fixed costs of exporting, and export entry raises firm revenue, which makes
it easier for firms to cover fixed import costs as well.
    While joint exporting and importing is pervasive, it is particularly important for firms engaged
  30 To  my knowledge, similar patterns are apparent in every firm-level data set thus far examined. A non-exhaustive
set of references are: Amiti and Davis (2011) on Indonesia, Kasahara and Lapham (2013) on Chile, Amiti, Itskhoki
and Konings (2014) on Belgium, and Blaum (2017) on Mexico.


                                                         23
in “processing trade.” Processing trade typically occurs under a special legal regime, under which
firms are exempt from import duties if they export their output. Depending on the country, pro-
cessing firms may also benefit from (non-tariff) tax incentives, input subsidies, or other policies as
well.
    Processing trade regimes are ubiquitous: the International Labor Organization counted over
130 countries with laws providing for export processing zones as of 2006, up from only 25 in
1975 [Boyenge (2007)]. Grant (2017) reports that there are over 300 “foreign-trade zones” in the
United States, accounting for 13% of US manufacturing output and $288 billion in imports, while
Cernat and Pajot (2012) report that exports originating from the European Union inward processing
regime account for 10% of total EU exports.31
    While this developed country processing trade is significant and understudied, it is dwarfed by
emerging market processing trade. In China, for example, more than half of total exports originate
from processing trade firms. Kee and Tang (2016) use firm-level data for processing and non-
processing exporters to build estimates of Chinese and foreign content in China’s exports. The
difference between exports and imported inputs for a processing firm is a rough estimate of the
Chinese content embodied in processing exports, which includes both direct value added by the
processing firm and indirect value added by upstream Chinese suppliers to the processing firm.32
Kee and Tang estimate that Chinese value added accounted for between 45-55% of the value of
China’s processing exports between 2000-2007, with a rising trend over time due to substitution
of foreign for Chinese inputs over time. This is naturally lower than Chinese content in its non-
processing exports, which was near 90%.
    Whether integration into global value chains via export processing is good policy is less clear.
Interestingly, Dai, Maitra and Yu (2016) show that Chinese firms that select into the processing
trade sector are actually less productive than ordinary exporters, which they attribute to lower fixed
costs of exporting and industrial policies that favor processing firms. Whether this pattern holds
elsewhere is unknown; if it does, it suggests that countries are effectively subsidizing unproductive
firms via their processing trade regimes, which implies that expansion of processing trade may not
be a healthy sign. Importantly, it is also an open question whether there are dynamic gains to be
had from encouraging processing exports, which could offset these concerns. Additional work in
   31 While these figures describe “inward processing” regimes, in which domestic firms import inputs to produce

exports, both the United States and European union also have “outward processing” regimes, in which exported inter-
mediate goods may be processed abroad and taxes are paid only the foreign value added embodied in those re-imported
final goods. See Feenstra, Hanson and Swenson (2000) for work on the “9802 program” in the United States.
   32 This statement requires that inputs from non-processing Chinese firms used by processing exporters are produced

entirely in China (with no foreign content themselves) and that imported inputs contain no Chinese content. Kee
and Tang use input-output data to argue that the Chinese content of inputs imported by processing firms is plausibly
zero, and they incorporate input-output estimates of the foreign content of inputs from non-processing firms in their
estimates. Kee and Tang also estimate the domestic content of non-processing firms, using an assumption that firms
split imported inputs proportionally across domestic sales and exports.


                                                         24
China and other countries with large processing regimes (e.g., Mexico) is much needed.
    Turning back to measurement of global value chains, consider two final observations. First,
to the extent that the domestic content of processing exports differs vastly from non-processing
exports, then it is prima facie important to take processing trade into account in computing the
value-added content of trade, as well as other input-output-based measures of GVC linkages. Sec-
ond, while processing trade is a stark example of the high concentration of importing and exporting
activities within a few firms, it is typically the case that exports are produced by firms that import
intensively. As such, the type of issues that arise in measuring GVC linkages for processing ex-
ports are likely more general. I will return to both these thoughts in discussing avenues for research
below.


3.3     Multinational Firms
Multinationals are the vehicles through which most trade – and thus input trade – takes place. In
this section, I want to highlight a few aspects of multinational data that are particularly relevant
for mapping value chains, with emphasis on the US multinational data produced by the Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA).33
      With BEA data, it is possible to map out vertical production networks between domestic parents
and foreign affiliates, which entail task specialization within the multinational enterprise and corre-
spondingly lead to flows of inputs between parents and affiliates [Hanson, Mataloni and Slaughter
(2005)]. Specifically, the data contain shipments from parents to affiliates, broken down according
to intended use (e.g., for further processing, resale, or as a capital input). Further, for a sub-set
of large affiliates, the data contain shipments by affiliates to different types of buyers – e.g., to
the parent, US buyers other than the parent firm, buyers in third countries, etc. As such, it pro-
vides information about how inputs are used in the destination, unlike census/customs-type data.
In this sense, these data allow us to see a subset of the bilateral network of firm-level shipments
        0      0
(zi j (s , s; f , f ) and fi j (s; f )) that underpin the hypothetical firm-to-firm global input output table.
      Ramondo, Rappoport and Ruhl (2016) document two facts using this data that speak to GVC
linkages within multinationals. The first fact is that trade among parents and affiliates is highly
skewed: the median manufacturing foreign affiliate does not ship anything to/from its parent, while
the largest 5% of affiliates account for half of transactions with the parent. This is prima facie
surprising: the majority of parent-affiliate pairs have de minimus vertical GVC linkages with one
another. Building on this observation, Ramondo et al. also show that vertical GVC linkages within
multinationals are not necessarily where we would a priori expect them to be. While US parents
tend to own affiliates in industries that are vertically linked to the parent’s industry, the magnitude
  33 Theliterature on multinationals is vast, so I cannot cover it in depth here. See recent surveys by Yeaple (2013)
and Antràs and Yeaple (2014) for a more complete view of the literature.


                                                         25
of input-output linkages between the industries does not predict actual transactions between parent
and affiliate. This second fact is also puzzling: we should expect to find micro-evidence of GVC
linkages where input-output data tell us to look for them. Overall, these data raise many new
questions about how to link micro and macro-perspectives on GVC linkages.
     Despite these puzzling results, the information on how parents are linked to affiliates in the
BEA data has been put to good use for studying GVC linkages. Hanson, Mataloni and Slaughter
(2005) use the data to study the determinants of vertical linkages, demonstrating that trade costs
reduce affiliate use of inputs from parent firms, while low unskilled wages tend to increase them
(consistent with the idea that affiliates are engaged in processing trade). Harrison and McMil-
lan (2011) instead use measures of vertical linkages to examine how domestic employment at
multinationals responds to their engagement with foreign affiliates. Unconditionally, they find that
affiliate employment in low income countries substitutes for domestic employment. However, do-
mestic employment increases as foreign wages fall when parents send inputs for further processing
to their affiliates in developing countries. Both contributions demonstrate the value of being able
to observe how exports are used abroad in testing theories of value chain fragmentation.


4    Pushing Forward
While there has been ample progress in measuring global value chain linkages at both the macro-
and micro-levels, this important work is incomplete. Supplementing my discussion about gaps in
the literature in Sections 2 and 3, I will conclude by discussing two broad areas in which more
work is needed.

Linking the Micro and Macro Approaches The macro- and micro-approaches to measuring
GVC engagement have advanced largely on parallel tracks, headed in the same direction, but
with limited overlap. There is scope for convergence in these two tracks, however: micro-data
can improve the input-output approach, and input-output type analysis can strengthen micro-
quantification exercises.
   In Section 2.6, I noted that there is less information on input use in the national input-output ac-
counts than meets the eye. One reason is that national accountants do not actually ask firms detailed
questions about domestic versus foreign sourcing in the surveys that underlie the input-output ac-
counts. While directly enhancing data collection would be would be the best solution, there are a
number of ways that creative use of existing data sources might greatly improve measurement of
GVC linkages.
   First, existing micro-data on import transactions linked to firm census-style data could be
brought to bear on improving estimates of the allocation of imported inputs across sectors. Us-

                                                  26
ing notation from the hypothetical firm-to-firm global input-output table, we observe imported
                                               0     0
inputs at the firm level – like ∑ f 0 zi j (s , s; f , f ) – in micro-data. Aggregating firm-level imports to
                                      0      0
the industry level – ∑ f ∑ f 0 zi j (s , s; f , f ) – ought to yield a good estimate of bilateral input trade
       0
zi j (s , s).34
      Building on this idea, Feenstra and Jensen (2012) attempt to construct an industry-to-industry
import input-output table using the US Linked/Longitudinal Firm Trade Transaction Database. The
                                                                                               0
good news is that they find that the resulting import input-output coefficients (zi j (s , s)/y j (s)) are
positively correlated with existing published data from the BEA, with an unweighted correlation
of 0.68 and a value-weighted correlation of 0.87. Thus, existing import IO tables may not be so
bad after all. On the other hand, there are deviations between the two data sets, which implies that
there may be additional information in the micro-data that could be profitably be combined with
existing input-output data sources to yield a better composite (reconciled) table.
      The second way that micro-data could improve input-output data is by enabling disaggrega-
tion of IO tables, thus tracking global value chain linkages at higher resolution. In industry-level
input-output analysis, one effectively makes the assumption that there is a representative producer
in each industry, operating with a technology that reflects industry averages, and whose output is
distributed across sectors and end uses based on average use patterns. Failure of this represen-
tative producer assumption leads to bias in input-output analysis. For example, one empirically
relevant concern is that exports tend to be produced with a higher imported input intensity than
the average unit of output in most industries, as implied by the concentration of trade among firms
that both import and export (see Section 3.2). Ignoring this specific correlation would lead one
to underestimate engagement of exporting firms in GVCs and the import content of exports, thus
overestimating the value-added content of trade.
      In a first-best world, national accountants would routinely construct separate input-output ta-
bles that address relevant dimensions of heterogeneity.35 Until that happens, we must make due
with existing data. Fortunately, there has been some progress in using existing data sources to al-
low for correlations in input use and output use patterns across firms within industries. Koopman,
Wang and Wei (2012) develop a procedure to split consolidated input-output tables into separate
input-output tables for processing versus non-processing firms, using industry-level trade and GDP
data broken down by firm type. They report that the share of domestic value-added in Chinese ex-
ports falls from 75% to 54% when using the adjusted split table in place of the consolidated IO
   34 I say “ought to” because there limitations in firm level data that make the concordance to input-output based

estimates imperfect. Nonetheless, the principle that there is “additional information” in firm level data not currently
incorporated into input-output analyses stands.
   35 For example, in countries with large processing trade sectors, it should be possible to construct input-output tables

that distinguish processing from non-processing firms within each industry. As proof of concept, there exists one year
(2003) in which such input-output data is available for Mexico. See Cruz et al. (2013).



                                                           27
table, which indicates aggregation bias is large when processing trade is prevalent.
    More broadly, it would be useful to explore how census and customs data could be used to
build extended IO tables for exporting versus non-exporting firms in all countries, with or without
processing trade regimes. This work could proceed either building on the direct data aggregation
approach of Feenstra and Jensen (2012), or using the data imputation approach of Koopman, Wang
and Wei (2012). Pushing still further, firms that differ in national ownership may also differ in their
input use and output allocation – e.g., affiliates of multinationals likely have larger than average
input use and export sales vis-à-vis the country of their parent firm – and micro-data can to be
applied to address this heterogeneity too.36 With continued development, the end goal ought to be
to include extended IO tables in published global input-output tables.
    Turning to a different kind of aggregation issue, concepts from the input-output literature are
useful for aggregating micro-evidence on the consequences of foreign input sourcing to the macro-
level. Recalling Section 3.1, recent work that evaluates the consequences of foreign input sourcing
at the firm level measures the direct impact of foreign sourcing, answering the question: how
much does a firm’s performance change when it starts sourcing from abroad, all else constant?
While these direct effects are a good starting point, there are also important indirect spillovers
across firms: firms not only benefit from their own foreign sourcing, but they also benefit from the
foreign sourcing of their domestic suppliers. Thus, the domestic input-output network transmits
and likely amplifies the direct effects of foreign sourcing.
    To allow for both direct and indirect effects, one ideally needs data on the network of domestic
                                             0     0
firm-to-firm input-output linkages (zii (s , s; f , f )). As above, the first best solution would be to
collect this data on these linkages. Recent work that exploits value-added tax (VAT) data [Bernard
et al. (2017); Tintelnot et al. (2017)], firm’s self-reported buyers and sellers [Barrot and Sauvagnat
(2016); Carvalho et al. (2016); Furusawa et al. (2017); Bernard, Moxnes and Saito (forthcoming)],
or survey data on intra-national shipments [Atalay, Hortaçsu and Syverson (2014)] is pushing in
this direction.
    Unfortunately, these micro-network methods are unlikely to be universally applicable, due to
lack of data availability. Proxy methods that combine existing macro- and micro-approaches to
measurement are a useful tool in this area as well. Specifically, aggregate industry-to-industry
                0
linkages (zii (s , s)) can serve as a proxy for firm-to-firm linkages. Blaum, Lelarge and Peters (forth-
coming) provide a model with heterogeneous firms embedded in industry equilibrium, in which
industries (and thus the firms in those industries) are linked together as in input-output data. Using
the model, they quantify how changes in foreign sourcing at the firm level aggregate up to the
  36 Againfocusing on China, Ma, Wang and Zhu (2015) construct extended IO tables that distinguish foreign from
Chinese-owned firms, while Tang, Wang and Wang (2017) distinguish between state-owned and private enterprises in
China.



                                                      28
macro level, and they find that input-output linkages behind the border are quantitatively important
for understanding how aggregate industry-level prices change following shocks to foreign sourc-
ing. More work combining macro- and micro-approaches to measuring GVC engagement would
be most welcome.

Theory and Measurement The final point I will make is that GVC measurement and theory are
linked: theory guides what has been measured, and improved measurement has stimulated new
theory. Yet, there remains fertile ground for further work in areas where theory and measurement
remain far apart.
    One area where theory is ahead of measurement is in conceptualizing the micro-structure of
value chains. Among models of value chains, there is an important distinction between models
that feature sequential production chains versus those that adopt a modular/roundabout production
structure. In a sequential production chain, upstream stages in the production process are a direct
input (and thus must be performed prior to) downstream stages, as in an assembly line. In a
modular production model, inputs are produced independently and then aggregated to produce
output. Further, the widely used roundabout production structure, in which output is used as an
input production, is effectively a modular production process with a loop in the production process.
These seemingly esoteric features of the production process matter a lot in practice, because they
deliver distinct predictions about the impact of frictions on trade [Yi (2003); Baldwin and Venables
(2013)] and spillovers within value chains [Costinot, Vogel and Wang (2013)].
    While the language of input-output analysis – which refers to the length of and location of
producers in value chains (Section 2.3) – suggests sequentiality in production, input-output data
are also consistent with modular/roundabout production. In fact, modular/roundabout production
is the default approach to modeling GVC trade. Neither input-output data, nor census/customs
firm-level micro-data, alone include information that can distinguish sequential value chains from
modular/roundabout production. One approach to doing so entails confronting existing data with
models that nest the two production alternatives, and comparing the models based on their distinc-
tive predictions. A second approach would be to develop new measures of sequentiality in produc-
tion at the sector level, akin to attempts to measure product differentiation or contractability. In the
end, both approaches are likely to be necessary to evaluate the role of sequential production in the
global economy.
    A second area where theory and measurement remain far apart is in understanding the organi-
zation of value chains, at both the firm and industry level. At the firm level, for example, Antràs
and Chor (2013) provide a property-rights theory of the firm that yields predictions for how firms
will choose to integrate versus outsource stages in global value chains. While Alfaro et al. (2015)
test this theory by inferring how parents and affiliates are linked to one another from input-output


                                                  29
data, Ramondo, Rappoport and Ruhl (2016) cast doubt on whether aggregate input-output linkages
are useful for understanding the actual transfer of resources within multinational firms (see Section
3.3). Ideally, improved data collection on the activities of multinationals – crucially the operations
of affiliates and their interactions with non-affiliate suppliers at home and abroad – could greatly
enhance our understanding of multinational firms in a value chain context. Further, firm-level sur-
vey data that is tailored to answering questions about offshoring/outsourcing activities could also
have high value in this area.37
    The case study method can also complement input-output and micro-data methods for studying
GVCs. Case studies have already served to motivate central GVC concepts – e.g., product teardown
studies of the Apple iPod and other consumer electronics were influential in motivating value-
added trade concepts [Dedrick, Kraemer and Linden (2009)].38 Industry case studies can shed
light on the industrial organization of GVC activities, as in work by Gary Gereffi and coauthors
on apparel and auto value chains [Gereffi (1999); Sturgeon, Biesebroeck and Gereffi (2008)]. The
organizational and institutional details contained in these case studies are a rich font for GVC
theory. Further, quantitative work in the style of the industrial organization literature – focusing
on industries where one can gather high quality data, understand the market, model interactions
between firms carefully, and respect/exploit particular features of the production process – would
add value relative to existing approaches to studying GVC activities.




   37 See Fontagné and D’Isanto (2017) for an example of a survey targeted at identifying motives offshoring and

integration versus outsourcing.
   38 For example, the iPod example was picked up by Johnson and Noguera (2012a), which was in turn stimulated by

Varian (2007). Notable failures in value chain functioning have also served to highlight risks inherent in global value
chains, as in the problems Boeing encountered in managing its global supplier network for the Dreamliner [Gates
(2013)], or the fragility of auto supply chains to disruptions in the supply of critical parts exposed in the aftermath of
the Japanese Tohoku earthquake and tsunami [Lohr (2011); Matsuo (2015)].

Supplemental Appendix
This appendix expands on the discussion in Section 2.2.2 about measuring value-added content
in exports. I begin by re-deriving value-added in exports, emphasizing that analyzing exports
amounts to uncoupling the global input-output system. I then discuss how decomposing value-
added content in exports is part of an overall decomposition of GDP.
    In Equation 7, input shipments A12 y2 have been removed from the global input-output matrix
and deposited into exports. This operation uncouples output in country 1 and country 2: y1 depends
directly on f11 and x12 , but (conditional on x12 ) does not directly depend on y2 .39 As a result, output
for country 1 can be uniquely decomposed according to whether it is used to produce f11 or x12 :

                                   y1 = [I − A11 ]−1 f11 + [I − A11 ]−1 x12 ,                              (A.1)

where [I − A11 ]−1 x12 is the value of output from country 1 required to produce its exports. Corre-
spondingly, the amount of value-added from country 1 required to produce its exports is: xc11 =
v̂1 ŷ−1          −1
      1 [I − A11 ] x12 .
      Pushing this logic further, output in country 2 depends on output in country 1:

      y2 = A21 y1 + A22 y2 + f21 + f22                                                                     (A.2)
         = A21 [I − A11 ]−1 x12 + A21 [I − A11 ]−1 f11 + A22 y2 + f21 + f22                                (A.3)
         = [I − A22 ]−1 A21 [I − A11 ]−1 x12 + [I − A22 ]−1 A21 [I − A11 ]−1 f11 + [f21 + f22 ] ,
                                                                                              
                                                                                                           (A.4)

In line A.2, note that A21 y1 is the vector of inputs shipped from country 2 to country 1, for all
downstream uses. In line A.3, I substitute for y1 using Equation A.1 to identify the subset of those
inputs that are used to produce country 1’s exports: A21 [I − A11 ]−1 x12 . In line A.4, I pull y2 to one
side. The result is a decomposition of country 2’s output, where [I − A22 ]−1 A21 [I − A11 ]−1 x12 is
the amount of country 2 output needed to produce the inputs it ships to country 1 that are ultimately
embodied in country 1’s exports. From this, it is straightforward to see that country 2 value added
in x12 is: xc21 = v̂2 ŷ−1          −1             −1
                        2 [I − A22 ] A21 [I − A11 ] x12 .
    Taking a step back, it is useful to explain how value-added content in exports fits into a full
decomposition of GDP. Using Equation 7, note that
                           " #          " #                           "     #
                            v1           y1                            xc11
                               = v̂ŷ−1     = v̂ŷ−1 [I − A∗ ]−1 F∗ +         .
                            v2           y2                            xc21
Thus, value added in exports is a naturally only one component of country 1’s overall value added.
  39 This is consistent with the observation by Los, Timmer and de Vries (2016) that we can compute domestic value

added in exports using input-output tables for one country at a time.


                                                       40
The other component is value added embodied in final goods contained in F∗ , which excludes f12
because it is already contained in x12 .
    One subtle, but important, point to note is that the resulting decomposition of value added
in final goods will not (in general) match results obtained via the methods described in Section
2.2.1. Upon reflection, the reason is obvious. While we use the matrix [I − A∗ ]−1 to compute
the gross output needed to produce final goods here, we used the Leontief inverse matrix [I −
A]−1 to compute output needed to produce final goods in Section 2.2.1. In Equation 3, output is
decomposed according to where it is ultimately embodied in final goods. In contrast, here we treat
output required to produce input shipments A12 y2 as part of the output needed to produce exports,
which means that the calculation implicitly adjusts down the amount of output need to produce
final goods. Put differently, output is decomposed in part based on where it is embodied in exports,
rather than entirely where it is embodied in final goods.
