                                           ABSTRACT
This paper investigates to what extent psychiatric disorders and mental distress affect labor market
outcomes among ethnic minorities of Latino and Asian descent, most of whom are immigrants.
Using data from the National Latino and Asian American Study, we examine the labor market effects
of meeting diagnostic criteria for any psychiatric disorder in the past 12 months as well as the effects
of psychiatric distress in the past year. Among Latinos, psychiatric disorders and mental distress are
associated with detrimental effects on employment and absenteeism, similar to effects found in
previous analyses of mostly white, American born populations. Among Asians, we find mixed
evidence that psychiatric disorders and mental distress detract from labor market outcomes.

1      Introduction

       Untreated mental illness in the workplace is a critically important and costly problem

worldwide [1]. Psychiatric disorders are highly prevalent, affecting about 26 percent of the US

population in a given year [2], frequently are recurrent and debilitating [3], and can impair

workplace productivity by affecting factors such as memory, concentration, decisiveness,

motivation, and social relations. In the US, a very large portion of the total cost of mental illness

– about 77 million dollars, or 48 percent, in 1992 –has been attributed to reduced workplace

productivity [4-5]. There also is substantial empirical evidence that psychiatric disorders are

associated with a range of specific, adverse labor market outcomes, including unemployment,

reduced labor supply, absenteeism, disability-related work leaves, lower perceived workplace

productivity, and reduced earnings [6-12].

       Much of the recent research on psychiatric disorders and labor market outcomes in the

US context is based on two data sources, the epidemiologic catchment area (ECA) surveys,

which were conducted in five communities during the early 1980’s, and the National

Comorbidity Survey (NCS), which took place on a national scale during the early 1990’s. The

ECA surveys and the NCS are unique in that they are large, population-based surveys that

include diagnostic interviews for a range of psychiatric illnesses. However, these surveys were

administered to English speaking respondents only, and, as a result, they excluded large numbers

of first generation immigrants with limited English proficiency. Although the ECA and NCS do

include English-proficient non-white respondents, sample sizes for ethnic minorities, particularly

Asians, and immigrants are small [13].

       The US labor force, on the other hand, reflects changes in the population as a whole and

is increasingly comprised of Latinos, Asian-Americans, and immigrants. In 2000, Latino and



                                                  3
Asian Americans made up about 16 percent of the US labor force [14]. The number of Latinos

in the labor force is expected to increase by more than 5.5 million by 2010, increasing to 20.9

million workers, compared to 15.4 million workers in 2000. Although the Asian population

remains relatively small, about 3.2 million Asian workers will enter the labor force by 2010 – a

net increase of 44 percent from the year 2000 [14]. Foreign born persons represent 14 percent of

the labor US force [15]. Given the growing size of the Latino, Asian American, and immigrant

populations in the US and their increasing presence in the labor force, it is essential that we

understand how mental health impacts labor market success for these groups.

       This study is the first to investigate the effects of psychiatric disorders and symptoms of

mental distress on labor market outcomes using a national sample of Latino and Asian

Americans. Data come from the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), a

national psychiatric epidemiologic study conducted to measure psychiatric disorders and mental

health service usage in a US representative sample of Asians and Latinos [16]. Unlike most

population-based surveys, the NLAAS provides detailed and high quality diagnostic data on

mental health status, as well as information on demographics, chronic physical health conditions,

and labor market outcomes. We consider the effects of meeting diagnostic criteria for any

psychiatric disorder in the past 12 months, as well as the effects of three broad classes of

disorders (affective disorders, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders). We also estimate

the effect of the K10 measure of psychiatric distress on labor market outcomes. The labor

market outcomes analyzed are current employment status, the number of weeks worked in the

past year among those who are employed, and having at least one work absence in the past

month among those who are employed.




                                                  4
       The findings suggest that among Latinos, having any recent psychiatric disorder is

associated with a decrease in the probability of being employed by about 10 percentage points

for males and by about 23 percentage points for females. The magnitudes of these effects are in

the range of those found for mostly White, native-born populations. Moreover, recent

psychiatric disorders are associated with an increase the probability of at least one work absence

in the past month by 19 percentage points for employed Latino males and by 14 percentage

points for employed Latino females. Higher levels of mental distress are associated with both

unemployment and work absence among Latinos. Psychiatric disorders and distress, however,

do not appear to reduce the number of weeks worked by employed Latinos. Moreover, in the

Asian samples, we find suggestive, but much less consistent, evidence that psychiatric disorders

and mental distress are associated with any of the labor market outcomes studied.

2      Background

       There is considerable evidence from the economics literature that psychiatric disorders

detract from earnings, employment, and work hours. Frank and Gertler [8], for example, use

data on men from the Baltimore ECA and find that mental distress is associated with a 21

percent reduction in earnings. Mental distress in this study is captured by whether or not the

individual has at least two of the following three indications of psychiatric disorder – last year

DSMIII diagnosis, at least four symptoms of psychiatric distress as measured on the General

Health Questionnaire, and at least one self-reported disability day [8].

       Ettner et al. [9] build on this study by using the NCS, which includes a nationally

representative sample, and by addressing the possibility that unobserved factors may confound

an observed relationship between psychiatric disorders and labor market outcomes. They report

that among both men and women, a diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder during the past 12



                                                  5
months is associated with a reduction of about 11 percentage points in the probability of being

employed. Ettner et al. also find some effects of psychiatric disorders on earnings and hours

worked, but these associations were more sensitive to the model specification, sample and

estimation methods used.

       Alexandre and French [6] also find that depression is associated with poor labor market

outcomes, reducing the probability of being employed by about 19 percentage points and

decreasing the number of weeks worked in the past year by 7-8 weeks. The measure of

depression in this study is a self-rated depression scale rather than a DSM diagnosis. Although

this measure has some disadvantages compared to a diagnostic interview, the sample is

ethnically diverse -- it includes low-income adults from Miami, most of whom are African-

American or Latino, and 19 percent of whom are foreign born.

       In addition to having negative effects on employment, labor supply, and earnings, there

also is evidence that psychiatric disorders detract from on-the-job performance by impairing

productivity and causing work absences. Kouzis and Eaton [11], using 1981 data from the

Baltimore ECA, find that psychiatric disorders are strongly associated with work absences

among employed persons. Kessler et al [12] and Kessler and Frank [7] confirm these findings

using data from the NCS and the Midlife Development in the US Survey. Kessler et al. [12] find

that depressed employees report between 1.5 and 3.2 more short-term disability days in the past

month than other employees, defined as full or partial days when the respondent could not work.

Kessler and Frank [7] also show that workers with more than one psychiatric disorder have more

disability days than workers with one or no psychiatric disorders. Berndt et al. [10] offer further

evidence that mental illness interferes with the ability to carry out work functions. Using data




                                                 6
from a clinical trial involving chronically depressed patients, they report that reduction in the

severity of depression improves patient perceptions about work performance.

       The ECA and NCS datasets, which are used in much of the previous research on

psychiatric disorders and labor market outcomes, are community-based and national samples.

The samples do include some English-speaking, racially and ethnically diverse respondents, but

individuals who were not English proficient at the time of the surveys were not sampled. This

restriction may have affected the composition of these samples considerably.

In the NLAAS, about 50 percent of Latinos and 35 percent of Asians rated their English

proficiency as fair or poor, which may have excluded them from English diagnostic assessments

[16]. Moreover, ECA and NCS sample sizes generally do not permit separate estimation of the

effects of psychiatric disorders on labor market outcomes by ethnicity and gender. These data

constraints limit our understanding of how psychiatric disorders affect labor market outcomes

among Latinos and Asian-Americans, ethnic groups in the US that are projected to triple in size

by 2050 [17].

       Estimating models by ethnicity and gender groups, and including non-English proficient

individuals, is important for at least two reasons. First, ethnic minorities and immigrants

generally work in different types of occupations than whites because of historical and

institutional factors, and, in the case of immigrants, because of the context of exit from their

home countries and the time it takes to assimilate into the labor market [18]. In 2003, 35.5

percent of the white employed population had occupations classified as “management,

professional and related,” the occupational class associated with the highest levels of autonomy

and social standing. In 2003, only 17.0 percent of employed Latinos had occupations in this

category, while the number is 43.3 percent among employed Asians. Employed Latinos are much




                                                  7
more likely to work in service sector jobs than employed whites and Asians [19]. Asians are

disproportionately represented in computer and mathematical occupations, as well as in

engineering and life, physical and social science occupations, which reflects the fact that Asians

are more likely than any other racial/ethnic group to have a college degree [20].

Symptoms of a psychiatric disorder may be less likely to visibly affect job performance in

occupations with high levels of autonomy and privacy. On the other hand, high-status jobs may

require more concentration and cognitive ability than lower-status jobs, making it harder to

function when dealing with a mental illness [7].

       Ethnic and racial minorities also may face different labor market consequences of mental

illness than whites because of labor market discrimination. Discrimination may result from place

of birth, language proficiency or accent, skin color or culture. If labor market discrimination

exists, the negative consequences of both having a psychiatric disorder and being an ethnic

minority may be compounded in the labor market. While there is considerable evidence that

inter-racial and ethnic earnings differentials exist, the source of these differentials – and whether

labor market discrimination plays a role – is controversial [21]. While this analysis cannot test

for discrimination, estimating the effects of psychiatric disorders on labor market outcomes in a

large sample of Latino and Asian Americans allows one to gauge whether these groups face

different labor market impacts than majority populations.

3      Methods

       In the human capital framework, individuals embody a stock of productive capital that

determines their productivity in the market. This stock is accumulated throughout the lifetime

through schooling, training, work and other experiences [22-24]. The onset of a psychiatric

illness, particularly during youth, may interfere with the process of human capital accumulation,



                                                   8
such as by disrupting educational plans. In this way, psychiatric disorders may affect

employment and performance on the job indirectly, via reduced education [25]. Psychiatric

illness, however, also may affect job prospects and productivity directly through its effects on

motivation, judgment, cognition and social interactions (see Chapter 2, Mental Health: A Report

of the Surgeon General for signs and symptoms of common disorders [26]). We seek to estimate

this latter effect – the direct effect of current psychiatric disorders on labor market outcomes

among adults – while controlling for other human capital pathways through which mental illness

may affect labor market outcomes indirectly.

       Guided by the above theoretical framework, we adopt models of the following type:

        E i = α + X i β + MH i δ + ε i                                                        (1)


       where Ei is a measure of individual i’s labor market outcomes,       is an intercept, Xi is a

vector of observable exogenous individual characteristics that may affect labor market success,

MH is a measures of psychiatric illness, and   i   is an error term.   and are the unknown

parameters of interest to be estimated.

       Empirically, estimating the effect of psychiatric illness on labor market outcomes ( ) is

complicated by two factors. First, the causation between psychiatric disorders and labor market

outcomes may run in the opposite direction, with employment factors influencing mental

distress. Job loss, for example, may lead to subsequent mental health problems [27]. Second,

the relationship between psychiatric disorders and labor market outcomes may be confounded by

an unmeasured, causal factor, such as a stressful life event. It may be difficult to measure some

important correlates of mental illness using secondary data, and these unmeasured correlates of

mental illness also may affect labor market outcomes directly. In both of these cases, estimating




                                                    9
the coefficients using standard methods such as OLS would violate a central assumption

underlying the classical linear regression model framework, which is that the right-hand

side variables should be exogenous with respect to the error term [28].

       We use three approaches to deal with this problem. Our first approach is to use data on

observed characteristics to proxy unobserved characteristics to the fullest extent possible.

Specific details about the covariates included in the models are described in the next section of

the paper. Notably, the NLAAS includes information on chronic physical health conditions,

which frequently co-exist with psychiatric disorders and could confound an observed association

between psychiatric disorders and adverse labor market outcomes [29]. We use a standard OLS

model for continuous dependent variables, and a standard probit model for binary outcomes to

estimate (1).

       Our second empirical approach is to estimate standard OLS and probit models that

include a measure of any prior psychiatric illness in addition to a measure of last year psychiatric

illness or distress, which is the main covariate of interest. Prior psychiatric condition is defined

as the existence of any lifetime diagnosis with most recent symptoms exhibited prior to the

previous year. This measure is a proxy for unobserved, indirect channels through which

previous mental illness may affect current labor market outcomes. Regardless of an individual’s

current mental status, prior symptoms may affect current work performance indirectly. For

example, previous mental health problems may have interrupted the development of social skills

that are important in the workplace. Even our detailed set of covariates would not account for

this factor, and it could confound an observed association between recent mental illness and

labor market outcomes. When we include both recent and prior measures of psychiatric illness

in the same model, we essentially are isolating the impact of incident mental illness or distress,



                                                 10
above and beyond one’s previous experiences with mental illness, on current labor market

outcomes.

       These two approaches use observed data to proxy unobserved factors that might

confound an association between recent psychiatric disorders and labor market outcomes. The

methods do not directly address the problem of reverse causality. Also, important correlates of

psychiatric disorders and labor market outcomes still may be left out of the model. For this

reason, we implement a third approach, which is to use empirical methods that directly address

the possibility that unobserved factors may exist that are associated with both psychiatric

disorders/distress and labor market outcomes.

       Where the labor market outcome measure is continuous, we use the two-stage least

squares (TSLS) method:

       Stage 1: MH i = α 2 + X i β 2 + Z iξ + ε 2i

                                          ∧
       Stage 2: Ei = α 1 + X i β 1 + MH i δ + ε 1i                                            (2)

                     ∧
       in which MH i is the predicted value from estimating psychiatric disorder on observable

individual characteristics (Xi) and instrumental variables (Zi) in stage 1.

       In the case of binary labor market outcome and psychiatric disorder variables, we

use a bivariate probit model:

        Ei* = α 1 + X i β 1 + MH i δ + ε 1i
        MH i* = α 2 + X i β 2 + Z iξ + ε 2i


        Ei = 1 if E i* ≥ 0




                                                     11
        MH i = 1 if MH i* ≥ 0                                                                   (3)


       Under the bivariate probit model, employment (Ei) and psychiatric illness (MHi) are

simultaneously specified by the following likelihood function [28]:

        Pr( Ei = 1, MH i = 1) = Φ( X i β 1 + MH i δ , X i β 2 + Z iξ , ρ )                      (4)


       where      is the bivairate cumulative distribution function and ρ = cov[ε ,η ] is the

correlation coefficient. The model is estimated using maximum likelihood. (For recent studies

using the bivariate probit model, see MacDonald and Shields [30], Evans and Schwab [31], and

Goldman [32]).

       The practical challenge of implementing the TSLS method and the bivariate probit model

is that in order to identify the labor market outcome equation, there must be at least one variable

that affects mental illness, but that is also exogenous and not directly related to labor market

outcomes (Zi). The identifying variable or variables should be reasonably good predictors of

mental illness. In the case of TSLS, a low first stage F-statistic for the identifying instrumental

variables may suggest that TSLS estimates are no better than biased OLS estimates [33-36].

Similarly, if the identifying variables are poor predictors of mental illness, the bivariate probit

model does not work well, yielding imprecise estimates (see Rashad and Kaestner [37]).

       Previous work on mental health (including substance abuse) and labor market outcomes

have employed a large range of identifying variables, mostly used in the context of instrumental

variables estimation. Some examples are parental alcohol dependency [38] or parental history of

mental health problems [9]; number of childhood psychiatric disorders [9]; long-term non-acute

illnesses such as asthma or diabetes [30, 39]; religiosity [6, 30, 39-41]; social support [6, 42]; and

state-level alcohol and illicit drug policies and prices [43-44]. Following the above literature, we



                                                       12
test and use three identifying instruments in our study (Zi): (1) the number of psychiatric

disorders with early onset (before age 18); (2) whether the respondent attends religious services

at least weekly; and (3) whether the respondent often uses spiritual or religious means (such as

praying, meditation, or speaking to a religious provider) to handle problems.

       The number of psychiatric disorders with onset before age 18 should be a good predictor

of current psychiatric disorders because of the chronic nature of psychiatric illness. Early

psychiatric problems may interfere with schooling, and this factor in turn is likely to impact labor

market outcomes as an adult. However, after controlling for education and a range of other

covariates, early onset of mental illness would not be expected to have a direct effect on labor

market outcomes. We use religiosity as a measure of individual social capital. Studies have

shown that higher social capital is correlated with better mental health [39, 45-48].

       One limitation of our study is that all three identifying variables are personal

characteristics, and it is difficult to make a strong theoretical argument that they are exogenous.

For example, as Alexandre & French [6] note, it is possible that religious beliefs directly impact

work habits, such as the number of hours worked. It is also possible that employment and

business information is conveyed through networks developed through church activities, which

may help one’s career. We deal with this problem by carefully assessing whether the identifying

variables as a group are reasonably strong predictors of mental illness, and if they can be validly

excluded from the labor market outcomes equation. Moreover, because we lack a strong

theoretical justification for the exogeneity of the identifying variables, we interpret the TSLS and

bivariate probit results with caution, and we do not emphasize these findings. Instead, we focus

on the standard estimation results and use the TSLS and bivariate probit findings as a check on

the main results of the paper.

4      The National Latino and Asian American Study

       Data used in the study come from The National Latino and Asian American Study

(NLAAS), a 2002-2003 survey of non-institutionalized Asian and Latin American adults residing

in the coterminous United States. The goal of the survey was to measure psychiatric diagnoses

and mental health service usage among Asian and Latino Americans. The NLAAS is a

nationally representative household sample of 4,864 individuals ages 18 and over, including

2,554 Latinos, 2,095 Asians, and 215 Whites (who were not included in this paper). NLAAS

interviews were conducted in English, Spanish, Chinese (Mandarin), Tagalog and Vietnamese,

based on the respondents’ language preferences. Originally, all interviews had been planned to

be conducted in-person, but due to budgetary constraints, approximately 1,000 interviews were

conducted by telephone. The weighted response rates for the NLAAS samples were: 73.2

percent for the total sample; 75.5 percent for the Latino Sample; and 65.6 percent for the Asian

sample [49]. We limit the analysis samples to 2,228 Latino respondents (1,016 males and 1,212

females) and 1,818 Asians (864 males and 954 females) between 18 and 65 years old who are

not in school at the time of the survey. All models are estimated separately by gender and broad

ethnic group (Latino or Asian) with techniques that acknowledge the complex survey design. A

fully interacted model of all covariates interacted with Latino ethnicity empirically supports our

estimation based on ethnicity specific samples. There are statistically significant interactions

between Latino and many key predictors of mental disorders, such as age, marital status, chronic

health conditions and English language proficiency (results not shown).

       We consider the following three, self-reported labor market outcomes as dependent

variables in this analysis: (1) a dummy variable indicating whether or not the respondent is

currently employed; (2) among employed individuals, the number of weeks during which the



                                                14
respondent was employed in the past year; and (3) among employed individuals, whether or not

the respondent missed at least one day of work in the past month. The employment indicator

was created from a survey question regarding the respondent’s work situation “as of today.”

Employed persons include respondents who work full or part time and respondents who report

that they are self-employed. In the employment models, the omitted category combines

individuals who are unemployed with individuals who are out of the labor force, such as

homemakers, early retirees and discouraged workers. (Students and persons over 65 are

excluded from the analysis samples.) In order to distinguish the effects of mental illness on

unemployment and out of labor force status, we experiment with some multinomial logit models

that allow for three, qualitative categories as the dependent variable (out of labor force,

unemployed, with employed as the omitted category). Results from this analysis are discussed

later in the paper.

        The NLAAS contains detailed information on psychiatric disorders that were collected by

trained, lay interviewers using the World Mental Health Survey Initiative version of the World

Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI). This fully

structured diagnostic instrument is based on the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual

of Mental Disorders, Version 4 (DSM-IV). The CIDI has been tested extensively for test-retest

reliability and validity [50-51]. The NLAAS includes prior, 12 month and 30 days diagnoses for

a range of psychiatric disorders. The survey also includes scales of mental distress [51] and

psychiatric impairment [52].

        Our main measure of recent psychiatric disorder is a dummy variable indicating whether

or not the respondent met diagnostic criteria for any psychiatric disorder in the past 12 months.

Any psychiatric disorder includes the following diagnoses: (1) major depression; (2) dysthymia;




                                                 15
(3) agoraphobia; (4) generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); (5) panic attack; (6) panic disorder; (7)

social phobia; (8) alcohol abuse; (9) alcohol dependence; (10) illicit drug abuse; (11) illicit drug

dependence; (12) post-traumatic stress disorder; (13) anorexia; and (3) bulimia. We also

consider the effects of three broad classes of psychiatric disorders separately (any affective

disorder, any anxiety disorder, any substance use disorder – see Table 1 for definitions of these

disorder classes), and the effects of mental distress, on labor market outcomes. To capture

mental distress, we use the respondent’s continuous score on the K10, a 10 question scale of non-

specific psychological distress (see Kessler et al. [53] for a description of this scale). The K10

has demonstrated, strong psychometric properties in demographic sub-samples [53]. Because of

multicollinearity between the psychiatric measures, we include each of the diagnosis and mental

distress measures separately in the models.

       Our models include a rich set of covariates that are intended to control for personal

characteristics that may be correlated with both labor market outcomes and mental illness. These

variables are: (1) sub-ethnicity (within the broader Latino and Asian categories); (2) age in years;

(3) education (high school, at least some college, with high school dropout as the baseline); (4)

marital status (married/cohabiting, widowed/divorced/separated with single as the baseline); (5)

the number of children in the household; (6) whether the respondent is not English proficient; (7)

immigrant; (8) US citizen; (9) a set of dummy indicators for current physical health conditions –

asthma, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, cardiovascular conditions; and

(10) the state unemployment rate in the interview year. The sub-ethnicity variables for the

Latino samples are: Puerto Rican; Cuban; and Mexican, with Other Latino as the baseline. For

the Asian samples, the sub-ethnicity variables are: Chinese; Vietnamese; Filipino, with Other

Asian as the baseline. The identifying variables used in the bivariate probit and TSLS models are




                                                 16
two dummy indicators of frequent religious attendance (at least weekly) and often using religious

means to handle life’s problems, as well as a continuous measure of the number of psychiatric

disorders with onset during childhood.

       As described earlier, in some models we include measures of both prior and current

disorder. Prior disorder is measured by a dummy variable indicating whether the respondent met

lifetime diagnostic criteria for any psychiatric disorder, but whose most recent symptoms

occurred prior to the past year. Thus, this variable excludes disorders and symptoms that

occurred in the past 12 months. It is important to note that in the models where both prior and

recent disorder measures are included as covariates, the number of incident cases is relatively

small in some cases (e.g. number of cases where a respondent without any prior disorder

develops a disorder in the past 12 months). The number of incident cases was 107 for Latino

females, 48 for Latino males, 38 for Asian females, and 33 for Asian males.

       Observations were dropped if they had missing information on employment status (n=2),

marital status (n = 2), English proficiency (n=4), immigrant (n=2), US citizen (n=7), state

unemployment rate (n = 2), religious service attendance (n = 14), reliance on religious means to

deal with problems (n = 4), and K10 distress score (n = 1). In models of absences and labor

supply, we also dropped respondents with missing information on work absences and the number

of weeks worked.

       Across the samples, 81 to 84 percent of males and 56 to 64 percent of females are

currently employed (Table 1). In the female analysis samples, 27 to 36 percent of respondents

are out of the labor force, which includes individuals who are homemakers, retired, disabled or

not looking for work. Approximately 11 to 12 percent of males report being out of the labor

force. Among employed respondents, the number of weeks worked in the past year ranged from




                                                17
about 47 to 50 weeks. In the male samples, 20 to 25 percent of respondents reported missing at

least one day of work in the past month; among females, 26 to 27 percent responded missing at

least one day of work in the past month.

       The unemployment rate is about 8-9 percent in the female samples, and ranges from 5 to

8 percent in the male samples. The sample unemployment rates are consistent with national

unemployment rates for Latinos during the time period when the NLAAS data were collected. In

January 2003, the unemployment rate for Latino women age 20 and over was 8.4 percent, and

the unemployment rate for Latino males age 20 and over was 7.5 percent [19]. Nationally, the

unemployment rate for Asian males was 6 percent and the unemployment rate for females was 5

percent in 2002.

       Recent psychiatric conditions are relatively common in all four samples, with the highest

rates among Latino females. Among Latino females, 17 percent meet diagnostic criteria for at

least one psychiatric disorder in the past 12 months – a large proportion of these women are

experiencing affective disorders (9 percent) and/or anxiety disorders (12 percent), but very few

have a diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence (1 percent). Among Latino males, 14 percent

have a 12 month DSM-IV diagnosis for at least one disorder, with 6 percent experiencing

affective disorders, 7 percent having an anxiety disorder, and 5 percent having a diagnosis of

substance abuse or dependence. In the Asian samples, rates of psychiatric disorders are lower (9

percent of males and 10 percent of females report any past year psychiatric disorder), but the

degree of mental distress, as measured by the K10, is similar to what is experienced in the Latino

samples.

       All four samples consist of individuals who mainly are of working age (25 to 64 years

old) because persons over 65 years old and students were excluded from the analysis. The




                                                18
largest ethnic group among the Latinos is the Mexican Americans; in the Asian samples, the

largest ethnic group is Chinese Americans. In the Latino samples, about 42 percent of male and

43 percent of female respondents have less than a high school education (not shown in Table 1),

and 59-78 percent of the Latino and Asian samples are immigrants. These characteristics are

very different from those of other samples used to study psychiatric disorders and labor market

outcomes. For example, in the NCS sample used by Ettner et al. (1997), only 13 percent of

females and 16 percent of males had less than a high school education, and 6 to 7 percent were

immigrants. Individuals who are foreign born and have less than a high school education are

likely to face quite different job circumstances, and possibly different labor market consequences

of mental illness, compared to American born, more educated workers.

5      Results

       Tables 2-5 show estimation results from employment, weeks worked and work absence

models for the four samples (Latino males, Latino females, Asian males, Asian females). In

each table, Panel A shows results from three models where any current psychiatric disorder is the

main covariate of interest. The first model is a standard probit model, the second model is a

standard probit model with prior disorder included as a covariate, and the third model is either a

bivariate probit model (in the case of a binary dependent variable), or a TSLS model (in the case

of a continuous dependent variable). These models directly account for the possibility that the

association between psychiatric disorders and labor market outcomes may be confounded by

unobserved factors. Panel B in each table (Tables 2-5) shows the same set of model results from

the analysis of the K10 mental distress score.




                                                 19
5.1    Main Findings for Latino Males and Females

       Among Latino males, the standard probit model suggests that having a psychiatric

disorder in the past year is associated with a statistically significant, 10 percentage point

reduction in the probability of being currently employed (about a 12 percent reduction at the

sample mean employment rate of 81 percent) (Table 2, Panel A, Column 1). Including prior

disorder as a covariate (Table 2, Panel A, Column 2) does not appreciably change the magnitude

or statistical significance of this effect, and estimating mental health and employment equations

simultaneously (Table 2, Panel A, Column 3) decreases the magnitude of the result to an 8

percentage point (about a 10 percent at the sample mean) reduction. The magnitude of this effect

of psychiatric disorders on the probability of employment for Latino males is very similar to

findings of Ettner et al. [9], who report an 11 percentage point reduction for men (about a 12

percent reduction at the sample mean employment rate of 91 percent) using the NCS sample.

       Among employed Latino men, psychiatric disorders do not have a statistically significant

association with the number of weeks worked in the past year (Table 2, Panel A, Columns 4-6).

This also is the case when the TSLS method is used to account for the potential endogeneity of

psychiatric disorders (Table 2, Panel A, Column 6), and when broad disorder classes are

considered separately (results not shown). Having a recent psychiatric disorder, however, does

appear to increase the probability of having at least one work absence in the past month among

employed Latino men (Table 2, Panel A, Columns 7-9). The magnitude of this effect ranges

from 15 to 19 percentage points (an increase of 60 to 76 percent at the sample mean of 25

percent), depending on the model specification. Although the effect loses statistical significance

in the bivariate probit model, the estimated rho in this model is close to zero and statistically




                                                  20
insignificant at the 0.05 level, suggesting that estimating the mental health and labor market

equations jointly is not advantageous.

       Thus far, this analysis focuses on estimating the association between DSM IV psychiatric

diagnoses, as measured through diagnostic interviews, and labor market outcomes among Latino

men. Diagnostic interviews have become standard tools in psychiatric epidemiology [53], and

allow us to compare results with other analyses that have used the same measures. The measures

used up to this point, however, are dummy variables, indicating whether or not the respondent

meets the threshold for diagnosis, and are not informative in providing information about the

severity of the condition. For this reason, we also consider the effects of the severity of

symptoms on labor market outcomes using the K10 measure, which is a continuous scale of non-

specific psychological distress. We use the same approach as before and estimate models with

and without prior psychiatric disorder. Because we have a binary outcome (such as employment)

and a continuous outcome (the K10 measure), we use TSLS methods for all models and estimate

linear probability models in cases where the dependent variable is binary.

       Panel B of Table 2 shows that for Latino males, higher K10 score is associated with

statistically significant, lower probability of being employed and statistically significant, higher

probability of having a work absence in the past month. The TSLS results are consistent in sign

with the OLS findings, but they lose statistical significance at conventional levels. The

identifying instruments performed well -- they were good predictors of the K10 score, and

passed the overidentification test.

       Findings for Latino females were similar to those of Latino males, but the effects for

females are larger in magnitude and more robust across the models relative to the male findings

(Table 3). Having a recent psychiatric disorder is associated with a 23 percentage point




                                                 21
reduction in the probability of being employed (this reduction translates into a 41 percent

reduction at the sample mean employment rate of 56 percent). The effect remains large and

statistically significant in the bivariate probit model (Table 3, Panel A, Column 3). The size of

this effect is larger than what Ettner et al. [9] report for women in the NCS – they find that

psychiatric disorder is associated with an 11 percentage point, or about a 14 percent (at the

sample mean), reduction in employment probability. Among employed Latino females, current

disorder also is associated with an increased probability of reporting at least one work absence in

the past month. While this effect is marginally statistically significant in some cases, having a

disorder appears to appreciably increase the probability of work absence – the size of this effect

is 13-18 percentage points, about a 48-67 percent increase at the sample mean absence rate of 27

percent.

        As seen for Latino males, higher levels of mental distress among Latino females, as

measured by the K10, are associated with statistically significant, adverse effects on the

probability of employment and work absences in the past month (Table 3, Panel B). These

effects persist across models, although they lose some statistical significance in the TSLS models

(Table 2, Panel B, Columns 3 and 9). Like Latino males, Latino females with current psychiatric

disorders do not appear to work fewer weeks than similar individuals who do not meet diagnostic

criteria for current disorders.

5.2     Main Findings for Asian Males and Females

        Among Asian males, having a current psychiatric disorder is associated with a 13

percentage point reduction in the probability of employment, which is a 15 percent reduction at

the sample mean of 84 percent (Table 3, Panel A, Column 1). The magnitude of this effect is

similar to the 12 percent reductions we find for Latino males and the sample of mostly white,




                                                 22
native born, NCS males used by Ettner et al. This effect, however, is less robust for Asian males

that it was for Latino males. Including the prior psychiatric disorder covariate (Table 3, Panel A,

Column 2) , and explicitly modeling correlation between unobserved factors using the bivariate

probit model (Table 3, Panel A, Column 3), reduce the size and statistical significance of the

effect.

          Similarly, in the work absence models (Table 3, Panel A, Columns 7-9), having a current

psychiatric disorder is associated with a small, statistically insignificant increase in the

probability of having an absence. This effect does not persist when prior psychiatric disorder is

included as a covariate, or when the bivariate probit model is used to model correlation between

unobserved factors. In Panel B of Table 3, we see that higher levels of mental distress are

associated with some detrimental effects on employment and labor supply. These effects,

however, are small and not statistically significant in many cases.

          In Table 5, we find an even more inconsistent pattern for Asian females. The measure of

any psychiatric disorder has a negative, but statistically insignificant association with the

probability of being employed and the number of weeks worked (Table 5, Panel A, Columns 1-

6). There is a positive association but not statistically significant association between psychiatric

disorders and absences (Table 5, Panel A, Columns 7-9). Panel B of Table 5 shows suggestive

but small and statistically insignificant effects of mental distress on labor market outcomes for

Asian females. In sum, these results for Asian females are consistent with the results found for

Asian males, but not consistent with those for Latino females, which showed that psychiatric

disorders detract significantly from labor market outcomes.




                                                  23
5.3     Further Analyses and Sensitivity Checks

        For brevity, we discuss in the text but do not show results from some sensitivity analyses

including: analyses of specific disorder classes; analyses in which the out of labor force

respondents are considered as a separate category; and findings from statistical tests related to

TSLS and bivariate probit estimation.

5.3.1   Considering out of labor force as a separate outcome

        In our analysis of employment, we initially ignored the distinction between respondents

who reported they were out of the labor force, and respondents who stated they were

unemployed. Both of these categories were combined as the baseline category. To gauge

whether separating these groups affects our interpretation of the results, we experimented with

multinomial logit models, which allow for a polychotomous outcome and are estimated using

maximum likelihood. This model distinguishes respondents who are unemployed and looking

for work from respondents who are out of the labor force. The out of labor force category

includes some early retirees and disabled individuals, but it mostly includes individuals who

were not looking for a job and did not work at all in the past 52 weeks for unspecified reasons.

We focus on Latino males, Latino females, and Asian females -- the three samples in which we

found statistically significant effects of psychiatric disorders and mental distress on labor market

outcomes in the main analysis.

        For Latino males and females, we find that having a psychiatric disorder has larger and

more robust effects on being out of the labor force than on being unemployed, but mental

distress has similar effects on both the unemployment and out of labor force outcomes. Among

Asian males, the opposite is true – we see that having a psychiatric disorder increases the

probability of unemployment, and not being out of the labor force. For Asian males, however,




                                                 24
mental distress is associated with being out of the labor force rather than unemployment. Our

data are not detailed enough for a comprehensive analysis of this issue, since we only know the

exact reason for being out of the labor force for a sub-set of respondents. However, it does

suggest that among Latinos, psychiatric disorders are associated with leaving the labor force

entirely rather than a temporary bout of unemployment, while for Asian males, the opposite is

true.

5.3.3   Effects of specific disorder classes

        As another sensitivity check, we estimated models of employment, labor supply and

absenteeism where dummy indicators for current affective disorders, current anxiety disorders,

and current substance use disorders were considered separately, instead of using a dummy

indicator of any current mental disorder. We also estimated the multinomial logit models with

these specific disorder classes as covariates. In general, the effects of these broad diagnostic

groups were consistent with the main findings, although in some cases we lose precision. Again,

we focus on Latino males and females and Asian males, since we did not find evidence in the

main analysis of detrimental effects of mental disorders for Asian females.

        Affective disorders appear to be more debilitating to labor market outcomes than anxiety

disorders, particularly for males. The findings indicate: (1) affective disorders are associated

with lower probability of being employed in all three samples; and (2) affective disorders are

associated with being out of the labor force, and not with temporary unemployment, for Latino

males and females. Anxiety disorders have less consistent effects across the samples. Among

Latino males and females, anxiety disorders are associated with being out of the labor force;

however, this effect is not evident for Asian males, and anxiety disorders are associated with

work absences only in the Latino female sample. In the case of substance use disorders, this




                                                 25
disorder class was associated with being out of the labor force for Latino males and females, and

was associated with being unemployed for Asian males.

5.3.4   Empirical performance of identifying variables

        In all but 1 of the 8 bivariate probit models estimated, the estimated correlation between

the error terms in the labor market outcome and psychiatric disorder equations was not

statistically significant at conventional levels. This finding suggests that in general there is no

advantage of the bivariate probit model over the standard probit model in this analysis. We note

that this conclusion hinges on the validity of the identifying assumptions made. As an informal

test, we re-estimated bivariate probit models of employment that included the three identifying

variables (number of early disorders, religious support, religious frequency) in both the

psychiatric disorder and labor market equations. The religious frequency and support variables

were statistically significant (at the 0.05 level) predictors of labor market outcomes in the Latino

female model for absenteeism, which reduces confidence in our identification strategy in this

case. However, using only the number of early disorders variable to identify the model (and

including the two religion variables in the employment equation) yielded very similar results.

        In the TSLS models, the identifying variables perform moderately well in terms of

predictive power. In all but two models, in which the F statistic was 6 and 8 respectively,

the F statistic on the identifying variables ranged from 9 to 88. The identifying variables

passed the over-identification test at the 0.05 level in all but two cases. In these models,

however, the identifying restrictions passed the over-identification test when the religion

variables were not used as identifying instruments, and the findings were insensitive to this

modification.




                                                 26
6      Conclusions

       This paper examines the labor market consequences of psychiatric disorders in a

population that has not been studied to date – ethnic minorities of Latino and Asian descent,

most of whom are immigrants. As these demographic groups become a larger portion of the

workforce, much more research is needed on their labor market experiences. The availability of

the NLAAS, which measures psychiatric disorders and labor market outcomes in a national

sample of Latino and Asian Americans, allows us to study the labor market consequences of

mental illness in these demographic groups for the first time.

       In this study, we find somewhat different results for Latinos and Asians. Psychiatric

disorders and mental distress have appreciable, negative associations with the probability of

being employed, and large, positive associations with work absences for Latino males and

females. While mental distress impacts both unemployment and being out of the labor force

among Latinos, meeting diagnostic criteria for a disorder is associated with being out of the labor

force, rather than being unemployed. As a whole, the findings indicate that mental illness

imposes labor market costs on Latinos that are at least as large and as important as those found in

studies based on mostly white samples. The similarity between NLAAS Latino and NCS males

[9] in the effects of psychiatric disorder on employment (12 percent reductions for both NCS

males and NLAAS Latino males) is striking, given the large differences in education, immigrant

status, English language proficiency and occupation.

       The effect of having a recent psychiatric disorder is associated with a 15 percent

reduction in the probability of employment for Asian males, which again is similar to what we

find for Latino males and what previous researchers have reported for NCS males. However,

particularly among female respondents, having a recent psychiatric disorder and symptoms of



                                                27
mental distress appear to have smaller and less consistent impacts on labor market outcomes for

Asians compared to Latinos. This differential effect of psychiatric disorders on employment

outcomes between Latinos and Asians might be linked to differential coping resources afforded

by greater education. Compared to Latinos, Asian Americans in NLAAS are 1.8 times more

likely to have a college degree, which may facilitate maintaining productivity and decreased

likelihood of disability, even in the presence of psychiatric disorders. Another potential

explanation for the limited effect of psychiatric illness on employment outcomes in Asians could

be their higher proportion working in professional and managerial occupations (45.2 percent)

than Latinos (16.8 percent) [54], with more discretion to be less productive or unproductive

rather than take a sick day. A third possibility is cultural differences between Latinos and Asians

in their reactions to mental illness. Asians have been found to show lower levels of absenteeism

that has been explained as due to internalization of Confucianism upon work values [55]. There

is some evidence that Asians are less likely than individuals from majority groups to endorse

illness, stress, and depression as legitimate reasons for absence [56]. These work values may

possibly restrain Asians with mental disorders from missing work, for stigma of being labeled as

mentally ill by their employers or coworkers.

       A primary limitation of this study is we cannot definitively address the potential

endogeneity of psychiatric disorders. Although we attempt to do so using bivariate probit and

TSLS models, our identification strategy is difficult to defend theoretically and does not perform

well empirically for Latino females. Thus, we emphasize our standard results, stressing that our

rich data source substantially reduces the possibility of unobserved confounding variables. The

NLAAS was designed specifically to capture the most important determinants of mental

disorders for Latino and Asian populations. In particular, we are able to control both prior




                                                 28
mental illness and for comorbid physical health conditions, both of which were likely to be

important confounding variables in this analysis.

       Our results suggest that there may be important labor market benefits associated with

public health policies targeted at the prevention and effective treatment of mental illnesses in

ethnic minority groups. In the US, there is ample evidence of health care disparities, or unequal

treatment of patients based on race and ethnicity that is not related to need for services or patient

preferences [57]. Wells et al. [58], for example, find that that despite similar levels of

psychiatric need between Latinos and non-Latinos, Latinos were much more likely than non-

Latinos to report not receiving mental health services (26 percent versus 12 percent). Our

findings suggest that eliminating these kinds of disparities and expanding access to services may

have significant labor market benefits – not just for majority populations, as has been

demonstrated, but also for Asian and Latino Americans. We recommend that future research

continue to focus on these demographic groups and as well as other under-studied and under-

served populations in order to fully understand the labor market benefits of preventing and

treating mental illness.
