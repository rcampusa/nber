                  Youth Employment in the Seventies:
             The Changing Circumstances of Young Adults



                                  ABSTRACT


    This paper examines the changing employment patterns for young
men and women aged 16 to 24 over the 1970s and pays particular attention
to the widening racial differences. Between 1970 and 1980 employment
rates for both black men and women in this age range fell roughly 14
points relative to those of whites. Macroeconomic conditions, the
reduction in the size of the military, changinci schooling patterns,
family structure, fertility patterns, and several public policies, are
all examined in an attempt to understand the patterns of the seventies.
     The conclusion reached is that perhaps one-half of the diverging
racial employment patterns can be explained" by the variables we
examine. For young men the most important forces appear to be the
changing structure of the military, worsening macroeconomic conditions,
and increased school enrollment among blacks. For women, the military
is less important, of course, but shifts in family structure and
fertility are rather imDortant.

              THE CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUNG ADULTS

                                     by

                    David T. Eliwood and David A. Wise


     Virtually all 16 year old Americans live at home, are supported by

                                          wearily to school, avoid work, and
one or both of their parents, trudge

are intrigued by members of the opposite sex. Within less than ten

years, much of that changes. By age 24 most live independently. With
                                   since left school. Most are married;
a few exceptions, they have long

many have babies.

     The transition from teenager to adult includes an almost overwhelm-

ing concentration of major events.     Two-thirds of first marriages and

more than half of first births happen during this period. Less than

one-third of twenty year olds will be living in the same house four years

 later. Teenagers average two jobs per year; by age 24, they are likely

 to be in one which will last ten years.

      For most youth, the transition from full-time schooling while living

 at home to independent household formation and labor market participation

 occurs without great difficulty. For a few, however, the period entails

 long spells out of school and without work. In the past decade there has
                                                                Indeed, in the
 been increasing concern about youth employment problems.

 l97Os teenage unemployment emerged as a major issue in the public domain.

 Our goal is to survey the evidence on recent trends in youth labor market

 experiences and to explore possible explanations of these trends. The

 scope of this paper extends well beyond teenage unemployment, however.

         We focus on youth aged 16-24 and we explore employment primarily.

  Employment rates differ among youth for many reasons. National economic

  fluctuatjons, age, military service, household formation, parenting

 responsibilities, and family background all influence employment. We

 report differences in employment patterns
                                               across groups and trends in
 these patterns over time, particularly in the l970s. Where possible we

 explore causes and effects of these patterns and trends.

        The wide variety of critical changes which occur between ages 16

 and 24 create particularly extreme
                                       heterogeneity in this group. The

 timing of school leaving, marriaae, childbearing, and serious job search

 differ greatly among youth. And each of these has important labor market

 consequences and may in turn be influenced by labor market conditions.

 The diversity also complicates interpretation of labor market statistics.

        Virtually all middle aged men are working or looking for work. Non-

employment is relatively easy to interpret. The situation is slightly

more complex for women of a similar age because the group which is not

working is composed both of those actively seeking work and a large

number who have other responsibilities which preclude work. These

persons are usually termed unemployed and not in the labor force respec-

tively.

        Normally the unemployment rate is defined as the number of unem-

ployed divided by the labor force (those who are working or are seeking

work). The employment rate is the ratio of employed persons to the

total   population   (not just the labor force). In principle the unemploy-

ment rate measures the difficulty of getting work, that is, the propor-

tion who are looking for work but can't find it.     The employment ratio
                                     —3—




simply captures the proportion of the population who have jobs.

     For those who are still in school, work may be sporadic and part—

time duting the school year, full-time but temporary during the summer.

Those seeking work will include persons who desire spending money and

those who need support to continue in school .   By contrast, out of

school youth presumably are interested in longer term employment at

least eventually. Still it may be hard to distinguish those who are

diligently engaged in job search from those with relatively weak labor

market attachment. The unemployed may include some who are not seriously

interested in working. The not in the labor force group may include some

persons who have become discouraged by fruitless job search.

     The confusion created by the dynamics of youth schooling and work

can be illustrated by considering two measures of unemployment. In

early 1976, the official Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment rate

was 20 percent for persons aged 16 to 19, yet just 4 percent of this

group was both out of school and out of work. The 20 percent figure

indicated that one-fifth of those who were in the labor force (employed

or seeking work) were unable to find work. Both numerator and denomi-

nator include persons enrolled in school along with those who are not.

Almost half of teenagers classified as unemployed are also in school.

If we confined our attention to those not in school, we would still have

an unemployment rate of close to 20 percent because we would exclude

both employed and unemployed persons who are in school. The 20 percent

figure may well reflect the employment difficulty faced by those young-

sters who have left school before most of their peers. It does not

indicate that being out of school and without employment is a serious
                                     -4-




problem for most teenagers. Most teenagers are in school. What might be

regarded as the most serious social ill, being both out of school and

unemployed, touches just 4 percent of youth at any one moment. Certainly

these figures do not indicate that the bulk of all teenagers are in des-

perate straits.

     We shall concentrate on employment rates (employment to population

ratios), avoiding for the most part the difficult distinctions between

the unemployed and those out of the labor force. Employment is a conve-

nient bottom line, an important indicator to compare across groups and

over time.


EMPLOYMEI\IT PATTER1S


     Figure 1 shows the civilian employment rates between 1955 and 1979

for all persons aged 16-24, by sex and race. It is these patterns we

seek to understand. Employment rates for the four groups and the changes

over time are quite different:

          • Employment rates for white males are the highest
            and have been relatively stable over time, rising
            slightly in the seventies.

          • Employment rates for black males were comparable
            to those of whites in 1954, but by 1979 the gap
            had widened to over 20 percentage points.
            Moreover the largest declines came during the
            seventies.

          • Employment rates for white females rose gradually
            over the sixties and jumped quite dramatically
            during the 1970s.

          • Employment rates for black females have remained
            low and largely unchanged over the period.

     For both men and women the gap between blacks and whites widened

roughly 14 points between 1969 and 1979. For males the widening reflected

primarily a fall in black employment; for females, a rise in white employ-

ment.

        In the remainder of the paper, we explore a wide variety of potential

explanations of these differences and trends. We have chosen to address

six major issues:

             • Demography

             • The Military

             • Schooling

             • Household Formation

             • Family Background

             • Public Policy

        We have made no attempt to fully disentangle the multitude of possible

interactions or to report the sometimes large literature surrounding each

issue. Instead, we have chosen to rely primarily on published data and

simple tabulations of the 1976 Survey of Income and Education and to

report the trends and patterns which appear on these data. We seek to

decompose the overall changes into the effects of these individual influ-

ences by asking, for example, the hypothetical question of how much

employment rates would have changed had one variable alone changed.

Inevitably, this sort of calculation ignores interactions and it often

raises issues of causality. For example, did changing family structures

reduce employment or did poorer employment prospects influence family

income?


DEMOGRAPHY

    The baby boom has come of age. Between 1960 and 1980 the number of
                                  —7—



youth aged 15-24 rose from 12 percent of the population to over 17

percent. The sudden expansion in the supply of young workers this period

might beput forth as an explanation for the declining employment rates

of some youth. To absorb the extra workers, demand would have had to

expand considerably. Some economic reasoning would suggest that the

relatively greater number of young workers could be employed only if their

wage rates fell relative to the wage rates of adult workers.

     We believe this large demographic bulge surely had an impact on the

youth labor market. Relative wage rates of young white workers did fall.

And quite possibly the occupational choices of young workers were affect-

ed. However, we do not believe the data support an hypothesis linking

the bulk of the changing employment patterns described in Figure 1 with

the bulge in the relative number of youth. Our conclusions rest on three

facts.

          • The employment patterns over this period differ
            dramatically by demographic groups.

     Throughout the l960s and l970s the employment rates for young whites,

particularly women were moving upward. The rates for these groups rose

particularly rapidly in the l970s, just when the rate for black men was

 beginning to fall most sharply. Surely if a sudden excess supply of

young workers had appeared, we should have expected all groups to suffer

 at least somewhat. Instead we see opposite trends for whites and blacks

 in the l970s.

           • The timing of the boom does not coincide with the
             most rapid falls in minority employment.

      We still might be tempted to turn to the baby boom as a primary

explanation of black employment problems were it not for the fact that

the bulk of the baby boom bulge was absorbed in the 1960s while the

worst pôblems for minorities occurred in the 1970s. Between 1961 and

1971 youth increased from 12 to 16 percent of the population. By contrast

over the next decade the proportion of youth rose just one more percentage

point. But comparatively and absolutely, minority youth fared far better

in the l960s than in the 1970s.

          • The market has shown a remarkable ability to
            adjust to changing supplies of youth during the
            summer.

     In March of 1976 there were 3.8 million teenagers in the full-time

labor force and 3.0 million of these had jobs.   In July of that same year,

the ranks had swelled to 8.3 million workers when youngsters were on

summer vacation. Of the additional 4.6 million new entrants to the labor

force, 4.0 million had found jobs. Indeed the unemployment rate among

youth is typically lower in July than durinq the school year. If the

market can adjust to a nearly threefold increase in teenage labor supply

each summer, it seems hard to believe it could not adjust to a far more

gradual increase over several decades.

      Nonetheless, several authors, notably Wachter (1978), have argued

 that the supply effects have interacted with institutional rigidities in

 the labor market to worsen the position of youth, especially black youth.

 We surely cannot rule out the possibility that the baby boom was an impor-

 tant contributing factor, but we cannot with much precision assess its

 independent contribution to the growing racial employment gap.

      We turn now to an issue where we can say a good deal more. We

 consider the impact of the vascillating level of military manpower on
                                    -10-



youth employment.


THE MILITARY

     Oneo-f the most dramatic changes in the seventies was a substantial

reduction in the size and composition of the military. While these

changes have been widely noted in popular discussion, they have received

surprisingly little attention in the youth employment literature.1 The

silence may, in part, reflect uncertainty about how to treat the military.

Most authors are interested primarily in assessing the performance of the

civilian labor market and data are almost always collected only for those

in the civilian population.

     The military is a major employer of men between the ages of 18 and

24. Obviously the need for military personnel serves as additional labor

demand for young men. At the same time, military employment is often

regarded as very different from civilian employment. The working condi-

tions, the skills, the commitment and the risks may indeed differ enor-

mously between the sectors and the working conditions within the military

obviously vary depending on whether the country is fighting a war. More-

over, the nature of the selection process changes from year to year. In

draft years, the proportion of the eligible population inducted and the

rules for deferral or avoidance are quite variable. With the volunteer

army, rigid pay rules and working conditions seem to deter many of the

more able or educated young men while the military may reject those with

comparatively low skills. The vast complexity of the whole issue coupled



     1. One notable exception is Cooper (1978).
                                      —11—



with poor data probably has led most authors to ignore the entire issue

(it certainly has for us up until now).

     Yet-the changes in the military over the past several decades have

been quite dramatic and may have had a serious impact on the youth labor

market. We have found:

            • There has been a sizable long term decline in the
              relative number of young men in the military over
              the last three decades, interrupted by the Vietnam
              war. The decline in military manpower in the 1970s
              effectively increased the civilian 18-24 year old
              labor force at least as much as the baby boom did
              during the decade!

Figure 3 shows that in 1952 nearly one-third of all 18-24 year old young

men were serving in the military. By 1964 the proportion had fallen to

15 percent. Five years later, the Vietnam war had boosted the military

back up to 20 percent. But by 1979, only 7 percent of the age group are

military personnel. The possible impact of these declines can be gleaned

by contrasting them to the baby boom rises of the 1970s. Between 1969

and 1979, the total male population aged 18—24 rose 25 percent. However,

the total male civilian population jumped by over 50 percent. Thus at

least one-half of the rise could be traced directly to the decline in the

role of the military. By contrast, in the previous decade the total

population had risen 50 percent but the civilian population had grown

by slightly over 40 percent. In fact, although the baby boom occurred

primarily during the l960s, the growth in the civilian labor force of

persons aged 16-24 was actually slightly greater in the 1970s.

whites between 18 and 24 doing military service fell sharply. After

 peaking at roughly 20 percent, the proportion fell to under 7 percent

 in l978. Somewhat to our surprise, at the military peak in the late

1960s whites were actually proportionately more common than blacks, with

only 16 percent of blacks and 20 percent of whites serving. But the fall—

off in service for blacks was much smaller in the 1970s. Indeed, after a

low of 10 percent in 1972, black participation rose during the 1970s.

Beginning in 1973, young blacks have been disproportionately found as

military personnel. By 1978, blacks were twice as likely as whites to

have enlisted.

          • If those in the military are treated as employed,
            the black/white employment gap grew 11 points
            rather than 14 points during the 1970s. Moreover,
            if we take account of the likelihood that draft
            avoidance induced many young whites to remain in
            school longer than they otherwise would have, the
            gap narrows another 2 points.

     It is unclear what is the proper way to treat the military. One

logical treatment would be to include military personnel as employed

and calculate employment to population ratios for the entire population

(civilian and military). Such a calculation leads to less growth in the

black/white employment gap over the 1970s than the employment rates

based only on the civilian population show. Since whites were dispropor-

tionately serving in the military in 1969, their employment rates are

boosted more than that for blacks. Conversely, blacks were overrepresented

in the later years so their employment rates are pushed up more in 1979.

The net effect is that the racial employment gap grows by 2 to 3 points

less if the military is treated as employment.

    Moreover, the Vietnam war buildup depressed employment rates for
                                    —15-




another reason.   It induced persons to remain in school longer to avoid

the draft. We shall see later that enrollment rates for men bulged in

the late sixties while those for women did not. Persons enrolled in

school tend to work much less than those out of school. We are not

aware of any studies of this military impact on enrollment. A rough

calculation based on the assumption that enrollment patterns would have

followed a straight line for both races between 1964 and 1974 in the

absence of the war indicates that the enrollment effect was much larger

for whites. We shall discuss the importance of school enrollment in a

later section. But it appears that some of the growth in employment

rates for whites over the 1970s was spuriously caused by the artificially

high school attendance rates in the late 1960s. A rough estimate is that

another 2 points of the widening black/white employment gap can be traced

to this enrollment effect.

     Thus as much as 4 to 5 points of the original 14 point gap for men

might be eliminated by including those in the military as employed and

by controlling for the draft induced school enrollment. These calcula-

tions, however, take no account of the possible additional impact that

the rapid increase in the civilian labor force might have had. Let us

turn now to the impact of the rapid fluctuations in the short term

demand for labor.


MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS

     Macroeconomic conditions have a sizeable impact on employment and

unemployment rates of youth. A common indicator of the strength of the

economy is the adult unemployment rate. According to recent estimates,
                                       -16-




for every one percentage point rise in the employment rate for adult males

there is a 2 point fall in the employment rate, for white teenagers, and

a 3 point fall in the rate for blacks. For 20 to 24 year olds the figures

are slightly higher.1 The unemployment rate for adult males varied greatly

over the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the boom of 1968 and 1969 this

rate reached 1.5 percent, the lowest in many decades. During the reces-

sion of 1970-71 the figure rose to 3.1 percent and in the recession of

1975-76 the rate topped 4.9 percent.

     Unemployment rates, which may capture job availability more precisely

than employment rates, show the influence of macroeconomic conditions

quite dramatically. Figure 5 displays unemployment rates for black and

white teenagers, for persons in their early twenties, and for men over 20.

     We can draw several important conclusions.

          • The youth unemployment (and employment) rates are
            very sensitive to macroeconomic conditions.

     During the recessions of 1958, 1961, 1970—71, and 1975-76, youth

unemployment rates rose very sharply. During the most serious post-war

recession in 1975-76, the black teenage unemployment rate was over 35

percent and for whites the figure exceeded 15 percent. By contrast during

the late 1960s when the economy was heated to its highest (and most infla-

tionary) post-war level, black teenage unemployment rates fell below 25

percent, and white rates were close to 10 percent.

          • About one-third to one-half of the decline in
            male black employment rates between 1969 and 1979
            could be traced to weaker economic conditions.
            But only about 14 percent of the increase in the
            disparity between black and white employment
            rates could be attributed to the change in
            economic conditions.

 The seventies were a period of much weaker economic performance than the

 sixties. The average unemployment rate for all persons was below 5

 percent -in the sixties; in the seventies it was 7 percent. Between 1969

 and 1979, the adult male unemployment rate rose 1.4 percentage points.

 Using cyclical sensitivity figures cited earlier we would have predicted

a 4 to 5 percent drop in the employment rate for black youth during that

period, and a 3 percent lower rate for whites, all else the same. In

fact, during that period the overall employment rate of black males fell

almost 10 points while it rose about 4 points for whites. About one-

third to one-half of the 10 point decline for blacks would be accounted

for by the decline attributable to weaker aggregate demand. But the

difference between the rates for blacks and whites increased by 14 points

between these two years. Only about 14 percent of this difference (2 of

4 points) could be attributed to economic conditions. We have not seen

separate estimates of the cyclical sensitivity of women's employment rates,

But we presume the results would be similar to those for men.

          • Even when the economy is booming extreme black!
            white differences remain.

     While macroeconomic conditions help to explain the employment

patterns of different groups over time, they provide little help in

understanding the differences between them at any point in time.   In

1969 the economy was extremely tight. The military buildup had reached

its peak, and many white youngsters were staying in school. Yet sizable

differences in employment and unemployment rates remained. For example,

the teenage unemployment rates for blacks was still 25 percent when the

white rate had fallen nearly to 10 percent.
                                    —19-




     In combination, then, the changing military and macroeconomic

conditions can explain up to half (7 points) of the 14 point growth in

the ractal employment gap for young men, though possible interactions

between the two have not been considered. For women only the macro-

economic effects can be used, so much more remains unexplained. Recall

that a portion of the military effect was related to reduced school

enrollment. We now explore the importance of schooling more directly.


SCHOOLING

     Schooling plays a major role in the labor market experience of

youth. The influence is two-fold. First, while young people are in

school they often do not work. When they do, their jobs typically involve

short-term part-time work. During the summers, we have already seen that

teenage employment represents a massive influx into the full-time labor

force. Second, after young people complete their schooling, their level

of education is highly correlated with their labor market employment

experiences. In the language of human capital, youngsters who have

accumulated more capital reap larger rewards.

     We begin by looking at the differing patterns of schooling for men

and women and blacks and whites over time. We then consider changes in

the employment rates of youth in and out of school. Finally, we explore

the impacts of changes in enrollment, together with increases in the

employment of students on the overall employment rates which we seek to

understand.

     There are several statistics that might be used as indicators of school

attainment. An appealing one is the enrollment rate for persons aged 16-24.
                                     -20-



 It captures the proportion of the age group that is enrolled in school.

 It also is ideal for understanding how employment patterns for those

enrolled-in school differ from the patterns of those who have left school.

Figure 6 shows enrollment rates for men and women between 1954 and 1978.

Later we shall treat blacks and whites separately. This figure reveals:

          • Enrollment rates which rose steadily through the
            l950s and l960s leveled off during the 1970s,
            and then fell for young men.

     Enrollment rates for young women rose throughout the 1950s and l960s,

then leveled off in the l970s. In 1954 only 25 percent of women aged 16

to 24 were enrolled in school. By 1970 over 40 percent were. The pattern

was rather different for men. Enrollment rates for men moved from 43

percent to 55 percent in the 1960s. But in the 1970s this trend halted

abruptly. Male enrollment rates fell rather dramatically over this period.

We have already suggested that this pattern may reflect a surge in enroll-

ment to avoid the draft in the late 1960s. The labor market effects of

all of these enrollment changes are likely to be profound since those

enrolled in school typically are employed far less than those out of school.

     Enrollment rates by race have been published since 1964. Table 1

reports these rates by sex and race in selected years.

          • During the 1960s and 1970s the enrollment gap
            between blacks and whites was largely eliminated.
            Enrollment rates for blacks continued to rise
            slowly over the 1970s for both men and women.

In 1964, some 51 percent of white males were enrolled in school while only

39 percent of black males were similarly inclined. By 1979 a larger pro-

portion of black men than white men were actually enrolled. Similarly

for women, blacks now remain enrolled as long as whites.

     The median black, as well as the median white, now completes high

school. But other measures show a continuing gap in total educational

achievement. The dropout rate for blacks continues to exceed that for

whites: -.13 percent of whites aged 16-24 are high school dropouts while

20 percent of blacks in this age group have not completed high school.

Black youth apparently pass through fewer grades per year of enrollment.

In addition, for any number of grades completed, achievement test scores

typically are lower for blacks than for whites. Thus, while blacks

remain in school almost as long as whites, the educational outcomes may

continue to be very different.

     Fewer blacks go on to college. According to a 1972 survey of high

school graduates, about 54 percent of whites attend a post-secondary

school full-time upon graduation from high school, while about 42 percent

of blacks do so. However, after controlling for individual and family

background attributes-—including parents' education and income, high

school class rank, and scholastic test scores--blacks are much more likely

than whites to attend a post-secondary school. For example, the proba-

bilities of attendance evaluated at the mean of attributes of white and

at the mean of attributes of non-white high school graduates are as

follows:


                     Evaluated At                 White   Non-White
             Mean of white attributes              .68      .83

             Mean of non-white attributes          .36      .58



 By these measures, there is a substantial positive race effect on post-

• secondary school attendance even as early as 1972.1



      1. See Meyer and Wise (1981).
                                        -24-




        The changing enrollment patterns clearly influence labor markets.

 Persons in school are less likely to work. Thus:

           _. All  else the same we should have expected to see
               falling employment rates for blacks and whites
               over the 1950s and 1960s as enrollment rates
               rose since fewer students than non-students work.

        In 1954 when 33 percent of all youth aged 16-24 were enrolled in

school the employment rate for students was roughly 25 percent; for

non-students, 65 percent. Overall the employment rate was 52 percent.

Therefore, when enrollment had risen to 47 percent, as in 1970, we should

have expected the employment rate to fall to 49 percent if nothing else

changed. If we do the calculation separately for men and women, we would

have expected the rate to fall 2 points for men, 3 points for women. That

they did not in fact fall indicates that one of two things happened. The

employment rates rose for in-school youth or for out of school youth, or

both.

        To discover which, Figure 7 shows the employment rates for youths

aged 16-24 who were enrolled and not enrolled in school by sex. (Racial

differences are described below.) The figure reveals:

            • For both men and women employment rates for those
              in school have risen sharply since 1954.

            • For men out of school there has been relatively
              little change in employment rates. For out of
              school women on the other hand, work has become
              increasingly common.

     Of all persons aged 16-24 enrolled in school over 40 percent are now

working at any point in time during the school year. Presumably a much

higher proportion work at some time during the school year. Work while

in school became much more common throughout the seventies. Obviously the

increased work may have important implications for education practices

and indeed for the effects of education. For example, it raises questions

about th. impact of outside work on the quality of education received and

the longer term prospects for jobs. Meyer and Wise (1982) found that young

persons who work in high school are employed substantially more weeks per

year after graduation than youth who don't work while in high school.

        The racial patterns in employment by school enrollment status are

even more startling. Table 2 shows that:

             • In spite of similar enrollment rates, blacks are
               far less likely to work whether in or out of
               school. While employment rates were rising for
               whites in school and white women out of school,
               employment rates for blacks were stagnant or
               falling for both enrolled and not enrolled men
               and women.

Employment rates for in-school blacks are half those of whites. Moreover,

blacks lost ground over the seventies. For example, between 1969 and

1979, employment of white women in school rose from 35 to 45 percent in

spite of the fact that general economic conditions worsened. Black women

in school, on the other hand, experienced a small decline in employment

rates. Jobs while in school are now of major significance for white

youth, but far less common for blacks. The stagnant job picture for blacks

transcends school enrollment. Whereas white women out of school worked

much more in 1979 than in 1969, black women were actually working a lot

less.


SUMMARY OF SCHOOL ENROLLMENT IMPACTS

        Let us pause now and summarize the labor market impact of the

changing enrollment patterns for blacks and whites. We treat each group
                                      -28-



separately.

            • The rising employment rates for white men over
        -     the seventies reflect a falling enrollment rate
              and a rising employment rate for those in school.

     Virtualy the entire change in employment rates for white men over

the past three decades might be traced to the combination of schooling

and macro effects. In the sixties when the economy was strong, increased

enrollments were offset by increased work in school and overall employ-

ment rose somewhat. In the seventies, enrollment rates started to fall.

Together with rising employment of school enrollees, these forces would

have pushed overall employment rates up considerably, but macroeconomic

conditions dampened the increase.

            • The falling employment rates for black men transcend
              school boundaries. In school or out, black male
              employment rates declined over the 1970s.

     Since school enrollment for black men was the same in 1979 as it

was in 1969, very little of the decline in employment can be traced to

changing enrollment patterns. Blacks are very unlikely to work while

in school, and the proportion who do is falling rapidly. Both in school

and out, employment rates are falling.

     For men, changing enrollment rates seem to account for as much as

3 points of the 14 point growth in the racial employment gap. We have

already accounted for the bulk of this impact when we described the

effects of induced enrollment in the Vietnam era. Thus, we have exp1ained

slightly over half of the gap so far using the military, macro, and

schooling effects. We shall have to look to other forces such as family

background and family formation for further explanation.
                                     -29-




          • The rising employment rates for white women over
            the 1970s reflects increased employment for both
            those in and out of school.

     For_women, on top of rising employment rates for those in school,

there were rapidly rising rates for those out of school. Employment

rates for white women both in school and out rose over ten points during

the 1970s even though the economy was weaker than in the sixties. Only

half of the rise for women over this period can be linked to employment

patterns of those in school. The rapidly changing behavior of those out

of school must also be considered.

          • Enrollment and employment patterns for black
            women were virtually identical in 1969 and 1979.

     Black women are by far the most stable group along these dimensions.

Enrollment rates changed little. Employment rates for those in school

and out fell slightly.

     The widening racial employment gap for women reflects rapidly changing

employment patterns for white women in school or out. We will seek clearer

answers as we explore household formation and family background influences

below.

     Before proceeding to these issues, however, let us pause for a little

more detail on employment patterns of whites and blacks who are in school

and those who are not. Our subsequent analysis will be based on a special

tabulation of the Survey of Income and Education for 1976. Thus the

employment and enrollment patterns shown there merit our scrutiny and are

shown in Table 3.

     The racial differences shown are quite dramatic. Once again we see

that although blacks and whites have relatively similar enrollment rates,
                                    -30-



employment rates both for school, enrollees and school dropouts are vastly

lower for blacks. We see that for younger age groups enrollment rates,

by race were quite similar by 1976. Some differences remain for older

college age men and women. But the critical racial difference lies in

employment. Whether in school or out, blacks work much less. Whereas

nearly half of white male teenagers work while in school, less than

one-fifth of comparable blacks do. Similar patterns emerge for white

women. We again conclude that school enrollment cannot explain the bulk

of the black employment declines in the 1970s. Indeed, the employment

rates for out of school teenage blacks are now so low that they approach

the rates for those in school. These results are troubling indeed for

they suggest that more years in school has done little to improve the

employment prospects of young blacks or that other forces have swamped

these benefits. Young blacks face employment problems whether they are

in school or out.

     We noted that school also affects employment for those who are out

of school because employment rates are strongly correlated with level of

schooling. We turn to that issue next.


EMPLOYMENT OF OUT OF SCHOOL YOUTH

     Once a youngster leaves school, level of education is strongly

associated with employment.

          • Persons with college diplomas work more than high
            school graduates who in turn work more than high
            school dropouts. The pattern applies equally to
            whites and blacks and men and women and differences
            persist as people age.

age, and years of schooling. Figure 9 displays similar figures for

women. Race, age, sex, and schooling are all highly correlated with

employment. For black dropouts the picture is particularly bleak. Less

than 20 pecent of 17 year old black male dropouts work, virtually none

of the comparable women work. Even seven years later at age 24, only 67

percent of black men and 35 percent of black women high school dropouts

work! Fortunately less than one-quarter of blacks can be found in this

category. Still the low levels of work are quite distressing. Increasing

education raises the employment rates quite dramatically. Yet black high

school graduates still fare worse than white high school dropouts.

      It is quite obvious that schooling level and employment are closely

related. Higher levels of schooling are associated with distinctly higher

employment for all groups. And at the high school level at least, blacks

and whites of equal age and education have quite different employment

level s.


     This concludes our discussion of the relationship between schooling

and employment. Emerging already is a picture of an employment pattern

for white men that is stable and easy to explain on the basis of tradi-

tional economic determinants like schooling and macro conditions. Employ-

ment for white women rose faster over the seventies than we might have

expected based on these factors alone. The employment patterns for blacks

are deteriorating very rapidly for reasons that are not easy to explain.

We have explained slightly over half of the worsening picture for men thus

far, but much less for women. In an effort to understand more we turn to

issues of household formation.
                                    -35-




HOUSEHOLD FORMATION

     Perhaps the most significant of events that occur during the teens

and eary twenties involves household formation. Over 98 percent of 16

year olds live at home. Almost none are married or have children. By

age 24, all but a quarter have left home, half are married, one-third

are living with children of their own. The labor market implications

and complications of family formation are far-reaching. Married women

work less, married men work more. Women with children rarely attend

school and are far less likely than childless women to work. Labor

market outcomes undoubtedly influence family formation too. Divorce

rates rise in recessions. Couples may not want to marry or have children

until one or both are "established" in their jobs.   In this section we

shall discuss the association between household formation and employment.

It is exceptionally difficult to disentangle cause and effect here. We

begin with a description of such associations in 1976 and then consider

the implications that changing family formation had for the 1970s.

     Youth between 16 and 24 are far too heterogeneous to treat all ages

collectively. Thus we concentrate on family formation variables for

persons of two ages, 18 and 24. We break the population in the Survey

of Income and Education into three categories: married and not living

in a parent's home (independent married), single and not living in a

parent's home (independent single), and living at home (dependent). Over

95 percent of those living in their parent's home are unmarried. Within

each group we distinguish persons with no children from those with

children Tables 4, 5, and 6 describe the distribution, the school

enrollment, and employment patterns of those not enrolled in school for

18 year olds and 24 year olds by race and sex.

     A wide variety of patterns emerge.

          • The overwhelming majority of 18 year olds still
         -- live at home. Some 80 percent of women and
            nearly 95 percent of men live at home at this
            age. By age 24 most persons have left home.

     Table 4 makes quite clear that household formation has hardly begun

by age 18, particularly for men. Whether in school or not, working or

not, the vast majority of men still live with their parents. Indeed

another tabulation shows that 84 percent of out of school employed 18

year old men are still living at home. Marriage pulls a larger percent-

age of women out of the household. Some 12 percent of white women are

married and living separately; 6.3 percent of black women are.

     This finding may be important as we consider the significance of

early employment problems. Since virtually all teenagers live at home,

there may be less pressure for them to work and the short-term financial

consequences of being out of work may be less severe than for older

independent persons. It1s possible that a fraction of these make

important contributions to family income. Yet even out of school youth

living with families in poverty or near poverty provide on average only

10 percent of family income. Some teenagers may face serious financial

hardships when they are unemployed, but most probably do not.

     By 24, however, things have changed rather drastically. Only one—

quarter of the white men and just 16 percent of white women are still at

home. Moreover, for those who have not left home, lack of a job may

prevent exit. By this age, employment has become far more important.

         • Marriage and childbearing sharply reduce school
           enrollment and employment rates for women. For
                                    -40-




            men school enrollment also is lower for those
            who are married, but employment is higher.

     Atage 18 the enrollment rate among married white women with no

childreni-s 31 percent as compared to 77 percent for those who are

unmarried and living at home. If the woman has a child and lives away

from home, chances are 9 out of 10 that she is out of school. If she has

a child but lives with her parents, she is more likely to remain in

school, but even then only 20 percent are enrolled.

     For married black women the situation is perhaps worse, but for those

who are unmarried and have children the enrollment effects are much less

pronounced than for white women. Virtually none of the 18 year old married

black women in our sample are enrolled in school. However, childbearing

for unmarried black women seems to have smaller effects on enrollment

than it does for whites. Some 42 percent of unmarried black women who

have children and live independently are still enrolled in school. Over

half of those who are single parents living with their parents go to

school. These figures are lower than those for women without children,

but the differences are not so great as they are for whites.

     Employment is also lower among mothers. White teenage mothers who

have left school are half as likely to work as their out of school peers

without children. For black mothers, however, the employment effects of

children are not nearly so strong as for whites, whether living with

parents or a husband. It's not that black mothers are so likely to work,

rather their unencumbered peers are so unlikely to be employed that both

groups look similar.

     The living situation of unwed mothers sharply influences the likeli-

hood of their working. A mother living with her parents is much more
                                     -41-



likely to work than one who is married or living singly. For black teen-

agers the effects are particularly pronounced. An unwed black mother

living 4th her parents is four times as likely to work as an unwed

mother living alone.

     Although the effects of childbirth and marriage are particularly

strong for the teenager, it is important to keep in mind that only 13

percent of white and 14 percent of black 18 year olds in our sample are

married, have children, or both. The 24 year old age group is the one

most affected by marital and family status.

     By age 24 only 30 percent of women of either race are both unmarried

and childless. Some 85 percent of the whites and 80 percent of the blacks

in this category who are out of school are working. For women who marry

but do not yet have children, employment rates fall to 80 percent for

whites and 55 percent for blacks. Obviously for whites at least marriage

alone has largely ceased to be strongly related to labor market activity.

Children have the most significant influence. Mothers, black or white,

work less than half the time.

     Men are affected differently by marriage. Married men, like married

women, are unlikely to be enrolled in school. But they are more likely

to work than their unmarried peers. Married men may feel more financial

pressure. Or marriage may be postponed until employment is obtained.

Whatever the direction of causality, according to recent Current Popula-

tion Survey data, once marital status, schooling, and race are controlled

for there is no relationship between the age of youth and their employment

status.1 It may be that changing family status accounts for much of the

apparent rise in employment as youths age.

     How has childbearing affected employment? One of the most dramatic

trends of the 1960s and l970s was a substantial decline in the fertility

rate for young white women (see Figure 10). Over the same period fertil-

ity rates were essentially level for black women. Marriage rates declined

for both groups. It seems likely that the changing patterns of family

formation have affected the employment rates of women. We conclude:

          • The changing family structures between 1970 and
            1980 could have been associated with as much as
            a 2 percentage point increase in the employment
            rate for white women aged 16 to 24 and a 1 point
            decrease in the employment rates for black women.
            As much as 3 points of the widening employment
            gap between black and white women during the
            seventies might be traced to changes in family
            structure. Changing household formation seems
            to explain little for men.

     In performing these calculations we compared what the 1980 employ-

ment rates would have been had family structures been the same as in

1970 and if employment rates by family type were identical to those in

1976. One reason that the net effects of changing fertility are so small

is that some mothers actually work more than non-mothers because they

also are not enrolled in school. It should be noted that these simple

calculations do not indicate the direction of causality. Household

formation decisions may be influenced by labor market conditions. If

childbirth and marriage aremore likely when conditions are bad, our

calculations would exaggerate the impact of changing household forma-

tion and vice versa.

     For women, the widening racial employment gap can be traced largely

to rising employment rates of white women. Thus far, we have explained
                                    -44-



2 points of the 14 point gap for women by the worsening macroeconomic

conditions, and 3 points from changing family structure. Changing

enrollment patterns offered little explanatory power. The remaining

differences must be traced to rising employment for women (both in school

and out) within a family structure category.

     The labor force participation of married women, particularly those

with children, rose dramatically over the seventies. Young married women

between 20 and 24 had participation rates of 43 percent in 1968. Ten

years later, 59 percent of married women were in the labor force! Some

of this increase can be traced to reduced childbearing which we have

already accounted for. But much of the rise reflected increased work by

mothers. During the l970s the labor force participation rates for married

mothers with young children shot up ten points. The forces we have

explored offer little power in explaining these rises. It is clear, how-

ever, that for white women, the increased employment in the seventies

must be traced in large part to this last fact. We have yet to explain

why employment patterns for black women did not follow suit.

     For men, the family structure variables seem far less potent. We

have already noted that the bulk of the changes in white employment rates

can be traced to changing military composition, macroeconomic conditions,

and school enrollment, and some of the fall in employment for blacks can

be traced to these same causes. Overall, these factors explain roughly 8

of the 14 point rise in the employment gap. In the next section we explore

yet another possible influence, family background.


FAMILY BACKGROUND

     One of the most obvious differences between blacks and whites is
                                      -45-




family background. Whereas 85 percent of white teenagers live in two-

parent households, nearly half (45 percent) of blacks live with one parent.

Moreover, while only 7 percent of white teens living at home live in house-

holds with incomes below the poverty line, 35 percent of black teens do.

In this section we explore whether these differences and the dramatic

changes in family structures over the 1970s might have influenced employ-

ment patterns over the past decade.

     It is difficult to trace family background for youngsters who have

already left home. Virtually all teenagers live at home, but a substan-

tial portion of 20-24 year olds have moved out. Thus we will concentrate

on teenagers only in this discussion, then seek to generalize the results

to the older age group. In our analysis we have divided all families into

two types, single parent and two parent. Within each type we have further

subdivided these families into three income categories: below the poverty

line, 100 percent to 200 percent of the poverty line, and over 200 percent

of the poverty line. This makes 6 family type and income categories.

Table 7 gives the percent distribution by category and the percent enrolled

in school, by race and sex for teenagers living at home. Here we see:

          • School enrollment is strongly related to both
            family type and income for both races and both
            sexes. Teenagers from poor and single parent
            families are less likely to enroll in school.

     Less than 70 percent of white males in poor single parent families

are enrolled in school. Some 77 percent of white males in single parent

families with income more than twice the poverty line are enrolled. And

fully 85 percent of persons in two parent families with this higher level

of income go off to school each day. Similar figures apply to all three

other sex and race combinations.
                                    -46-




          • As is well known, blacks are heavily concentrated
            in single parent and low income families.

Some 60 percent of white teenagers are in moderate to high income, two

parent families. Only 15 percent of blacks are. Only 3 percent of whites

are in poor single parent families, but nearly one-quarter of black teen-

agers are found in such families.

          • Black school enrollment is as high or higher than
            white enrollment within virtually every family
            type and income category. Lower enrollment rates
            for blacks thus can be completely accounted for
            by family background differences.

     Sample sizes in many cells are small, but in general black and white

enrollment rates look remarkably similar within family type and income

groupings. In many cases black enrollment rates are actually higher.

Thus the lower enrollment rates for blacks overall can be attributed to

their concentration in lower income and single parent families. As men-

tioned above, analysis of post-secondary school attendance patterns shows

that controlling for family background and other individual attributes,

blacks are much more likely than whites to attend a post-secondary school,

and in particular to attend a four-year college or university.

     Table S displays employment rates for those in school and out of

school for the various family type and income groups. The results are

quite dramatic.

          • For males and females, blacks and whites, enrolled
            or riot, from single parent or two parent families,
            rising family income is associated with rising
            levels of employment.

     One out of every four white males in poor single parent families who

is enrolled in school is also working. If his family had income over

twice the poverty line he was twice as likely to be working. Astonishingly,

 only 30 percent of out of school black males living in poor single parent

 households work. Some 55 percent of those of higher income homes are

 working.1n each category we see rising family income associated with

 higher levels of employment. This may be in small part a statistical

 artifact. Families with working teenagers are not as likely to be poor.

 However, in virtually none of the household groupings, particularly the

higher income ones, do the youngsters contribute more than 10-15 percent

of family income on average, thus we believe this effect is small.

          • For persons out of school, family type is very
            strongly associated with employment rates.
            Teenagers from two parent families are far more
            likely to be working.  For those enrolled in
            school, family type shows a less dramatic but
            still substantial relationship to employment for
            whites, and very little relationship for blacks.

For both races and both sexes, coming from a single parent family substan-

tially diminishes the likelihood that a youngster out of school will be

working. Some 40-45 percent of blacks of eitrr sex in two parent families

who are out of school, are employed; roughly 30 percent of those from

single parent families are employed. White women living with two parents

have employment rates of 67 percent; those who live with only one have

rates of 45 percent. The pattern applies for all income groups, though

there is a hint in the data that the negative relationship is less severe

for higher income single parent families. Family type seems to alter

behavior most for white women, least for white men. In all cases the

impact is large. It is unclear from this data whether the family type

effects are direct or indirect via level of schooling achieved or house-

hold formation decisions. Regardless, the structure of families seems to

be strongly correlated with labor market outcomes, particularly for women.
                                       -52-




        We can only speculate about the reasons for these findings. Possibly

youth from poor families have less access to networks or contacts and

information that help in finding jobs. Or persons from poor or single-

parent families may be less likely to have working role models. And it

is possible that welfare rules offer substantial disincentives to work

for youth in poor families.

        For those in school, the effects are less strong. White employment

rates for youngsters in two parent families are still somewhat higher

than those for persons in single parent families. But for blacks, family

type has only a small impact. Only a small fraction of young blacks work

while in school regardless of their family type. (Nonetheless, those

from families with higher incomes work more.)

        These results suggest that the rapidly changing family structures of

the l970s may indeed have had profound labor market impacts. We will

consider that issue in a moment. It is imporint to recognize, however,

that:

             • In every family type and income classification,
               blacks always fare much worse than whites. Even
               if family structures and income levels for blacks
               were identical to those of whites, the overall
               employment rate for black teenagers living at
               home would rise only from 21 to 27 percent. The
               overall rate for whites is 48 percent. Thus the
               black-white gap cannot be attributed primarily to
               family background differences. For out of school
               youth, however, as much as one-half the gap can
               be attributed to family structure and family
               income.

        Overall, the employment rate for white persons in this sample is 48

percent;. for blacks the rate is 21 percent. If the black population had

the same income and family type configuration as whites, and employment

rates within each category were unchanged, black employment rates would
                                   -53-



rise from 21 to 27 percent. Thus although family structure and family

income effects are sizable, the bulk of the black-white employment gap

for teenagers cannot be traced to the differing family backgrounds of

blacks and whites.

     The sample sizes are probably too small to perform this calculation

for out-of-school youth only and generate a result of great reliability.

When the calculation is performed, roughly half of the difference can be

traced to these characteristics. The result follows from the far greater

impact of family income and structure on the employment of out-of-school

blacks.

     We turn at last to the changing family patterns of the 1970s and

their possible influence on employment rates. Figure 11 documents a

trend which has been widely discussed elsewhere. There was a sudden and

sharp increase in the number of single parent families during the l970s.

For blacks the changes were enormous. WhereaS. 30 percent of black teens

were found in single parent households in 1970, nearly 50 percent were in

this family type by 1980. Over the same period the percent of white

teenagers in single parent households rose from 9.1 to 14.4 percent. It

is instructive to consider the possible impacts of these changes on

employment.

          • For out of school teenagers the changing family
            structure may have been associated with a decline
            in the overall employment rate by three points
            for black males and females while it had no
            influence on whites. For in-school teens, impacts
            for all groups were negligible. Since most teens
            are in school overall the changing family structure
            lowered employment rates for minority teenagers by
            one point. However, since most 20-24 year olds are
            out of school, impacts could be larger for that
            group. Perhaps two points of the 12 point increase
            in the black-white employment gap could be traced
            to family structure changes.

     The nearly 20 percent increase in single parent black families might

have been expected to be associated with lower employment rates, partic-

ularly fqr those out of school. If the differences in employment patterns

between youngsters for single parent and two parent families held at the

1976 level (roughly .15 points) throughout the period and if we treat the

changes as exogenous then overall employment rates for those out-of—school

would have fallen three points. Between 1970 and 1980, however, the

impacts of the altered family structure on those in school would be negli-

gible since family structure is so weakly related to employment rates for

blacks in school. Since most persons are in school, the overall impact

for minority teenagers is small, perhaps lowering employment by one point.

     Recall, however, that most 20-24 year olds are out of school, so they

may be more heavily affected by family background. On the other hand,

many left home before the full change of the 1970s had occurred. At most

we might believe the changing family structur€ caused a two to three

point fall in minority employment for those in their early twenties.

Averaging the effects for the teenagers with that for 20-24 year olds, at

most two points of the 12 point fall in minority employment might be traced

directly to changing family structure, and then only if such changes are

treated as exogenous.

     In short, family structure and family income are critical determinants

of employment patterns. For males, then we have now explained as much as

9 or 10 points of the 14 point growth in the gap. For females, we have

accounted for perhaps 6 or 7 points. Nonetheless, we still are unable to

explain all of the changes in minority employment patterns relative to

whites over the l970s. Now we turn to our final topic: government programs.
                                    -56-



 PUBLIC POLICY

     Many government programs may have had an influence on the employment

and related experiences of youth over the 1970s. We shall focus on three:

youth employment programs, minimum wage legislation, and the Basic Educa-

tional Opportunity Grant (BEOG) program.


     Youth Employment Programs

     The rising interest in the labor market problems of youth was matched

in the late l960s and 1970s by a rapid increase in public training and

employment programs for youth. In 1964 fewer than 50,000 youth under

age 22 were served by federal employment and training programs. By 1969

perhaps 750,000 participated in some program.     In 1979 nearly two million

youth received federally sponsored labor market aid. During the Carter

years a diverse set of programs, many experimental, were created or

expanded to help youth. The programs ranged 'rom the Young Adult Conserva-

tion Corps where youth are employed in conservation or other public

projects to the Youth Incentive Entitlement Projects, experimental

programs where youth are guaranteed part-time work while in school and

full-time summer jobs if they return to school.

     The largest single program was the Summer Youth Employment Program

(SYEP) which provides employment for disadvantaged youth aged 14-21

during the summer months. The program grew from roughly 400,000 persons

in 1969 to over one million in 1978. The enormity of the program can be

illustrated by the fact that nearly 45 percent of all summer jobs held by

minority youth aged 14-19 in July 1978 were provided under SYEP. On the

other hand, just 3 percent of jobs for whites during the same period were

similarly provided. As shown in Figure 12, some 50 percent of white

youth (aged 14-19) had private sector jobs outside the program, only 18

percent of minority youth did. The program provided jobs for another 2

percent of whites and 14 percent of non-whites. Those figures must be

interpreted carefully. Fully 40 percent of all SYEP jobs go to very

young teenagers aged 14 and 15, so the contribution for older youth may

be smaller. Still the size of the public sector role in the labor market

for minority teenagers is astonishing.

     It is impossible to know the extent to which summer jobs displaced

some youth from unsubsidized private sector jobs.     It is worth noting

that employment rates for minority teenagers as shown in Figure 13 may

not have fallen as much over the seventies in the summer months as they

did during the school year, suggesting perhaps that these programs miti-

gated the problems of minority youth. On the other hand, it is possible

that these public sector jobs do not provide the kind of work experience

and job networks that private employment might.


     The Minimum Wg

     Since its inception in 1938, the scope of the minimum wage has been

continuously expanded, primarily through extended coverage. Perhaps 90

percent of non-supervisory workers are now subject to the minimum, either

through the federal legislation itself or through state extensions. The

real minimum was about the same in 1970 as in 1980.     In these years it

was about 15 percent higher than the 1973 level, the lowest of the real

values during the seventies.

     What has been the effect of the minimum on the employment and earn-

ings of youth? Figures 14 through 16 show the distribution of youth wage

rates for selected age groups in 1978, when the minimum was set at $   2.65.
The figures make clear that:

          • The minimum has a dramatic effect on youth wage
            rates. A large proportion of some age groups are
            paid at the minimum. A substantial proportion of
            teenagers are also paid below the minimum.

     The employment impact of the minimum wage has been the subject of a

long list of studies that we shall not attempt to summarize. Rather we

shall report results from a recent analysis of Meyer and Wise [1981].

Their study concentrates on youth 16 to 24 during the l970s. It also

emphasizes the earnings as well as the employment effect of the minimum.

According to their estimates,

          • Without the minimum wage, employment of youth
            would have been 3.9 percent higher than it was.
            Employment of those 16 to 19 would have been 7.1
            percent higher and among those 20 to 24, it would
            have been 2.2 percent higher. The effect among
            blacks was considerably larger than among whites,
            5.6 versus 3.7 percent.

     Simulated employment effects of the minimum are shown in Table 9 by

race and age groups. These estimates reveal a rather substantial employ-

ment effect.1 The minimum wage also affects youth earnings. It increases


     1. Other estimates are in general not dramatically different from
these but are probably a bit lower on average.
                                      -64-




on average the average wage of those employed but reduces the number of

persons employed. Results not shown here show that the two effects almost

exactly offset one another. Total youth earnings are about the same with

the minimum as they would be without it.       It is not surprising that the

minimum should have a relatively large effect on teenage employment. Over

the seventies, the minimum was on average very close to the average wage

rate 16 to 17 year olds would have had in the absence of the minimum.

        As we have shown above, many employed youth, especially minority

youngsters, have government-provided jobs that pay the minimum, more

than some would otherwise receive. If it were not for these jobs, the

observed effect of the minimum would presumably have been somewhat

greater.


        Aid for Post-Secondary Education: The BEOG Program

        The role and scope of federal student financial aid activities has

been periodically debated and revised.       In the middle 1960s a desire to

equalize educational opportunities across income classes became promi-

nent. The Basic Educational Opportunity Grant (BEOG) Program initiated

in 1973 gave fullest expression to this policy goal. Over the l97Os,

programs became the dominant aid instrument as, over time, benefits under

the program were extended to higher income groups.

        We know of only one analysis of the program's impact.' It reveals

that:

            • Without BEOG awards, post-secondary school
              enrollment of low income youth would be about 37
              percent lower than it is. Enrollment of middle


         1. See Fuller, Manski, and Wise [1980].
                                              -65-



                       and upper income youth would be only 6 percent
                       lower, although by 1979 40 percent of BEOG aid
                       was to middle and upper income youth.

         -
                     • Without the BEOG grants, enrollment in two-year
             -
                 -     colleges and in vocational-technical schools
                       would be about 31 percent lower. Enrollment in
                       four-year colleges and universities is virtually
                       unaffected by the program.

      Approximately 40 percent of 1979 awards went to middle and upper

 income students. But awards to upper and middle income youth have very

 little effect on their enrollment patterns, whereas awards to low income

 students have a substantial effect on the post-secondary school enrollment

 of this group. In addition, the awards have virtually no effect on enroll-

 ment in four-year colleges for any income group, according to these esti-

 mates. The effect of the awards is to increase enrollment by low income

 students in two-year colleges and in vocational-technical schools.

 Predicted enrollments (in thousands) by school type and by income group,

with and without BEOG awards (in thousands) are as follows in 1979:



                                              Four-Year       Two-Year and

     Total              1603    1324        668      679       935      645


Total enrollment would be 17 percent lower without the BEOG awards accord-

ing to these estimates: 37 percent lower among low income students, 11

percent lower among middle income youth, and 2 percent lower among upper

income youngsters. While for many low income students, the awards seem
                                      -66-



to tip   the balance in favor of junior colleges and vocational schools
versus full-time entry into the labor force, attendance at four-year

colleges and universities is not affected greatly by the awards. Apparently

two-year schools, vocational schools, and work are much closer substitutes

for each other than four-year college programs are for any of these three.

      In conclusion, we emphasize that these three programs apparently

have countervailing influences on employment of young people. Youth

employment programs are intended to increase employment, especially among

the disadvantaged. The grants are designed to increase education and

therefore improve labor market opportunity later. But since these

programs increase the enrollment of low income youth, they reduce their

measured employment while they remain in school, since persons in school

work less than persons out of school. At the same time, the minimum wage

reduces employment for these same groups.


CONCLUSIONS

     We have examined employment patterns across groups and over time.

Our basic focus has been on understanding the widening racial employment

gap over the seventies. For both men and women, the gap grew by roughly

14 points during the l97Os. For men this reflected a roughly 4 point

rise in employment rates for whites and a 10 point fall for blacks. For

women, virtually all of the change came from rising employment of white

women. We have explored a wide variety of possible explanations for

these changes. Our findings are:

            • The changing structure of the military may have
              had a significant influence on employment patterns
              of youth. If persons in the military are treated
              as employed, we reduce the unexplained growth in
              the employment gap by 2 to 3 points for men.
                          -67-



• The macroeconomic state of the economy continued
  to have a substantial influence on employment of
  young people. The general economic weakness of
  the 1970s hurt the young, particularly blacks,
  disproportionately. These influences may have
  added 2 points in the gap for both men and women.

• Enrollment rates for blacks rose slightly over the
  seventies. For white males rates fell sharply
  (perhaps due to the elimination of draft-induced
  enrollment in the late sixties), while for females
  employment was stable in the seventies. These
  changes can explain perhaps 3 points of the gap
  for males and none of the gap for females.

• The median black is now receiving almost as much
  education measured by years of schooling as whites.
  Yet employment rates for blacks vis--vis whites
  have not increased correspondingly.

• Employment for whites enrolled in school grew
  considerably in recent years and now reaches
  almost half of all youngsters in a given month.
  For blacks work while in school remains uncommon.

• Household formation decisions are highly correlated
  with schooling and employment patterns. Women with
  children are far less likely to work or attend
  school than their childless peers. Unwed whites
  are almost always out of school and rarely work.
  For unwed blacks, the influence of childbirth on
  school enrollment is less severe, but still substan-
  tial.  In general, employment rates are higher for
  unwed mothers if they live in a parent's home than
  if they live independently. The sharply reduced
  birth rate of the 1970s for white women seems to
  have pushed up schoul enrollment and work when
  out of school. Moreover, the labor force parti-
  cipation of mothers and childless married women
  rose sharply over the decade. Perhaps 3 points of
  the rise in the employment gap for women can be
  accounted for by these forces for both men and
  women.

• Policies of the l970s simultaneously increased
  and diminished demand for youthful workers. Youth
  programs grew enormously over the decade. At the
  same time the minimum wage remained a deterrent to
  hiring unskilled youth and BEOGs grants increased
  post-secondary school enrollment for youth from low
  income families. Overall there was an enormous
  increase in youth employment programs during the
                                    -68-



            late 1960s and 1970s. Unfortunately, the employment
            picture for minority youth looks even worse today
            than it did in the 1970s.

     The one area where we feel somewhat uncertain involves the large

supply chänes affecting the labor market. While we believe the baby boom

alone cannot explain very much, coupled with the sharply reduced military

manpower needs in the 1970s the increase in the supply of civilian manpower

was quite sizable. Moreover the steep rise in labor force participation of

white women, both young and old may have further crowded the labor market.

Black workers may have been displaced. We have not sought to quantify

these effects at all.

     The changing employment patterns for whites can be traced almost

entirely to the factors we could measure. White men attend school some-

what less and work more when they are in school than they did in the 1960s.

As a result, employment rates rose, though they were dampened by worsening

economic conditions and the minimum wage. White women work more in school,

are less likely to be married or have children, and if they are married

or have children they are more likely to work now than in the 1960s. These

trends collectively overpowered negative macroeconomic forces.

     For blacks the patterns are somewhat more perplexing. Changing

military structure, worsening macroeconomic conditions, changing family

structure, and increased school enrollment all contributed to the decline

in civilian employment of blacks relative to whites. Still many of these

results simply push questions back to one further level of complexity.

Why are blacks more likely to be in the military, why are they strongly

influenced by macroeconomic fluctuations, why are family structures changing?

Perhaps the answers to these questions would also shed light on the large

residual gap we have been unable to explain.
