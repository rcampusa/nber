                                           ABSTRACT

We combine newly released individual data from the 1940 full-count census with death records
and other information available in family trees to create the largest individual data to date to
study the association between years of schooling and age at death. Conditional on surviving to
age 35, one additional year of education is associated with roughly 0.4 more years of life for both
men and women for cohorts born 1906-1915. This association is close to linear but exhibits
strong credentialing effects, particularly for men, and is substantially smaller for cohorts born
earlier. This association varies substantially by state of birth, but it is not smaller in states with
higher levels of education or longevity. For men the association is stronger in places with greater
incomes, higher quality of school, and larger investments in public health. Women also exhibit
great heterogeneity in the association, but our measures of the childhood environment do not
explain it.

1. Introduction

Educational attainment is a profound predictor of longevity. Prior studies across different

disciplines and in various countries show that those with more years of schooling had a lower

mortality risk compared to those with less education (Buckles et al. 2016; Hummer and

Hernandez 2013; Kitagawa and Hauser 1973; Lleras-Muney 2005). In the US, these educational

disparities in mortality have increased dramatically since the mid-1980s across race and gender

groups (Case and Deaton 2015, 2017; Hayward et al. 2015; Meara et al. 2008; Montez et al.

2011; Olshansky et al. 2012; Sasson 2016). Understanding the nature of this relationship and the

reasons why it is so strong and persistent is a key issue for both researchers and policy makers.



In this paper, we investigate the relationship between education and longevity, using a novel and

very large individual-level dataset for the US. We combine recently released individual data

from the 1940 full US census with death records and information from family trees in

FamilySearch. FamilySearch has a wiki-style family tree with over 1.2 billion people--the

largest collection of its kind. We study the association between years of schooling and age at

death (also referred to herein as longevity or lifespan) among more than 5 million white

individuals born in the US between 1870 and 1915 who were alive in 1940.



The majority of previous US research on the education-mortality relationship used data from the

National Vital Statistics System, survey datasets linked to the National Death Index, or census

data.1 However, these datasets have several limitations. First, although the National Vital



1
 Unlike multiple European countries (where previous studies have used large individual data sets to study this
question, e.g., Behrman et al. 2011, Lager and Torssander 2012), the US does not have national registry data.


                                                         3
Statistic System is considered the single most comprehensive data source on US mortality, it

suffers from well-known measurement errors in educational attainment. Educational attainment

available on death certificates is reported by funeral directors and other individuals instead of the

deceased. It is thus rounded (heaped) at 12 years of schooling from both lower and higher-level

education (Rostron et al. 2010; Sasson 2016). Our data rely on years of education that are

reported to the census enumerator while the person is still alive.



Second, other studies have used cross-sectional surveys linked to the National Death Index, such

as the National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality File and the National Longitudinal

Mortality Study (Case and Deaton 2017; Hayward et al. 2015; Montez et al. 2012). Educational

attainment is better measured in these surveys, but these datasets are typically limited by sample

sizes, and can only track mortality within a short period.2 Because we track the age at death in

family trees, we observe deaths occurring from 1940 until today.



We focus on individual-level longevity rather than aggregate mortality risk, within a defined

time frame, providing the first estimates of the relationship between longevity and education at

the individuals level. We find large associations between education and longevity: one more year

of schooling is associated with about half a year longer life for both men and women. We show

that estimates of the education gradient are grossly underestimated when the data are censored,

for example, when using death certificates obtained during a finite period, such as the Death

Mortality Files.




2
 Alternatively, census data has also been used in studies of the education-mortality relationship (e.g., Lleras-Muney
2005). In these studies, mortality suffers from substantial measurement error (Black et al. 2015).


                                                          4
We test the functional form of this relationship and confirm findings in previous work that

suggest important credentialing effects. We also confirm previous findings that in either logs or

levels, the education gradient in longevity diminishes with age (Crimmins 2005; Elo and Preston

1996; Kitagawa and Hauser 1973; Lynch 2003). We also find that the education gradient is

larger for more recently born cohorts (Meara et al. 2008; Montez et al. 2011; Montez et al. 2019;

Olshansky et al. 2012).



Taking advantage of the large size of our sample, we investigate whether education gradients

vary geographically and why. Recent work suggests that place of residence is a strong predictor

of mortality (Chetty et al. 2016; Deryugina and Molitor 2018; Finkelstein et al. 2019). Moreover,

Montez et al. (2019a,b) document that the association between education and mortality rates

differs by state-of-residence. We focus on state-of-birth instead to overcome the potential issue

of selective migration: education might affect the decision to migrate and where to live (Currie

and Schwandt 2016). But individuals do not choose their state-of-birth.



There is substantial variation in the association between education and longevity based on state-

of-birth. This variation across states is similar across genders but there are some important

differences. For men the education gradient in longevity is larger in places with greater

education and greater baseline longevity, whereas for women the gradient does not vary by these

baseline levels. These results do not support a simple view of decreasing returns to scale--we

can rule out that the associations fall with baseline education or longevity levels.




                                                  5
We correlate these state-level education gradients with various state-level measures to explore if

childhood circumstances modify education gradients, which previous work suggests have long-

lasting economic and health effects (Almond et al. 2018). We explore three theories. First, we

hypothesize that the returns to a year of schooling are larger in places where the quality of

education is higher. To test this, we focus on the measures of quality of schooling compiled by

Card and Kruger (1992), who first documented that the association between education and wages

was larger for men who went to school in places with greater quality of schooling. We find that

the association between education and longevity is also larger for men who went to school in

places where the quality of school was higher. But there's no such relationship for women.



Next we explore whether the education-longevity association varies depending on the level of

public health investments. On the one hand, it's possible that when mortality levels are high, and

there are few health resources that can affect health, education will matter less. In this case, we

might expect that the association between education and longevity will increase as mortality

levels fall, because more educated individuals will be more likely to use the knowledge and

technologies that cause mortality to fall. On the other hand, public health interventions like

sewers and water filtration, which lowered infant mortality in the early 1900s (Alsan and Goldin

2019; Cutler and Miller 2005), often benefit all, irrespective of education. In this case education

gradients might fall as health levels increase, because such interventions disproportionately

benefit groups with high initial mortality levels.3 Finally it is also possible that child health and

education are complements (or substitutes) in the production of adult health and mortality. We



3
 For example, Acemoglu and Johnson (2007) show that innovations like DDT and penicillin increased longevity
more in places with an initially large incidence of malaria and infectious disease that antibiotics treat. Becker,
Philipson, and Soares (2005) show these innovations lowered inequality in longevity across countries of the world.


                                                         6
find that education gradients are larger in places with more health resources for men, but not

clearly for women.



Lastly, we assess whether the education-longevity association is larger in places with greater

incomes. It's long been hypothesized that part of the association between education and

longevity (or other health measures) is due to the greater financial resources during childhood

that allow individuals to gain high levels of education and better health status. If this hypothesis

is correct, the education gradient in longevity and childhood financial resources should be

positively associated. It is also possible that education and family income are complements in the

production of adult health. For example, better fed children might benefit more from education.

We find that the education gradients are larger for those born in states with higher per capita

income for men but not for women.



2. Data and Descriptive Statistics



2.1. Data

Primary micro-level data. The primary microdata comes from the 1940 full-count US census--

the first national census to collect information on years of schooling and income for almost all

respondents, including name, place of birth and year of birth for all respondents.



These data were matched to the FamilySearch database, a genealogy platform with over 12.6

million registered users, and profiles for over 1.2 billion deceased individuals. When people

search their own family histories, they gather source documents, including census records, and



                                                  7
upload information (e.g., vital events) to the profiles of their ancestors on a genealogical website

like FamilySearch. These data include name, date of birth, date of death, dates of marriages and

links between parents and children.



Our outcome of interest is the age at death (or longevity--we use these terms interchangeably ),

which is measured in years and computed as the death year minus the birth year.4 The main

explanatory variable of interest is years of education, which ranges from zero to 17,

corresponding to five or more years of post-secondary education.



Sample selection. We exclude those born in Alaska and Hawaii (which weren't yet states), the

District of Columbia, or outside the US. We drop individuals missing information on education,

date of birth or date of death. We keep individuals who were 25 to 70 years old in 1940 (born

1870 to 1915), who by then had completed their education and were well represented. Because

blacks and individuals of other races are poorly represented in family trees, we concentrate on

individuals self-reporting as white in 1940.5 Finally we drop individuals whose age at death

appears to be implausible. Figure A1 shows the details of how we move from the original 1940

census data to the final data, which includes 5.4 million individuals.



For our analysis of the geographic moderators, we focus only on the youngest cohort born 1906

to 1915, for whom we have data on the childhood conditions in their state-of-birth. In order to




4
  Month and day of birth and death are missing for a substantial number of cases, so we rely on year of birth and
year of date only.
5
  Although about 10 percent of the population in the 1940 census is black, in the matched data they only account for
0.6 percent of the observations. Fully understanding the under-representation of black individuals in our data and its
implications for the education gradient is beyond the scope of this paper.


                                                          8
make them comparable, we restrict attention further to those who are alive at age 35. This sample

has about 1.36 million observations. Another reason to focus on this young cohort is that the

education of older cohorts is overstated in the 1940 census (Goldin 1998).



State-level data for the 1906-1915 cohort


Quality of Schooling by state. Based on issues of the Biennial Survey of Education, which

contains the results of surveys conducted by the US Office of Education from 1918 to 1966,

Card and Krueger (1992) compiled a dataset measuring the quality of public schools, based on

the ratio of enrolled students to instructional staff in the state (pupil/teacher ratio), the average

length of the school term (term length), and average annual teacher salaries. Stephens and Yang

(2014) extended the data series to birth cohorts from 1905 to 1959, using various editions of the

Digest of Educational Statistics.6 We use the average of quality measures for the 1906-1915

cohorts.


Child mortality, number of doctors and number of nurses from the 1910 census. We construct a

measure of child mortality using the 1910 census, which asked women the number of children

they ever had, and the number of children they had that died. We use the fraction of children that

died to women ages 16 to 45 as a proxy for child mortality. This measure ranges from 129 in

Iowa to 294 in New Mexico, with an average of 185 deaths per thousand.7 Using the occupation

questions in the census, we compute the total number of doctors and nurses in each state, divided



6
  The dataset is available on the journal website: https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.6.1777
7
  Official infant mortality rates by state are only available for a few states with complete birth and death registration
systems. We collected data for these states. The correlation between our measure and the 1900 infant mortality for
the 8 states (CT, MA, ME, MI, NH, NY, RI, and VT) for which official measures are available is 0.97. The
correlation in 1915 is 0.92, based on official measures from 10 states (CT, MA, ME, MI, MN, NH, NY, PA, RI, and
VT).


                                                            9
by the state population. The number of doctors per thousand ranges from 0.69 in South Carolina

to 2.15 in Colorado, averaging 1.35 across states. The number of nurses per thousand ranges

from 0.07 in Oklahoma to 0.65 in California, averaging 0.28 across states.


Per capita income by state. We use estimates of state-level per capita income (in 1929 dollars) in

1900 and 1920, reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.8 It ranges from $211 in Mississippi to

$818 in Nevada, averaging of $478.4 across states.


2.2 Summary Statistics, Representativeness and Data Quality



Summary statistics for the data are in Table 1. The average years of schooling is nine for the full

sample, 10 for the most recent cohort, and is slightly larger for women. These averages conceal

much variation. Figure A2 shows the distribution of education by gender for the 1906-1915

cohort. Although more men graduate college, many more women graduate high school. The

larger education of females for these cohorts has been documented elsewhere: women had higher

high school graduation rates in every state for every year from roughly 1910 into the 1930s

(Goldin 1998).



For the birth cohorts born between 1870 and 1915, the mean age at death is 76.2, but is five years

greater for females (79.1) than for males (73.9). For the most recent cohort, conditional on

surviving to age 35, the gender gap in longevity is six years. The increase in the gender gap is

greater if we condition on being alive at age 65 for all cohorts, consistent with the growing

survival advantage of women documented elsewhere (Barford et al. 2006; Beltrán-Sánchez et al.


8
    These data come from estimates produced by Kuznets, Miller and Easterlin (1960).



                                                         10
2015; Cullen et al. 2016; Goldin and Lleras-Muney 2019; Preston and Wang 2006).9 Figure A3

shows the entire distribution of the age at death by gender for the 1906-1915 cohort. The

distribution of longevity is not quite normal--there is a long left tail of early deaths, particularly

for males. Notably, there is no evidence in the data that there is age heaping, suggesting that the

data on dates is of high quality.



Representativeness. Figure A2 compares the distribution of education in the 1940 census and in

our matched sample, for whites born in the contiguous 48 states from 1906 to 1915. The

distributions are very similar, with few small differences: we have more individuals with exactly

8 or 12 years of schooling, whereas there are more individuals with college degrees in the full

1940 census. But the differences are small. We cannot reject the null that the distributions are

identical using the Kolmogorov­Smirnov test. (For men the p-value is 1; for women it's 0.964.)

Table A1 shows that the census-tree linked data are also representative of education for each

birth cohort born between 1906 and 1915. The sample represents roughly 10% of the original

census count. The table also shows that the census-tree linked data contains more males

compared to the 1940 full-count data. In general, it is more difficult to trace women through

historical records because their surname changes. However, our ability to track women is much

better than in other historical research.

Table A2 shows the distribution of the observations by state-of-birth for the youngest cohort.

The spatial distribution in our data differs from the distribution in the census in some important

ways. Individuals from the Midwest are over-represented in our data, whereas individuals from


9
 The gap in average longevity between men and women at age 65 rises from 2.53 for the 1876-1885 cohort to 4.48
for the 1906-1915 cohort.



                                                      11
the Northeast are underrepresented. Most notably, the most populous states (CA, NY, NJ, PA,

TX) are underrepresented in our data, with the exception of Ohio.10 These differences however

are not statistically significant--we cannot reject that the distributions are equal (p-value for

male: 0.368; for female: 0.687). We assess the sensitivity of our results to weighting schemes to

make the data nationally representative.

Quality of death information. An important consideration is whether the age at death

information in the family tree, which comes from multiple sources, is of high quality. One way

to assess this is to compare our age at death to the expected age at death reported in the Social

Security Administration (SSA) cohort life tables. These tables show that for the 1910 cohort,

conditional on surviving to age 35, average age at death is 71.61 for males and 78.54 for

females.11 In our data, the average age at death for this birth cohort is 72.69 for males and 79.62

for females, about a year higher than in the SSA data. This difference is to be expected because

blacks, immigrants and low SES individuals are less likely to be represented in our data, but are

included in SSA computations.12



We also check the quality of our data against newly released version of the 1940 census matched

to mortality records created by a research group at Berkeley, the CenSoc-Numident.13 This

database matches all individuals observed in the 1940 census to death certificates of individuals

who died between 1988 and 2005 in the Numident file held by the SSA. The match is done by


10
   This is partly due to the fact that historical records for these states are poor, whereas they are excellent in Ohio
and other midwestern states like Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Idaho. It is also likely due to the fact that second
generation immigrants are less likely to be in the family trees as are individuals of low SES.
11
   These tables are available here: https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as116/as116_Tbl_7_1910.html#wp1081274
12
   There could be other sources for the differences. The SSA computations are based only on data from states with
registration systems. The SSA attempts to make these data representative by weighting the state level data. Using
weights does not materially change our averages (weighted longevity is 79.45 for females and 72.63 for males).
13
   These data are available here: https://censoc.berkeley.edu/


                                                          12
first name, last name, year of birth, and place of birth. There are several differences between our

data and this database. First, our data contain information on the age at death from multiple

sources. As a result, our database includes deaths across all possible years, not just those

occurring 1988 to 2005. Second, our data is constructed differently, relying more on people, who

generated most of our matches to death records--not on algorithms alone. It is not clear that our

data is more accurate for any given person or group. On average, however, we expect similar

results.



Figure A4 shows the average age at death by birth cohort in the CenSoc-Numident and in our

data. To make the samples comparable in both datasets, we restrict attention to those born in the

contiguous 48 states categorized as white in the 1940 census, who died between 1988 and 2005.

The mean age at death in both datasets is very similar (differences are less than 0.5 years in all

cases), exhibiting a similar (downward) trend for men and women.14



The data differ in other dimensions. Table A3 shows how the two datasets compare. Longevity

is greater in our data, despite similarities in the preceding figure, because of differences in the

extent to which different cohorts are represented. (The CenSoc-Numident data include a larger

share of older cohorts.) The geographic distribution of the CenSoc data is also different with

more observations from the Northeast and fewer from the Midwest. We assess the extent to

which our results differ from those derived from this alternative data throughout the paper.




14
  The age at death is falling on both data because they both condition on being alive in 1940. So although more
recent cohorts live longer, older cohorts are only observed in 1940 if they lived long enough to be alive in 1940.
This selection causes the downward trend observed in both data sets.


                                                         13
3. Basic Associations Between Education and Longevity

Panel A Figure 1 shows some preliminary evidence of the association between education and

longevity in our data for the 1906-1915 cohort. It shows that the average age at death increases

with education almost linearly for both genders. Panel B further shows the estimated density of

the age at death conditional on surviving to age 35, for various education groups: no school (0),

some elementary (1-7), some high school (8-11), some college (12-15), and college plus (16+).

For both men and women, the density of longevity shifts right when education increases.



To estimate the extent of the association, we estimate the following regression model:



               = 0 + 1 ×  +   +  +  +  +                                            (1)



where the outcome y is the age at death for individual i born in year c in state s. Education is the

number of years of schooling in the 1940 census for the individual. The regression also includes

individual characteristics such as gender ( ), dummies for each birth cohort ( ), for each

state-of-birth ( ) and state-of-birth specific cohort trends ( ). 1is the coefficient of interest,

measuring the association between education and longevity, which we also refer to as the

education gradient in longevity. We report Huber-White robust standard errors clustered at the

state-of-birth level.



Table 2 shows the results for the 1906-1915 birth cohorts conditional on being alive at age 35.

Column 1 includes no covariates. Column 2 controls for cohort fixed effects. Column 3 controls

for state-of-birth fixed effects and column 4 adds state-specific linear trends. The coefficient of



                                                 14
education is positive and statistically significant in all regressions and for both genders. The

estimates are remarkably stable across columns.



Conditional on surviving to age 35, one additional year of education is associated with roughly

0.4 more years of life. Women benefited slightly more (0.43) from the education than men

(0.40)--but this difference is not statistically significant at the 5% level (p-value=0.193).

Relative to mean longevity (72.79 for men; 79.63 for women), this effect is roughly equivalent to

a 0.5 percent increase in longevity for each additional year of schooling. Alternatively, an

increase of one standard deviation in education would increase longevity by 1.2 years for both

men and women. The estimates are very similar if we weight the observations to make them

representative of the nation (column 5). Once we do this, there is no longer any difference

between genders.



We also estimate an Accelerated Failure Time model (AFT), common in demography, which

uses the log of the age at death as the dependent variable. The results from this estimation (in

Table A4) lead to similar conclusions, with one more year of education increasing longevity by

about 0.6 percent. We prefer the model in levels because the distribution of the age at death has a

fat left tail, which is less consistent with the log normal assumption.15



Data quality and effects of truncation. We now compare our results to the results one would

obtain using Berkeley's CenSoc-Numident data. Table 3 shows the results. The education

gradient in the CenSoc-Numident data is much smaller (0.088) than in our data (0.41). Columns

     In fact, the data reject both normality and log normality for the distribution of the age at death.


                                                              15
2 and 3 show this is the result of limiting the years during which deaths are observed. In column

2, we show that if we restrict our data to include only individuals who died between 1988 and

2005 then our estimates are close, where the coefficient of education is 0.104 compared to 0.088

in the CenSoc-Numident data. This suggests that the matching approach does not affect the

results.



These results show that our data is of similar quality to the CenSoc-Numident data. They also

highlight the benefit of using the census tree data. In column 3 we show that when we include all

deaths from 1941 to 2005, we get a dramatic increase in the coefficient of education, which rises

from 0.10 to 0.35. Thus, including early deaths makes a very large difference to our estimates.

Column 4 shows that if we include deaths up to 2019, the coefficient of education rises to 0.42,

another substantial (but smaller) increase.16 These results document that left and right censoring

effect a substantial attenuation in the estimates of the education gradient, because more educated

individuals are more likely to survive to 1988, and to live beyond 2005.



Estimates by cohort and age. So far, our results only show associations for the youngest cohort

in the data. Figure 2 shows the associations by cohort and survival age. For each ten-year birth

cohort, we restrict the sample so that everyone has survived to the same age: the 1906-1915

cohort is restricted to surviving to age 35, the 1896-1905 cohort is restricted to survive to age 45,

etc. Panel A of Figure 2 plots the results when gradients are estimated in levels.




16
  There are some small differences by gender. The education gradients for men are very close on both data sets
(0.099 in the CenSoc data vs 0.108 in the census-tree data). For women the CenSoc data produces lower estimates
0.0788 compared to 0.0992.


                                                       16
We find that the relationship between education and longevity is greater for more recent cohorts

than for older cohorts surviving to the same age. For example, conditional on surviving to age

55, one more year of education is associated with 0.34 years of life for the 1906-1915 cohort, but

only with 0.25 years of life for the 1896 cohort and 0.17 years of life for the 1886-1895 cohort.

The gradients are about twice as large for the more recent cohort than for cohorts born 20 years

earlier. More recent cohorts are also more highly educated--thus the gradient is increasing with

the level of education across cohorts.17



In the 1940 census educational attainment, particularly high school graduation, is overstated for

cohorts older than 35 (those born before 1905; Goldin 1998); and so caution is needed in

interpreting these results. If individuals with low levels of schooling, who lived short lives,

reported higher levels of schooling, the relationship between years of school and longevity would

likely be attenuated, since the average longevity of the highly educated group would fall as a

result of the misclassification.18 Goldin finds that these errors are smaller in states with higher

educational attainment. In Fig. A5 we show that the results are very similar among high

education states, suggesting that the increase in the education gradient across cohorts is real

rather than due to measurement error for older cohorts.



We also find that the education gradient is lower at older ages. This is true for all cohorts. For

example, with the 1906-1915 cohort, conditional on surviving to age 35, one more year of




17
   In the 1940 census, the mean education was 8.26 for the 1876-1885 cohort, 8.72 for the 1886-1895 cohort, 9.29
for the 1896-1905 cohort and 10.04 for the 1906-1915 cohort. These differences in educational attainment across
cohorts are likely to be underestimated since those with lower education are less likely to have survived to 1940.
18
   The effect of misclassification on the education gradient is ex-ante unclear. If low education individuals who live
long lives report higher education, then this would result in an over-estimation of the results.


                                                          17
education is associated with 0.41 additional years of life, but only with 0.28 years of life for

those surviving to age 65. This evidence is consistent with the idea that education plays an

important role in preventing early deaths. Analyses that condition on survival to old age will find

lower estimates of the gradient. This result confirms observations in the literature based on

alternative data and estimation methods, e.g. Kitagawa and Hauser (1973), Elo and Preston

(1996), Lynch (2003), and Crimmins (2005). These conclusions are identical if we estimate a

linear or a log linear model as shown in Panel B of Fig. 2.



4. Heterogeneity by state of birth for the 1906-1915 cohort.

Previous work has documented substantial heterogeneity in the association between education

and various health measures, including mortality by gender (Montez et al. 2011; Ross et al.

2012), race (Montez et al. 2011; Williams and Jackson 2005), overtime (Bound et al. 2015;

Cutler et al. 2015; Goldring et al. 2016; Meara et al. 2008; Olshansky et al. 2012), and state-of-

residence (Montez et al. 2019; Montez et al. 2019). In this section, we focus on spatial variation

by state-of-birth. Because we only have state-level data for the most recent cohort (1906-1915),

this analysis focuses on them.



We estimate education gradients by state of birth and gender, controlling for birth cohort

dummies as in Eq. 1 above. The estimated coefficients on education are positive and statistically

significant for both men and women in all states. However, there is wide variation (Fig. A6).

Table A5 shows the top ten and bottom ten states ranked based on the education gradient. In

Utah (the top state), one more year of education is associated with 0.72 additional years of life,

whereas in New Mexico (the bottom state) one more year of education is associated with only



                                                 18
0.25 more years of life. Moving from the bottom 10th percentile of the education distribution to

the 90th yields 4.3 more years of life in Utah but only 2.3 in New Mexico. These large

differences are statistically significant at the 5% level, and similar if we estimate gradients based

on a log model (Panel B). Utah remains the top state even when we account for the fact that life

expectancy in Utah is long. Similarly, New Mexico and South Dakota are the two bottom states

in either levels or percentages.



Figure 3 documents this variation in space by gender. For men education gradients were

generally larger in the West and Northeast, as well as in Indiana and Ohio. The associations are

smaller in the South, except for Florida and Louisiana, and in many states in the middle of the

country. In general, states with large associations for men also have large associations for women

(Fig. A7). But there are noticeable exceptions. In California, Louisiana and Florida the

associations between education and longevity are very small for women but above average for

men. Conversely in Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri, the association is large for women, but

small for men. Overall and quite surprisingly the correlation in the male and female education

gradient across states is small (0.26). Thus, while the overall gradient is not different by gender,

there appear to be large differences in why/when education is associated with longevity, differing

by gender and space.



In Fig. A8, we explore whether these gradients are stable over time. To do this, we re-estimate

the gradient conditioning on survival to age 65 for all cohorts. Then we correlate the gradient for

the 1904-1915 cohort with the gradient for the oldest 1876-1885 cohort. Surprisingly, the

gradients are not very related. The relationship is positive and statistically significant for males




                                                  19
(regression coefficient = 0.286, p = 0.012) but negative and not significant for females

(regression coefficient = -0.115, p = 0.227). This suggests that there were significant changes

throughout the period affecting the association between education and longevity. These changes

led to greater associations for more recent cohorts and to different associations based on state of

birth. This suggests that environmental characteristics, which were changing throughout the

period, resulted in vastly different education gradients.



We now explore reasons for this heterogeneity.



One possible explanation is that the association between education and longevity exhibits

decreasing returns to scale, with greater "returns" at low levels of education. To test this, Fig. A9

panel A plots the gradients by state-of-birth against the average level of education in the state for

the same cohorts. Contrary to expectations, for men, the education gradients are larger in places

where education was already great to begin with. A regression estimates that for men, one more

year of education increases the education gradient by 0.11, a very large increase relative to the

mean association of 0.5. By contrast, for women, the education gradient is flat and does not vary

with the level of education.19 Thus for neither men nor women do we find that the gradient is

smaller when education is greater.



Panel B investigates a related hypothesis: that the education gradient decreases when longevity

increases. Again we find that for men the education gradient is greater in places with greater



19
  The slope of the regression of the education gradient on years of education is 0.1072 (p < 0.001) for men and
0.0118 (p=0.528) for women. We can reject the relationship is negative for men ( p < 0.001) but not for women (p =
0.264)


                                                        20
longevity, though this association is not statistically significant. For women, we find a small

decrease, but the decrease is not statistically significant either. These results are very similar if

we estimate state- and cohort-specific gradients and plot them against education or longevity

levels (Fig. A10). Thus, the evidence does not support the hypothesis that there are decreasing

returns based on education or longevity levels.



Next, we explore whether the returns to education vary with the quality of education. To test this,

we make use of state-level data containing quality of schooling measures. Note that education

levels and quality of education are only mildly correlated ­there is variation in the quality of

schooling within the same level of education.20 Figure 4 plots the estimated education gradients

by gender against our measures of quality: relative teacher wages, length of school term and

pupil-teacher ratios. For males all three measures strongly predict education gradients (Panel A).

Put otherwise, when teachers were well paid, the school year was long, and pupil-teacher ratios

were low, men who went to school longer benefited more from schooling in terms of their

longevity. The results for men are consistent with the findings of Frisvold and Golderstein

(2011) who show, using the same measures of quality of school, that higher quality of education

led to greater health gradients among Blacks born between 1930 and 1950 in the South.



However, Panel B shows that the same does not hold true for women. Quality of schooling

measures exhibit only a weak association with the education gradient. Table A6 shows these

results quantitatively. If we regress education gradients on school measures, individually or

jointly, the regressors are statistically significant predictors for men, but not for women.


20
  The correlation between years of education and relative teacher wages is 0.18, 0.22 for term length and -0.19 for
pupil teacher ratios.


                                                         21
The second hypothesis is that the education gradient varies with the level of health resources. We

use three measures observed in 1910: child mortality, number of doctors and number of nurses.

Figure 5 shows the results. For men (Panel A), we find that the education gradient is larger in

places with better resources (lower child mortality, higher number of doctors or nurses). But

again these associations are much more muted for women. Panel B of Table 6 confirms these

findings. Male gradients are statistically significantly correlated with all three measures, most

notably with the number of nurses. These findings support the hypothesis that innovation

increases health inequality consistent with the "fundamental causes of disease" hypothesis by

Link ant Phelan (1995) and Link et al. (1998) and documented by Glied and Lleras-Muney

(2008). But only the number of doctors predicts education gradients for women, and jointly we

cannot reject that all three measures do not matter for women's gradients.



The last hypothesis we explore is that health associations are larger in richer states, measured by

per capita income. Figure 6 shows that this is true for men but not for women. Panel C of Table

A6 again confirms the associations are statistically significant for men but not women.



In sum, for men, we find that the large variation in education gradients across state-of-birth can

be explained by differences across states in the quality of schooling, the level of public health

resources and state-level incomes. However, this section ends with a puzzle. Although education

is equally predictive of longevity for women and men, the spatial variation in the education

gradient is quite different by gender, and we found no early life indicators explaining this

variation for women. Indeed, if we regress the education gradients at the state level on all state




                                                 22
characteristics (Table A7), we find that the r-squared in this regression is high for men (0.57),

and much lower for women (0.18). We return to this question in the discussion section.



5. Testing for linear relationships

So far, we have estimated linear relationships between education and longevity (or its log).

However, a large literature has argued that there are important credentialing effects. Because in

our data we observe education as a continuous measure ranging from 0 to 17, we can estimate

strict non-parametric models of the education-longevity relationship, and test whether this

relationship is linear or subject to credentialing (or sheepskin) effects. A close look at Fig. 1

panel A suggests that while the relationship looks linear, there are visible jumps at 1, 8, 12 and

16 years of education, though these jumps are much more visible for men than for women.



To investigate this, for the youngest cohort, we estimate a fully non-parametric model, where 0 is

the left-out category. We include a dummy for every single year of school. The models control

for state-of-birth dummies, year-of-birth dummies, and state-of-birth-specific linear trends, and

are estimated separately by gender. The estimated coefficients are plotted in Fig. 7 Panel A.

(The point estimates are in Table A8.) These estimates show that for men the relationship

between education and longevity is best described as a series of step functions with increases at

1, 8, 12 and 16, and no increases in between. For women the relationship is more linear before 8

years of school, but becomes a step function thereafter. Results from the CenSoc-Numident are

similar for both men and women (Fig. A11). Table A9 shows that we reject the linear

specification for both men and women for the full range, but not for education levels between 1

and 6.



                                                  23
In Table A10 we present the fit of different models: a fully non-parametric model, a linear

model, and a model with splines at exactly 8, 12 and 16 years of school, which correspond to

concrete degrees. We show four measures of fit: the adjusted r-square, the AIC, the BIC and the

mean squared error from a cross-validation exercise.21 The spline model provides the best fit

(highest adjusted r-square, lowest AIC, BIC or MSE) for both men and women. However, the

linear model still provides an excellent fit: our fit measures do not improve much by moving

from the linear to the spline or the non-parametric model.



Figure 7 Panel B shows the evolution of the gradient for different cohorts that results from

estimating the non-parametric model for various cohorts, restricting all cohorts to survival to age

65 so the numbers are comparable across cohorts. Several conclusions emerge. First there is a

very large difference in the pattern between men and women. The associations for women are

quite close to linear for almost all cohorts. For men credentialing effects are much more

important. For men in more recent cohorts the increases in longevity associated with 8, 12 and 16

years of school are larger. This results in a fanning out of the relationship: there are very few

differences across cohorts for low levels for schooling but an increasingly large difference at

higher levels of schooling across cohorts. For women, instead, we observe that there are larger

associations for more recent cohorts for almost all levels of schooling. Overall the gradients are

larger for more recent cohorts consistent with our earlier findings.22



21
   We use a 10-fold cross-validation process to compute the MSE. Specifically, we first randomly shuffle the dataset
and split it into 10 groups. For each unique group, we take the group as a holdout, estimate the model on the
remaining groups, compute the MSE based on all groups, and store the mean MSE. We then take the average of
these 10 mean MSE.
22
   Figure A12 shows these conclusions hold if we estimate the gradients for high education states to minimize the
effect of measurement error for older cohorts.


                                                        24
6. Discussion

This paper uses a new individual-level dataset to study the association between years of

schooling and longevity in the US across white cohorts born between 1870 and 1915. We find

that education gradients are large, grew across cohorts, and get smaller as individuals age. We

also find that the relationship is close to linear, particularly for women, though there are

important credentialing effects, particularly for men.



This evidence on the functional form of the education-longevity relationship is mostly consistent

with existing evidence. Previous studies have depict a linear decline in mortality risk as

education increases from 0 to 11, a step-change reduction upon attainment of a high school

diploma, and then another steeper linear decline with more years of education (Backlund et al.

1999; Everett et al. 2013; Hayward et al. 2015; Montez et al. 2012). However, we have several

new findings. First, for older cohorts, the relationship is almost flat for men whereas it is graded

for women in all the birth cohorts we examine. Second, credentialing matters more for men.

Third, the "returns" to high levels of education (college) rose quite substantially across cohorts,

again despite the fact that more people are attending college.



We document extensive heterogeneity in this association by gender, cohort and state-of-birth. As

Hayward et al. (2015) note "...there is no inherent causal association between educational

attainment and adult mortality; instead, the causal association is dependent upon time, place, and

social environment under study." Our findings are very much in line with this observation.




                                                 25
We observe there is a substantial increase in the association across cohorts, particularly at the

upper end of the education distribution. This evidence is consistent with the increase in the

education gradients in mortality documented later in the 20th century (Crimmins and Saito 2001;

Feldman et al. 1989; Lauderdale 2001; Meara et al. 2008; Montez et al. 2011; Montez et al.

2019; Olshansky et al. 2012; Pappas et al. 1993; Preston and Elo 1995). Many recent analyses of

these trends rely on comparisons over time across fixed education categories. As a result many

have debated whether these trends are real, or if they reflect changes in the composition of the

population within each education category (Bosworth 2018; Bound et al. 2015; Case and Deaton

2017; Cutler et al. 2011; Dowd and Hamoudi 2014; Goldring et al. 2016; Novosad et al. 2020).

Our results show that one more year of schooling has a larger return for more recent cohorts,

who have greater mean schooling levels, suggesting these increases in disparities are real rather

than due to composition effects.



We investigate the sources of heterogeneity across space and show that for men the variation in

the association across states is related to environmental conditions in their state-of-birth. But the

same is not true for women. In fact, this paper documents that the dynamics of the gradient are

substantially different for men and women. While the association is very large for both genders,

the association for men can be much more easily explained by variation in their childhood

circumstances. For women we also observe substantial heterogeneity, but it is not so easily

explained.



Why is the education gradient in longevity moderated by environmental conditions for men but

not women? We hypothesize that women are less sensitive to conditions while growing up and




                                                 26
that this might explain why gradients are unaffected by these conditions. It has long been

hypothesized that males are less biologically buffered than females against the environment

during growth and development (Stinson 1985). A few recent studies however find some support

for this hypothesis. For example, Doblhammer et al. (2013) find that the effects of being born

during the 1866-68 Finnish famine on longevity were large for men but not noticeable for

women. Similarly, Lindeboom et al. (2010) find that children exposed in utero to the Dutch

Potato famine of 1846-47 had lower longevity, with much larger effects for men. Van den Berg

et al. (2016) find that undernutrition between conception and age 4 lowers heights among adult

men, but not adult women. Bertrand et al. (2013) find that boys do particularly poorly in

disadvantaged environments, and they appear to be more sensitive to inputs. Consistent with

these findings, Autor et al. (2019) find that family disadvantage appears to affect boys'

educational attainment more than girls'. However, not all research finds differences. For

example, Magnusni et al (2016) find no statistically significant differences in the effects of early

childhood education interventions, though the point estimates favor larger effects among girls.

This male-sensitivity hypothesis related to the large differences in longevity by gender. While

environmental forces play an important role in explaining gender gaps in longevity, it is well

documented that there are biological differences that disadvantage males in many domains

(Kraemer 2000).



Even if the male-sensitivity hypothesis is borne out, it still provides no insight on why there is

variation in the education gradients for women. We hypothesize that for women factors like

marriage markets and fertility play a large role in moderating the relationship between education

and mortality. For example, until the mid 1930s maternal mortality was very large in the US. If




                                                 27
more educated women had fewer births, and had them at different ages, then this would result in

an education gradient in mortality, both directly through maternal mortality and indirectly since

births can have long-term health consequences (like fistulae) that affect the longevity of women

who survive past reproductive ages.



Lastly it is possible that gender differences are due to differences in the quality of the data by

gender. If we regress our estimates of the education gradients on the fraction of the population

that is represented in our data (shown in Table A2) we find that the gradients for women are

larger in states for which our match is better (beta = 0.0154, p value: 0.026) but not for men. We

also find whether individuals migrate and where they migrate is a function of gender, education

and its interaction.23 Women are in fact more likely to move, and thus our measures of the

environment they grow up in might be mismatched. Thus, sample selection and differential

migration might play an important role in explaining gender differences as well. Understanding

these gender differences is an important direction for future research.

This paper has a few limitations. Ideally one would construct cohort-specific measures of

childhood conditions--we have done so as much as possible. Data on nutrition and pollution

levels would also be valuable--we have only investigated heterogeneity along a few dimensions.

Further, we investigate heterogeneity based on state-of-birth. It would be helpful to investigate

how many people grow up in the state where they are born; as would replicating the analysis of

Montez et al (2011), which compared the effects of state-of-birth and state-of-residence. Finally,

we note that we have not documented any causal relationship between education and longevity.

Note: Descriptive statistics were calculated based on whites born in the 48 states. In parentheses
are standard deviations. We computed state specific child mortality (the number of deaths per
1000 live births) as the fraction of children that died among the number of children women ages
16-45 ever had based on the 1910 full census. We also calculated the average state-specific
number of physicians/surgeons and nurses per 1000 population based on the occupation variable
using the 1910 and 1920 full census. State-level per capita income is the average per capita
income between 1900 and 1920.

Note: In parentheses are standard deviations.
The CenSoc-Numident data include 6,824,036 individuals, among which 50% are females, and
93.19% are whites. Since this data only provides death records between 1988 and 2005, the mean
age at death is 75.75, with a standard deviation equals to 9.07 and a range (47, 121).
We first restricted the CenSoc-Numident dataset to those born 1906-1915 in 48 U.S. states (N=
1,214,847) and then merged it to the 1940 Full Census. All 1,214,847 observations from the
CenSoc-Numident can be matched to the census. However, there are disagreements with respect
to race between Census and CenSoc data; 94.75% (N= 1,151,073) identify themselves as white
based on Census, while 86.63% (N=1,052,530) people consider themselves as white in both
Census and CenSoc. To be consistent with the definition of our Census-Tree data, we restricted
to whites using the self-reported race from the Census only. We further excluded those missing
years of education and included 1,134,687 in the analyses.

Notes: Analytic sample includes whites born between 1806 and 1915 in the 48 states who were
alive at age 35 (N=1,362,469). We estimate a linear regression model stratified by state of birth
to estimate the state specific returns to education, and to report the increase in longevity when
education increases from the 10th percentile to 90th percentile. Estimates of state-specific returns
to education on longevity reported in the table adjust for gender, and birth cohort fixed effects.

Note: Analytic sample includes whites born between 1906 and 1915 in the 48 states surviving to
age 35. We included dummies of exact years of education (no education as the reference) in the
non-parametric model, included a continuous measure of years of education in the linear model,
and used the following knots for the spline regression model: years of education=1, 7, 8, 11, 12,
15, and 16. All models control for gender (not in the stratified analyses by gender), state of birth
fixed effects, year of birth fixed effects, and state of birth specific linear trends. Standard errors
are clustered at the state-of-birth level. MSE stands for Mean Squared Error, which is calculated
from 10-fold cross validation. AIC denotes Akaike Information Criterion, and BIC represents
Bayesian Information Criterion. Based on BIC measures, the spline model is the preferred model
to depict the relationship between educational attainment and longevity.

Estimates are based on CenSoc-Numident from UC Berkeley and Census-Tree data used in this
study. The analytic sample include whites born 1906-1915 in the 48 states, and who died
between 1988 and 2005. In the Censoc-Numident data and in our data the race is defined using
the race reported in the 1940 census. There are 1,134,687 observations in CenSoc-Numident, and
627,200 observations in Census Tree. This figure shows a downwards trend in average longevity
by birth cohorts. The primary reason is the survival bias. Those born in 1870 were 70 years old
in the 1940 census, while those born in 1910 were only 30.

figures show the coefficient of education, from regressions controlling for gender, birth cohort
dummies, state of birth dummies, and state of birth specific time trends. Each estimate comes
from a separate regression. We always restrict the sample so that all the individuals in a given
cohort are restricted to have survived to the same age. States with above-median average
education are included in the high state education group.

includes whites born in 48 states and survived to age 65. Coefficients ( ) and standard errors
(SE) are from a weighted OLS regression of education gradients for 1906-1915 cohorts on
education gradients for 1876-1885 cohorts

Fig. A9 Education gradients by level of education and longevity. Matched 1940-family tree data.
Sample includes only whites born 1906-1915 in the 48 states of the US and survived to age 35.
See text for details. N=1,362,469. Coefficients ( ) and standard errors (SE) are from a weighted
OLS regression of education gradients on state-level average education or longevity, with the
weights equal to the inverse of standard errors of estimated gradients.

Fig. A10. Returns to education on longevity by level of education and longevity
Estimates by state of birth and cohort. Each point denotes returns to education for specific
state*cohort cell (48 states by 5 birth cohort groups with two birth cohorts per group). Sample
includes only whites born 1906-1915 in the 48 states of the US and survived to age 35.
Coefficients ( ) and standard errors (SE) are from a weighted OLS regression of education
gradients on state-cohort level average education or longevity, with the weights equal to the
inverse of standard errors of estimated gradients.

Fig. A11 Education gradients in longevity using CenSoc-Numident and Census-Tree Data. Analytic samples from CenSoc and
Census-Tree data include whites born 1906-1915 in the 48 states and died 1988-2005. All models include a complete set of dummies
for exact years of education (zero year of education as the reference) and adjust for state-of-birth fixed effects, year-of-birth fixed
effects, and state-of-birth specific linear trends.

Fig. A12 Non-parametric estimates of the education-longevity relationship by gender, and birth
cohort, and state-level education. The figure reports the coefficients from a regression of age at
death on dummies for each single year of school, controlling for state of birth dummies, year of
birth dummies and state-of-birth specific linear trend. The excluded category is 0 years of school.
The 1906-1915/1986-1905/1886-1895/1876-1885 samples includes only whites born in the 48
states of the US who survived to age 65. States with above-median average education are
included in the high state education group.
