       Existing general equilibrium models based on traditional expected utility preferences have
been unable to explain the excess return predictability observed in equity markets, bond markets,
and foreign exchange markets. In this paper, we abandon the expected-utility hypothesis in favor
of preferences that exhibit first-order risk aversion. We incorporate these preferences into a
general equilibrium two-country monetary model, solve the model numerically, and compare the
quantitative implications of the model to estimates obtained from U.S. and Japanese data for
equity, bond and foreign exchange markets. Although increasing the degree of first-order risk
aversion substantially increases excess return predictability, the model remains incapable of
generating excess return predictability sufficiently large to match the data. We conclude that the
observed patterns of excess return predictability are unlikely to be explained purely by time-
varying risk premiums generated by highly risk averse agents in a complete markets economy.

1. Introduction
         It is generally accepted that excess returns on a variety of assets are predictable. This is

true for returns in the equity markets, bond markets, and foreign exchange markets of various

countries. One interpretation of this evidence is that equilibrium risk premiums on all assets are

highly variable.     Yet, existing rational expectations general equilibrium models based on

traditional expected utility preferences have been unable to generate risk premiums that are

sufficiently variable to be consistent with the observed predictability of returns.

         Consequently, in this paper we abandon the expected-utility hypothesis in favor of

preferences that exhibit first-order risk aversion.'         With these    preferences,    agents are
substantively averse to even small gambles. Hence, a small degree of uncertainty in the

exogenous environment of economic agents can potentially induce relatively large fluctuations

in agents' intertemporal marginal rates of substitution. This, in turn, implies large fluctuations

in expected rates of return on a variety of assets. Our goal is to determine whether a general

equilibrium model incorporating preferences that exhibit first-order risk aversion is quantitatively

consistent with the predictability of returns and with other time series properties observed in the

data from the foreign exchange market, the equity markets, and the bond markets of the U.S. and

Japan.

         Other papers that propose first-order risk aversion as an explanation for asset pricing

anomalies include Epstein and Zin (1990, 1991) and Bonomo and Garcia (1993). In particular,

Epstein and Zin (1991) are unable to reject the overidentifying restrictions implied by a closed

economy model, analogous to. the model of Hansen and Singleton (1982), when first-order risk


      The concept of first-order risk aversion was intmduced by Segal and Spivak (1990).
aversion is assumed. Their approach requires the researcher to choose a proxy for the
unobservable rate of return on aggregate wealth, and their inference about the validity of the

model depends on this choice. In an open economy setting, the choice of a proxy for the return

on aggregate wealth is problematic. Hence, we do not follow the approach of Epstein and Zin

(1991). Instead of testing the first-order conditions of the model, we explicitly solve a two-

country monetary model for the endogenous moments of interest.

       In our model, consumption of two goods equals the outputs of two countries, which are

assumed to be exogenous endowment streams. The two money supplies are also exogenous. The

growth rates of these exogenous processes follow a discrete Markov chain that is estimated from

U.S and Japanese data using the method of Tauchen and Hussey (1991). The equilibrium

processes for returns and other endogenous variables are found by numerically solving a system

of Euler equations. Having solved the model, we generate a variety of statistics that provide

evidence on the predictability of the model's returns. The performance of the model is evaluated

by comparing these statistics to the corresponding statistics in the data.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present evidence

on the predictability of excess rates of return in the dollar-yen foreign exchange market, in the

dollar and yen discount bond markets, and in the equity markets. These stylized facts provide

the set of statistics that we would like the model to match. In section 3, we discuss intuitively

why time-varying equilibrium risk premiums could be an explanation of the statistics described

in section 2. Section 4 introduces the concept of first-order risk aversion, and section 5

incorporates these preferences into a formal dynamic model. In section 6 we derive the model's

equilibrium conditions for endogenous financial variables. Section 7 describes our procedure for


                                                2
calibrating the model, and section 8 presents our results. Section 9 compares our results with

Epstein and Zin (1991), and section 10 provides concluding comments.

2. Some Stylized Facts on Excess Return Predictability
        In this section we document the predictability of excess rates of return on discount bonds,

equities, and foreign money markets using regression analysis. Since U.S. and Japanese data are

the exogenous processes of the model, we report results only for these two countries.
Nevertheless, the evidence is consistent across the markets of most developed countries as

documented by the recent empirical studies of Harvey (1991), Bekaert and Hodrick (1992, 1993).

and Solnik (1993). among others.

        We begin by developing notation for own-counuy money market and equity investments.

Let I (I') be the dollar (yen) return at time t+1 from investing one dollar (yen) at time t in the

nominally risk-free dollar (yen) bond. Let R÷1 (R÷1) be the analogous one-period dollar (yen)

return in the equity market of the U.S. (Japan). Throughout the paper, lower case letters will

represent either the natural logarithms of upper case counterparts or variables measured as

continuously compounded rates of return. Hence, the continuously compounded excess dollar

(yen) rate of return in the U.S. (Japanese) equity market is r1 -           i       - it). The conditional

expectation of an excess return is often referred to in the literature as a risk premium, and we

will use this terminology interchangeably with expected excess return.2




    1
        An excess raze of return is the nominal rate of return on an asset in excess of the short-term interest
rate. If inflation is stochastic, conditional expectations of excess rates of return will be non-zero even if
agents ait risk neutral, which makes use of the term "risk premium" for these conditional expectations
somewhat imprecise. Engel (1992) provides a recent discussion of this issue for the risk premium in the
foreign exchange market

                                                      3
A. The Foreign Exchange Market

        If S1 is the spot exchange rate at date t of dollars per yen, the dollar return to investing

one dollar in the yen money market and bearing the foreign exchange risk is                Let F be

the forward exchange rate of dollars per yen quoted at date I for date C-i-i transactions. Then, the

dollar return to investing one dollar in the yen money market and eliminating the foreign

exchange risk with a forward contract is F1t/S1. Since this investment also provides a risk-free

return of dollars, covered interest arbitrage implies interest rate parity:

                                         i —i? tç —St.                                          (1)

The right-hand side of equation (I) is the continuously compounded forward premium or discount

in the foreign exchange market. Notice that the continuously compounded excess dollar rate of

return from investing in the Japanese money market is i + s,÷ - s, - if, which from equation (1)

SH-tfI
       A common way of testing the predictability of the excess rate of return on an uncovered

foreign money market investment is to regress the excess return on the forward premium:

                                    —          +   3(f, — s)   +                                (2)

The null hypothesis that the excess rate of return is unpredictable implies       = 0. If the point

estimate of f3 differs significantly from zero, there is evidence that cx ante excess rates of return

vary over time. In the empirical analysis we focus on a quarterly holding period Since that is the




                                                   4
 frequency we use for the exogenous processes in simulating the model.3 The sample period for

 our exchange rate data is January 1976 to December 1989. The data are described more

completely in Appendix A.

         The rt row of Table 1, Panel A. displays the regression results for equation (2) using
the three-month forward premium as the predictor. As is typical in the literature, the
                                                                                       slope
coefficient of -4.016 is significantly negative.4 The R2 for the regression is .22, and the standard

deviation of the fitted value of the excess return, reported in Table 1. Panel B. is 12.36%.'

These statistics indicate that excess returns are quite predictable and risk premiums are quite

variable.

B. The Discount Bond Market

        Similar evidence of predictable excess holding period rates of return can be found in the

discount bond market using a forward premium computed from bond prices as a predictor.
Specifically, let V denote the date t price of a nominally risk-free pure discount bond which

pays one unit of currency at date t+k. When necessary to avoid confusion, there will be a

superscript $ or V symbol on V, to denote the currency. Let i, be the continuously compounded

yield to maturity on a k-period bond expressed in percent per period. By definition.



      The availability of monthly observations on the three-month holding pexiod allows us to use
additional observations that increase the power of the tests but induce autoconelation in the errors. As
in Hansen and Hodrick (1980), the standard errors in Table I allow for the autoconelation induced by the
overlapping error stiucwre and, additionally, for possible conditional heteroskedasticity as in Hansen
(1982).

       For the dollar values of other major foreign currencies, the estimated coefficients are also
significantly below zero. Similar results arise in regressions using non-dollar exchange rates as
demonstrated in Bekaert (1992) and Hodrick (1992). Bossaerts and Billion (1991) use French franc
exchange rates and find slope coefficients that are all less than zero, but not all are significantly negative.

      All rates of retum in this paper are expressed in percentage points per annum.

                                                      5

Let the one-period continuously compounded holding period rate of return on a k-period bond

realized at time t+l be h,+ = ln(V1.fV), which from equation (3) can be written as

                                             = —(k —          +                                          (4)
                                                                  Ida.

       In the empirical analysis we examine the one-period excess holding period rate of return

on a two-period bond, Ii.4.3 - i1, in a regression analogous to equation (2). For parallel structure,

we define the forward premium in the bond market, denoted tb,                       as   the logarithm of the

contractual price today for a one-period bond delivered one period from now minus the logarithm

of the price today of a one-period bond:
                            fb1 =   ln(VJV1) —ln(V1) =                   +                               (5)
                                                              —2i13          2i1.

The bond market analogue to equation (2) is


                                    hi.ia   ii =       + i1(1) +                                         (6)

If excess holding period returns are unpredictable, f3 should be zero.
       In rows two and three of Table I, we report estimates of equation (6) for the U.S. dollar

and Japanese yen discount bond markets. Since our timing interval is one quarter, h;+ia is the

three-month return on a six-month bond and ft is the forward premium on a three-month bond

to be purchased three months in the future. For the empirical analysis we have monthly

observations on three-month and six-month Euro-dollar and Euro-yen interest rates from October

1975 to June 1990.

       For both the dollar and the yen markets, the estimate of                      is -0.45, and both are



                                                     6
significantly negative.6 While the estimated l's are not as negative as the estimates from the

foreign exchange market, there is strong evidence of predictability of the excess rates of return.

The R2 for the U.S. market is .03. and the R2 for the yen market is .09. The standard deviations

of the fitted values of the excess returns in the two markets are 0.3 18% for the U.S. and 0.370%

for Japan. These statistics are much smaller than those in the foreign exchange market.

C. The Equity Markets

        A similar set of results emerges from examining excess rates of return in equity markets.

We focus on results in Bekaert and Hodrick (1992), who show that excess rates of return to U.S.

and foreign equities are predicted by the forward premium in the foreign exchange market.

Consistent with our two-country framework, we construct a dollar world equity market excess

rate of return as an equally-weighted avenge of the dollar excess rates of returns on the equity

markets of the U.S. and Japan:


                          —
                                = [(rti — i1) + (r,1      —
                                                              i7) + (s— f1)](1/2).                (7)

We regress this excess return on the three-month forward premium in the dollar-yen foreign

exchange market:
                                    —
                                        i15
                                              =   I3 + J3(f   —   +                               (8)

The fourth row of Table 1. Panel A, reports a slope coefficient of -3.543, with a standard error

of 0.816. As equation (7) indicates, there are three components to this world equity excess rate

of return: the excess dollar rate of return in the U.S. equity market, the excess yen rate of return

in the Japanese equity market, and the excess rate of return in the foreign exchange market. The

data.

regression of the thiixi component on the forward premium is discussed above. Regressions of

the fhst two components on the forward premium are contained in rows five and six of Table

1, Panel A. Each of the components has a negative slope coefficient, and all but the Japanese

equity coefficient are significantly negative.

3. Time-Varying Risk Premiums
        The patterns of predictability in excess returns documented above can, in principle, be

explained by time variation in equilibrium risk premiums.' Our paper considers this point of

view. In this section we formally relate the regression evidence of the previous section to time-

variation in risk premiums using a decomposition of the forward premium introduced by Fama

(1984a). We then discuss what is required from an equilibrium model if it is to be consistent

with the patterns observed in the data.'

        Define the logarithmic risk premium in the foreign exchange market as rp E(s) -

Following Fama (1984a), the forward premium can be decomposed into the expected rate of




    'The literature modelling asset returns as the outcome of a dynamic, stochastic equilibrium is too vast
to be reviewed here. Examples of recent papers that model excess returns in foreign exchange markets
using approaches related to that used in this paper include Backus, Gregory, and Telrner (1992). Bansal,
Gallant. Hussey and Tauchen (1991), and Bekaert (l993a.b). Kandel and Stambaugh (1991) use a similar
approach to model excess returns in equity markets,

    'There are at least two other potential explanations of the data, which we take seriously but do not
pursue in this paper. First, the stylized facts may not be representative of the true population distributions.
Rather, they may be examples of problems in statistical inference caused by the adoption of a rational
expectations perspective in non-experimental data, Such problems could be caused by infrequent regime
changes, learning, peso problems, data snooping biases, and so forth. Second, these stylized facts may
be evidence of market inefficiency.

depreciation of the dollar relative to the yen minus this risk premium:

                                                                 —
                                   fp1 E   f1   —; = E1(As1,,)       rp1,                        (9)

where A is the first difference operator.

         Now, consider the regression of s - 1, on a constant and fp1, as in equation (2). By

rational expectations.     - = rp, +            where the   innovation, +. is orthogonal to the time
infonnation set. Consequently, only the risk premium covaries with the regressor in equation (2).

and the slope coefficient in that regression is


               = cov(s,,1 —f1, fp1) =               cov(rp1, E1(6s1,1)) — var(rp,)
                                                                                                (10)
                       var(fp1)         var(E1(6.s141)) + var(rpj — 2cov(rp. E1(As.1))

         A decomposition similar to equation (9) can be performed for the bond market. Define

the risk premium in the bond market to be rb1 E.(ht+ia - iJ. Then, the forward premium in the

bond market, fbi. can be decomposed into the expected rate of change of the logarithm of the

one-period bond price minus the risk premium:

                                        lb1      E1(Av11) — rb1,                                (11)

where v÷1 = In(V11). The slope coefficient in equation (6) would then be given by an expression

analogous to equation (10) with rp replaced by rb, and As.M replaced by Av+1.

         Clearly, if var(rp,) = 0, the slope coefficient in equation (2) is zero. Similarly, if var(rb)

= 0,   the slope coefficient in equation (6) is zero. To generate the negative slope coefficients

found in the data, the risk premiums rp and rb1 must vary through time, The decomposition (10)

provides inwition regarding the amount of time-variation in risk premiums required to match the

data. Consider first the case of foreign exchange. The explained variance in regression (2) is

vr(fp1). so the finding of        C-I implies

                                                     9
                                       var(rp1) > var(fpj.                                   (12)

Furthermore. if j3 c -1, equation (10) implies

                        var(rp1) > cov(rp1, E1(as1,1)) > var(E1(As1,1)).                     (13)

Hence, regression results like those in the actual data require that the risk premium in the foreign

exchange market be more variable than the expected rate of depreciation and that the risk

premium and the expected rate of depreciation covaiy positively. Similarly, since the slope

coefficient for the equity market regression is comparable to that in the foreign exchange market

regression, the implied variability of the equity risk premium is comparable to the implied

variability of the risk premium in the foreign exchange market

       In the case of the bond market regressions (6), the estimated slope coefficients are

insignificantly different from -0.5. Equation (10), applied to the dollar and yen bond markets,
then implies


                                    va4E1(av11))      var(rb)                                (14)

That is, the variabilities of the risk premiums in the two bond markets are roughly equal to the

variabilities of the expected rates of change of the logarithmic bond prices.

       The general asset pricing framework of Hansen and Richard (1987) provides insight into

what is needed from an equilibrium model if it is to generate the requisite time-variation in risk

premiums. Let R,1 denote an arbitrary dollar return realized in period t+1 from investing one
dollar at time t. Hansen and Richard (1987) show that there exists a stochastic discount factor,

In equilibrium models with effectively complete markets, QL equals each agent's intertemporal

marginal rate of substitution of wealth divided by the gross rate of change in the dollar price

level.

           Equation (15) implies that substantial time variability in excess returns can be achieved

only if there is substantial time-variation in the conditional second moments of the joint (Rt÷1.

    } process, which. in turn, requires substantial volatility in the marginal rate of substitution.'°

One way of generating highly volatile marginal rates of substitution is to assume that agents have

a high degree of risk aversion. In effect, the extreme nonlinearity associated with high risk
aversion can transform the uncertainty due to conditionally homoskedastic exogenous inputs into

endogenous risky asset returns whose moments are conditionally quite variable. Alternatively.

high volatility in marginal rates of substitution can be generated by directly assuming time-
varying conditional heteroskedasticity in the exogenous driving processes (as in Bekaert

(1993b))J'
           It should be noted that increasing the variance of risk premiums is not sufficient to insure



    'Hansen and Richard (1987) require that (i) the space of portfolio payoffs is a Hilbert space of square
integrable random variables, and (ii) there axe no arbitrage opportunities.
    '° Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) develop restrictions on the mean and variance of the intertemporal
marginal rate of substitution implied by the stochastic properties of observed asset returns. Cochrane and
Hansen (1992) use this methodology to survey equilibrium approaches to asset pricing. They demonstrate
how difficult it Is to generate sufficient variability in Q within the context of an equilibrium model.

    "In principle, these two approaches could be combined. For the model of this paper, however.
incorporating time-vaiying conditional heteroskedasticity substantially increases the dimensionality of the
state space, rendering the approach computationally intractable.

that conditions (12), (13), and (14) hold. The forward premiums and the expected rates of

change of asset prices are also endogenous variables in the model. Changes in the model

specification that increase the variances of risk premiums may also increase the variances of

E(As1) ahd Ejav,+1], leaving the relative variances unchanged. Furthermore, the covariances

between the risk premiums and the expected rates of change of asset prices may change. Thus,

while it is likely that exueme risk aversion will increase the variability in intertemporal marginal

rates of substitution, it is unclear whether this is sufficient to induce the patterns of predictability

in excess returns that are observed in the data. Hence, to explore the effects of increasingrisk

aversion we must solve the model explicitly.

4.   First-Order Risk Aversion

        The preceding discussion makes clear the role that substantial risk aversion may play in

generating the regression results described in section 2. Models using expected-utility preferences

have not fared well in this regard. Even the models of Backus, Gregory, and Telmer (1993) and

Bekaert (1993b), which incorporate substantial time-nonseparabiities in the form of habit

persistence, fail to imply sufficient predictability in excess rates of return. The reason for this

failure is not difficult to see. Expected-utility preferences display second-order risk aversion.

That is, in response to a lottery which is close to perfect certainty, an expected utility maximizer

exhibits behavior close to risk neutrality. This is a problem for consumption-based asset pricing

models because, at any given date, the conditional variance of next period's aggregate

consumption is small.

       One way of addressing this problem is to abandon preferences that display only second-

order risk aversion in favor of preferences that imply first-order risk aversion. With this type of


                                                  12
preference specification, agents are substantially averse to even small gambles. Epstein and Zin

(1991) examine a variety of such preferences. including Gui's (1991) disappointment aversion

preferences, in order to increase the variability of agents intertemporal marginal rate of

substitution. Disappointment aversion was introduced by Gui (1991) as a way of accommodating

the Allais paradox within a parsimonious extension of expected utility. Camerer's (1989) review

of the experimental economics literature suggests that expected utility cannot explain the

experimental evidence on preference orderings under uncertainty. Rather, what is required is a

preference ordering in which outcomes are evaluated relative to some reference point.

Disappointment aversion has this property.

       We follow Epstein and Zin (1991) in using the following simple model of disappointment

aversion. A preference ordering over the space of probability distributions P (e.g.. over

alternative lotteries) can be represented by a certainty equivalent function ji: P—R. For P P.

p(P) is implicitly defined by


               P(Pr1I
                a          5 !_dp(z)+A 5 LdP(z)1Ai,a<1.                                     (16)
                        K(.,))a       (p()..,)U )
where K = Aprob(z> p) + prob(z pi). if A = I. the preferences described by equation (16)

correspond ta expected utility with a coefficient of relative risk aversion equal to 1 - a. If A

differs from unity, equation (16) can be interpreted as follows. Those outcomes below the

certainty equivalent are disappointing, while those above the certainty equivalent are elating. If

A < 1, the elation region is down-weighted relative to the disappointment region. The next

section embeds these preferences in a two-country monetary model.

5. A Two-Country Monetary Model


                                               13
       In the model asset prices and exchange rates are determined in a competitive equilibrium

in which the demands for assets and goods are the optimal choices of a representative agent. As

in Marshall (1992) and Belcaert (1993b). money is demanded by agents because consumption

transactions are costly, and increasing real balance holdings decreases these transaction costs.

Specifically, let the two countries be denoted as x and y, respectively. The representative agent's

consumption of the good produced in country x is c', and the representative agent's consumption

of the good produced in country y is 0. Consumption of c' involves transaction costs measured

by


                     a t(c1', M1/P,') a x(c,')(M1:/P')'1 v > 1,          7. > o.             (17)



denominated in units of c'. where M1 is the amount of currency x (which we call the dollar)

acquired by the representative agent in period t and P is the price of c' at date tin units of M'.

Consumption of c' involves a transaction cost of


                     a Y(c1'. M.'1/P1') a                          > i. c > o.               (18)



denominated in units of good y, where N1 is the amount of currency y (which we call thç yen)

acquired by the representative agent in period t; and P is the yen price of c' at date I

       The timing in this model differs from the transaction-cost models of Feenstra (1986) and

Marshall (1992) in that money provides transaction services in period t when it is acquired.

However, money must be held until the following period, so losses in purchasing power due to

inflation accrue in period t+l. This timing is imposed for tractability. With our timing, the only

endogenous state variable affecting an individual agent's decisions is the agent's stock of wealth.


                                                14
If money only provided transaction services if acquired one period earlier, the agent's stock of

money would represent a second endogenous state variable, The optimality conditions would

then involve the derivatives of the (unknown) value function with respect to the money-wealth

ratio. To solve such a model numerically would be extremely burdensome computationally.

       In addition to monies, agents can hold n capital assets. Let       be the value (in units of

c') of the representative agent's investment in asset i, chosen at t, and which pays off at t+1. The

gross real return to asset i (measured in units of good x received in t+1 per unit of good x

invested at date t) is denoted R.

       if S, denotes the exchange rate (dollars/yen), the budget constraint for the representative

agent in units of consumption good x is

where W1 denotes the representative agent's wealth at the beginning of period t:


                                        M' + S MJ       +                                    (20)

        The representative agent's preferences over cutrent and uncertain future consumption

incorporate disappointment aversion as in equation (16), and are specified using the approach of

Epstein and Zin (1989). Specifically, let J denote the vector of exogenous state variables which

span the agent's information set at date t. The utility value of W1 in the state J1 isdenoted V(W,,

JJ, and is defined recursively by




                                                   15

subject to the budget constraint (19) and the wealth constraint (20). using the definition of p from

equation (16). The expression                    denotes   the certainty equivalent of the conditional


distribution of the value function at date t+l, given information at date t. When agents make

their consumption and portfolio choices, they care about two distinct effects: how their choices

affect current-period utility, and what happens to the probability distribution of their future utility.

In an expected utility framework, the latter effect is incorporated by taking the conditional

expectation of next-period's value function.           In equation (21), effects of the probability
distribution of future utility on current utility are captured by the certainty equivalent function

p. In addition, the two effects are aggregated in equation (21) by the CES function of the form

(a' + tf)'1", while, in the expected-utility framework, the two effects are simply added.

       The parameter p governs intertemporal substitution in the following, somewhat
unconventional, sense: The elasticity of substitution between current utility (c't(c'Y4 and the

certainty-equivalent of future utility,                 is given by l/(1+p). Therefore, p determines


the optimal tradeoff between present and future utility. When p is near unity, there is an

extremely high degree of substitutability between these two sources of utility. Extremely

negative values of p imply almost no substitutability. It should be noted that this elasticity of

substitution does not directly correspond to the elasticity of substitution between current and

future consumption (as studied, for example, by HaIl (1988)). The more conventional notion of


                                                  16
intertemporal substitution elasticity is a function of all the preference parameters of the model.

6. Equilibrium Determination of Exchange Rates and Asset Returns

       In onler to derive equilibrium asset prices and exchange rates, we must solve the

representative agent's decision problem and impose market clearing. The agent's optimal
behavior is characterized by a set of Euler equations that involve the real return on optimally-

invested aggregate wealth, which we denote R1. (An explicit characterization of P1 can be found

in Appendix B.) These equations also involve the real returns, inclusive of marginal transaction

cost savings, from holding dollars and yen. Let



                                       RLl•I   5...LI' '                                         (fl)

Note that both R,11 and R, are measured in units of good x received in t+1 per unit of good

        Other endogenous variables are the nominally risk free, continuously compounded interest

rates on dollars and yen, denoted i and i. Nominally risk-free interest rates are functions of the

marginal transaction costs with respect to real balances:

Given interest rates and the spot rate, the forward rate F, can then be computed using covered

7. Calibration and Solution or the Model
       In this section we describe our procedures for choosing the parameters of the stochastic

processes for the exogenous variables and of the transaction cost functions. The outputs and

money supplies of the two countries are assumed to be exogenous. There are no data series

corresponding precisely to the endowment constructs of the model. The difficulty is that a two-

country model cannot replicate the complexity of trade patterns that we observe in the real world.

As a result, we do not take seriously the predictions of the model for quantity variables.

However, the implications of the model for asset return predictability can be investigated with

a plausible specification of the endowment driving processes.

       We calibrate the endowments and money supplies of the two countries to consumption

data and money supply data from the U.S. and Japan. The growth rates of these four exogenous

processes are assumed to follow a vector autoregression, which we will approximate as a discrete

Markov chain. We find that a firsv.order VAR with conditionally homoskedastic errors fits the

data well. In Table 2. Panels A and B, we display OLS estimates of this VAR. Table 2, Panel

C reports statistics testing the appropriate lag length for the VAR. The Akaike and Schwarz

criteria, as well as the sequential likelihood ratio tests, support the first-order VAR specification.

Table 2. Panel D provides statistics testing for normality. autocorrelation, and conditional

hómoskedasticity of the VAR residuals. Only in the residual for the growth rate of Japanese

                                                 19
consumption is there marginal evidence of serial correlation. For none of the residuals is there

significant evidence against normality or conditional homoskedasticity.

       The growth rates of these four exogenous processes are approximated by a discrete urn-

order Markov chain in which each variable can take four possible values, implying a state space

with 256 possible values. The Markov chain is calibrated to the estimated VAR using the

Gaussian quadrature method of Tauchen and Hussey (1991). In Table 3, we display the

parameters of the first-order VAR implied by this Markov chain approximation. The parameters

characterizing the Markov process VAR are virtually indistinguishable from those of the

estimated VAR reported in Table 2. All parameters of the Markov process VAR (including the

elements of the covariance matrix decomposition) are within one-tenth of one standard error of

the corresponding parameters in the estimated VAR. We take this as evidence that the discrete

approximation is unlikely to distort the economic implications of the model.

       The parameters of the transaction cost functions (17) and (18) are chosen by fitting

equations (29) to U.S. (for v1) and Japanese (for N)• data, as described in Appendix A.
Specifically, we set

              *y'(c.m) = 0.0008 c 43"m I         (c.m)    = 0.0166c "°9m 2.W9.             (31)


       Given this exogenous process, the three unknown endogenous processes R,, v. and v are

found by solving the three Euler equations (24) and (25) (for i = x and y) simultaneously. Since

the state space is discrete, the Euler equations can be solved exactly for the 256 values of each

endogenous variable. The only approximation is in the initial discretization of the driving

processes. A detailed description of the solution procedure can be found in Appendix B. Once

R,, v, and v have been determined, all other endogenous variables can be calculated from

                                              20
definitions and equilibrium conditions.

8. Implications of the Model for Excess Return Predictability
       In this section. we report results obtained from solving the model for a variety of

parameters governing preferences. The quarterly subjective discount parameter l is fixed at
(0.96)0. The choice of 8 (the weig]fl on c' in the cwrent-period utility) is irrelevant, since we

examine rates of depreciation , rather than levels of exchange rates. The remaining parameters

are varied over the following grid: A E (1.0,O.85,O.70,O.55, 0.40,0.25), p E (0.50. -0.33, -4.0.

-9.0). We experimented initially with values of a between 0.5 and -9 and found that the choice

of a had virtually no effect on the moments of interest Consequently, we only report results for

a = -1. This corresponds to a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 2 in an economy with
expected-utility preferences over timeless gambles.

       We first discuss the ability of the model to replicate the predictability of excess returns

documented in section 2. We focus on three measures of predictability: the slope coefficient in

the excess return regressions analogous to equations (2), (6), and (8); the R2, measured as the

ratio of the variance of the expected excess return to the variance of the realized excess return;

and the standard deviation of the expected excess return. All three statistics can be computed

exactly given the discrete Markov chain driving process.

       Consider the model's implications for the slope coefficients in the excess return
regressions analogous to equations (2), (6). and (8). The results are displayed in Tables 4. 5, and

6 for the foreign exchange market and the dollar and yen discount bond markets, respectively.

Table 7 displays the slope coefficient when the excess return to the aggregate wealth portfolio

(which we interpret as an analogue to an unlevered equity portfolio) is regressed on the foreign


                                                21
exchange forward premium.

          It is clear from these tables that the model cannot match the slope coefficients estimated
from observed data. For no combination of parameters do the regression coefficients implied by

the model come close to the magnitudes reported in Table 1. For example, for the foreign

exchange market regression, the estimated slope coefficient in Table 1 Panel A is -4.016, with

an estimated standard error of 0.766. The most negative slope coefficient implied by the model

is -0.191. which is approximately five standard errors away from the estimated value. Similarly,

the slope coefficients implied by the model for the term stnicture regressions analogous to

equation (6) (reported in Tables 5 and 6) and the equity return regressions (reported in Table 1)

are   extremely small, and they are all more than 3.4 standard errors away from the corresponding

estimates reported in Table 1.

          The second measure of predictability is the model's R2 as defined above. This theoretical

      cannot be observed in the data, but a lower bound is provided by the estimated R2s reported

in Table 1, Panel A. Whereas the R2s in the data are substantive, ranging between 1% and 22%.

the corresponding R2s in the model are negligible, all being less than .2%.

          The third measure of the predictability of excess returns is the variability of the explained

component of excess returns. As with the R2 discussed above, a lower bound for this measure

in the data is provided by the standard deviation of the fitted value of the excess return

regressions reported in Table 1, Panel B. As with the previous two measures, the model is

unable to reproduce the variability observed in the data. For example, the standard deviation of

the fitted value of s,, - f, in Table 1 is 12.4%, The largest value of the standard deviation of

          f) from the model, reported in Table 4, is 0.356%, which is over thirty times too small.


                                                   22
Analogously, the standard deviation of the fitted valueof the excess world equity return in Table

I is 10.9%. The largest standard deviation of E1(r - iJ from the model, reported in Table 7,

is 0.175%, which is over sixty times too small. The standard deviations of the fitted values of

the excess returns in the discount bond markets arc 0.318% and 0.370% for the dollar and the

yen markets, respectively. The maximum value of the standard deviations of the expected excess

returns, reported in Tables 5 and 6. ale 0.13% and 0.06% respectively.

         These results are somewhat disappointing to those who favor risk-based explanations for

the predictability of excess returns. To further explore the role of risk aversion in generating

predictability in excess returns, we next examine how the predictions of the model change as we

increase the importance of the first-order risk aversion by lowering A. In all cases, setting A =

1   results in extremely small values for the slope coefficients. However, it is not generally true

that increasing the amount of risk aversion (decreasing A) implies more negative slope
coefficients. Furthermore, a large degree of risk aversion is not systematically associated with

a particular sign of the regression coefficieni For example, the coefficients corresponding to A

= .40 and A =25 in Tables 4 through 7 are as likely to be positive as to be negative. Thus, even

if it were assumed that agents in the economy display extreme risk aversion, it is not at all clear

whether this would improve the performance of the model along this dimension.

         To see why the model fails to replicate the observed slope coefficients, it is useful to

return to the discussion of section 3. In that section, we argued that substantial time-variation

in risk premiums is necessary if a model is to match the patterns found in the data. Examination

of Tables 4 through 7 reveals that the variances of the cx ante risk premiums are unambiguously

increasing as the degree of first-order risk aversion increases. For foreign exchange, the standard


                                                 23
deviation of the risk premium increases by a factor of 100 when A moves from        1   to .25. For

discount bonds and the aggregate wealth portfolio, the standard deviation of the risk premium

increases at least twenty-fold when A moves from 1 to .25. Similarly, the R2's in all markets

increase dramatically as first-order risk aversion is increased.

       The reason why these dramatic increases in risk-premium volatility do not imply

comparable increases in the magnitude of the slope coefficients in the prediction regressions is

that these coefficients are functions of moments in addition to the variances of the risk premiums.

As shown in equation (10), the slope coefficients also depend on the variances of the expected

asset price changes and on the covariances between the expected changes in asset prices and the

risk premiums. These moments are also affected by changes in the parameter governing first-

order risk aversion. In particular, Tables 5 and 6 show that the variances of the expected changes

in the prices of one-period discount bonds actually decrease unambiguously as A decreases. The

variance of the expected change in the spot foreign exchange rate is not monotonic in A. As

shown in Table 4, decreasing A from unity initially reduces this variance, while further
reductions in A increase it. The value of A at which this variance is at a minimum depends on

p. The effects of increased fit-order risk aversion on the covariances between the cx ante risk

premiums and the expected changes in asset prices are also in Tables 4 through 6. In the foreign

exchange market, decreasing A unambiguously increases this covariance. In the discount bond

markets, the response of this covaijance to increased risk aversion is not monotonic, and depends

on the value of p.

       Our model also has implications for the unconditional mean equity premium and the

unconditional standard deviations of financial variables, which provide additional dimensions to


                                               24
assess the rnodels performance. in Table 7, increasing the amount of first-order risk aversion

dramatically increases the unconditional mean excess equity return. As A is reduced from 1 to

.25, the mean equity risk premium increases by a factor of approximately 20. This increase is

not sufficient to match the data as the largest mean equity premium generated by our model

simulations is 3.5%; While this is substantially below the value of 8.4% estimated from our data

set, the equity return data correspond to a levered portfolio, while the equity return computed in

our model is unlevered. The result are comparable to those of Bonomo and Garcia (1993) for

homoskedastic driving processes. These authors are able to increase the mean equity risk

premium significantly by employing a richer driving process that incorporates regime switching.

       Table 8 displays standard deviations implied by the model. In comparing Table 8 with

Table 1, Panel B, notice that the magnitudes of the standard deviations in the model are almost

always smaller than the corresponding statistics in the data. In particular, the standard deviation

of cunency depreciation is approximately 2.5 times higher in the data than in the model, and the

standard deviation of the equity risk premium is approximately three times higher in the data than

in the modeL When p = -9, the standard deviation of the forward premium in the model is only

50% lower than that in the data; for the other values of p. the variability of the forward premium

is almost an order of magnitude too low.

       Although the model underpredicts the variability of both expected and realized excess

returns, the parameterizations of the model that generate the largest variances of expected rates

of return tend to overpredict the variances of the forward premiums in the discount bond markets.

For example, with p = -9 and A = .25. the standard deviations of the forward premiums in the

dollar and yen discount bond market are 3.81% and 2.56%. compared to 0.71% and 0.83% in


                                               25
Table 1, Panel B.

       The source of this problem is as follows. In order to generate high volatility in excess

returns, the model must generate high volatility in the conditional second moments of
intertemporal marginal rates of substitution. Unfortunately, parameterizations of the model which

do this also imply highly volatile spot interest rates. A similar problem has been noted in a

closed-economy model by Heaton (1991). Consequently, one challenge for this class of models

is to accommodate highly variable expected and realized excess returns on risky assets while

keeping short-term interest rates relatively non-volatile.

9. On the Success of Epstein and Zin (1991)
       Epstein and Zin (1991) are unable to reject the overidentifying restrictions implied by

their single-country model with preferences incorporating flist-order risk aversion, which suggests

considerable support for this approach to asset pricing. Our approach is less successful. How

can we explain the differences in findings?

       According to the Euler equation (25), the implications of these models for asset returns

are summarized in the behavior of the asset pricing operator

                                          I,(Z11)    a   —l
                                                         *1



This operator is a function of RHI, the return to the aggregate wealth portfolio. Euler equation

estimation requires an observable analogue to this asset pricing operator, and Epstein and Zin use

the return on a value-weighted portfolio of equities as their empirical measure of R. This

procedure is clearly subject to Roll's (1977) critique, a point acknowledged by Epstein and Zin.

Furthermore, with this approach, the empirical asset pricing operator is a function of the returns



                                                26
on the equity assets being priced. The operator partially inherits the statistical properties of
observed equity returns, so it has less difficulty replicating the behavior of observed excess equity

returns. In contrast, we derive R2 by explicitly solving the model's equilibrium as a function

of the growth rates of output and money in the two countries. Nowhere do we use data on asset

returns in deriving the asset pricing operator. To ask the pricing operator, derived in this way,

to replicate the stochastic properties of equity returns is a much tougher test of the model than

the Epstein-Zin procedure. It is not surprising that we find more evidence against the model.

10. Conclusions

       In this paper, we ask whether high levels of risk aversion can explain the observed

predictability of excess returns within the context of a frictionless, representative agent model.

In order to give this explanation the best chance for success, we assume that agents' preferences

display first-order risk aversion. This preference specification implies that agents respond more

strongly to consumption risk than would be the case under conventional Von Neumann-

Morgensteni preferences. Yet, even this more extreme form of risk aversion can explain only

a small fraction of the predictability of excess returns found in the data. Furthermore, we find

that the slope coefficients in equations predicting excess returns do not increase monotonically

with increased risk aversion. The level of risk aversion affects not only the variability of risk

premiums, but also the second moments of other endogenous variables which affect predictability.

The resulting implications for the signs and magnitudes of these slope coefficients are ambiguous.

       Taken together, the results of this paper suggest that the predictability of excess returns

cannot be fully explained simply by modifying preference assumptions. A more promising

approach may be to abandon the assumption that the empirical distribution in the data set is a


                                                27
good proxy for agents' subjective distribution over future variables. Rational optimizing models

that do not impose this assumption include learning models, models with peso-problems, and

some models with regime switching. It is hoped that these alternative approaches wilt have more

success in explaining excess-return predictability than approaches based solely on modelling

agents' aversion to consumption risk.

                    APPENDIX A: DESCRIPTION OF DATA
       The interest rate data are monthly series on three-month and six-month Euro-dollar and

Euro-yen rates, obtained from the Harris Bank database at the University of Chicago. Monthly

exchange rate data are from daily bid and ask rates from Citicorp Database Services and are

described in detail in Bekaert and Hodrick (1993).

    The money supplies for the U.S. and Japan are quarterly series taken from International

Financial Statistics (IFS Series 34). Growth rates are deseasonalized by regressing on four

dummies. The consumption data are Nondurables and Services from the OECD Quarterly

National Accounts. The Japanese data include the Semi-durables category, as this category is

included in the U.S. Nondurables series. Per capita data on money supplies and consumption

were derived by using linear interpolations from the annual population series 99z from IFS.

       The transaction cost technology parameters are considered to be part of the exogenous

environment and are calibrated from the model's implications for money demand, as summarized

by equations (29). These equations imply linear relationships between the logs of current dollar

and yen velocities of circulation and the logs of the respective interest rate divided by one plus

the interest rate. The calibration is done by linear regression using quarterly Eurocurrency

interest data and nominal velocity. The velocity series used is computed using nominal GDP,

taken 1mm OECD Quarterly National Accounts, divided by the money series described above.

GDP velocity is used because it implies more reasonable parameters for the transaction cost

function than consumption velocity. The use of GDP velocity can be justified by noting that

money in actual economies intermediates many more transactions than just consumption

transactions. See Marshall (1992) for a fuller discussion of this issue.

                       APPENDIX B: SOLUTION PROCEDURE

       The key step in solving the model is to solve numerically the Euler equations (24) and

(25) for the endogenous variables v, v{. (defined in equations (28)) and R,÷1 (the return to the

aggregate wealth portfolio). We do so by using a finite-state Markov chain to approximate the

exogenous driving process (see Tauchen and Llussey (1991)). We then solve the model exactly

for this approximate driving process. In this appendix we describe the solution procedure in

greater detail.

       Let e denote the total output of good x at date t. let e denote the output of good y at

date t, and let M÷1 and M denote the supplies of dollars and yen respectively, available for use

in mediating transactions at date t. (These money stocks are dated t+l because it is assumed that

the loss in value from inflation accrues to the agent in t+ I.) Let & denote the vector of growth

rates of outputs and money supplies in the two counuies:


                                          e1' e1    NI11   M1
                                              cJ M1' M'
It is assuMed that (e, e, M1, M,1) is an exogenous process whose law of motion is known.
       First, we show how equations (24) and (25) can be written in terms of & and the three

endogenous processes (vt, v, R,1J. Using (17). (18). and the requirement that, in equilibrium.

the output of each good must either be consumed or used as transaction costs,

we can write consumption growths, marginal transaction costs, and inflation rates as functions

       The next step is to formally characterize R.M, the return to the aggregate wealth portfolio.

Since we define the return to money inclusive of marginal transaction costs, 'y and v[. we must

incorporate these marginal transaction costs into the definition of the portfolio weights for the

aggregate wealth portfolio. Formally, let

The portfolio weights on the aggregate wealth portfolio are defined in terms of W1. Let w1   and

w,1 denote the portfolio weight on M1 and M1, respectively:



                                           E                                                 (41)

The return to the aggregate wealth portfolio is defined as follows:



                              2 E w1.1R,1          +                +                        (45)


where       and R,. are defined in equations (22) and (23). Aggregate wealth evolves according

       In a single-good nonmonetary model, the market return can be expressed as a function

of the wealth/consumption ratio and the growth rate of consumption. It is convenient to

this three-equation system be denoted

where f is a known function,

       Our task then is to find a stochastic process {v, vT. w;} which satisfies equations (49)

for the given & process. Following Tauchen and Hussey (1991), we approximate& by a finite-


                                                33
state Markov chain. The discretization uses Gaussian quadrature. In the results presented in

section 7, we allow each of the four elements of & to take on 4 values, implying 256 possible

states of the economy. The endogenous processes, v, vT, wc are then represented by vectors

with 256 elements each, to be determined by solving system (49). The conditional expectation

can be evaluated exactly (given the discrete approximation) since the state transition probabilities

are known. We reduce the computational burden of this solution algorithm by assuming that the

growth rates of c and c are observed, rather than the growth rates of output in the two countries.

This enables us to solve system (49) recursively: the elements of {wc v11 do not depend on the

third equation in (49). Therefore, the 512 elements of (w;. v1} are found by simultaneously

solving the 512 equations represented by the first two equations of (49). each evaluated at each

of the 256 states. Given these values for (w;, v}, the 256 elements of v, are found      by solving

the 256 equations represented by the last equation of (49) evaluated at each of the 256 states.

Having solved for {w;, v1, v,), the remaining endogenous variables can be computed using

equation (47) and equations (32) - (39).

 Notes: The data are monthly observations on quarterly rates. The sample period is from Januaiy
 1976 to December 1989 for exchange rates and equities and from October 1975 to June 1990 for
 interest rates. All rates are measured as percentage points per annum. Time subscripts denote
quarters. The logarithms of the dollar/yen spot and forward exchange rates are denoted Iand
ç The quarterly rate of depreciation is A1; the three-month forward premium on the yen in
terms of the dollar is denoted f; the quarterly dollar excess return on the world equity market
(an equally-weighted average of the dollar excess returns to U.S. and Japanese equities. defined
in equation (7)) is r'1 - it; the three-month dollar excess return to U.S. equities is       - it; the
three month yen excess return to Japanese equities is i -     i;                   i)

Notes: The sample period is 1974:4 to 1990:1. gm1 denotes the growth rate of the dollar money
supply; g; denotes the growth rate of U.S. consumption; gn denotes the growth rate of the yen
money supply; gy1 denotes the growth rate of Japanese consumption. Estimates of the VAR
coefficients and the decomposition of the en-or covariance matrix are obtained by OLS and
reported in Panels A and B with heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors in parentheses. The
appropriate lag length for the VAR minimizes the Akaike or Schwarz criterion in Panel C. The
likelihood ratio test is a sequential test of a VAR(n) versus a VAR(n+1). The test statistic has
a x2 distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of coefficients being restricted by
the lower VAR order. The statistic incorporates the Sims (1980) correction. Marginal levels of
significance axe in parentheses. Panel D reports statistics and associated p-values for various
residual diagnostic tests. Column 1 reports the Cumby-Huizinga (1992) I-test for serial
con-elation of the residuals. Column 2 reports the Ljung-Box test statistic, applied to squared
residuals, as a test for ARCH. Columns 3, 4, and 5 test for normality of the residuals. Ku is
the normalized kurtosis coefficient and Sic the normalized skewness coefficient Their asymptotic
disthbution is N(0,24/T), N(0,6[F) respectively, with T the sample size, under the null of
normality. BJ is the Bera-Jarque (1982) test for normality and is %2(2).

Notes: The discrete state space approximation to the VAR in Table 2 is computed using the
Gaussian quadrature procedure of Tauchen and Hussey (1991). Each variable is allowed to take
four possible values, implying a discrete state space with 256 elements. Variable definitions are
given in the notes to Table 2.
