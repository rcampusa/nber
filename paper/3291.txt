                NON-COINTEGRATION AND ECONOMETRIC EVALUATION OF
                       MODELS OF REGIONAL SHIFT AND SHARE


                                    ABSTRACT


     This paper tests for cointegration between regional output of an industry
and national output of the same industry.   An equilibrium economic theory is
presented to argue for the plausibility of cointegration, however, regional
economic forecasting using the shift and share framework often acts as if
cointegration does not exist.   Data analysis on broad industrial sectors for 20
states finds very little evidence for cointegration. Forecasting models with
and without imposing cointegration are than constructed and used to forecast
out of sample.  The simplest, non-cointegrating models are the best.

Introduction
       One of the abiding concerns of regional economics is the temporal behavior of
aggregate regional economies. An important dimension of this behavior is the
comparison of the region to the economic behavior of the nation in which it is
located. Both as they follow and as they deviate from macroeconomic trends and
cycles, the movements of regional employment, earnings and other aggregates are
very often modeled as functions of national data. This concern extends to the
behavior of particular industrial sectors as well, since regional economic policy is
often based on an analysis of the performance of industries which are important to
the region, in both actual and potential senses.
       Emphasis on this relationship between national and regional economies is not
misplaced given the experience of the past decade or so, since during that span the
response of regions in the United States, and more particularly of certain sectors on
those regions, to various movements in macroeconomic cycles has varied
tremendously. Moreover, the shocks which have apparently induced such responses
appear to have had persistent regional effects; of special note is the effect of supply
shocks on manufacturing sectors in the upper midwest region, which may never
reattain the employment peaks of the 1970s, and the recent slump in the oil—based
states of the southwest.
       The regional persistence of shocks is not what might be expected; standard
analysis presumes that factor price adjustment and factor migration to equalize
those prices across regions would force an interregional equilibrium wherein all
regions would grow at the same national rate in the long run. A key by—product of
such a model's steady state is that the share of national output, employment and
earnings generated in the region will be constant over time.
        On the other hand, practical regional forecasters, often using the "shift and
share" paradigm, frequently forecast the share of output, employment or earnings in
                                         —3—




the region to remain at its current value. Such a model not only economizes on data
requirements, but also is efficient if the share is a random walk. In this case, the
share will not have a long run equilibrium.
       This paper applies modern time series methods to the regional forecasting
problem. Using the concept of cointegration to test for a long run equilibrium
relationship between regions, rather startling results are obtained. It is found that
industrial output in individual states is not cointegrated with national output in the
same sector. The finding is consistent with the "shift share" model and has rather
important economic implications.
       In Section 2 of this paper we present a model of the relationship between
regional economies; the model, while extraordinarily simple, is sufficient to examine
the concepts, of shift and share, productivity shocks and the possible causes of
non—cointegration or the persistence of regional shocks. In Section 3 we present the
basic shift share analysis and in 4 we formulate the statistical model for regional
earnings. Section 5 tests for the existance of an equilibrium relationship between
regional and national earnings directly by testing for the cointegration of these two
variables using the Engle and Granger(1987) test procedure The striking result is
that cointegration is not found, which casts severe doubt on equilibrium based
models. Additionally, the non—cointegration results provide a basis for empirical
model construction, suggesting that unit root models be given strong consideration.
In Section 6, we propose nine models of regional shift, many of which have been
previously analyzed. Some are non—cointegrating, disequilibrium based, and others
are cointegrating and equilibrium based. These are examined for "out of sample"
forecasting performance. The conclusion is that the models of disequilibrium are
superior, especially as measured by their forecasting ability. Section 7 provides
some summary remarks.
2. Regional Economic Models
                                            -4-

       We develop a very simple model for the output and payroll of region i and
industry j. We suppose all regions have access to the same technology but that
there are some fixed factors which are specific to a region. These could be pure
location or weather effects or merely inherited and immobile physical capital. We
consider labor as the variable factor of production and model region i, industry j at
time t but supress the j subscript throughout. Letting q be the log of output,
the log of employment, aj the log of the fixed factor, bt a productivity shift which is
independent of region, and a, the output elasticity of labor in this sector, the
production function can be written for industry j     as




(1)



Defining       and    to be the log wage and log price of output in region i, the first
order conditions for profit maximization with respect to the variable factor, labor,
are given by


(2)                                     = log a +          —   1it
                                    —




The quantity most easily observed in regional data is payroll. Denoting its log as


                                        =         +
(3)



which depends on the fixed factor, productivity, wages and prices.
       The difference between log earnings for sector j in two regions i and k which
each satisfy (1) and (2), is then
                                            —5-


(4)
                   —   kt =          — kt + i(Wkt — w) +               i-(a    —   ak).


While it is possible for the prices of a good to differ from one region to another in
the short run, they should be equal in the log run. Similarly through labor
migration or the factor price equalization theorem, wage rates should be equalized in
the long run.
        Economic arguments thus suggest that in the long run, the ratio of earnings
in two regions should be a constant depending upon a       —   ak.   It is therefore
reasonable to model the relative wages and relative prices between two regions as
stationary stochastic processes. Since the sum of such processes will itself be a
stationary process, equation (4) implies that the log ratio should itself be a
stationary process. Thus, shocks to wages, prices, employment or national
productivity do not affect the long run ratio.
        If productivity is integrated of order 1 but relative wage and prices are 1(0),
then this is a simple example of cointegration as discussed by Engle and Granger
(1987). Log earnings in each sector is integrated of order 1 from equation (3), but
the log ratio is stationary.
       The finding of cointegration is robust to several variations. If there is more
than one variable factor and the output elasticities are constant, then the relative
price of the new factor across regions will also appear in (4). For example, if capital
is considered to be a variable factor of production with a price which is equalized
across regions in the long run (a plausible assumption because of the highly
developed capital market), then payroll will still be cointegrated.. Similarly, if
labor is disaggregated into several factors of production, each with a constant
output elasticity, then the argument above applies for each of the types of labor as
well as for the sum of the payrolls. Finally, if there are differing costs of living in
different regions and labor migration is assumed to equalize real wages across
                                           -6-

regions, then the stochastic process of wkt_wjt should still be stationary but with a
non—zero mean. Consequently, the long run equilibrium share will depend upon the
relative cost of living as well as on the specific factors ak—al.
       Under what conditions will cointegration fail in the model? If the a change
over time either through differential state productivities or through endogenous
permanent shocks to a1, then cointegration will not be found. Alternatively, if
wages and/or prices have no long run tendency to equalize across regions, then there
will be no cointegration. If the output elasticity is not a constant, then
cointegration will fail if the elasticity moves in a non—stationary fashion.
       In the statistical analysis we test for cointegration between an industry
earnings in one state and the corresponding industry earnings in the nation as a
whole. Denote Yft as earnings in the US outside region i for the same industry j.
Because   each state is a tiny fraction of the US, log (Y +    rt       so that
cointegration between one state and the balance of the U.S. is equivalent to
cointegration between that state and the nation. Conveniently, tests for
cointegration do not rest on any exogeneity assumption. The use of the nation as
the second region more closely accords with traditional regional economic
considerations which we discuss below. Furthermore, it means that all tests for one
industry are calculated relative to the same measure.
3. The Shift and Share Model

       If region 2 is considered to be the US output of the sector under study rather
than this total minus the state, then there are regional economic counterparts to
most of these models.
       Using the terms of Stevens and Moore (1980) which are derived from Perloff
(1969) we define regional growth in earnings in this sector as          RGt while
national industry growth is   2t = IGt.      The log share in this region is s and the
regional shift is RS =         We have the identity
                                          —7—




                                  1t = '2t + LISt
or

                                    RG=iIG+RS


Thus the forecasting problem becomes one of forecasting national industry growth
and then forecasting the regional shift. In many cases IG is taken to be strongly
exogenous and is forecast from some other source so only RS remains.
       A very popular assumption favored by Brown(1969), and Hellman(1976) is
that the best forecast of the regional shift is zero so that the share is a martingale.
This is sometimes called rather misleading the constant share model, but we will
call it the martingale share model. Although the forecast value of the share is that
it will be the same in the future as it is today, the share is not at all constant. Since
the share is therefore an integrated process, it is clear that regional and national
output are not cointegrated in this case. A slight variation on this model would
allow the share to be a random walk with drift so that a region will consistently
grow faster or slower than the nation. Yet another variation is to suppose that the
shift follows a simple time series process or perhaps even is itself a random walk.
       An alternative simple assumption is that the share will approach its long
term historical value in the forecast period. This is an example of an assumption
implying cointegration with a unit elasticity. If the long run elasticity is different
from one, then the region will be forecast to grow with this constant elasticity
relation to the national economy. Any of these models can be given deterministic
trends as well. A wide range of more complex models will be estimated and tested,
however they all share these long run forecast properties.


4. The Statistical MOdel

       We suppose that the earnings in regions 1 and 2 can be considered to be a

                                              =     [::]
where   B is the backshift operator, A(B) = I — AB and the                       are white noise
processes. This first order case is the simplest to examine and conveniently appears
to be the appropriate model for this data set. The process can be stationary, can
have one unit root or can have two unit roots. These will be determined by the
           *
rank I—A       .   Statistically the case of one unit root corresponds to cointegration while
two unit roots implies non—cointegration. The model can be parameterized into the
difference y1—y2 and y2. Letting s =                   1t2t
                                                   which is interpreted as the log share
earnings in region 1 as a fraction of region 2, the model becomes

The rank of I—A = rank          I—A   .   If this rank is zero, then both s and y2 are random

forecasting an equivalent representation again introduces y2 into equation (8).
The assumption that y2 is strongly exogenous would now imply that a=O.

where the long run equilibrium relation is that s +             is stationary or y1 +

region 2 is not 1. Just as before, this system can be triangularized by introducing
        into the first equations.

          Engle and Granger (1987) survey the testing for and estimation of
cointegrating systems. The testing is of particular interest because it is not obvious
that national and regional earnings are cointegrated. In the language of Engle and
Granger a regression of         on
                                     2t is called a cointegrating regression because if a
long run equilibrium exists such a regression will give a consistent estimate of it. In
fact Stock (1986) shows that convergence to the true parameters is extremely fast.
The intercept term gives an estimate of log share and the slope coefficient ought to
be close to unity if equilibrium shares exist. Granger and Newbold (1974) refer to
this regression as "spurious" since inference is so hazardous but Engle and Granger
(1987) note that the residuals from the cointegrating regression are convenient for
testing for cointegration. If we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the residuals
form a random walk sequence, then we infer that there is no linear combination
which defines an equilibrium for these variables.
                                            —11——




        Several statistics are available for testing that there are no unit roots in the
 cointegrating residuals. For the first—order case, the most convenient is a test that
 the Durbin—Watson statistic is zero. This was analyzed by Bhargava and Sargan
 (1983) for fixed regressors and revised for the cointegration case in Engle and Yoo
 (1986) whose critical value calculation we use here. We use this simpler method
 because of the large number of cases we examine and because the data support first
 order models, however in other contexts it is possibly better to use the Engle—
 Granger(1987) tests based on the augmented Dickey and Fuller (1981) regression.
        The possibility of non—cointegration has several important implications for
our data:
(a)    There is no long—run equilibrium share; or put another way, there is no

       equilibrium relationship between national and regional earnings.
(b)    The stochastic process   5 is   non—stationary and has infinite variance.
(c)    Shocks to the share      are permanent, so that tax or subsidy policies designed
       to impact particular industries, or local shocks such as environmental
       regulations or infrastructure investments will have persistent effects.
(d)    The optimal k—step—ahead forecast of
                                                 5t+k is in fact s


The last of these is probably the only one of the four which was Specifically desired
by those who formulated the shift—share framework.
       The idea that key macroeconomic variables are well described by random
walks (with the attendant implications) has recently gained currency among

macroeconometrjcjans (Nelson and Plosser (1982), Campbell and Mankiw (1986)).
The implications are strong and much attention has been devoted to the appropriate
testing procedure. The implications for regional forecasting and regional policy
making seem especially important.
       In the next section we present tests of cointegration for the models.
                                            —12--



Following that we estimate specific forecasting models and compute the
out—of—sample forecasts for a wide range of states and industries.


5. Results from Cointegration Tests


        Quarterly data on US and state earnings in the nine broad industry
categories, plus total earnings are examined from 1969:3 to 1981:4. Twenty states
are included in the sample. For each state— industry combination two cointegrating
regressions were performed, the first unconstrained, the second constraining the
slope coefficient at unity. 400 cointegrating regressions were thus performed.
With 50 observations the 5% critical value given in Engle and Yoo (1986) is 0.78 for
the case where the coefficient is estimated unconstrained. At a 10% size the critical
value falls to .69. For the constrained case, the critical values are simply obtained
from the critical values of    as reported by Dickey and Fuller and quoted by Engle
and Yoo. These are related to the DW critical values by the approximation:


                                   2
                                       /T
                      DW=
                              1+t/T     2




This gives critical values for the constrained model of .59 for the 5% and .48 for the
10% test.

       The results are presented in Tables 1 and 2.. For each pair of state and

sector, two statistics are given. The first is the constrained case, the second is
unconstrained. As can be seen, there is little or no evidence of cointegration.
       In Table 1, results are presented for non—durable and durable manufacturing.
These sectors are typically modelled by regional economists as basic or export
oriented sectors and trade theorists would say they produce tradeables. Therefore
                                         —13—



these sectors should satisfy the assumption that the relative price of such a good
from one region relative to another should have a long run equilibrium value of one
by long run purchasing power parity. Often the manufacturing sector is modeled as
a linear function of national output in manufacturing. See for example
Glickman(1971). Consequently, these sectors should be most likely to cointegrate.
       From the table however, it is clear that only a single rejection of the
non—cointegration hypothesis is obtained at the 5% level out of 40 constrained and
40 unconstrained tests. This surprising result is borne out in the other sectors as
well. Only in Transportation,Communication, and Public Utilities, Services and
Government are there any cases of rejections at all. Altogether however, there are
only 9 rejections at the 5% level out of 200 unrestricted tests which is probably best
interpreted simply as evidence of Type I error. As some of these sectors are local
serving and produce non—tradables, perhaps the finding of non—cointegration is less
surprising since local demand shocks could destroy cointegration. This is
corroborated by the results on total state earnings which again find no evidence of
cointegration. Even more interesting is the observation that there are only 5
rejections in the unit elasticity case. This is the case which gives a constant share in
the long run. There seems to be no evidence to support such a model.
       There are several interpretations of this striking finding. First, it is possible
that cointegration within a single homogeneous sector would disappear when
aggregates such as durables were examined together. The regional economist is
however offered little choice on the ingredients for his accounts and forecasting is
typically done from such aggregates. Second, it is possible that the test has little
power, partly because there are only 50 observations. Cointegration could be true,
yet the tests have so little power that it cannot be detected. This is examined in
the next section where forecasting models are constructed with and without
imposing cointegration. As is shown there, the cointegrated models are inferior in
                                         —14—-




Out of sample forecasts. Also, the statistical assumptions underlying the test could
be incorrect. In particular, the national series could have a more complex process
than that embodied in (5) such as having deterministic trends. This would alter the
size of the test. Again, however, the forecasting models should then reverse this
conclusion.

       The overwhelming conclusion is that cointegration does not exist,with the
attendant implication that the share is appropriately modeled as a nonstationary
process, rather than one converging to some dynamic equilibrium. Put another way,
whatever causes shocks, the effects of the shocks seem to be permanent. This
conclusion will be of interest to regional policymakers since it dramatically affects
the cost benefit analysis of local industrial policy. A program to attract new
industry will yield jobs and income over the long run if it yields them in the short
run. That is, any increase in the share of output in a sector can be viewed as
permanent so that the long run benefits may well outweigh short run costs. By the
same analysis, actions in competitor states may permanently reduce industrial
shares so that activist policies may be critical. This is in accordance with the game
theoretic approach to local policy analysis which is commonly discussed and opposed
to the equilibrium assumptons that any interference in the regional marketplace will
incur a local welfare loss. In terms of the model of section 2, it appears that the a1s
do change over time and the local policy maker should examine the costs of
increasing them.
       A further implication is that the traditional non—parametric models of
martingale share and constant shift are more appropriate models of regional
aggregates than might have been expected. We turn now to the comparison of these
and other models..


6. Models of Regional Growth
                                                   -15-

        In this section we propose, estimate and compare several models of regional
growth in terms of out—of--sample forecasting as well as within—sample fit. Some of
these models assume non—cointegration, while others impose cointegration. We
consider the cointegrated models as well in order to corroborate our finding that the
cointegration model is not a very good model for forecasting. We first comment
briefly on each of nine models and then compare their theoretical properties, and
how they are nested. Then estimation is discussed, followed by model comparison.
For ease of exposition each model is formulated in terms of the regional shift term,
RS            however each can easily be recast in terms of RG r                     by adding

IGt             to the right hand side. The models are roughly listed by increasing
generality. We denote            =   st—   Et_ist, and the information set is assumed to
include national variables dated at t.


Model 1: Martingale Share E_i[ RSt 1= 0 or
                                                     = as in (7).
       As stated above, this implies that the share is a random walk.
Model 2: Martingale Shift Et_i[ Ft J = RS_i, or
                                                                     =
       Brown (1969) and others examine this model. This shift is a random walk;

so that the share itself must be differenced twice to give an unforecastible series.
That iS, S is 1(2) which is also a unit root process, so that in this case as well, the
non—cointegration of         and y           is implied.
                         1
                                       US
Model 3: Constant       Shift: E1[ RSt 1=            o , or     =     ±        as in (7) with an
intercept.
       The share is a random walk with drift.
Model 4:     Autoregressive      Shift Et_i[     ' 1= ' +                 or



                1st =        +   iziSt_i +
                                                  —16—



         This is a generalization of Models 1, 2 and 3. It allows the shift component
to be an autoregressive process which converges to a rate of change of 8/(1_              ) (if
    I
        < 1). It also implies a unit—root model in two lags similar to Model 3 (unless
   —0)

Model 5: Autoregressive earnings E_i[ RSt ]= 7 +               'y1       —         or

                       = 7 + (71+1) "u—i +


          This is the only one of our models specifically designed to let the regional
economy be independent of the national economy which is a possibility given the
earlier results. Because of this, no assumption on cointegration is made. Earnings
themselves may be a random walk ('yr = 0) or may converge to              —   y0/y1 (if 'y1 < 0).
Model 6: Constant short—run elasticity E_i[ RSt] =                   + 01 IG, or


                       = 0o + 01              +


         This is the first model to allow national earnings to have a non—unit impact
elasticity on regional earnings, (since RGt =            0+    + 1) IG) and is an example
of equation (7') with an intercept. Since the error—correction term                 is missing,

the long—run elasticity is undefined, and so this model is in the non—cointegrated
unit—root class of models 1 through 4. It may be important to allow non—unit
elasticity in the short run (as do 8 and 9 as well as this model) and in the long run
(in 9) since there is a small amount of evidence in the cointegration results to
suggest that the non—unitary response is preferred.
Model 7: Autoregressive share E_i[                  I=    +5   5—i' or


                List   =0+         8t—i
                                          +
                                           —17—



        The model is (8) and can be given as s =    +      + 1) st—i so that if
0, the equation forces the long run equilibrium share to be —5/ö. This model
therefore implies cointegration between regional and US earnings with a unit long
run elasticity (unless 5 =   0,   in which case we have model 2).
Model 8: Unit Elastic Error Correction Model

               Ei[ RSt] =            + r1 IG + W2
              LSt =   Wa   + WiYUS,t + r2            +


       The unit elasticity error correction model given in (8') nests most of the
models above, since it implies cointegration with a unit long run elasticity (if w2 <
0) and allows the short—run elasticity to be non—unitary like model 7 (if    W1   0).

Model 9: Error Correction Model (9')

              Ei[ RS] =             +             + '2 1Gt + *3s
                                                   *3
                                                                    ,   or


                   = *0    + (*1+*3)(yitl                           + *2          +
                                              —   *1 + *3


       This can be rewritten as the first equation of a bivariate single lag vector
autoregression of regional on national earnings; it generalizes the unit elasticity
error correction model in 8 to allow non—unit long run elasticity which is now given
by *3/(*1+*3). That is, some kind of increasing or decreasing comparative
advantage for this region is allowed. But unlike the disequilibrium models 1 and 2,
the change in the long run is systematic and predictable.
       The discussion above makes clear the way the models are nested. Note
further that Model 9 nests all of the models except 2 and 4 since these two use a
second lag of earnings. Also note that the "equilibrium" models 7, 8 and 9, nest

unit root models under certain restrictions, hence it is appropriate to include them
in model comparison even though the results of Section 5 indicate that they might
                                           —18—



be inappropriate. In any case, since comparison of forecast performance is a major
tool used below, it seemed sensible to include equilibrium models in the
comparison,in case the data generation process radically changed in the post—sample
forecast period.
         Each of the models is estimated for each of the state—industry combinations.
The data set is the same as that used in Section 5. The estimation results are
summarized in Table 3 in terms of the geometric means across states and industries
of the in—sample standard errors of regression.. Larger models fit somewhat better
with model 9 as the best followed by 8. These cointegrating models have 4 and 3
parameters respectively. Close behind are models 6 and 4 which are
non—cointegrating models with 2 parameters each. . Models 1,3 and 7 were in the
next group zero one and two parameters respectively, and finally 2 and 5 as the
worst.    In terms of standard errors, the cointegrating models fit the data slightly
better but at the cost of additional parameters. This cost is most noticable in
forecasting.

         We now turn to the forecasting ability of the nine models. We emphasize
this aspect of model comparison, since much of the debate surrounding various
models of shift and share concerned forecasting performance. (Again, see Stevens
and Moore (1980) and James and Hughes(1973).) In each case we compare forecasts
of       but since we directly estimate RS1, in order to convert to the variable of
interest we add (IG +            to the model's forecast of RSt. This is not a problem

if forecasts can be made conditional on IGt, however unconditional forecasts will
need estimates of IGt terms. Forecasts are computed both conditionally and
unconditionally, each under two settings. First, ten post—sample one step forecasts
are made — at each step all available information is used. In the other scenario,
one—through ten-step ahead forecasts are undertaken. These forecasts are made
using actual data through the estimation period and forecasts as they are needed
                                         —19-


through the multistep forecasts, which is the usual situation facing the forecaster.

Conditional forecasts are made using actual values of         and IG. Additionally,
actual values of       are also used in the calculation of s in multi—step forecasts.
Unconditional forecasts are made using one—step and multi—step forecasts of
in the two scenarios as appropriate. These latter forecasts of        are estimated
via first through fourth order autoregression model of IGt and using the Schwarz
(1978) criterion to pick the best model. The first—order model was usually selected.
       Each state/industry/model combination was used in each of the four forecast
regimes, with forecast errors constructed as actual     less forecasted y. Root
mean square errors for the ten post—sample observations were calculated in each
case, and geometric means across and states and industry were calculated in order
to compare forecasts across models. The means were then normalized by dividing
each by the root mean square forecast error of the best model for each
state/industry combination. Thus, the figures in Table 4, which give the results for
this exercise, shows how much worse one does on average by picking the indicated
model rather than the one which happens to be hlbest.u The standardization by the
"best model does not affect any comparisons across models.
       While Table 3 indicates that within the estimation period, the least
constrained, most pararneterized models have the best fit in terms of standard error,
this result definitely does not hold in the post—sample period. This is consistent
with both theoretical and empirical work indicating the value of parsimony in
forecasting and the tendency for a minimum standard error criterion to select

over—parameterjzed models. The specific pattern of performance shows the value of
using cointegration tests as part of an overall modeling strategy, since the results on
forecasting ability now come as no surprise. Model 1, the martingale share model,
does best in one step conditional forecasts even though it is among the most
constrained of our models. It outperforms the more sophisticated, but equilibrium
                                            —20—



 based   models (such as Model 8). Model 4 does almost as well and the geometric
 means of 3, 4, 6 and 7 are relatively close. Model 2, the martingale shift model does
 very poorly. Although martingale shift is obviously a poor assumption for the
 long—term, our forecast horizon is only two and a—half years so this maybe
 somewhat surprising.
          The general flavor of these results carries over into the other three
forecasting scenarios. In the one step unconditional forecasts, models 1 and 4 do
very well, followed closely by 3 and 6. Again, the equilibrium models 7, 8 and 9 do
somewhat worse. In the one through ten step ahead conditional scenario, model 1
seems to do substantially better than the others, while with unconditional forecasts,
model 3 and model 6 do slightly better than model       1.

         Similar exercises were carried out separately across states and across
industries to see if individual states or individual industries were different. The
states were also divided into fast growth, average growth, and slow growth
categories and results computed for these separately. The results give no surprises.
Models 1, 3 and 4 were always the leaders in forecasting ability, with none
appearing as a clear—cut preference in all cases. In two industry cases (durables,
finance) Models 6 and 7 also performed well.
         The value of parsimony in selecting forecasting models is clear. The results
were then reanalyzed using the AIC or Akaike Information Criterion proposed by
Akaike(1974) and BIC or Bayesian Information Criterion introduced by
Schwarz(1978) which provides a higher penalty for each parameter. The models
selected by these criteria are better on average than a random selection of the
models and the BIC is very close to selecting the best model. Further details are in
Brown(1986) and for another data set in Engle and Brown(1988)and Brown and
Engle( 1986).

         To summarize the results of this section, we find that models with
                                         —21—



low—parameterizations, particularly the martingale share, and constant and
autoregressive shift models, out—perform less constrained models in post—sample
forecasting. This is not surprising for two related reasons. First, the results of our
cointegration tests indicate that regional share should be modeled with a unit root
in its dynamic process, and it happens that the simpler models impose this
constraint. Second, examination of regional shifts across time indicate a great
amount of instability in this value, and highly parameterized models often fail to
forecast well in such circumstances. Thus, the martingale share, and to a lesser
extent, the constant shift models, which are both low parameter, random walk
constructions, forecast significantly better than the alternative models considered
here.



7. Conclusions
        11TraditionaP' models of regional share typically involve a unit root in the
stochastic process which defines the share. The "martingale share" model is the
prime example of this. That the share follows a random walk may be thought of as
a result of the persistence of location decisions by the factors of production and the
cointegration results of Section 5 bear this out. National and regional earnings do
not cointegrate, hence they have no equilibrium relationship. In Section 6 we
summarize the results of an exhaustive comparison of several models of shift and
share, mainly via their forecasting ability. We compare the performance of these
models directly. Again, as might have been expected given the non—cointegration
results, those models which imposed unit root relationships on the share, even
though they performed less well in—sample due to the low parameterization, proved
far superior in terms of forecasting ability. In fact, the simplest one, the margingale
share model performed so well overall, that due both to its simplicity, ease of
computation — and its ability to forecast, it becomes highly recommended,both as
                                         —22—



a forecasting device, where the current share is the best forecast of future share, and
as a description of the temporal process of the share.
       These simple conclusions may appear to contradict findings of Norrbin and
Schlagenhauf(1988) for the US and Altonji and Ham(1985) for Canada, that find the
bulk of the variability in regional output is due to aggregate or national shocks. In
fact our very simple martingale share model can be rewritten as

                    =   Yust +
which decomposes the regional changes into national and regional causes. The
model makes no prediction as to which source of shocks is greater. It merely says
that both permanently change regional output. If the system were cointegrated, the
regional shocks would not be permanent and might then be even less important,
particularly for long horizon forecasting. Thus, these results are fully consistent
with ours.
