                                              ABSTRACT

Most analysts of the modern Latin American economy hold to a pessimistic belief in historical persistence
-- they believe that Latin America has always had very high levels of inequality, suggesting it will
be hard for modern social policy to create a more egalitarian society. This paper argues that this conclusion
is not supported by what little evidence we have. The persistence view is based on an historical literature
which has made little or no effort to be comparative. Modern analysts see a more unequal Latin America
compared with Asia and the rich post-industrial nations and then assume that this must always have
been true. Indeed, some have argued that high inequality appeared very early in the post-conquest
Americas, and that this fact supported rent-seeking and anti-growth institutions which help explain
the disappointing growth performance we observe there even today. This paper argues to the contrary.
Compared with the rest of the world, inequality was not high in pre-conquest 1491, nor was it high
in the post-conquest decades following 1492. Indeed, it was not even high in the mid-19th century
just prior Latin America’s belle époque. It only became high thereafter. Historical persistence in Latin
American inequality is a myth.

                     Latin American Inequality over Five Centuries



        Most analysts of the modern Latin American economy carry a pessimistic belief

in historical persistence: that is, they believe that Latin America has always had very high

levels of income and wealth inequality, suggesting it will be hard, or even impossible, for

modern social policy to create a more egalitarian society. This paper argues that this

conclusion is not supported by what little evidence we have. The persistence view is

based on an historical literature which has made little or no effort to be comparative.

Indeed, other studies have shown that even where there is measured historical

persistence, the effects decay over time (Banerjee and Iyer 2005; Nunn 2008; Bruhn and

Gallego 2009). Yet modern analysts see a more unequal Latin America compared with

Asia and the rich post-industrial nations (López and Perry 2008) and then assume that

this must always have been true. Indeed, some have argued that high inequality appeared

very early in the post-conquest Americas, and that this fact supported rent-seeking and

anti-growth institutions which help explain the disappointing growth performance we

observe there even today. This paper argues to the contrary. Compared with the rest of

the world, inequality was not high in pre-conquest 1491, nor was it high in the post-

conquest decades following 1492. Indeed, it was not even high in the mid-19th century

just prior Latin America’s belle époque. It only became high thereafter. Historical

persistence in Latin American inequality is a myth.

        The next section places Latin American pre-industrial inequality in context by

comparing it with inequality the world around over the two millennia from Rome in 14

AD to British India in 1947. It turns out that there is little that is unusual about pre-




                                               3
industrial Latin America when that comparison is made. The paper then offers empirical

explanations for pre-industrial inequality the world around over the two millennia since

Rome, including late 18th and 19th century Latin America. Next, we ask whether Latin

America has always been more unequal. The paper goes on to use the estimated

relationship found in the pre-industrial sample to fill by prediction the many and big

empirical gaps in Latin American inequality history from 1491 through the end of the

belle époque. That is, it uses an estimated world pre-industrial relationship to predict

Latin American inequality where no income distribution evidence is yet available. These

predictions are then compared with the Latin American inequality facts where they exist.

The paper concludes by posing four revisionist hypotheses. The hope is that these

working hypotheses will be used to motivate the collection of new pre-industrial

inequality evidence and thus perhaps to overthrow once and for all the historical

persistence view that pervades modern debate about Latin American inequality.


                               Latin America in Context:
             What Did Pre-Industrial Inequality Look Like the World Round?1


           We have no evidence documenting inequality for the Inca, Aztec or other

indigenous civilizations in the Americas prior to the arrival of the Iberian conquerors. But

we can guess. Recently, Branko Milanovic, Peter Lindert and myself (2008; hereafter

BMW) collected what we call an ‘ancient inequality’ data base for 29 places, ranging

over two millennia from the Roman Empire in the year 14, Byzantium in the year 1000,

England in 1290, Tuscany in 1427, Holland in 1732, Old Castille in 1752, France in

1788, Java in 1880, and British India in 1947. The sample includes four Latin American

                                                        4
observations: Nueva España 1790, Chile 1861, Brazil 1872, and Peru 1876, although a

new Mexican 1844 social table observation can now be added to the BMW sample.

While each of these 29 BMW observations reports a Gini coefficient and other measures

of inequality, only Tuscany 1427 offers a full size distribution of income. Instead, the

observations have been constructed mainly from what are called social tables, sources

which report average income and income recipients by social classes, but no income

variance within them.

       Social tables are particularly useful in evaluating ancient societies where classes

were clearly delineated, where the differences in mean incomes between them were

substantial, and where mobility between them was trivial. If class (and race) alone

determined one’s income, and if income differences between classes were large while

income differences within classes were small (mainly reflecting life-cycle status and

luck), then most inequality would be explained by average income differences between

classes. One of the most famous social tables was constructed by Gregory King for

England and Wales in 1688 (Barnett 1936; Lindert and Williamson 1982). King’s class

list was fairly detailed (31 in number), but he did not report inequalities within these

social groups, so we cannot identify within-class inequality for 1688 England. Yet, when

income variance within class is also available for any pre-industrial country offering

social table estimates, the differences between measured inequality are typically very

small whether within class variance is included or excluded. Indeed, when comparing any

two pre-industrial societies where full size distributions are available, inequality

differences between them can be explained almost entirely by inequality differences

measured by class differences alone. In short, the lion’s share of inequality in pre-




                                              5
industrial societies is and was accounted for by between-class average income

differences.

         Table 1 and Figure 1 report what these BMW data look like. The Gini estimates

are plotted in Figure 1 against income or GDP (or GDI) per capita. Figure 1 also displays

what we call the inequality possibility frontier (solid line), a curve based on the

maximum inequality the elite could have extracted at that income per capita. The

maximum is constructed under the assumption that everybody but the elite in such

repressive societies would have gotten just the World Bank’s subsistence minimum of

$PPP 300.2 The ratio of the actual inequality to the maximum feasible inequality (both

expressed in Gini coefficients) is called the extraction ratio.3 In most cases, the

calculated pre-industrial Ginis lie pretty close to the inequality possibility frontier (IPF).

The countries farthest below the IPF curve – with the lowest extraction ratios -- are the

most advanced pre-industrial economies in northwestern Europe: that is, 1561-1808

Holland, 1788 France, and 1688-1801 England.

         The inequality possibility frontier allows us to better situate these ancient pre-

industrial inequality estimates in a modern context. The bottom panel of Table 1 provides

estimates of inequality extraction ratios for 25 contemporary societies. Brazil has often


2
  This is less than Maddison’s (1998: 12) assumed subsistence minimum of $PPP 400 which, in principle,
covers more than physiological needs. Note that a purely physiological minimum “sufficient to sustain life
with moderate activity and zero consumption of other goods” (Bairoch 1993: 106) was estimated by
Bairoch to be $PPP 80 at 1960 prices, or $PPP 355 at 1990 prices. Our minimum is also consistent with the
World Bank absolute poverty line which is 1.08 per day per capita in 1993 $PPP (Chen and Ravallion
2007: 6). This works out to be about $PPP 365 per annum in 1990 international prices. Since more than a
billion people are believed to have incomes less than the World Bank global poverty line, it seems
reasonable to assume that the physiological minimum income must be less. One may recall also that Colin
Clark (1957: 18-23) distinguished between international units (the early PPP dollar) and oriental units, the
lower dollar equivalents which he thought held for subtropical or tropical regions where calorie, housing
and clothing needs are considerably less than those in temperate climates. Since our ancient pre-industrial
sample includes a fair number of tropical countries, this gives us another reason to use a conservatively low
estimate of the physiological minimum.

  The extraction ratio is not unlike an index of the percent in poverty, but where the poverty line is fixed.

been cited as an example of an extremely unequal society, driven by a long history of

slavery, racial discrimination and regional dualism. Indeed, Brazil’s Gini in 2002 is

comparable to the most unequal pre-industrial societies in our ancient inequality sample.

But Brazil is more than four times richer than the average ancient society in our sample,

so its maximum feasible inequality (92.7) is much higher than our ancient society average

(60.6). Thus, modern elites have extracted only a little more than 63 percent of the

maximum feasible inequality in Brazil, and its inequality extraction ratio is about the

same as what we find among the least exploitative and repressive ancient societies like

1801-3 England and 1886 Japan. What is true of Brazil, is also true of contemporary

Chile, Mexico and Peru. All three have Ginis today well above the world average (Chile

2003 = 54.6, Mexico 2000 = 53.8 and Peru 2002 = 52 versus the world average = 40.6),

but all three have extraction ratios below the least exploitative in our ancient societies

sample. Furthermore, not all of these four have Ginis today above what they were 150-

200 years ago. Inequality has fallen over two centuries in two Latin American republics

for which data exist: Chile 1861 = 63.7 to 2003 = 54.6, or 14 percent lower, and Mexico

1790 = 63.5 to 2000 = 53.8, or 15 percent lower. Inequality has been on the rise over two

centuries in the other two Latin American republics for which data exist: Brazil 1872 =

43.3 to 2002 = 58.8, or 36 percent higher; and Peru 1876 = 42.2 to 2002 = 52, or 23

percent higher.

       As a country becomes richer, and its surplus above subsistence rises, its feasible

inequality expands. Consequently, even if recorded inequality is stable, the extraction

ratio must fall. This can be seen in Figure 2 where the inequality extraction ratio is

plotted against income per capita for both ancient societies and their modern




                                              7
counterparts. Thus, the social consequences of increased inequality may not entail as

much relative impoverishment, or as much perceived injustice, as might appear if we

looked only at the recorded Gini. This logic is particularly compelling for low and

middle-income societies where increases in income push the maximum feasible

inequality up sharply along the steepest part of the IPF curve. The farther a society rises

above the subsistence minimum, the less will economic development lift its inequality

possibilities, and thus the extraction ratio will be driven more and more by the rise in the

actual Gini itself. Thus, the inequality extraction ratio has fallen everywhere in Latin

America over the past century or two, and in some cases by a lot: it has fallen by 15

percent in Brazil (from 74.2 in 1872 to 63.4 in 2002), by 32 percent in Chile (from 83 in

1861 to 56.4 in 2003), by 47 percent in Mexico (from 105.5 in 1790 to 56.2 in 2000), and

by 27 percent in Peru (from 78.1 in 1876 to 56.7 in 2002). While the rest of this paper

will focus on actual or measured inequality, future debates over social justice and

economic development will have to struggle with the implications of different trends in

actual inequality and extraction ratios.



       Fundamentals: Explaining Pre-Industrial Inequality the World Round



       Using this BMW information from ancient pre-industrial societies, can we explain

differences in observed inequality? The Kuznets hypothesis posits that inequality tends to

follow a bell-shape as average real income increases. Although Kuznets formulated his

hypothesis explicitly with a view toward industrializing and industrialized economies,

one might wonder whether his Curve is even more apparent among our pre-industrial




                                              8
economies as well. After all, the secular upswing could be easily explained by increases

in per capita income: poor countries do not have much surplus for the elite to extract, but

as income rises in pre-industrial economies, so does the surplus and potential inequality.

In addition to log average income and its square, Table 2 includes the urbanization rate,

population density and colonial status (a dummy variable). The regression also includes a

number of controls for country-specific eccentricities in the data: the number of social

groups available for calculating the Gini, whether the social table is based on tax data,

and whether the social table for a colony includes the income of resident colonists. The

Kuznets hypothesis predicts a positive coefficient on average income (or its log) and

negative coefficient on its square. We also expect higher inequality for the more

urbanized countries (reflecting a common finding that inequality in urban areas tends to

be higher than in rural areas: Ravallion et al. 2007), and for those that are ruled by

foreign elites since powerful colonizers are presumed to be able to achieve higher

extraction rates than weaker local elites, and since countries with weak local elites but

with large surpluses will attract powerful colonizers to extract it (Acemoglu, Johnson and

Robinson 2001, 2002).

           The empirical results confirm all expectations. Both income terms are of the right

sign and significant, supporting a pre-industrial Kuznets Curve.4 The sign on the

urbanization rate is, as predicted, positive, but since it competes with population density,

its statistical significance is somewhat lower. Still, each percentage point increase in the

urbanization rate (say, from 10 percent to 11 percent) is associated with an increase in the

Gini by 0.35 points. Colonies were clearly much more unequal: holding everything else

    Note that GDP per capita is in natural logs.

constant, colonies had a Gini almost 13 points higher than non-colonies.5 Foreigner is a

dummy variable that controls for two observations (South Serbia 1455 and Levant 1596)

that were colonies but where their ancient inequality surveys did not report the incomes

and numbers of colonizers at the top. This is therefore simply another control for data

eccentricity, and its negative sign shows that being a colony, but not having colonizers

included in the survey, reduces recorded inequality considerably (9 to 10 points).

         The number of social groups used in the inequality calculations, or tax census

origin of social tables, do not affect the Gini in any significant way. This finding is

comforting, especially regarding Nueva España’s three classes, because it shows that our

estimates of inequality are being driven by fundamentals, not by the way the social tables

were constructed by pre-industrial observers.

         Population density is negatively associated with inequality, although its

significance weakens when the two Java observations – the most dense part of the pre-

industrial world – are removed. It might have been expected that the introduction of a

dummy variable for more densely populated Asia would have caused the effect of density

to dissipate. This is not the case, as shown in column 2 of Table 2. The negative impact

of population density on inequality seems to be counter-intuitive. After all, conventional

theory – which we will exploit below -- would predict that more population pressure on

the land should raise land yields and rents, lower labor’s marginal product and the wage,

thus producing more inequality, not less. Furthermore, this effect should have been all the

more powerful in pre-industrial societies where land and labor drove inequality not, as in

modern societies, human capital and financial wealth. It seems likely that this


5
  To repeat, it should be stressed that this is a correlation only. The causal relation cannot be identified with
this regression.


                                                       10
conventional effect is being offset in the ancient economy data by two forces. First,

densely populated agrarian societies also had lower per capita income, so this may have

been working against the conventional force (since inequality rises with per capita

income). Second, more densely populated agrarian societies must have had higher

relative food prices than thinly settled societies, so that nominal subsistence had to be

much higher to purchase the more expensive foodstuffs, lowering measured inequality

and the extraction ratio.6 It seems likely that this force must have been most powerful

during the two millennia before the middle of the 19th century since a world market for

grains did not yet exist and thus local conditions dictated the relative price of food

(Latham and Neal 1983; Clingingsmith and Williamson 2008; Studer 2008). This second

offset has important implications for comparing inequality in the labor-scarce and

resource-abundant Americas with the labor-abundant and resource-scarce Europe, and

between the densely populated highlands in Mexico and the Andes relative to resource-

abundant Southern Cone. However, it is less clear that it had the same effect within

countries over time, since the results in Table 2 rely almost entirely on a cross section, not

a time series. Finally, to the extent that population size and density are correlated, there is

a third possible offset. Looking at modern data, Filipe Campante and Quoc-Anh Do

(2007) explain the negative correlation by the size of the potential revolutionary

underclass concentrated around the capital thus posing a threat to the elite.




6
  Rarely do even modern inequality studies assess the impact of different class-specific cost-of-living trends
on real inequality trends. We know this mattered hugely in early modern Europe (Hoffman et al. 2002),
and we need to know whether it has also mattered at any time in Latin America since 1491. When Latin
America underwent her commodity export boom during the belle époque, did the rise in food export prices
in the Southern Cone serve to raise real inequality even more than nominal inequality? Did it have the
opposite effect in Mexico, which imported cheap corn from the United States? And what about 20th century
Latin American food exporters when their terms of trade collapsed 1915-1940?


                                                     11
       The stylized picture that emerges is this: Inequality follows contours that are

consistent with the Kuznets Curve hypothesis, a pre-industrial secular rise to a peak,

followed by a fall during modern economic growth. It follows that most of the pre-

industrial Third World had probably reached very high levels of inequality by the early

19th century before what is called the first global trade boom. However, the extraction

ratio tends to fall as income increases, even during pre-industrial times. This fact would,

of course, invite a European colonist to plunder where the potential surplus was big, but

where the local elite had relaxed their extraction rate. We will return to this issue below.



                   Has Latin America Always Been More Unequal?



       Has Latin America always been more unequal than other parts of the world, as

implied by the recent work of Stanley Engerman and Kenneth Sokoloff (1997;

Engerman, Haber and Sokoloff 2000)? Engerman and Sokoloff offered a hypothesis to

account for Latin American growth underachievement during the two centuries following

its independence. Their thesis begins with the plausible assertion that high levels of

income inequality, and thus of political power, favor rich landlords and rent-seekers, and

thus the development of institutions which are compatible with rent-seeking but

incompatible with economic growth. Their thesis argues further that high levels of Latin

American inequality have their roots in the natural resource endowments present when

Iberia conquered and colonized the region five centuries ago. Exploitation of the native

population and of imported African slaves, as well as their subsequent

disenfranchisement, reinforced the development of institutions incompatible with growth.




                                             12
Engerman and Sokoloff had no difficulty collecting evidence which confirmed high

inequality, disenfranchisement and lack of suffrage in Latin America compared with the

United States. But what about comparisons with the rest of the world, and what about

earlier?7 Oddly enough, neither the Engerman-Sokoloff team or its critics have

confronted the thesis with inequality evidence for the economic leaders in northwest

Europe at comparable pre-industrial stages; this is the comparison that matters, not with

industrial United States.

         Table 3 presents inequality information for pre-industrial western Europe (that is,

prior to 1810) and for pre-industrial Latin America (that is, prior to 1880). For the former,

we have observations from 1788 France, 1561 and 1732 Holland, and 1688, 1759 and

1801 England-Wales. For the latter, we have Nueva España 1790 and Mexico 1844 taken

as an average, Chile 1861, Brazil 1872 and Peru 1876. Engerman and Sokoloff coined

their hypothesis in terms of actual inequality. According to that criterion, their thesis

must be soundly rejected. That is, the (population weighted) average Latin American Gini

(47.5) was considerably lower than that of western Europe (52.9), not higher.8

Furthermore, the comparative inequality implications emerging for these social tables

have been confirmed recently by Rafael Dobado and Hector Gracia using an inequality

proxy – Maddison’s real GDP per capita relative to their unskilled grain wage: according

to their data, in 1820 Mexico, Bolivia and Colombia all had less inequality than did the

7
 John Coatsworth argues that the Engerman-Sokoloff thesis has not held up well to scrutiny: “what little
quantitative evidence there is does not suggest that ownership of land, or other assets for that matter, was
more concentrated in Latin America than in the United States” (Coatsworth 2008: 553). However,
Coatsworth’s survey of the land and wealth distribution estimates for Latin America (Coatsworth 2008:
Table 2, 553) reveals that the first Latin America observations are for the province of Buenos Aires in 1820
and 1838, and for Rio de Janeiro in 1830. He is not able to report any colonial observations. See also
Johnson and Frank (2006) and Gelman and Santilli (2006).
8
 If pre-industrial Mexican inequality is described best by the 1844 observation in Table 3, then this
conclusion can be made even stronger.


                                                     13
Netherlands, the United Kingdom and France, or even Portugal and Spain (Dobado and

Garcia 2009: Figure 18).

         It is not true that pre-industrial Latin America was more unequal than pre-

industrial northwest Europe.9 Thus, if inequality encouraged rent-seeking and

discouraged growth in Latin America, it did it even more so in northwest Europe where

the industrial revolution first started! Since we know that high inequality was consistent

with industrial revolutions occurring in western Europe, it is unclear why it should be

inconsistent with it in Latin America somewhat later. However, Latin America was

poorer than northwest Europe, and poorer societies have a smaller surplus for the elite to

extract. Thus, maximum feasible inequality was considerably lower and extraction rates

were considerably higher in Latin America than in northwest Europe (Table 3). While

measured inequality does not support the Engerman-Sokoloff thesis, the extraction rate

does.10 The Engerman-Sokoloff team, their followers, and their critics all need to decide

which of these inequality indicators matters for their hypothesis and why. To the extent

that political power determines the extraction ratio, then Daron Acemoglu and James

Robinson may be quite right in stressing political inequality rather than just economic

inequality (Acemoglu et al. 2008; Acemoglu and Robinson 2006).




9
  See also the summaries on this point in Bértola et al. (2009: 5-6) and Bértola (2009). It should be added
that has Asia not always been less unequal? Ancient Asia was not significantly less unequal when we
control for other factors. Indeed, population density is sufficient to identify why ancient Asia had lower
levels of inequality than the rest of the pre-industrial world.
10
   In this sense, Coatsworth may have been too quick to conclude, based on measured inequality, that “if
colonial institutions constrained economic development, they did not do so until after the colonial era”
(Coatsworth 2008: 11).

Initial Conditions: What Was Latin American Inequality Like in 1491?

of the dependent variables also reported in Table 4 to predict Ginis for Latin America in

1700, 1790, 1820 and 1870. Table 4 also predicts Ginis for Mexico in 1820 and 1870. In

addition, the table reports predictions for the five Latin American cases where we also

have actual inequality estimates: i.e. Nueva España 1790, Mexico 1844, Brazil 1872,

Chile 1861 and Peru 1876. While the correlation between actual and predicted inequality

for those five cases is hardly perfect, it is positive and strongly significant (R2=0.68), a

comforting result.

       Table 4 implies that the Gini coefficient in Latin America prior to the arrival of

the Iberians was 22.5, which would have made it the society with the lowest inequality in

the pre-industrial world (or at least in our sample of it: Table 1). China in 1880 had a Gini

of 24.5, very close to pre-conquest Latin America. Dutch colonial Java had a Gini in

1880 of 39.7, a figure which would have been 27.1 without the Dutch colonists

(according to the BMW regression, 39.7-12.6 = 27.1). Thus, Table 4 implies that pre-

conquest Latin America had modest levels of inequality much like all the other poor pre-

industrial societies in our sample which had escaped being colonized.

Extracting the Surplus: What Was the Colonial Impact Like after 1492?

        Given what we know about ancient pre-industrial economies the world around,

and assuming that Iberian colonists were no better or worse at extracting surplus than

were the other colonizers in the ancient inequality sample (England, Holland, and the

Ottoman Turks), the answer to this question is quite simple. Colonies had higher Gini

coefficients by 12-13 percentage points (Table 2), so the Latin American Gini coefficient

might have drifted up from 22.5 in 1491 to something like 35 in the post-1492 decades.

Perhaps it was in fact a bit lower or a bit higher, but inequality clearly must have jumped

up significantly during the first decades after the Iberian conquest, an increase of about

half. Not only did the Iberian elite replace the indigenous elite, but, if they were anything

like the English, the Dutch and the Turks, the Iberians must have been able (or willing) to

raise the extraction rate in their favor by a lot.



Inequality Decline? The Likely Impact of the 16th Century Demographic Disaster

        As is well known, European disease caused immense demographic damage to the

indigenous population over the century following Columbus’s first voyage, due to

soaring mortality rates. Massimo Livi-Bacci thinks it shrank by more than 90 percent by

the early 17th century (Livi Bacci 2006). Other scholars, like Angus Maddison, think the

shrinking was smaller, and Table 4 uses Maddison to take the lower bound. The Atlantic

slave trade tried to substitute African slaves for decimated indigenous populations but

their addition was far smaller than the subtraction from the indigenous population caused

by European disease. Furthermore, the African slaves arrived in significant numbers only

after a long lag. Moreover, not many were transported to the once densely populated




                                               16
highlands where the indigenous population losses were greatest, but rather to the sugar-

rich tropics where the losses were smallest. The demographic collapse destroyed

indigenous political and institutional structures, facilitated religious and cultural

assimilation, and helped raise the per capita income of the indigenous survivors who

resettled on the best lands.11

        It is useful to elaborate that last point: the demographic disaster in Latin America

must have contributed to higher (but unknown) GDP per capita and average labor

productivity, higher marginal productivity of labor, and lower marginal productivity of

land, suggesting that the wage-rental ratio (w/r) went up and that inequality went down.

The economics can be made a little more precise. Assume that only land (R) and labor

(L) mattered in the early colonial economy, and that technology (A) was unchanged

across the 16th century. If we also assume constant returns to scale, then it follows that

                 Y = ARαLβ, α + β = 1,

                 Y/L = A(R/L)α = y = GDP per capita.

The marginal product of labor and land are, respectively,

                 dY/dL = β(Y/L) = w, dY/dR = α (Y/R) = r

so that the wage-rental ratio is

                 w/r = (β/α)(R/L)

Thus, the wage-rental ratio rises with the land-labor ratio, and the elasticity relating the

two is (under these assumptions) always 1.

  Bates, Coatsworth and Williamson (2007: 919-20). Note the demographic parallel with Alwyn Young’s
argument that today’s HIV-AIDS raises the incomes of those Africans who survive the disease (Young
2005), or Joel Mokyr’s argument that the Irish famine in the late 1840s raised per capita income of the
survivors (Mokyr 1983).


                                                  17
         The elasticity of GDP per capita to the land-labor ratio is α. Table 4 reports that

population density fell by 51 percent between 1500 and 1600 (from 1.60 to 0.78 persons

per square kilometer), implying that the land-labor ratio rose about 103 percent (from

0.63 to 1.28 square kilometers per person). If α = 0.5, then GDP per capita might have

increased by about 52 percent over the century. John Coatsworth (2008: 548) is in

agreement: “As European disease and abuse decimated indigenous populations … per

capita output rose ... Additional gains in productivity occurred when those who survived

found work, resettled or were ‘congregated’ on the most productive lands.” And what

went up, then went down. As the indigenous population slowly recovered between 1600

and 1700, the land-labor ratio fell about 29 percent, implying that GDP per capita might

have decreased by almost 15 percent, at least in the Latin American interior. Based on

Mexican evidence, Coatsworth (2008: 548) thinks the fall was even bigger: “Mexican

production stagnated for most of the seventeenth century, falling by half in per capita

terms as population recovered … The revival of the indigenous population … put an end

to rising productivity in agriculture.” Of course, things were different in the sugar-based

plantation islands of the Caribbean, but these crude estimates generated by land-labor

ratio trends are used in Table 4 to interpolate GDP per capita between Maddison’s

observations for 1500 and 1790.

         According to the simple economics above, the percentage rise in the wage-rental

ratio across the 16th century would have been about the same as the percentage fall in the

labor-land ratio.12 If population fell by Livi-Bacci’s 90 percent estimate (from an index of


12
  The economics is very simple, and complexity would diminish the size of the demographic disaster
effects estimated here, but not the direction. For example, if land supply was very elastic (as it probably
was in the Americas) then the impact on the land-labor ratio would be diminished. To take another
example, while the assumption of constant technology across the 16th century is analytically convenient,


                                                     18
100 to 10), then the land-labor ratio rose by a factor of ten (from an index of 10 to 100),13

which implies that wage-rental ratio rose by a factor of 10 as well. As we noted above,

and based instead on Maddison’s population estimates, Table 4 implies that the land-

labor ratio rose by more than 100 percent. We have assumed perfect competition in these

calculations which, of course, is completely inconsistent with our knowledge that Iberian

colonists introduced coercive and repressive devices so that labor’s greater scarcity was

not fully rewarded. In more formal terms, the Iberians used slavery, haciendas and other

institutions to push the wage below labor’s marginal product (Coatsworth 2008; Bértola

et al. 2009: 6-8). Thus, the demographically-induced rise in the wage-rental ratio must

have been considerably less than 100 percent. But even if it was only 25 or 50 percent, it

implies pronounced downward pressure on inequality across the 16th century.

Furthermore, it seems likely that land concentration also diminished as labor got scarcer,

so there are other reasons to believe that exogenous demographic trends put strong

downward pressure on inequality across the 16th century. On the other hand, improved

productivity in extracting minerals from the mines as well as any general improvement in

economy-wide productivity (e.g. a rise in A) might have pushed inequality in the

opposite direction, upwards. What was the net effect? Table 4 predicts that after the

initial effect of colonization, there was very little additional change in Latin American

inequality up to 1600.




technological transfer from Europe and mining development must have increased A in the formal output
and output per worker expression in the text. This point is expanded below.

   The cultivatable land area of Latin America was 10.966 million km2 between 1500 and 1800. Livi-
Bacci’s 50 million pre-conquest population implies a population density of 4.56. His 3-4 (say 3.5) million
estimate for c1700 implies a density of 0.31, a spectacular fall of population density over the 16th century.

Inequality Rise: What Did Latin American Inequality Look Like in 1790?

        Over the two centuries between 1600 and 1790, a number of fundamentals were at

work in Latin America which would have served to raise inequality and extraction ratios.

First and foremost, populations partially recovered their 16th century losses. Interpolating

1790 from Maddison’s (2008) estimates for 1700 and 1820, yields a rise in population

from 8.6 million in 1600 to 12.45 million in 1790. Thus, population density rose from

about 0.78 to 1.14, and land-labor ratios fell by about 31 percent. Second, GDP per capita

rose from 438 to 650, or almost by half, and urbanization rose from 9 to 14.2 percent, or

by more than half. These forces imply that the Gini might have risen from 36.2 to 57.6,

which, according to the Table 4 predictions, implies that over the three centuries between

1491 and 1870 Latin American inequality reached its peak in the late colonial decades

just prior to independence.



Revolution, Independence and Lost Decades

        While revolution, independence and the ‘lost decades’ that followed up to about

1870 (Bates, Coatsworth and Williamson 2007) were very complicated times, and while

there must have been many forces at work influencing inequality, the ancient inequality

regression predicts that the Gini probably dropped from 57.6 in 1790 to 46.4 in 1870. The

biggest force contributing to the fall was, of course, independence and de-colonization

since the five ‘lost decades’ between the 1820s and the 1870 yielded very little GDP per

capita growth14 or urbanization. Mexico repeats the Latin American (predicted) trends, its



14
  Debate over Angus Maddison’s data is intense, but some adopt his more positive view of Latin American
growth 1820-1870. See, for example, Leandro Prados de la Escosura (2007, 2009). However, even Prados’
more rosy view of post-independence is consistent with very poor growth performance (Prados 2007: Table


                                                  20
Gini falling from 57.7 to 44 between 1790 and 1870, and, once again, by far the biggest

fall being between 1790 and 1820, from 57.7 to 47.8. Ongoing research by Amilcar

Challu also suggests a significant fall in Mexican inequality: he estimates a social table

for 1844 Querétaro yielding a Gini of 51.3,15 suggesting that most of the fall between

1790 and 1870 had taken place by the 1840s.

         Recent archival work by Leticia Arroyo Abad (2008: Figure 1) confirms this

prediction of falling inequality after independence. She uses data on wage rates and land

rents to infer trends in inequality. When her rent-wage ratios for Argentina, Mexico, and

Venezuela are weighted by 1850 populations, the resulting Latin American rent-wage

ratio falls by 11 percent 1820-1850, and for Mexico alone the fall is 12 percent.

Furthermore, the Arroyo Abad Mexican rent-wage ratio trends and the Mexican Gini

coefficients coming from the social tables in Table 4 are closely reproduced by the

Amilcar Challu rent-wage series for central Mexico 1780-1869 reported in Table 5.

Challu’s inequality index rises by 38 percent from the 1780s to the 1800s, falls by 29

percent from the 1800s to the 1820s, and then continues a slow downward drift during the

‘lost decades’ up to the 1860s. To summarize, the Arroyo Abad index falls by 4 percent

per decade between 1820 and 1850, the Challu index falls by 5.2 percent per decade

between 1820 and 1869, and our Gini in Table 4 falls by almost 2 percent per decade

between 1820 and 1870.




1.4): between 1820 and 1850, the two biggest republics, Brazil and Mexico, grew at 0 and 0.1 percent per
annum, respectively; in the 1850s, the figures were -0.1 and -1.3. Lost decades indeed.

   In personal correspondence, Challu has described Querétaro as quite representative, but it is, of course,
only one state.

Creating Modern Inequality during the Belle Époque Globalization Boom

       “[As] export-led economic growth took off throughout Latin America in the late

       nineteenth century, economic inequality increased … The returns to [land,] scarce

       capital and skills rose precipitously. Peasant and public lands … passed into the

       hands of landlords, politicians, land companies and plantations ... The conditions

       that Engerman-Sokoloff and Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson saw as blocking

       economic growth were in fact the conditions that made it possible” (Coatsworth

       2008: 567-8).

       The economics underlying Coatsworth’s statement above is, of course, quite

straight forward. Latin America faced a rising terms of trade throughout the late 19th

century. Since it was a primary product exporter, land and mineral rents were driven up

relative to wages. This happened everywhere around the poor periphery (Williamson

2002, 2008), but it was especially dramatic in Latin America partly because the region

was able to expand its export sectors so effectively, thus to become very large shares in

GDP (Williamson 2009: Table 4.1). Since land and mineral resources were held by those

at the top, inequality rose as well. Not too long ago, the only data we had to judge the

magnitude of these inequality trends were proxies, like the land rent to unskilled wage

ratio or the GDP per worker to unskilled wage ratio (Williamson 1999, 2002). Thus,

when the rent-wage ratios for Argentina, Mexico, Uruguay and Venezuela (Arroyo Abad

2008: Figure 1) are weighted by 1890 populations, the Latin American average rises 7.9

percent per decade 1850-1870 and 6.3 percent per decade 1870-1900, for a total increase

of 37 percent after 1850. This rent-wage proxy thus implies a big inequality surge over

the second half of the century. We also have the more comprehensive belle époque




                                             22
inequality evidence for the Southern Cone summarized in Table 6. It comes from two

sources: first, Ginis calculated from new evidence collected by Luis Bértola and his

collaborators (2009: Table 4), and second, what Leandro Prados de la Escosura (2007:

Table 12.1) calls his backward projected Pseudo-Ginis. They both tell the same tale:

inequality rose by 11-37 percent over the belle époque. True, and as the table makes

clear, the Latin American weighted average reported in Table 6 refers only to four

republics in the Southern Cone – Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. Thus, the

average misses the heavily populated Mexican and Andean republics. However, Prados

de la Escosura also shows that a Mexican inequality proxy -- income per worker to the

unskilled wage ratio -- rose by about 2.8 times between the early 1880s and 1920 (Prados

de la Escosura 2007: Figure 12.1b), suggesting that over its four Porfiriato pre-

revolutionary decades Mexico followed the Southern Cone by recording a steep rise in

inequality. Brazil recorded a less spectacular increase between the early 1880s and the

mid 1920s, but still the income per capita to unskilled wage ratio rose by about 45

percent (Prados de la Escosura 2007: Figure 12.1b). Furthermore, the Arroyo Abad rent-

wage inequality proxy for Mexico confirms the Prados data since the 1870-1900 increase

was 27 percent over the three decades. Assuming, therefore, that Mexican inequality rose

more like the Prados P-Ginis than the Bértola Ginis for the southern cone, it follows that

Latin American inequality probably rose by something like 30 percent over the belle

époque. Applying that increase to the 1870 Latin American Gini coefficient in Table 4

would imply that it rose from 46.4 to 60.3, making the Gini in the 1920s the highest that

Latin America recorded since pre-conquest, even higher than the 1790 colonial peak

(57.6), and much, much higher than 1600 (36.2). Any modern analyst who believes that




                                            23
high inequality has been an attribute of Latin America since the Iberian conquest should

take note.



                                 Revisionist Hypotheses



       Figure 3 plots our inequality predictions from 1491 to 1929. However crude the

evidence may seem, it points to several revisionist interpretations of, or hypotheses about,

500 years of Latin American inequality.

       First, it is simply not true that Latin America has always been unequal. It cannot

be stressed enough that this is a comparative statement. Only by comparisons with other

times and places can statements about Latin American inequality offer any useful

meaning. While comparisons with the United States are not uncommon in the recent

literature, comparisons with the European (colonial) leaders or with other parts of the

poor periphery are rarely, if ever, made. When such comparisons are made (Table 3 and

Milanovic, Lindert and Williamson 2008), income inequality in pre-industrial Latin

America is found to have been lower than that of northwest Europe, not higher. To

repeat, it is not true that pre-industrial Latin America (pre-1870) was more unequal than

pre-industrial northwest Europe (pre-1800). Thus, if, as Engerman and Sokoloff have

suggested, it is thought that inequality encouraged rent-seeking, suppressed private

property rights, retarded the development of ‘good’ institutions, and thus discouraged

growth in Latin America, it must have done even more so in northwest Europe where the

industrial revolution first started! In addition, it appears that pre-conquest Latin America

had one of the lowest, if not the lowest, level of inequality anywhere in the poor




                                             24
periphery. It also appears that Latin American inequality remained one of the lowest

anywhere around the world until the start of the seventeenth century. It can hardly be said

that initial endowments and Iberian colonization made Latin America more unequal than

other places.

        Second, Latin America was poorer than northwest Europe, and poorer societies

have smaller surpluses for the elite to extract. Thus, while inequality was lower, what this

paper and Milanovic et al. (2008) call extraction rates (how much of the available

surplus was actually extracted by the elite) were considerably higher in Latin America

than in northwest Europe. Whether measured inequality or extraction rates are the best

indicators of pro-rent-seeking and anti-growth institutions is an issue that needs to be

resolved since they offer very different inferences regarding Latin American growth

underachievement. Presumably, political inequality had an important influence on the

size of the extraction ratio.

        Third, Latin American inequality over the five centuries from pre-conquest to the

present has exhibited immense variance: indeed, Latin America exhibited more inequality

variance between 1491 and 1929 (Ginis ranging from 22.5 to 60.3) than one can find

across Latin America today (Ginis ranging from 42 for Trinidad and Tobago to 60 for

Bolivia: López and Perry 2008: Figure 1, Panel A), or than one can between Latin

America, Europe, and East Asia today (51, 34, 38, respectively: López and Perry 2008: 2-

3). While the historical literature certainly offers strong opinions about potential

explanations, we need far more evidence to document them firmly. By replacing less

rapacious indigenous elite with more rapacious European elite, the Iberian conquest

appears to have raised, initially, inequality by about half. Yet, the sixteenth century saw




                                             25
very little further rise in inequality, most probably because the demographic disaster

produced a powerful downward offset to all other inequality-increasing forces. It looks

like the two centuries up to about 1790 or so saw the biggest increase in Latin American

inequality, reaching its colonial peak in that year (Gini 57.6: Table 4). What are the

explanations for the colonial inequality boom? Was it simply driven by increases in GDP

per capita and thus in the surplus available for the elite to extract? Or, did the elite learn

more effective ways to extract a bigger share of the same surplus? Or was it both? In any

case, about half of that huge rise up to 1790 was eroded by three decades of war and

independence, followed by five post-independence ‘lost decades’ of economic stagnation.

Thus, by 1870 inequality in Latin America (Gini 46.4: Table 4) was not much different

than it was for all pre-industrial societies for which we can get the data (Gini 44.3: Table

1). To repeat, while inequality was high in Latin America as it was poised for its

industrial revolution, it was no higher than the average pre-industrial society, nor higher

than industrializing Europe.

        Fourth, globalization forces during the belle époque pushed Latin American

inequality up to historic highs by the 1920s. Although that belle époque inequality boom

cannot yet be adequately measured for all of Latin America, it looks like ongoing

research will shortly do so (e.g Bértola et al. 2009). Other primary product exporters

underwent similar inequality-enhancing booms over that half century too (Williamson

2002; 2006), but it appears that Latin America had one of the biggest inequality booms,

and, even more notable, that the high inequality achieved persisted (and even increased)

during the anti-global episode between the 1920s and the 1970s (Prados 2007: Table

12.1). The latter offers a striking contrast with the industrialized world which underwent




                                              26
a great egalitarian leveling across the mid-20th century (Williamson and Lindert 1980:

53-62; Goldin and Margo 1992; Atkinson and Piketty 2008).

       The inequality history that makes Latin America distinctive stretches across the

20th century when Europe and its English-speaking offshoots underwent a secular decline

in inequality correlated with the rise of the welfare state (Lindert 2004; Atkinson and

Piketty 2008). Latin America did not share that 20th century decline. Why has 20th

century Latin American inequality history been so unique, while everything else about

their inequality history from 1491 to the 1920s was so ordinary?

Sources and Notes:
GDP per capita: Maddison (2008), except Peru 1876 from Milanovic, Lindert and
Williamson (2008: Table 1). For Latin America, Mexico and Brazil, 1790 is linearly interpolated
between 1700 and 1820. For Chile1790, the Mexican growth rate 1790-1820 is assumed.
Population: Maddison (2008). Missing years linearly interpolated.
Urbanization: Bairoch (pp. 388-9, 423) and Sánchez-Albornoz (1974: pp. 30-32, 77). Latin
American 1820 interpolated. Mexico 1820 and 1870 derived by assuming percent fall 1790-
1820
and rise 1820-1870 the same as for Latin America.
Land area: Milanovic, Lindert and Williamson (2008: Table 1).
Colony dummy: While Chile gained independence in 1818, the other did so shortly after 1820:
Brazil 1822, Mexico 1821, Peru 1821, and a few even later. Yet, the colony dummy is still set
equal to 0 in 1820 for Latin America and all four regions in the table.
Actual Gini: Tables 1 and 3.
Predicted Gini: Data above inserted in to estimated regression, col. 1, Table 2.
