                                         ABSTRACT

We show that individuals' macroeconomic expectations are influenced by their socioeconomic
status (SES). People with higher income or higher education are more optimistic about future
macroeconomic developments, including business conditions, the national unemployment rate,
and stock market returns. The spread in beliefs between high- and low-SES individuals
diminishes significantly during recessions. A comparison with professional forecasters and
historical data reveals that the beliefs wedge reflects excessive pessimism on the part of low-SES
individuals. SES-driven expectations help explain why higher-SES individuals are more inclined
to invest in the stock market and more likely to consider purchasing homes, durable goods, or
cars.

1        Introduction

Individuals’ choices of consumption, saving, and investment depend on expectations about fu-

ture macroeconomic conditions. As Mankiw, Reis, and Wolfers (2003), Souleles (2004), Puri and

Robinson (2007), Dominitz and Manski (2007) and others have shown, there is substantial disagree-

ment between individuals in their forecasts. Such heterogeneity can have important effects on asset

prices and macroeconomic dynamics (e.g., Sims (2008), Geanakoplos (2009), Piazzesi and Schneider

(2012), Guzman and Stiglitz (2015)). Consumption and investment choices induced by differences

in beliefs further may have welfare consequences (Brunnermeier, Simsek, and Xiong (2014)). Yet

the origins of this disagreement are still not well understood.

        In this paper, we show that heterogeneity in macroeconomic expectations is associated with

individuals’ socioeconomic status (SES), measured by income and education. Our empirical analysis

is motivated by experimental evidence. Kuhnen and Miu (2017) find that experimental subjects

coming from low-SES backgrounds are more pessimistic about the payoff distributions of risky

assets relative to high-SES subjects. Moreover, this gap in expectations between low and high-SES

individuals’ beliefs arises after good news about the payoff distribution is revealed in the experiment,

but not after bad news. We build on this experimental work by analyzing the relationship between

people’s SES and their degree of optimism about the macroeconomy, as well as the dynamics

of beliefs over the business cycle. We use monthly data spanning almost four decades from the

Michigan Survey of Consumers (MSC).

        To guide the empirical analysis, we propose a variant of the local thinking framework of Gen-

naioli and Shleifer (2010) that reproduces the experimental evidence we build on. As in Gennaioli,

Shleifer, and Vishny (2012) we assume that a local thinker neglects states of the world that she does

not view as representative. In line with the experimental evidence, we hypothesize that personal

economic circumstances influence which states—good or bad ones—people view as representative.

This yields a pessimism bias for people with low SES. Moreover, again in line with the experi-

mental evidence, we hypothesize that low-SES individuals are more prone to local thinking than

high-SES individuals.1 We show that this leads to a pro-cyclical wedge in beliefs between high and
    1

low-SES individuals: the relative pessimism of low-SES individuals is most pronounced following

good macroeconomic news.

   We start by examining SES-related unconditional heterogeneity in expectations regarding future

stock market returns, the national unemployment rate, and general business conditions. We find

that within virtually every month during our almost four-decade sample, for each one of those

expectations measures, and for both income rank within year-age groups and education as SES

measures, high-SES respondents in the survey are more optimistic than low-SES respondents. These

differences in beliefs are substantial, even after controlling for other demographic characteristics,

age effects, and time fixed effects. For example, moving from the bottom to the top income quintile

implies a change in macroeconomic optimism that is about the same magnitude as a third of

a typical peak-to-trough movement over the business cycle in the monthly average beliefs in the

Michigan Survey. Having a college degree corresponds to a belief difference of about 6% of a typical

peak-to-trough movement.

   We then turn to the business-cycle dynamics of the beliefs wedge between high and low-SES

people. We show that the wedge is pro-cyclical. During recessions the macroeconomic expectations

of high and low-SES individuals are quite similar, but the wedge widens substantially in times of

good macroeconomic performance. Thus, there is a remarkable consistency in the behavior of the

beliefs wedge in our long sample of survey data and in the experimental evidence that motivates

our analysis.

   Furthermore, the variant of the local thinking model we have set up was based on the as-

sumption that low-SES individuals are more prone to local thinking shaped by personal economic

circumstances than high-SES individuals. This implies that high-SES individuals should make fore-

casts that are, on average, closer to an objective forecast than low-SES individuals. We test this

implication by comparing the macroeconomic expectations from the MSC with matched forecasts

from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and, for beliefs about future stock returns in the

MSC, with long-run historical realizations of stock market index returns. Based on these proxies

for objective forecasts, we find that forecasts of high-SES individuals are, indeed, less biased based

than those of low-SES individuals.


                                                  2
   Having established the basic facts about the unconditional and the dynamic properties of SES-

related heterogeneity in macroeconomic expectations, we examine in more detail the mechanism

that leads to the correlation between SES and macroeconomic beliefs. A potential alternative

theory to our baseline hypothesis of a causal effect of SES on macroeconomic expectations is that

that there is an underlying fixed personal characteristic—e.g., vulnerability to depression—that

causes both general pessimism as well as poor economic choices that lead to low SES (see, e.g.,

Puri and Robinson (2007)). Relatedly, one could worry about reverse causality where pessimism

causes economic choices that subsequently lead to low SES. However, using the panel sub-sample

of the MSC in which respondents are re-interviewed once after six months we can difference out

unobserved fixed personal characteristics. Doing so, we still find a strong positive relationship

between changes in income and changes in macroeconomic optimism. These differenced results

also make clear that a reverse causality story is unlikely to explain our results because a potentially

plausible effect of beliefs changes on SES changes would take much longer than a few months

to materialize. Furthermore, using the full MSC sample, we find that respondents who report a

recent positive change in their personal financial situation or receipt of good economic news, as

well as those who reside in geographic areas with positive recent changes in economic conditions

have more optimistic macroeconomic beliefs. These proxies for experienced changes absorb part

of the explanatory power of the SES level variables. Taken together, all of these results indicate

that macroeconomic beliefs are responsive to recent changes in individuals’ perceived economic

circumstances, which does not fit well with fixed effects or reverse causality stories.

   As a final step in our analysis, we show that differences in beliefs associated with individu-

als’ socioeconomic standing help explain their economic behavior. Since the MSC offers data on

beliefs about macroeconomic conditions, as well as information about respondents’ actual or in-

tended choices, such as stock market investment decisions and attitudes towards purchasing homes,

durables or cars, we can quantify the effect of SES through the beliefs channel on these choices. We

find that, while SES measures like income or education on their own directly predict the interest

in investing in stocks, or buying homes, durables, or cars, there exist indirect effects of income and

education through the belief channel that account for a significant fraction of the total effect of the


                                                  3
SES variables on these decisions—for example, close to 25% in the case of home buying attitudes.

We also specifically analyze stock market investment decisions and beliefs regarding stock returns

in particular, and show that SES-induced beliefs account for a significant fraction, up to 47%, of

the total effect of the SES variables, namely, income and education, on the decision to invest, and

on the share of income invested in equities.

   Therefore, the results in this paper can help shed light on the empirical pattern documented by

Vissing-Jorgensen (2003), Campbell (2006) and Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (2007) that house-

holds with lower education, income or wealth are substantially less likely to participate in the stock

market. The causes of non-participation are still unclear. Standard explanations involve partic-

ipation costs (Vissing-Jorgensen (2002)), but they still appear to leave a substantial part of the

non-participation unexplained (Andersen and Nielsen (2011)). Our findings indicate that beliefs

could be part of the explanation for why some individuals do not participate: whatever the actual

cost or perceived cost of participation, pessimistic expectations lead to lower perceived benefits

from participation and hence to low rates of participation of low-SES individuals.

   Stock market non-participation can imply welfare losses for households, as discussed in Calvet,

Campbell, and Sodini (2007). Thus, low macroeconomic expectations can have welfare consequence

for low-SES individuals. Moreover, non-participation of low-SES households could result in het-

erogeneity in wealth returns that is correlated with the level of wealth, which in turn plays a role

in generating wealth inequality (Favilukis (2013), Gabaix, Lasry, Lions, and Moll (2016)). By lim-

iting their investment opportunity set, the pessimistic low-SES households may perpetuate their

disadvantaged financial position.

   Pessimistic expectations about future business conditions or unemployment could further induce

individuals from low-SES backgrounds to have low levels of investments along other dimensions also,

such as pursuing higher education, better health, or starting a new business. While there is no

direct evidence for this implication of our work, existing relevant findings seem to support it. For

example, Kearney and Levine (2016) document that children from lower SES families are more

likely to drop out of high school, relative to their better-off peers, and attribute this to more

pessimistic subjective estimates of the likelihood of economic success among lower SES individuals.


                                                  4
In this sense, our results also connect to the theory of Piketty (1995) in which individuals draw

on the personal economic experience of their family dynasties to form beliefs about the returns to

effort in the economy.

   Our work on macroeconomic expectations builds on earlier work that is focused on stock return

beliefs. Kezdi and Willis (2011) document links between income and education and stock market

return beliefs using a sample of 55- to 64-year olds from the Health and Retirement Study. Their

estimation is based on a single survey wave from 2002. Kuhnen and Miu (2017) complement their

experimental work with evidence on SES-related stock return beliefs heterogeneity based on a sin-

gle Qualtrics survey cross-section. Our finding in this paper that SES-related beliefs heterogeneity

is subject to strong business cycle dynamics—with the beliefs wedge between high and low-SES

individuals almost disappearing during recessions—highlights that it is important to study sam-

ples with a much longer time dimension. Moreover, we show that SES variables are related to

macroeconomic expectations more generally, not just stock return expectations.

   Our work is further related to an emerging literature showing that individuals’ macroeconomic

expectations are influenced by personal circumstances that are specific to an individual or a group of

people. While our focus is on an individual’s current economic situation, which is strongly influenced

by a person’s history of idiosyncratic shocks and initial conditions, earlier work has found links

between the macroeconomic history that individuals of a given cohort have experienced, and their

expectations and investment decisions. Individuals in cohorts that experienced bad macroeconomic

conditions subsequently avoid risky financial choices, either as investors (Malmendier and Nagel

(2011)) or as managers (Malmendier and Tate (2005), Malmendier, Tate, and Yan (2011)). Evidence

in support of this belief channel is provided by Malmendier and Nagel (2015), who find that

differences in inflation experiences across cohorts strongly predict differences in the expectations

of these cohorts regarding future inflation levels. Experimental evidence in Kuhnen (2015) shows

that individuals faced with sequences of negative payoffs form overly pessimistic beliefs about the

quality of the available investments. Kuchler and Zafar (2016) show that individuals’ expectations

about national U.S. house prices depend on their personally experienced house price history in

their local geographic area, and expectations about the national unemployment rate are influenced


                                                  5
by personal experiences of unemployment.2 A common thread in these studies is that expectations

about a macroeconomic variable (e.g., house prices) are related to personal experiences of the

realized cohort-specific or geographically local history of the same variable. In contrast, the effect

that we study is one where a person’s own economic situation is correlated with a broad range of

macroeconomic expectations.



2        Socioeconomic Status and Macroeconomic Beliefs

Our empirical work is motivated by the experimental evidence in Kuhnen and Miu (2017). To set

the stage for the empirical analysis, we illustrate the key ideas with a simple model based on the

“local thinking” framework of Gennaioli and Shleifer (2010) and Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny

(2012). The model allows us to draw connections between heterogeneity in macroeconomic beliefs,

the experimental evidence, and the notion that personal experiences influence the formation of

expectations, as in Malmendier and Nagel (2011) and other recent work.

        Let the trinomial random variable ωt ∈ {−1, 0, 1} represent the current latent state of the

macroeconomy. For simplicity, we assume that ωt is IID. Every period t, individuals observe a

signal st ∈ {0, 1} about the current latent state. This signal is IID over time conditional on ωt and

the distribution of st conditional on ωt is shown in the following table:

                                                     st = 0    st = 1

                                        ωt = 1        1-π        π

                                        ωt = 0        1/2       1/2

                                        ωt = −1        π        1-π

We assume 1/2 ≤ π ≤ 1. With π = 1/2, the signal is completely uninformative, with π = 1 it

reaches its maximum informativeness (but is not perfectly informative about the state). From this

table, it is straightforward to derive the probabilities of the state conditional on the signal.

    Amonlirdviman (2007) documents that people with low income or education are more pessimistic about their
own personal situation, and presents a model where these individuals suffer from low self-control, and the optimal
response to self-control problems is to become defensively pessimistic about one’s future prospects.

   A rational individual would then estimate the state as

                                                      4   2
                                       E[ωt |st = 1] = π − ,

                                                       2 4
                                       E[ωt |st = 0] = − π                                        (1)
                                                       3 3

   Now consider a local thinker. In Gennaioli and Shleifer (2010), an agent combines data received

from the external world with information retrieved from memory to evaluate a hypothesis, with

limited and selected recall of information. People can only envision a limited number of scenarios,

and those that do come to mind are more representative, or stereotypical, for these individuals.

As in Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny (2012), we assume that a local thinker neglects some states

of the world when forming expectations about the macroeconomy; only states that she regards as

representative come to mind. Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny (2015) suggest that the states that

come to mind are those that are similar to recently observed data. Here we explore a variation of this

idea. We analyze a local thinker whose views about the possible states of the economy are influenced

by her own personal economic circumstances and experiences. The notion that individuals rely

on personal experiences when forming macroeconomic expectations is related to the findings in

Malmendier and Nagel (2011), but they analyze how personal macroeconomic experiences influence

macroeconomic expectations. In contrast, here we study the influence of individuals’ microeconomic

situation on their macroeconomic expectations.

   Consider an individual with currently low socioeconomic status. On average, such an individual

has accumulated relatively unfavorable experiences in the past. Moreover, the individual is currently

in a relatively disadvantageous economic situation. We assume that these bad experiences lead the

individual to ignore the possibility that the good state, ωt = 1, could arise. As a consequence, the

local thinker perceives the following signal distribution:

                                               st = 0   st = 1

                                    ωt = 0       1/2         1/2

                                    ωt = −1       π          1-π

The complete neglect of the good state is an extreme assumption that yields particularly stark


                                                  7
and simple results, but this is not crucial. A skewed tilt towards worse states would result in

qualitatively similar results.

   Given the neglect of the good state, the local thinker estimates the underlying state of the

economy as follows:

                                                            1−π
                                      E P [ωt |st = 1] = −         ,
                                                           3/2 − π
                                                               π
                                       E P [ωt |st = 0] = −                                       (2)
                                                            1/2 + π

Comparing (2) with (1) one can show that

   • the local thinker is always more pessimistic.

   • the wedge in beliefs between a rational individual and the low-SES local thinker is biggest

      following good signals, i.e.,


                       E P [ωt |st = 1] − E[ωt |st = 1] < E P [ωt |st = 0] − E[ωt |st = 0].       (3)



The intuition for the second result is that the size of the wedge depends on the importance (in

terms of probability) of the neglected state. Following a bad signal, the neglected good state is less

likely and hence the error from neglecting it is smaller. In the extreme case, with π = 1, the error

would be zero and the local thinker would agree with a rational individual following a bad signal.

Following a good signal, however, the good state is important and neglect of this state induces a

big error.

   In line with these predictions, we conduct our empirical analysis of macroeconomic expectations

in two steps:


   1. We examine whether socioeconomic status is unconditionally related to individuals’ relative

      optimism in macroeconomic expectations. In doing so, we look for the empirical counterpart—

      in terms of macroeconomic expectations—to the experimental evidence in Kuhnen and Miu

      (2017) that low-SES people are more pessimistic.


                                                     8
  2. We explore whether low-SES individuals are more prone to local thinking of the type we

     sketched above. If low-SES individuals are more prone to local thinking than high-SES

     individuals, we should find, according to (3), a pro-cyclical beliefs wedge between high- and

     low-SES individuals’ expectations. A time-varying wedge of this kind would be consistent

     with experimental evidence in Kuhnen and Miu (2017) that low-SES people update their

     beliefs asymmetrically in response to news. Faced with good news, they update their beliefs

     less than high-SES people do. In contrast, faced with bad news, high and low-SES people

     updated in a similar way. Moreover, we should then also find that the expectations of high-

     SES individuals are, on average, less biased than those of low-SES individuals. We examine

     both of these predictions.


   An alternative model based on ambiguity aversion could potentially produce observationally

equivalent predictions for individuals’ economic choices. Ambiguity aversion induces an individual

to make choices as if she were pessimistic (Hansen and Sargent (2001)) and ambiguity about signal

precision can induce an asymmetric reaction to news (Epstein and Schneider (2008)). To the extent

that low-SES individuals are more ambiguity averse—perhaps, along the lines of Heath and Tversky

(1991), because they feel less competent than high-SES individuals in judging the macroeconomic

outlook—this could explain why low-SES individuals make choices as if they were pessimistic.

However, unlike the local thinking model above, the ambiguity aversion model does not make clear

predictions for the beliefs that individuals report in a survey. In ambiguity aversion models, the

decision-maker entertains a range of beliefs and makes decisions to maximize utility under the

worst-case scenario from this range of beliefs. But this does not imply that the individual would

report the beliefs associated with the worst-case scenario when asked about her expectations in

a survey. Bhandari, Borovička, and Ho (2016), for example, assume so, but this is an additional

assumption that does not follow from ambiguity aversion theory.

3     Data

Our data span the period 1978-2014, at a monthly frequency. Each month, approximately 400

individuals are recruited for the Michigan Survey of Consumers, and are asked to express their

beliefs about future values of several macroeconomic variables. The survey is based on a nationally

representative group of respondents, sampled using landline and cellular phone numbers (Curtin

and Dechaux (2015)). In our analysis, we weight observations with the household sample weights

provided by the MSC. These sample weights adjust, among other things, for differential non-

response by demographic characteristics.3

     Curtin, Presser, and Singer (2002) investigate the role of survey non-response on expectations collected by the
MSC, and find that demographic characteristics, including income and education, do not have sizeable effects on
the probability of agreeing to be part of the survey. Moreover, the authors find no evidence that the likelihood of
participating in the survey is a function of the respondents’ macroeconomic optimism.

   In total, there are 189,590 person-month observations in our sample. The macro belief variables

we study are P ST K, BU S12, BU S5, BEXP and U N EM P . Table 1 presents the survey ques-

tions used to measure the belief variables, and the respondents’ possible answers. P ST K is the

respondent’s subjective probability that the US stock market will have a positive return over the

next 12 months. BUS12, BU S5 and BEXP measure expectations about the evolution of the overall

business environment over the following 12 months or 5 years, and UNEMP measures expectations

about the evolution of the national unemployment rate over the following 12 months. We rescale the

belief variables except P ST K to vary between -1 to 1, and we set the sign such that higher values

imply optimism. To calculate an aggregate measure of macroeconomic optimism, we standard-

ize each of these individual beliefs, and average the standardized values. Because P ST K is only

available starting in June 2002, OP T IN DX is the average of four standardized beliefs (BU S12,

BU S5, BEXP and U N EM P ) prior to that time, and it is the average of five standardized beliefs

(BU S12, BU S5, BEXP , U N EM P , and P ST K) after that month.

   One could be concerned with the inclusion of PSTK in our OPTINDX measure because the

PSTK-related question is worded in a way that may be difficult for an average respondent to un-

derstand. Relatedly, stock market beliefs may be inherently different from other macroeconomic

beliefs because investing in equities could be an unfamiliar or irrelevant topic for some households.

Moreover, a data-driven weighting of the 5 belief measures in OPTINDX may be preferable instead

of simply equally weighting them. In unreported results we experiment with alternative specifi-

cations of OPTINDX. In one case we exclude PSTK from our index; in another, we use the first

principal component weights to construct our OPTINDX. We find that these alternative construc-

tions of the OPTINDX measure yield qualitatively similar results, both in terms of point estimates

and significance in our main regressions.

   We choose income and education as indicators of the socioeconomic status of households. We

restrict our analysis to individuals 24- to 75-years old, because income or college degree completion

may not be meaningful SES measures for very old or very young adults. Next we create percentiles

of real income (in 2014 dollars) within each year and age group (25-29, 30-34, .. 70-74), which we

then divide by 100 and label Income rank. Therefore, a change of one percentile implies an income

rank change of 0.01. We use this as one the socioeconomic status variables because relative income

compared to peers may matter more than dollar income, but we obtain broadly similar effects if we

use dollar income rather than income rank. College Degree is a binary variable which takes value

1 if the respondent has at least a college degree.

      To measure recent changes in an individual’s personal economic situation, we use the variable 1-

yr Change in Personal Situation, provided in the Michigan survey for each respondent, which takes

values -1, 0 or 1 if the individual reports being worse off, the same, or better-off than a year ago,

in terms of their personal finances. For a more objective measure of changes in the individual’s

economic environment, we use data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on the unemployment

level and data on per-capita income from Bureau of Economic Analysis of the county where the

respondent resides.4

      Because the county of residence is not publicly available in the Michigan survey, we had the county-level infor-


                                                          13
    Table 2 presents summary statistics for the variables that capture the personal economic situa-

tion, beliefs, and household economic choices of the individuals in the sample. In our data, 34.1%

of people have completed at least a college degree. The median real household income (in 2014

dollars) of the participants in the survey is $57,591, but there are clear outliers in the income distri-

bution, as can be seen in Table 2. The average value for the overall amount a person has invested

in equities as of the time of the survey is about 85% of the annual income of that individual.

    Given the construction of the aggregate belief measure OP T IN DX as a mean of standardized

variables, in our sample spanning 1978-2014 the average OP T IN DX is close to zero. The average

estimates for BU S12 and BU S5, which are beliefs regarding whether there will be good or bad

economic times over the next 12 months or 5 year, are -0.014 and -0.084, respectively. Given that

the scale for these two variables spans -1 to 1, these averages indicate that expectations about

future economic times have not been overly pessimistic or overly optimistic during the 37 years

studied here. The same holds true for BEXP , the belief regarding general business conditions over

the next year, whose average in the sample is 0.075. The belief regarding whether unemployment

will be lower or higher over the next year, U N EM P , has the most negative sample average, -0.195,

indicating that survey participants were the most pessimistic about this particular aspect of future

economic conditions. During 2002-2014, the time frame for which this measure is available, the

average estimate of P ST K, the probability that the U.S. stock market would have a positive return

in the next 12 months, is 48.3%, with a standard deviation of 29.3%.

    We also use several variables that capture the individuals’ decisions regarding stock market

investments, namely whether they invest in equity (Invest), as well as the share of income invested

in the stock market (Invest Share), and their attitudes at the time of the survey towards buying a

home (HOM ), buying durables (DU R) or cars (CAR). About 62% of individuals in our sample

participate in the stock market, and on average responses regarding whether it is a good time to

purchase a home, durables or cars are positive. For example, the variable HOM , which can take
mation merged in by the staff who oversee this survey, but the resulting dataset that we can use does not have the
actual county identifiers. The county level data could only be merged in for MSC observations during 2000-2014.
The merging is done such that the county unemployment level is as of the month preceeding the survey and the
county per-capita income is as of the year preceeding the survey. This is done to reflect the most current information
available to the respondents.

values of -1, 0 or 1, indicating either negative, neutral or positive attitudes towards buying a home,

has an average of 0.384, and thus is more tilted towards the positive end of the response scale.



4     Expectations Heterogeneity by Socioeconomic Status

4.1      Beliefs and SES

We start by examining differences in macroeconomic expectations by SES, measured along the

dimensions of income and education. Figure 1 plots the monthly average values of our optimism

index, OPTINDX, for individuals in the highest and lowest income quintiles (in their respective

age groups) from 1978 to 2014. The figure shows that there is a remarkably persistent wedge in

beliefs between high- and low-SES individuals: In almost every month during the sample period,

individuals with higher income or higher education had more optimistic macroeconomic expecta-

tions.

    Moreover, the disagreement between households of different SES is pro-cyclical. During reces-

sions, it shrinks to close to zero. This pro-cyclicality of the wedge is consistent with the prediction

we discussed in Section 2 for the case in which low-SES individuals are more prone of local thinking

based on extrapolation from personal economic circumstances than high-SES individuals.

    Among the different macroeconomic expectations variables, we are particularly interested in

beliefs about future stock market returns, as we have the most direct measures of closely related

economic decisions—stock market investments—for this type of belief. Figure 2 plots the monthly

averages of PSTK, individuals’ stated probability that the US stock market will have a positive

return over the following 12 months, for high- and low-SES groups. As the figure shows, the time

series of the PSTK beliefs wedge looks very similar to the wedge in OPTINDX that we examined

earlier: High-SES individuals are more optimistic than low-SES individuals in virtually every month

throughout the whole sample in which PSTK is available and the wedge is pro-cyclical.

    In the Appendix, we document that there exists an SES-induced wedge in beliefs for each

component of the optimism index OPTINDX (in addition to P ST K), namely, BU S5, BU S12,

BEXP and U N EM P , and that recessions lead to a lower SES-related gap for each of these types

of macroeconomic expectations.

   Table 3 presents these results more formally in terms of a regression. Dependent variables

in the models in the table are measures of macroeconomic expectations: the aggregate optimism

measure OP T IN DX in the first column, and its separate components in the following five columns.

Independent variables include the person’s income rank as a percentile (defined with respect to

the person’s year-age group), an indicator for whether the person has a college degree or higher

education, and interactions of an NBER recession indicator with the two SES measures. All the

regressions in the paper also include fixed effects for the year-month of the survey, as well as

indicators for the respondents’ age, gender, and marital status. The standard errors are clustered

by time, specifically by year-month.

   In line with the patterns seen in the figures, Table 3 shows that people’s SES characteristics are

highly significant predictors of their beliefs regarding future macroeconomic conditions (P ST K,



                                                    18
BU S12, BU S5, BEXP , U N EM P ), as well as of their aggregate optimism index OP T IN DX.

For each of our five measures of beliefs, we find that having a higher income rank among people in

the same age category and in the same year, and having a college degree are significant predictors

of the level of optimism in the respondents’ expectations. When the dependent variable captures

expectations about future stock market returns (P ST K), we find that during non-recession months,

for an increase from the bottom to the top most rank of respondents’ income, the probability they

estimate for the U.S. stock market to have a positive return over the next year increases by 16.4%.

People with at least a college degree, on average believe that the probability of positive stock market

return is 7.2% higher than people without a college education.

   Similarly, we find that during non-recession months, those with higher SES have significantly

more optimistic expectations for BU S12, BU S5, BEXP , U N EM P and have higher values for

the overall belief measure OP T IN DX. For example, an increase of a person’s income rank from

bottom to top most rank leads to an average increase of 0.304 in OPTINDX. In other words, a

change of 20 percentile (or, 1 quintile) in income rank leads to and increase of 0.304x0.2= 0.06 in

OPTINDX. Having a college degree has a similar effect, as it leads to an increase in OPTINDX of

0.058. All of these effects are statistically significant at p < 0.05 or better.

   Judging economic significance is not quite straightforward as the survey-based beliefs measures

we use as dependent variables have quite substantial measurement noise, including occasionally

non-sensical outliers. One way to gauge the economic significance is to compare the cross-sectional

variation related to the SES variables with typical business cycle time-variation in the macroeco-

nomic belief variables. Based on Figure 1 we can see that OPTINDX averaged across high and low

income moves, at the most extreme, by about one unit from peak-to-trough during the business

cycle. In comparison, focusing on non-recession months (i.e., ignoring the interaction term for

now) the regression results in Table 3 imply that moving from the bottom percentile of the in-

come distribution to the top percentile changes OPTINDX by a third, i.e., by about a third of the

peak-to-trough movement in OPTINDX. Having a college degree implies a change of about 6% of

peak-to-trough OPTINDX. For PSTK, the typical peak-to-through movement in Figure 2 is about

0.30, and so a change from the lowest to the highest income percentile implies a change in PSTK


                                                   19
of a little more than half this amount. A change in the college education status implies a change

in PSTK of about a quarter of the peak-to-trough movement. This comparison to business-cycle

variation shows that the SES-related heterogeneity in expectations is substantial and economically

significant.

   The regression results in Table 3 further show that the size of the beliefs wedge between high- and

low-SES individuals is state-dependent. Consistent with Figures 1 and 2, the coefficient estimates

on the interaction terms of the NBER recession indicator and either SES measure show that the

SES-related wedge in expectations is significantly smaller during recessions. In the case of education,

the effect of a college degree on OPTINDX is two thirds smaller during recessions (instead of 0.058,

it is 0.058-0.039, or 0.019). The effect of income percentile rank is a quarter smaller (instead of

0.304 it is 0.304-0.076, or 0.228) during recessions, although Figure 1 shows that the wedge even

completely disappeared between the lowest and highest income quintiles for a few months during

the last three recessions.

   Our analysis so far has documented two broad empirical patterns: first, lower SES people hold

more pessimistic macroeconomic beliefs, and second, during recessions the difference in macroeco-

nomic beliefs between those with high and low SES diminishes considerably. These findings are

consistent with the simple model we sketched in Section 2 in which individuals are prone local

thinking shaped by their own personal circumstances and experiences and in which this tendency

for local thinking is particularly strong for low-SES individuals.


4.2    Heterogeneity in forecast bias

An additional implication of the specific local thinking framework we set up on in Section 2 is that

high-SES individuals’ forecasts should, on average, be closer to the “truth.” We now examine this

prediction. This is not quite a straightforward exercise, though.

   First, it is not clear what the “truth”—i.e., the rational forecast—is. With learning about

parameters and model uncertainty, we, as econometricians, do not have knowledge of the true

model of macroeconomic dynamics. We deal with this issue by taking the median from the Survey

of Professional Forecasters (SPF) as our benchmark forecasts. These are arguably among the most


                                                  20
sophisticated macroeconomic forecasts available.5 The SPF does not have one-year stock market

return forecasts, so we need a different benchmark for PSTK. We assume that stock returns are

close to unpredictable, and so we use an estimate of the unconditional probability of a positive

12-month stock market returns as benchmark. We estimate it based on the fraction of positive

12-month returns (using overlapping monthly windows) of the CRSP value-weighted index since

1926.

       Second, for some of the expectations variables in the Michigan Survey, there is no directly

corresponding forecast in the SPF. We deal with this issue as follows:

       • UNEMP can be matched with the unemployment forecast in the SPF. Since the Michigan

         Survey asks about the change in unemployment over the next 12 months, we compare it with

         the difference between the three-quarter ahead forecast, t + 3 of the level of unemployment,

         and the end of prior quarter t − 1 “nowcast”6 .

       • For the three business conditions variables in the Michigan Survey, BEXP is the one that is

         closest to a change in real GDP so we match BEXP with RGDP forecasts in the SPF. BEXP

         is based on the question “And how about a year from now, do you expect that in the country

         as a whole business conditions will be better, or worse than they are at present, or just about

         the same?” (see Table 1). It seems reasonable to think of good business conditions as a

         high RGDP growth rate and bad business conditions as a low RGDP growth rate, similar

         to typical classifications into recessions and non-recession periods. Therefore, we calculate a

         change in the forecasted growth rate of RGDP. Since the SPF contains RGDP level forecasts,

         we calculate the average forecasted change in log GDP over the four quarters from the end

         of the current quarter t to quarter t + 4 and we subtract the change from the end of the prior

         quarter, t − 1 to t.
   5
     Carroll (2003) compares the time series of mean inflation forecasts from the SPF and the Michigan Survey with
subsequently realized inflation and finds that the SPF forecast has a much smaller mean-squared error than the
Michigan forecast. Croushore (1998) cannot reject unbiasedness of the mean SPF forecast and Mankiw, Reis, and
Wolfers (2003) cannot reject unbiasedness of the median forecast.
   6
     Using the prior quarter rate from the SPF rather than from published unemployment series avoids the problem
that current versions of the unemployment series have been revised ex-post and do not represent information that
was available in real time.




                                                       21
      • PSTK is matched to a benchmark computed from realized stock returns as explained above.

      The third issue is that the UNEMP and BEXP in the Michigan Survey of Consumers are

categorical and hence do not directly map into the continuous SPF unemployment and RGDP

forecasts. To make them comparable, we discretize the SPF forecast based on the assumption that

any forecasted change in the unemployment rate or the RGDP growth rate within one standard

deviation (calculated over the full sample since 1978) above or below zero corresponds to the “Same”

category for BEXP and UNEMP, while a change above or below corresponds to better or worse

conditions for BEXP and more or less unemployment for UNEMP.

      Finally, the SPF is conducted only quarterly, while the Michigan Survey is monthly. The SPF is

carried out in the middle month each quarter. We match the first two Michigan Survey months each

quarter with the SPF from the prior quarter and the Michigan Survey wave from the third month

each quarter to the SPF from the same quarter. Thus, the Michigan Survey is lagged somewhat

relative to the SPF. This seems reasonable, as professionals are presumably faster in noticing and

reacting to very recent information.7

      Based on these definitions, we now calculate each month a forecast bias by subtracting from

PSTK, BEXP, and UNEMP, the corresponding value of the professional forecast. We then average

these forecast biases for each (within age group-year) income percentile over the whole sample

period. The results are presented in Figure 3. The plots also include a local linear regression fitted

based on those income percentile averages.

      The top panel shows that forecasts of individuals in all income ranks are, on average, too

pessimistic relative to historical stock market performance. But beliefs of high-income individuals

are closest to the historical frequencies. The middle panel presents the average forecast bias for

RGDP. In this case, high-income individuals have forecasts that are on average unbiased while low-

income individuals are too pessimistic. The bottom panel shows that high-income individuals are

close to getting the unemployment forecast right on average, while low-income individuals forecast

an unemployment rate that is too high, i.e., they are again too pessimistic.

      In summary, the forecast bias results are consistent with the local thinking framework we set
  7
      For evidence on this, see Carroll (2003).

up on in Section 2. Specifically, the fact that higher-income individuals’ forecasts are closer to the

“truth” is consistent with the notion that they are less prone to local thinking and extrapolation

from their own personal circumstances and experiences than low-income individuals.


4.3    Inspecting the mechanism

So far we have looked for a relationship between the level of SES and macroeconomic expectations.

Our local thinking hypothesis implies a causal effect of SES on beliefs. However, the correlation

between SES and expectations in levels could potentially be explained by alternative theories as

well. One potential alternative theory is that there is an underlying fixed personal characteristic—

e.g., vulnerability to depression—that causes both general pessimism as well as poor economic

choices that lead to low SES. Puri and Robinson (2007), for example, study the economic effects

of dispositional optimism. This type of theory would imply an unobserved person fixed effect.

   To address this issue, we use the panel sub-sample of the MSC. While most of the MSC sample

consists of newly sampled respondents each month, a random sub-sample of them are re-interviewed

once six months after the initial interview. We can use this panel structure to difference out

unobserved fixed effects by looking at the relationship between changes in beliefs and changes in

SES.

   Specifically, we use this panel dimension to re-run a version of the baseline regressions in Table

                                                     24
3 with the dependent variable (expectations) and explanatory variable (income rank) differenced

over the six-month window between the initial interview and the re-interview. As Table 4 shows,

with the change in OPTINDX as the dependent variable, we still obtain a positive coefficient that is

statistically significant. In terms of magnitude, it is about one-fourth of the coefficient in the levels

regression in Table 3, indicating that the change in personal income rank over a short period of six

months accounts for a substantial portion of the levels effect that we identified in Table 3. Given

that measurement noise in SES is magnified when regressions are run with short-run differences,

this is a large effect. Thus, the fixed effects alternative mechanism is at best a partial explanation of

the SES-expectations relationship. The regressions with the individual components of OPTINDX

in the other columns on Table 4 all have positive coefficients on the income rank change and the

difference from zero is statistically significant only for three out of the five variables.

   These differenced results also address a potential reverse causality story for our findings. Pes-

simistic beliefs could perhaps directly cause poor economic choices (e.g., portfolio and human

capital investment decisions) that affect the SES measures that we use as explanatory variables in

our baseline regressions. However, given the differenced panel regression results, this type of story

seems a highly implausible explanation. To the extent that beliefs do affect choices, the effects of

these choices on SES would presumably take much longer than six months to materialize in any

significant way. Therefore, this story is an unlikely explanation for the contemporaneous correlation

of belief changes and SES changes that we find in Table 4.

   We can use the full sample of the MSC, without relying the panel structure, to provide further

evidence that recent changes in economic circumstances affect individuals’ expectations. Instead of

direct measures of changes in income, we have to rely, however, on respondents’ statements about

past changes that they recall to have experienced. The survey variable we use for this purpose is

the 1-yr Change in Personal Situation, which can take the values -1, 0 or 1 to indicate whether

people feel their finances have gotten worse, stayed the same, or improved in the past year.

   The regressions reported in Table 5 in the second column add this variable to our baseline

regression. Doing so raises the R2 substantially and it lowers the coefficients on income rank by

about a third. Thus, the change in economic situation captured by the added variable absorbs part

of the SES level effect. While the interpretation is not as clean as in the differenced regression

in Table 4, it would be difficult to explain this strong relationship between OPTINDX and recent

changes in the survey respondents’ personal financial situation under a personal fixed effects or

reverse causality stories.

   Finally, our baseline regressions are potentially subject to the concern that individual-specific

variation in mood could lead to spurious correlation between self-reported SES measures and re-

ported macroeconomic beliefs. For example, someone who is depressed at the time of the interview

might report a pessimistic expectation and, at the same time, provide the interviewer with an


                                                  26
underestimate of her income. As a consequence, there could be a spurious positive correlation

between income rank and macroeconomic expectation. Our results already indicate to some extent

that this story is unlikely to be important since education, in addition to income rank, also plays

an important role in shaping expectations. While underestimation of income rank by an individual

in a depressed state may be plausible, underreporting of the own education level does not seem

plausible. Nonetheless, a concern about spurious correlation of beliefs and income could remain.

    To address this concern, we add local economic condition variables to the regression that are

based on official economic statistics rather than on self-reports by survey respondents. Specifically,

we use county-level data on the unemployment rate (monthly, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics)

and the level of personal income (annually, in December 2014 dollars, from the Bureau of Economic

Analysis) for the 2000-2014 period.8 As Table 5 shows, these local economic condition variables

help explain cross-sectional variation in macroeconomic beliefs. Both are statistically significant,

and in terms of magnitudes a decrease of 0.5% in the local unemployment rate or an increase of

$1,000 in local income have the same effect as a one percentile increase in the personal income rank

of an individual. An alternative approach (untabulated) is to use the local economic conditions

variables as instruments for income rank. Instrumented in this way, income rank still enters the

regression significantly.

    Overall, the results in this section are supportive of a causal effect of SES on beliefs. Unobserved

personal fixed effects, reverse causality, and spurious correlation through correlated measurement

error can at most play a partial role, but they cannot be the main reasons for the strong empirical

relationship between SES and macroeconomic expectations.



5    Importance of SES-driven expectations for household choices

The results so far indicate that a person’s socioeconomic situation shapes their beliefs about future

macro-level economic conditions, such that higher SES individuals hold more optimistic beliefs

about future stock returns, unemployment and business conditions. In the next step of the analysis,

our goal is to quantify the impact of SES, specifically through its influence on beliefs, on households’

economic choices.

   It is natural to expect that aspects of a person’s SES will have a direct effect on that person’s

economic choices. For example, higher income individuals or those who are better educated are

likely to be in a better position to invest in stocks relative to lower income individuals, perhaps

because of access to retirement accounts at work, lower participation costs relative to wealth, or

simply because they have money left to save after paying their bills each months. Similarly, higher

SES individuals are less likely to face financial constraints and thus are more likely to consider

purchasing homes, cars or durable goods.

   Therefore, the total effect of SES on household choices comes from two sources: (1) the direct

effect of SES on these choices—for example, because higher income leads to easier access to retire-

ment accounts, and (2) the indirect effect of SES on these choices through the belief channel—for

example, because higher SES individuals hold more optimistic beliefs about the distribution of

stock returns, or other macroeconomic developments.

   We can measure the relative importance of the direct and indirect effects of SES on people’s

economic choices using the analysis in Table 6. The dependent variables in columns two to six

capture the respondent’s investments in stocks (Invest and InvestShare) and their assessment

that it is a good time to purchase homes, durables or cars (HOM , DU R, CAR). The explanatory

variables include our two SES dimensions (income rank and education), as well as the person’s

aggregate belief about future macroeconomic conditions (OP T IN DX). If beliefs were measured

without error, we could use OLS estimates of the coefficients on OP T IN DX in these regressions

combined with the results from the regression of OP T IN DX on the SES variables in the first

column to calculate how much of the effect of SES on choices is direct (SES ⇒ Choice) and how

much of it is indirect (SES ⇒ Macroeconomic expectations ⇒ Choice).

   There is, however, substantial measurement error in OP T IN DX. People’s willingness and

ability to carefully and precisely state their expectations in a survey is arguably limited and their

responses could be influenced by random mood fluctuations that are not substantial and persistent

enough to have consequences for economic choices. This measurement problem is likely much more

severe for a relatively elusive concept like expectations of “general business conditions” than for a

relatively clearly defined concept like family income or education level. In this sense, including a

substantially mis-measured OP T IN DX along with more precisely measured SES variables in the

regression could lead to a severe underestimation of the role of OP T IN DX. Alternatively, rather

than attenuation of the OP T IN DX coefficient, this type of measurement error could also induce

spurious correlation between the choice measures and OP T IN DX if the mood fluctuations of the

survey respondents affect the responses to the choice questions as well.

   To address these issues, we return to the panel sub-sample of the MSC and we use each respon-

dent’s lagged OP T IN DX from the prior interview six months earlier as a instrument for current

OPTINDX. This approach eliminates the effects of high-frequency mood fluctuations (e.g., due

to a bad night’s sleep) on survey responses. This approach is also reasonable in the sense that

only persistent beliefs variation (rather than high-frequency fluctuations) should have an effect on

investment decisions and consumption choices. The first stage of these regressions are reported in

the Appendix in Table A1.



                                                    29
   The direct effects of the two SES measures on household choices are given by the estimated

regression coefficients in the models in Table 6 for each of the two measures. As expected, we

find that higher SES people are more likely to participate in the stock market, invest more money

relative to their income in equities, and are more likely to believe that it is a good time to purchase

homes, cars or durable goods. For example, the regression in the second column in Table 6 shows

that an income rank increase from the bottom to the top most rank corresponds to 71% (p < 0.01)

increase in the probability that the person invests in stocks. This is a large effect, considering that

in our data, as shown in the summary statistics in Table 2, 62% of respondents invest in the stock

market. Individuals with a college or higher education have a 10% (p < 0.01) higher probability

of investing in stocks, compared to those less educated. Similarly, the results in the third column

in Table 6 show that people with higher incomes and a college or higher education, conditional

on investing in equities, have a higher amount of money, expressed as a fraction of their annual

income, invested in stocks.

   The regression models in the last three columns in Table 6 show that, in general, both dimensions

of SES are significant and positive predictors of people’s assessment that it is a good time to purchase

a home, or a car or durable goods. For example, having a college or higher education translates

into an improvement of 0.065 (p < 0.01) in the person’s attitude towards buying a home, which

is sizeable, given that the mean of this variable is 0.384 in our sample. The effect of increasing

one’s income rank by one quintile on the attitude towards buying a home is similar in magnitude

(0.311 × 0.2=0.06, p < 0.01) to that of having a college education. When the dependent variable

captures the attitude towards buying durables, or cars, the estimated direct effects of the bottom

to top income rank change are 0.156 and 0.263 respectively (both effects at p < 0.01). The only

exception is that college educated people are not significantly different than those without a college

degree to indicate that it is a good time to purchase durables. For car buying attitude, the direct

effect of college education is an increase of 0.044 (p < 0.01) in attitude.

   Since in the regression models in Table 6 we control for the person’s beliefs about future macroe-

conomic conditions, as measured by their overall optimism, OP T IN DX, the above effects of SES

on the person’s decisions regarding investments and purchases represent the direct effects of SES


                                                  30
on these decisions, holding fixed any indirect effects of SES through the belief channel.

   To measure the indirect effects of SES, and the relative importance of the direct versus the indi-

rect effects, we follow standard methodology used in mediation analysis. The results are presented

in Table 7, and show that SES changes household choices through both the direct channel and the

indirect, belief-related, channel.

   For example, looking at the decision to invest or not in stocks (first row in Table 7), the direct

effect of an increase of 100 percentile in a person’s income rank is an increase of 0.714 in the

probability of investing, as shown earlier in the regression analysis in Table 6. The indirect effect

of the same increase in the income rank, through the belief channel, is equal to the product of

two quantities: the coefficient estimate on Income Rank in the regression model predicting the

belief OP T IN DX in the first column of Table 6, and the coefficient estimate on OP T IN DX in

the regression model from Table 6 that predicts the Invest variable. Thus, the indirect effect is

0.324 × 0.057 = 0.0184. The total effect of an increase from bottom to top most income rank on

the probability of investing in stocks is the sum of the direct (0.714) and indirect (0.018) effects,

namely 0.733. The importance of the indirect, belief-related channel, is given by the ratio of the

indirect to total effect, which is equal to 2.52%. In other words, a person’s income rank is a positive

predictor of the decision to invest in stocks, and about 2.52% of the positive effect of income on the

probability to invest is attributable to the beliefs that the person holds about future macroeconomic

conditions. The rest of the effect is attributable to other income-related factors that are not about

differences in beliefs.

   The importance of the indirect beliefs channel is higher for other SES measures and household

decisions. For example, analyzing the decision to invest in stocks, the indirect channel accounts for

3.06% of the positive effect of a college education. When analyzing the share of income invested

in stocks, the indirect, belief-related channel, accounts for 18.26% of the positive effect of higher

income rank, and 3.87% of the positive effect of a college education. When analyzing people’s

home buying attitude, the indirect, belief-related channel, accounts for 24.28% of the positive

effect of higher income rank, and 20.75% of the positive effect of a college education. The indirect,

belief-related channel accounts for 39.29% of the positive effect of higher income rank on attitudes

towards durables purchases, and for 30.82% of the positive effects of either higher income rank,

or higher education, on attitudes towards car purchases. Thus, the effects of SES on household

choices and attitudes are in part driven by the differences in macroeconomic expectations of people

with different SES.9

       So far in the analysis we have related several decisions of individuals to their aggregate belief

about future economic conditions, OP T IN DX. We will now turn towards analyzing a specific

aspect of these beliefs, namely, the subjective probability that the U.S. stock market return will

be positive over the next year (P ST K), to understand how it relates to the respondents’ decision

regarding making investments in stocks.

       While SES-related variables such as income and participation costs impact whether a household

invests in the stock market (e.g., Vissing-Jorgensen (2002)), our results so far suggest that SES-

driven variation in beliefs about stock returns may also explain the variation across SES levels in

terms of the decision to invest, and the fraction of income invested in stocks. We thus investigate

the relative importance of the SES-related stock market belief channel, relative to that of other

SES-related factors, on stock investment decisions.

       The results in Table 8 indicate that SES measures, as well as P ST K, are positive predictors of a
   9
    An additional way to quantify the role of the SES-induced beliefs on household economic choices is to examine
the contribution of these beliefs to the standard deviation of households’ choices. In untabulated analyses, we find
that this alternate approach leads to similar results as documented here.

person’s decision to invest in equities, and conditional on investing, of the share of income invested

in stocks. The relative importance of the direct effect of SES measures, and their indirect effect

through expectations, is illustrated in the results in Table 9. In columns (2)-(6) in Table 8, P ST K

is instrumented with 6-month prior P ST K. The first stage of these regressions are reported in the

Appendix in Table A2.

       As expected, the results in Table 8 show that, controlling for the belief about stock market

returns, our SES measures are positive and significant predictors of both the invest decision, as

well as of the share of income invested in stocks. In other words, income rank, and education directly

influence a household’s stock market investment decisions. However, as shown in our analysis in

Table 3 and in the first column in Table 8, these SES measures also impact P ST K, the belief

about whether the stock market return will be positive over the next year, which by itself, as seen

in Table 8, influences the households’ decision whether, and how much, to invest in stocks.10
  10
    A possible concern is that there is a mechanical correlation between the expectations expressed by survey re-
spondents and their declared choices, stemming from people’s desire to look ”consistent” in their survey answers.
Specifically, an individual who declared that he does not invest in the stock market may later express pessimistic
expectations about future stock market returns, to justify to himself and the experimenter why he holds no equities.
Fortunately, the survey design used by the MSC staff alleviates this concern, because people are first asked to estimate
the probability that the stock market will have a positive return, and only later are asked to calculate how much

    The coefficient estimates in Table 8 allow us to estimate the direct and indirect (via the belief

channel) effects of each of the SES measures on stock market investment decisions. Specifically,

increasing a person’s income rank by 100 percentile increases the probability of stock market partic-

ipation by 0.625, and the share of income invested by 0.229. The indirect effects of the same change

in income rank on these two outcomes, through the belief channel, are obtained by multiplying the

coefficient estimates on P ST K in the first column in Table 8 and those in the second, and third

column, respectively. Namely, the indirect effects of increasing the income rank by 100 percentile

on the probability of participation and on the share of income invested in stocks are increases of

about 0.159 × 0.424=0.067 and 0.159 × 1.251=0.199, respectively. The indirect effect of higher

income, though inducing more optimistic beliefs about the stock market, represents 9.76% of the

total effect of income on the participation decision (= 0.625+0.067), and 46.56% of its total effect

on the share of income invested in stocks (=0.229+0.199).

    When examining the effects of education on the decision to invest in stocks and on the share

of income invested, we also find sizeable indirect effects of this SES measure on the two decisions.

Specifically, following the same procedure described earlier for quantifying the direct and indirect

effects of income rank on stock investment decisions, we find that having a college degree increases

the probability of investing in stocks by 9.4%, and 31.97% of this total effect of education on

participation is coming from the indirect, belief-related channel. Also, having a college or better

education increases the share of income invested in stocks by 32.4% and the fraction of this total

effect that is driven by the belief channel is 27.50%. These results are summarized in Table 9.

    Thus, we find that people who have higher incomes and are more educated are more likely to

invest in stocks, and are willing to invest more of their income in these assets, and this is in part
money, if any, they invest in stocks.


                                                  34
because they hold more optimistic beliefs about the stock market return distribution.



6     Robustness checks, caveats and limitations

In this section, we discuss several potential alternative explanations of our results and the extent

to which they are addressed by our evidence. We also discuss a number of caveats and limitations

that one should keep in mind in interpreting our findings.


6.1   Information flows

It is possible that the reason why there are differences across SES strata in the expectations peo-

ple form about the macroeconomy is that low- and high-SES individuals have access to different

information sets, rather than having a different interpretation of the same information. While here

we can not fully control for the information set available to individuals, as could be done in an

experimental setting (e.g., Kuhnen and Miu (2017))), we are able to construct a proxy for the

information that the survey respondents have about business conditions. Specifically, we use MSC

data regarding the volume and tone of business news that survey respondents report to have heard

recently to construct the variable Business News Heard. This variable takes the value of -2,-1,0,1,or

2, depending on how many business news the responded reported having heard recently (0, 1, or 2),

and whether they were positive or negative in nature (as coded by the MSC interviewer). A value

of 2 means the respondent reported having heard 2 pieces of positive business news, while a value

of -2 means the respondent reported having heard 2 pieces of negative business news. A value of

1 indicates the responded only reported having heard one piece of business news, and that it was

positive. If the one piece of news heard was negative, the value of Business News Heard would be

-1. Finally, this variable has the value 0 if either the responded did not recall hearing any business

news lately, or whether one piece of news recalled was positive, and another was negative.

    In Table 10 we estimate OLS regressions of various macroeconomic expectations on SES mea-

sures, as in Table 3, but we also include as a control the variable Business News Heard, to proxy

for the information available to each respondent. We find that the higher is the value of Business

         Table 10: Macroeconomic Expectations, Socioeconomic Status, and News Heard
The table presents OLS regressions of macroeconomic expectations on SES measures while controlling for
the business news heard by the survey respondents. The variable Business News Heard takes the value of
-2,-1,0,1,or 2, depending on how many business news the respondents reported having heard recently (0, 1,
or 2), and whether they were positive or negative. Specifically, a value of 2 means the respondent reported
having heard 2 pieces of positive business news. A value of -2 means the respondent reported having heard 2
pieces of negative business news. A value of 1 indicates the responded only reported having heard one piece
of business news, and that it was positive. If the one piece of news heard was negative, the value of Business
News Heard is -1. Finally, this variable has the value 0 if either the respondent did not recall hearing any
business news lately, or whether one piece of news recalled was positive, and another was negative. Other
controls include dummies for year-month, age, gender, and marital status. Standard errors are clustered by
year-month, and t−statistics are shown in parentheses.

News Heard, that is, the more positive economic news people have heard lately, the more optimistic

they are when assessing future macroeconomic conditions, which is a natural result. Importantly,

we continue to find that the respondents’ income rank and education continue to be strong and

positive drivers of their macroeconomic optimism, even after controlling for their information set as

proxied by the Business News Heard variable. This suggests that our main results are not simply

an indication of exposure of low- and high-SES individuals to different information sets.

6.2   Financial literacy

Another possible concern regarding the finding that lower income individuals have more pessimistic

macroeconomic expectations is that the effect is driven by a lack of financial literacy, which might

induce low income people to be more confused, in a pessimistic manner, about the macroeconomy.

To address this concern, in the analysis in Table 11 we estimate similar models as in Table 3, but

only for people with a college degree. We continue to find a significant and positive effect (0.252,

p < 0.01) of IncomeRank on people’s aggregate expectations as measured by OP T IN DX. This

effect is similar in magnitude to that estimated in the specification in the first column in Table

3 (i.e., 0.304). In other words, even among those with high education, we find that individuals

earning more money are more optimistic about future macroeconomic developments than their

lower-income peers.


6.3   Indirectness of choice measures

We also interpret the respondents’ answers regarding household decisions—such as choices concern-

ing investing in the stock market, or attitudes towards buying homes, cars and durable goods—as

good proxies for these individuals’ actual economic behavior. That being said, we do not have

administrative data to verify these survey answers. However, there are two reasons to believe that

people’s survey responses are truthful.


                                                   37
         First, as shown earlier in our analysis, there is a clear relationship between respondents’ expec-

tations and their own household decisions as reported during the survey, which implies that the

data on decisions can not be simply noise. This correlation between expectations and behavior is

also found at the aggregate level, as shown for example in Carroll, Fuhrer, and Wilcox (1994), who

document that the degree of optimism in MSC expectations is a strong positive predictor of the

change over the following year in the aggregate level of personal consumption, including purchases

of cars, other goods, and services.

         Second, the survey measures of household behavior are strong predictors of aggregate macroe-

conomic outcomes. For example, Cai, Deggendorf, and Wilcox (2015) find that the MSC aggregate

response regarding whether it is a good time to buy a home is a strong and positive predictor of

the volume of transactions in the housing market measured over the following year. In additional

analyses of our own we find that the MSC respondents’ monthly aggregate attitude DU R regard-

ing purchasing durables is highly correlated (ρ=0.5, p < 0.01) with the aggregate contemporaneous

monthly demand for durable goods, obtained from the FRED database of the Federal Reserve Bank

of St. Louis. Similarly, we find that there is a high correlation (ρ=0.6, p < 0.01) between the MSC

aggregate monthly attitude CAR towards buying cars, and the contemporaneous total car sales

reported in the FRED database.11

         Therefore, while we can not verify for each respondent whether their household decisions are

truthfully reported, at least we observe that in the aggregate, the reports of individuals in the MSC

correspond to actual macroeconomic outcomes.



7         Conclusion

Using a sample of more than 180,000 responses from participants in the Michigan Survey of Con-

sumers each month from 1978 to 2014, we show that socioeconomic status (SES) has a strong

influence on individuals’ beliefs about future macroeconomic conditions such as changes in un-

employment, business conditions in general, and stock market performance. Specifically, we find
    11
    The durable goods demand data and the total car sales data are available on the website of the Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGORDER, and https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TOTALSA,
respectively. For our analysis we detrend these monthly time series to account for population growth.


                                                       38
that higher SES individuals—namely, those with higher income and higher education—are more

optimistic about future macroeconomic conditions. Consistent with a model of asymmetric belief

updating in which low-SES individuals have a tendency to neglect good states of the world, we find

that the beliefs wedge between high- and low-SES individuals is strongly pro-cyclical: in recessions,

the beliefs wedge almost disappears.

   This SES-related heterogeneity in macroeconomic expectations in turn has significant effects

on people’s economic choices. Specifically, we find that the relative macroeconomic optimism of

individuals with higher SES is in part responsible for these households’ higher propensity to invest

in stocks or to be inclined to purchase homes, cars or durable goods.

   Our findings suggest that differences in macroeconomic expectations across people with differ-

ent socioeconomic standing could potentially contribute to wealth inequality in the population over

time, since these expectations influence household decisions such as investing in stocks or in real

estate. An interesting avenue for future work is to quantify the importance of divergence in expec-

tations across SES strata for the dynamics of the wealth distribution in the population, possibly by

incorporating the SES-related belief heterogeneity in models like those of Piketty (1995), Favilukis

(2013), and Gabaix, Lasry, Lions, and Moll (2016). The implications for the wealth distribution

are not quite straightforward. For example, while high-SES individuals’ beliefs about stock market

returns appear to be less biased on average than the more pessimistic beliefs of low-SES individuals,

the fact that the optimism about stock returns of high-SES people is more pro-cyclical may imply

that they mis-time the stock market, which tends to have counter-cyclical expected returns. We

believe that this is a fruitful direction for future research.
