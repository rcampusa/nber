     Most data used to study the durations of unemployment spells come
from the Current Population Survey, which is a point-in-time survey
and gives an incomplete picture of the underlying duration distribution.
We introduce a new sample of completed unemployment spells obtained
from panel data and apply CPS sampling and reporting techniques to
replicate the type of data used by other researchers. Predicted dura-
 tion distributions derived from this CPS-like data are then compared
to the actual distribution. We conclude that the best inferences that
can be made about unemployment durations using CPS-like data are
seriously biased.

I. ItifRODUCTION

     Despite decades of intense interest in the sources and nature of

unemployment, the answer to the simple question, "How long do spells of

unemployment last?" has remained elusive. This is rather surprising since

economists are often tempted to interpret short spells of unemployment as a

frictional or normal component of unemployment about which policy—makers need

not be concerned, and long—term or chronic unemployment as a disequilibrium

component embodying most of its socially wasteful aspects. Hall (1970) and

Marston (1976) have potnted out that this Is not a partIcularly useful

distinction, since the high unemployment rates of many disadvantaged groups

seem to be related to employment instability or frequent unemployment spells

rather than lengthy individual spells. Nevertheless, the observation that the

average spell of unemployment Is relatively short has been used to support the

position that most unemployment is essentially "voluntary." Conversely, the

inability of some individuals to locate a job over a period of several months

Is considered to be evidence of labor market malfunctioning. As a prelude to

analyzing changes in the ratio of long—term to short—term unemployment, Green

et al. state in the Monthly Labor Review that

         The length of time that workers remain unemployed is an
         important indication of the severity of the Nation's
         unemployment problem.

     The duration data used to study unemployment comes, almost exclusively,

from the Census Bureau's monthly current Population Survey (CPs), the only

representative sample obtained on a continuing basis. Despite the attractive

features of CPS data that make it an invaluable tool in many research

applications, the data cannot be used to answer even rather simple questions

concerning unemployment durations. The CPS Is a point—in—time survey and thus

cannot measure Important aspects of phenomena which persist over time. For
                                        2




example, the CPS records as duration of unemployment the average duration of

unemployment spells in progress as of the survey date, rather than the

duration of completed spells. Moreover, as Kaltz (1970) has noted, the point—

in—time sampling of the CPS understates the frequency of short spells of

unemployment since longer spells are more likely to be recorded in the survey.

      In spite of these difficulties, CPS data has been "the only game in town"

for   analyzing unemployment durations, and thus the trend in recent work has

been to glean more information from the CPS by exploiting the quasi—panel

nature of the data — an IndIvIdual Is In the sample for four months, out for

eight, and then in again for four months — and by imposing additional

restrictions on the underlying distribution of spell durations. These

restrictions are then used to compute descriptive statistics of the duration

distribution, typically, the mean and the upper deciles. These statistics, in

turn, form the basis for almost all informed discussion regarding the duration

of unemployment spells.

      Obviously these empirical characterizations of unemployment spells are

only as good as the statistical assumptions they are based on; yet within the

confines of CPS data there Is no way to check their validity. Providing such

a check is the major purpose of this paper.

      We depart from the current trend by introducing a new sample of completed

unemployment spells obtained from panel data. We apply to this data CPS

sampling and reporting techniques, including the censoring of long spells, to

replicate the type of data used by other researchers. We then apply

conventional statistical analysis to the CPS—like data and to censored

versions of the actual duration data, and use the results of that analysis to

characterize the duration distribution as researchers before us have done.

Comparisons of predicted distributions with the actual are then made for
                                        3




several statistical models, applied to five different sets of duration data.

In this way we distinguish the impact of point—in—time sampling from that of

censored reporting of durations, since reporting techniques can be altered

more readily.

     Our results suggest that point—in—time sampling, by introducing

considerable error into the measurement of unemployment durations, leads to

unreliable estimates of the duration distribution. When data derived from

continuous monitoring is used, both applying more general parametric forms and

predictions.    This is not the case for CPS—like data; censored data performs

nearly as well as uncensored data, and the simplest parametric forms

frequently provide the best fits. The best inferences that can be made about

the actual distribution using CPS—like data are seriously biased. Mean

durations are underestimated by 2 to 3 weeks, and the fraction of spells

lasting more than 28 weeks or more than 52 weeks are substantially under-

stated. Based on these findings, we are skeptical about the value of CPS

duration data in the study of unemployment.



II. ESTIMATING UNEMPLOYMENT DURATION FROM CPS DKFA

     Inferences about completed spells of unemployment depend crucially upon

the type of data that are available. We begin by using "perfect" data to

characterize the duration distribution. Assume that a homogeneous population

has been continuously monitored. At each moment of time, the number of

persons with elapsed duration in unemployment s is known. Denoting calendar

time by t, let the distribution of exit times from unemployment spells started

at time t be given by Fe(s).

    Suppose that a particular date, T0, is chosen to analyze the unemployment
                                            4



records, and that we wish to estimate the distribution of completed un-

employment durations. Denote the flow into unemployment at date t as p(t).

The probability that an individual who entered the unemployed state at date

 t T is still unemployed at date T0 is 1 —            F(T0    —   t)   =   1   —
                                                                                   Fe(s).   The

density of elapsed durations at the interview date T0 is:


                                p(T0- s) [1 - FT -
    (1)      h(s;T) =
                            T
                                       —
                                           F[TQ
                                                  —   uljdu

     In general, this density will depend upon the entire previous history of

the process, as the denominator of equation (1) makes plain.

     Can we estimate the time—dependent distribution functions, Fe(s)?

Clearly one cross—sectional "snap—shot" alone Is not sufficient, even with

p(t) known. However, with "perfect" data we can obtain estimates of Fe(s) for

a particular t by observing the durations of unemployment spells started at

time t, which, by assumption, are observed over time.' In this manner it is

possible to produce estimates of duration distributions that differ by time

period and to compare unemployment behavior in booms and in troughs.

     In practice, researchers have typically restricted the general form of

(1). Two approaches are possible in view of available data — the first based

on cross—section data and the second on gross flows. If only a "snapshot" of

elapsed durations is available, but the p(t)'s are known, one can estimate the

parameters of the distribution of exit times provided that the distribution is

known up to a vector of parameters and that it is unchanging over time.2 This

is known as the synthetic cohort method. In this case we have


                            p(T — s) [1—F(s;4)J
    (1')     h(s;T) =
                        T
                        L0 p(u) [1—F(T0 u;)]du
                                                  5




where by F(s;) we indicate specifically the requirement that F be known up to

the parameter vector .

        Estimates   of c can be used to calculate functions of q such as the

average duration of a completed spell, or the upper percentage points of F.

The major advantage of this method is that it allows one to deal explicitly

with non—stationarity. Indeed, if               contains an element related to demand

pressure, it is feasible to examine whether the exit distribution varies with

the business cycle.

        Despite the attractIveness of thIs specfcaton, i.t rarely has been

implemented in the economics literature. Unpublished papers by Luckett (1978)

and Smith (1982) and the article by Bowers and Harkness (1979) are the only

studies that discuss or Implement this approach, to our knowledge.3

        The more common method of using cross—section data is to assume that

stochastic process generating the exit times is Markov or semi—Markov. The

ergodic property of regular Markov processes implies that the Inf low p(t)

converges to p and thus (1') converges to



    (1''       h(s) =            [1   —   F(s)]         =   1   —   F(s)
                                 - F(T      -                   D
                        pJ° [1                  u)]du

where      =    [1—F(s)]ds   is the mean of completed spells. This is the result

of Kaitz (1970) and Salant (1977), though obtained in a different nianner.4

Typically, a parametric form of F is chosen such that 1—F(s) and D can be

expressed as functions of a few parameters. It should be stressed that (1'')

holds only in the stationary state and that even relatively minor departures

from stationary inflows can have large consequences for the estimates. In

particular, reporting a time series of estimated functions which are based on

period—by—period stationarity assumptions is likely to be of little value.5
                                               6




     The second approach to estimating the distribution of exit times from

unemployment is available when entry and possibly exit times are known for all

individuals.6 If   all   entry and exit times are known we are in the "perfect"

data case described above. CPS data have only a quasi—panel structure; when

individuals are observed for four months, only some of the labor market flows

will be observed for each cohort. However, aggregate flow data for successive

periods allows one to calculate the empirical hazard rate:



                            =                — U[a
                                 (U[s,T0]            h,T0 Lh])/U[s,TJ


where U[s,t] is the stock of unemployed with elapsed duration s at time t

and th is the time between samples. The fundamental relationship between

hazard functions and distribution functions



    (3)      a)          A(s) =      f(s)/(1—F(s))


             b)          F(s)        1 —   exp— f X(x)dx}


provides the link between observed behavior and the hypothesized underlying

distribution of completed spell lengths (Kalbfleisch and Prentice (1980)). In

practice, A(s) is not observed for all values of s. Some simple curves are

therefore fit to the data and the complete distribution is inferred from these

estimates. In this regard, it is worth remarking that non—negativity

throughout the range of s is an essential requirement for any hypothesized

hazard function. Moreover, one typically requires that



    (4)
             s÷ 0J X(x)
             urn                dx
                                         7




in order that the distribution function in (3) b) be non—defective, While

defective distributions can be of use in some problems, e.g., mover—stayer

models, our intended purpose of estimating hazard rates —   identifying   the

distribution of durations of completed spells of unemployment — argues

strongly against considering distributions with F(oo) < 1. In other words,

some hazard functions which appear to fit the data well may be objectionable

on an a priori basis.

       In prac1ple, estImated parameters of the extt time distrIbutIon obtained

from gross flow methods should be identical to estimates obtained from the

point—in—time sampling methods, provided the specification is correct. Both

approaches allow for non—stationary behavior in the entrance rates into

unemployment, and while neither can encompass pure cohort effects on the exit

distribution, each can treat fluctuation in the exit distribution as a

function of aggregate economic conditions. The major advantage of gross flow

data is that It allows one to ignore the relatively cumbersome weighting shown

in (1').

      Despite the close relationship between the sample data function —    either
the elapsed duration distribution in the point—in—time sample or the hazard

function in the gross flow approach — and the distribution of completed

spells, there are serious problems associated with using CPS data in either of

its manifestations to estimate duration distributions. A primary difficulty

is that the reported data are presented as grouped data in intervals of 0 — 4,

5 —   6, 7 — 10, 11 — 14, 15 — 26, or more than 27 weeks of elapsed unemploy-
ment. As these categories are not integer multiples of the sampling window

(one month), it is not possible to obtain the exact weight, p(t), needed to

calculate (1') in the synthetic cohort approach.7
                                        8



       Grouping of the data also causes difficulties for the gross flow

approach. Since interviews are one month apart and we do not know when during

the month the transition out of unemployment occurred, actual completed

durations lie in the intervals 0 —   8.3,   5 —   10.3,   7 —   14.3,   11 —   18.3,   15 —

30.3 and 27+ weeks. As the overlapping of these Intervals suggest, we know
completed durations with very little precision from gross flow data.8

       Other difficulties foLlow from the CPS reporting procedures. Usable data

are censored at about six months. Only five of the reported intervals can be

used to fit hazard functIons, SiUCC the longer spells of unemployment in the

open—ended final category must be excluded. Also, since many short—spells of

unemployment are missed altogether — the length bias problem in sampling

discussed by Kaltz (1970) — the fit of the estimated distribution depends

upon behavior in both the lower and upper tails being consistent with the

assumed functional form.

       Despite the frailties of the CPS data for estimating duration distribu-

tions, it is currently the only sample with representative coverage of all

labor market participants, and is thus potentially the most informative. It

is therefore very important to know whether, despite all these problems, the

duration distributions estimated from CPS data are reasonably accurate.



III.    TUE DENVER INCOME M&INTENMICE EXPERIMENT DATA

       Our new sample of completed unemployment spells comes from surveys

conducted by the Denver Income Maintenance Experiment (DIME). A principal

advantage of these data Is that they provide a continuous employment history

for each individual in the sample for up to 48 months. Thus the completed

duration of each unemployment spell is known, with the exception of a very

small number of spells which overlap the beginning or end of the sample
                                       9




period. The periodic interviews are retrospective, so we have accurate

information on the timing of each transition into and out of employment.

     The DIME sample has been discussed extensively elsewhere,9 as have the

employment histories constructed from the basic Public Use Files.10 A few

characteristics of the data, however, are particularly relevant to the

application at hand since they limit the comparability of our results with

those of CPS—based studies. Specifically, the sample selection criteria for

DIME families and the imprecision of recorded transitions between unemployment

and nonpartIcIpatIon In employment ntervews may lImIt our abilIty to draw

conclusions about the general population from this study.



1. Saimple Selection

     The CPS sample is representative of the U. S. population; the DIME sample

is not. The experiment was designed to measure the effects of a negative

income tax on labor supply. tn order that the sample correspond as closely as

possible to the target population of a future NIT program, the 2,657 families

initially enrolled in the experiment were required to satisfy a number of

eligibility requirements. These included restrictions concerning age, family

structure, and ability to work but, most importantly, all families with pre—

experiment "normal" earnings above a specified level were excluded. Eligible

families were allocated in a non—random fashion among eleven different

financial treatments and a control group containing 40% of the total sample.

    The most obvious problem in using this sample to study unemployment is

that the support guarantees and varying tax rates faced by financial treatment

families distort labor supply decisions. This is easily avoided, however, by

restricting the analysis, as we do, to the control group, which received only

token payments for reporting their work histories.
                                      10




     The earnings truncation of the DIME sample presents a more serious

difficulty. We would expect families who experience lower incomes prior to

the experiment to contain members with an unusual propensity to experience

long or frequent spells of unemployment. It is not obvious how restricting

our analysis to individuals in low income families will affect the

distribution of unemployment spell durations, but we might expect long spells

to be more prevalent than in the population as a whole.



2, The Uneaployiiient—Nonparticipation Distinction

     In general, the information available in the DIME   Public   Use Files

permits individuals to be classified as employed, unemployed, or nonpartici-

pating according to the CPS definitions of these labor market states.

However, a problem concerning the identification of transitions between

unemployment and nonparticipation arose during the construction of employment

histories. The data were collected via ten periodic interviews, which were

administered at intervals of three to four months. At each interview all

spells of employment and non—employment since the last interview were

identified. After this, a series of questions relating to each spell were

asked, including probes for search activity during each spell of non—

employment.

     This procedure had two unfortunate results. Between periodic interviews,

any transitions between unemployment and nonparticipation are not

identified. As a consequence, transition rates between these two states will

be underestimated.1' Secondly, all observed transitions between these states

will occur during months in which periodic interviews took place, and will be

placed at the end of a month in the raw data. There will thus be some error

in timing of recorded transitions. These problems suggest that some caution
                                          11




be exercised in interpreting results from DIME data but, given the

deficiencies of CPS data, do not seem to warrant abandoning the use of such

special samples.'2



3.   Continuous Monitoring   and CL'S—like Uneapioyent Data

     To perform the comparisons described above, we first constructed the

"true" distribution of completed unemployment spells. The middle years of the

sample, 1972 and 1973, were used as the sampling frame. All spells of

unemployment occurring during this period were included. A small fraction of

these spells were censored because of sample attrition — about 1.5% for adult

men and less than 1% for women —   but,   in the main, the sample consists of

about 700 completed spells of unemployment for men and women over twenty—one

years of age.

     Figures 1 and 2 display the sample density functions of unemployment

duration for adult men and women. These graphs are constructed by fitting a

cubic spline function through the observed frequencies to obtain smoothness.

Some relevant characteristics of the sample distributions are given in Table 1.

     Both male and female distributions exhibit skewness of the sort commonly

thought to be characteristic of unemployment: most spells are quite short but

the distribution has a long skew to the right.'3. For example, in this sample

the mean is 78% higher than the median for men, and 45% higher for women. For

men the sample density function looks rather like an exponential, at least up

to about the      or 25th week, while the density of completed spell lengths

for women does not resemble any textbook form of which we are aware.

          From this sample of all spells of unemployment we constructed hazard

functions after grouping the data, separately by sex, into four—week

intervals. These are reported in Appendix A. Hazard functions could be

estimated for smaller intervals from these data, but we wished to keep the

analysis close to the practical limits of what could be obtained using CPS

data. Also, we have avoided using intervals of unequal length, as the CPS

uses, in order to eliminate inessential complications. The effects of

censoring duration data at 28 or 52 weeks can be determined by employing only

          Construction      of CPS—type data required an entirely different procedure.

The CPS interviews individuals at one point of each month, determines the

current labor market state, then matches observations in consecutive months to

give the gross monthly flows among states.'4 We have produced what we will

call CPS—like data, or, when there is no possibility of confusion, simply CPS

data, by matching observations on the individual's state on the first day of

adjacent months, indexed by elapsed duration. The resulting gross flow data

are used to produce exit probabilities grouped into duration categories at 4

week intervals. This grouping corresponds closely, but not exactly, to the

one used by the CPS in reporting both gross flow and elapsed duration distri-

butions. In what follows we will refer to the data obtained using the full

panel nature of the data as continuous monitoring data, whether censored or

uncensored. CPS data will be censored at 28 or 52 weeks.

          In principle these data could be used to estimate the distribution of

exit times by either the synthetic cohort or the gross flow approach. As a

practical matter, the number of spells of unemployment recorded during the two

year period was about 350 each for men and women; consequently, the number of

persons unemployed at any one time is relatively small, and the grouped
                                            16




duration distribution will have sparse cells at any point in time. Hence, it

does not appear feasible to apply the synthetic cohort approach to these

data. However, because labor market conditions were stable during the 1972—73

period, as measured by both the Denver SMSA unemployment rate and the

unemployment rates of DIME    controls,'5    it seems reasonable to treat the

completed spells of unemployment as observations from a single exit time

distribution, which allows us to use the gross flow approach. The empirical

work that follows focuses solely on this approach.



IV. Fitting Paraisetric Forms to Continuous Monitoring and to CPS—Llke Data

        In this section we report the results of fitting several specific

distribution functions to the five sets of data described above. Continuous

monitoring data will be referred to as CM28, CM52, or CMall to identify the

censoring limit, and CPS—like data will be denoted CPS28 or CPS52. We report

results based on three functional forms for the hazard function, described in

Table 2. Other functional forms were also considered, but the estimates

failed to satisfy restrictions on the hazard presented in Section ii.16

        Users of actual CPS gross flows are presented with censored data on

unemployment spells, from which they wish to infer moments, or functions of

moments, of the full distribution. Excluding the open—ended final duration

interval, censoring occurs at about 26 weeks, leaving only five observations

on grouped data. Our CPS28 data, which is grouped into regular four—week

intervals, has six usable observations. This limits the choice of distribu-

tion function substantially, and we have restricted our set of hazard

functions to those which are estimable within the confines of actual CPS

data.

Our primary interest is in how well the fitted distributions enable us to

extrapolate to durations beyond the censoring limit.

        We have estimated the functional forms described in Table 2 by maximum

likelihood, using the data reported in Appendices A and J3•17 Table 3 contains

these estimates for the three candidate distributions. These results suggest

that models which allow non—constant hazard rates are superior to the

constant—hazard exponential for both men and women. The Weibull appears to

fit most versions of the data better than the exponential, according to a

likelihood ratio test, as do several forms of the Gompertz with admissible

parameter values. It should be noted, however, that the exit rate derived

from CPS data increases with elapsed duration, while the continuous monitoring

exit rates usually decline over time. Since the Weibull and Gompertz we

cannot choose between them are not nested models, on the basis of a likelihood

ratio test.

        More important than the fit of each model to the data used to estimate

it, is the ability to each parametric model to predict the actual (unobserved)

distribution of unemployment spells. In the case of uncensored continuous

monitoring data, these considerations coincide, since the entire distribution

is used in estimation. We can compare this "best possible" fit of simple

parametric forms to those achieved when data is simply censored and, in turn,

to those which result when CPS—type monitoring and reporting procedures are

used.

        We focus on three aspects of the distribution of unemployment spells:

the duration of a typical spell as measured by the mean and median, the

frequency of very short spells, and the frequency of very long spells.

Predicted values of these magnitudes from all acceptable parametric models are

presented in Table 4, together with the true values from the continuous

monitoring sample.'8



Means and Medians

     When uncensored data are used, the estimated mean and median unemployment

durations are very close to their true values for both men and women,

regardless of the parametric model used.'9 If the continuous monitoring data

are censored, however, the choice of a model becomes very important. CM52

performs nearly as well as CMaI1   wIth   the Webull form, but usually results in

a significant underestimate of both mean and median with either of the other

forms. CM28 does even worse, but the undershooting is kept to a minimum by

the Weibull distribution.

     With CPS data, the degree of censoring has almost no effect on the

predicted means and medians. In sharp contrast to the CM data, use of the

Weibull or Gompertz does not generally improve the predictions. When compared

to Weibull estimates using CM data with similar censoring, CPS28 and CPS52

lead to more serious underestimates of mean durations, and slightly worse

estimates of medians.



Frequency of Short Spells

     One well—known feature of the CPS sampling method is that short spells of

unemployment are undercounted. For example, ignoring the overall sampling

rate, as interviews are conducted at four week intervals, a spell with a

complete duration of four weeks or more is certain to be caught, a two—week

spell has a .5 probabilty of being detected, and so forth. Since shorter

spells of unemployment are less likely to be included in the CPS sample, the

distribution of completed spell lengths may be biased.
                                      22




     How important are these missing spells? Table 4 shows that, in this

sample, 51% of men's unemployment spells are less than 8 weeks long, as are

35% of women's. Using the Weibull distribution results in good estimates with

CM data, regardless of censoring. With the same distribution, CPS—type data

do appear to lead to length bias, as the proportion of short spells is

significantly underestimated for both men and women. This impression does not

persist, however, if we turn to the exponential where, for women, the bias is

in the opposite direction. Although CPS sampling results in censoring at the

lower tail of the distribution as well as at the upper tail, the resulting

bias in the estimated distribution depends solely on how well the assumed

parametric model fits in the lower tail.



Frequency of Long Spells

     Table 4 contains the actual and predicted proportions of unemployment

spells which end in less than 28 weeks, or less than 52 weeks. Even with

uncensored data, the models we use proved too simple to fit these tail

probabilities very consistently. For men, prediction is good up to 28 weeks,

but the number of extremely long spells is underestimated. For women,

prediction is reasonably good for 52 weeks, but underestimates the proportion

of spells less than 28 weeks. The shape of the actual distributions in the

upper tails clearly does not conform very well to these standard distribu—

tions. Note that this has some rather important considerations: under ideal

data conditions, the best estimate suggests that 5% of men's unemployment

spells are longer than 52 weeks, while the true proportion is over 9%.

    As might be expected, censored versions of the data do even worse. None

of the models pick up the fat upper tail of the actual distribution for men;

the proportion of long spells is consistently underpredicted. For women,

there is a clear tradeoff between predicting the proportion of spells less

than 28 weeks, and the proportion less than 52 weeks, The Weibull fits well

at 28 weeks with CM28, and well at 52 weeks with CM52.

     Predictions using CPS data are remarkably insensitive to changes in

functional form or censoring and remarkably poor. For men, long spells are

underpredicted by a very large amount (8 points for over 52 weeks). For

women, the exponential predicts rather well at 28 weeks, but all models do

very badly at 52 weeks.



     General Goodness—of—Fit

     Table    5 presents a chi—square test for the fit of each model for the

first 17 four—week intervals, and the maximum distance between the predicted

and actual distribution functions.2° The results have already been suggested

by the discussion above. The best fit is achieved by the Weibull applied to

CM data, CMS2 is nearly as good as CMaII; CN28        is   only a little worse. CPS

data does best with the exponential model, but is always clearly inferior to

the best of the CM models. Censoring has no effect on the fit of the CPS—

exponential.

     Several conclusions are suggested by the preceding results:

    1. A very simple and commonly—used functional form — the Weibull —        fits
the actual distributions of unemployment durations very well. This is true

for both men and women, with the only major problem being an inability to fit

the upper tail of the male     distribution   in this sample.

    2. With continuous monitoring data, censoring at 52 weeks does not lead

to a marked   deterioration   of the fit, and censoring at 28 weeks leads to only

moderate problems when the Weibull form is used.

   3. CPS—like data censored at 52 weeks fits the actual distributions very

badly, and the use of functional forms more general than the exponential

generally make the predictions worse. Censoring at 28 rather than 52 weeks

makes almost no difference.

     The implications for our current knowledge of the unemployment duration

distribution, which is derived from the CPS, are almost entirely negative.

Although the results reported here are specific to our data set, it seems

likely that predictions from parametric models applied to CPS data are no

better than those from our very similar CPS28. Even more disturbing, these

predictions can probably not be improved by using more general parametric

fQrtns, or by extending the censoring limit to make additional data

available. With existng sampling techniques, we cannot do much better than

leave the censoring at 26 weeks and estimate an exponential hazard model. The

major problem appears to be the imprecision with which unemployment durations

are measured by the CPS. Measurement error obscures in CPS data the hazard

rate patterns which are so evident in the continuous monitoring data.

     How serious is the poor fit which results? The underprediction of very

long spells and the bias in predicted mean duration might be reduced in

magnitude by a more representative data set with fewer long spells. The

apparent unreliability of estimates derived from CPS data is likely to be a

more persistent problem. When using actual CT'S data, investigators can choose

among functional forms for the hazard only by examining how well they fit the

available data. On this basis, we would prefer parametric forms other than

the exponential. Table 5 shows, however, that such "preferred" estimates from

CT'S—like data may   predict   the underLying distribution of completed spells very

poorly.

V. CONCLUSIONS

    The findings reported in this study are specific to the data set used,

and the other data sets could in principle produce different results. Yet, to

our knowledge, the DIME data provide the only means of assessing the value of

using data derived from point—in-time sampling, such as that reported in the

CPS, to estimate durations of completed spells of unemployment. Our results

indicate that the bias in mean durations is about 2—3 weeks, and that the

frequency of long spells is underpredicted. More importantly, we find that

the currently popular method of estimating hazard functions on censored and

aggregated data in order to provide estimates of the complete distribution and

of functions of the complete distribution, are quite unreliable. This arises

in part because durations are censored and some parametrizations yield

defective distribution functions, but primarily because CPS sampling and

reporting techniques introduce measurement error into observed unemployment

durations. Functional forms which fit the true distribution very well produce

misleading estimates when applied to CPS Data. Consequently, we conclude that

there is little to be coaxed out of CPS unemployment data other than what is

present in non—parametric estimates of the distribution function available

from the censored data.

                                FOOTNOTES

     We ignore here, and elsewhere throughout this article, any distinction
     between a "true" escape rate distribution and that produced by the
     mixture of a true distribution with a distribution generated by
     unobserved population heterogeneity. For the purpose of estimating the
     distribution of completed unemployment spells, this distinction is
     irrelevant.
2
     By unchanging over time we mean that the form of the distribution
     function and its dependence upon variables such as aggregate demand,
     are known. This dependence upon external covariates is not completely
     general, since it cannot encompass pure cohort effects.

     Bowers and Harkness (1979) do not directly estimate the parameters of
     the exit distribution based on likelihood construction. Instead they
     use the empirical survivor function L(s) = U(s, T)/p(T — s), where
     U(s, T0) is the number of spells of length S in process at time T0, and
     fit smooth curves to these data. Since L'(s) is not guaranteed to be
     non—positive, smoothing by regressing L(s) on s is necessary to produce
     a well behaved survivor function. In principle, this smoothing amounts
     to assuming a specific form for F(s)).

     See also the papers by Akerloff and Main (1980), Bjorklund (1981),
     Cripps and Tarling (1974), Frank (1978), and Marston (1976)..

     European authors following Cripps and Tarling (1974), are sensitive to
     the effect of non—stationary state stocks on estimates of the exit
     distribution, and tend to report moments of the exit distribution only
     when a "stationary position (of the register) has been reached."
     (Cripps and Tarling, p. 301).

     See Clark and Summers (1979) for an application of this approach.

     This problem is not insurmountable. The existing gross flow data are
     available monthly and one can form weighted averages of the monthly
     flows assuming that the entry rate is uniformly distributed within a
     month.

8    There are further problems with the gross flow data that hinder their
     usefulness for the analysis of unemployment, for example, the reported
     flows do not add up to the current stocks. See Abowd and Zellrier
     (1982) for a discussion of these issues.

     See Keeley et al (1978), and Tuma and Robins (1980).
10   See Lundberg (1980), and Kiefer and Neumann (1982).

     This is documented in Kiefer and Neumann (1982).
12   The appropriate way to assess these difficulties, of course, is to
     compare the characteristics of DIME data with those of the alternative,
     CPS data. It must be noted, then, that the exact date on which a
     transition between unemployment and nonparticipation takes place is not
     available from CPS gross flow data either. In fact, for L recorded
                                    30



     transition, we know only that a change in labor force status has
     occurred at some point during the month. Thus, the error in the
     reported duration of unemployment spells beginning or ending in
     nonparticipation will be larger in DIME data than in CPS data, while
     for spells beginning or ending in employment it will be smaller. In
     addition, Woitman (1980) suggests that simple response variability
     results in inflated CPS gross flow data, and that this problem is
     particularly serious for movements into and out of the labor force.
     This implies that part of the discrepancy between the unemployment—
     nonparticipation transition rates in DIME and CPS may be the existence
     of spurious transitions in the latter.

13   See Burdett et al (1982), Kiefer and Neumann (1982) and Salant (1977)
     for other evidence of unemployment spell length and its distribution.

14   We are ignoring the complications brought about by movement into and
     out of CPS due to sample rotation. Users of the CPS have generally
     assumed that there is no rotation effect, and we do not attempt to
     reproduce the problem in our sample.
15   The Denver SMSA unemployment rate was 3.6% in 1972 and 3.4% in 1973.
     For DIME controls, the equivalent unemployment rates were 7.6% in each
     year. (Kiefer and Neumann, 1982, Ps334).
16   We considered generalizations of the Weibull and Gompertz hazards
     obtained by adding squared terms in log duration and duration
     respectively. In all cases, the maximum—likelihood estimates violated
     condition (4) on the hazard. A linear—log model, A(d) = B + B11n(d)
     routinely fit best with B1 < 0, violating the nonnegativiy condition
     on the hazard. These results are not reported here. Note that Clark
     and Summers (1979) do not impose these restrictions on the hazard, and
     end up with an estimated c.d.f. having a regular maximum.

17
     For the continuous monitoring data, elapsed duration is set at the
     midpoint of each 4—week Interval. For CPS data, elapsed duration to
     date takes on the values of 4.15, 8.65, 12.65, 16.65, 20.65, and 24.65;
     the midpoint of the prior month duration category plus the sampling
     window (4.3 weeks),
18   Closed form solutions exist for the exponential and Weibull mean value
     functions and these were used in Table 4. The Gompertz mean values
     were obtained via numerical integration. Median values were obtained
     from the fitted survivor functions.

19   The only exception Is that the exponential overestimates the median for
     men only by about two weeks.
                                                      17
20   The chi squared statistic is formed as x2 = N         (F(c)   —   F(t))21F(c),
                                                     t=1
     where N is the number of spells of unemployment in the sample, F is
     the predicted distribution, and F Is the empirical distribution. The
     summation runs over the seventeen duration intervals reported. Table 5
     also reports the maximum deviation between the predicted and actual
     distribution for each specification, which is useful for any distance
     tests such as the Kolmogorov—Smlrnov test.
