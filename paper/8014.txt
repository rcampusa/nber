1. Introduction

   The impact of globalization on labor-market outcomes continues to be an important concern

of scholars, policy makers, and advocacy groups (e.g., see the volumes of Abowd and Freeman,

1991, and Feenstra, 2000). One particular concern is the effect on wages. Previous research

analyzes the importance of foreign ownership (Aitken, et al., 1996; Feliciano and Lipsey, 1999),

trade protection (Gaston and Trefler, 1994, 1995; Haskel and Slaughter, 2000), and foreign

competition (Borjas and Ramey, 1995; Freeman and Katz, 1991). But whether international

linkages condition how firms share profits with their workers has not been investigated.

   In the literature on rent sharing in the labor market, many studies have documented a robustly

positive correlation between wages for various micro-units‚Äîfirms, individuals, union-firm

bargaining units‚Äîwith profits per worker at the level of that micro-unit‚Äôs industry. These

industry profits are interpreted as ‚Äúprosperity in the product market‚Äù (Oswald, 1996 p. 16)

enjoyed by firms and available for sharing with workers.

   A common feature of these industry studies is they delineate product markets by the same

country as that of the micro-units. That is, wages for micro-units located in a specific country

are linked with measures of industry profitability constructed using data for operations in that

same country. These industry-profit measures implicitly assume that national borders bound the

product markets whose prosperity is relevant to wages. But is there international rent sharing

with profits shared across borders? As a number of forces have made product and labor markets

more international in recent decades, the implicitly closed-economy perspective may miss

important international aspects of wage setting.

   Consider, for example, the wages of automobile workers in the United States. In 1950 the

United States accounted for 75 percent of total world motor vehicle output. But that share has

fallen to less than 25 percent today, as production has greatly expanded in Japan, Europe, and

elsewhere (Ward‚Äôs Communications, 1999). When U.S. automobile workers and their firms

negotiate wages, is the automobile market taken to be just the United States, or the United States

plus certain other countries, or the whole world? The answer to this question may very well
                                                                                                                   2


depend on a number of international linkages. One might be multinational firms. Do employees
working for Honda in Marysville, OH, focus more on automobile profits in Japan than do their

counterparts working for G.M. in Flint, MI? Another linkage might be international unions. In

the 1970s, the United Auto Workers (UAW) union achieved nominal-wage parity between its

U.S. and Canadian workers (Budd, 1998; Yates, 1993); might this imply different behavior

between unions with Canadian members and wholly-domestic unions? And trade barriers might

also matter. Did Japanese voluntary export restraints alter the wage-setting behavior for U.S.

auto workers?

    Motivated by the questions of this example, in this paper we examine how rent or profit

sharing may be conditioned by the international linkages which help shape economic openness.

This focus on international linkages is the central contribution of the paper. Our wage data are

negotiated contract wages for a sample of over 1000 Canadian labor contracts spanning all

manufacturing from 1980 through 1992. These contracts are negotiated by a bargaining unit

consisting of a union and a firm. For Canadian data, the standard profit-sharing specification

includes Canadian industry profits and we start by also adding U.S. industry profits. For Canada,

the United States is overwhelmingly the single biggest country in the rest of the world on many

economic metrics. For example, since 1994 the United States has accounted for between 75

percent and 85 percent of all Canadian exports and about 75 percent of all imports.1

Accordingly, for our sample of Canadian wages the obvious first extension of product-market

boundaries beyond Canada is to the United States.

    But the importance of U.S. profits for Canadian bargaining units might depend on different

international linkages. Thus, we also analyze the role of three transmission mechanisms. Two of

the three indicate organizational structures: foreign ownership and international unions, based

on information about the firm and union in each bargaining unit. The other captures U.S.-

Canadian product-market integration as proxied by two industry border barriers, Canadian tariffs
and U.S. transportation costs.

   Our central finding is that the relevant measure of product-market prosperity, and thus the

pattern of profit sharing, varies significantly with international linkages. Specifically, we have

two main results. First, international linkages of organizational structure matter for how profits

are shared. Higher Canadian-industry profits raise wages for employees of Canadian-owned

firms and/or employees represented by a domestic union, but higher Canadian-industry profits

generally have a much smaller (or no) effect on the wages of Canadian employees of U.S.-owned

firms and/or employees represented by an international union. The converse holds for U.S.-

industry profits. Higher U.S. profits lower wages for employees of Canadian-owned firms

and/or employees represented by domestic unions, but higher U.S. profits raise or have zero

effect on wages for employees of U.S.-owned firms and/or employees represented by an

international union. Second, we find some evidence that border barriers matter as well. Higher

U.S. profits reduce wages less when Canadian tariffs are higher, while transportation costs

(whose levels are much lower than tariff levels) show no such ‚Äúinsulating‚Äù effect on wages.

   These results are robust to a number of measurement and specification issues. They have not

been documented by previous research, and, taken together, they paint a richer picture of rent

sharing. Profits do seem to be shared across borders: the relevant product market for wage
setting extends beyond national borders, and the specific wage impacts of the prosperity of these

product markets differ across multinational ownership, union type, and trade barriers. We

interpret this as evidence of international rent sharing.

   The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 briefly surveys the related literature.

Section 3 motivate the empirical analysis with a discussion of the underlying theory of profit

sharing. Section 4 presents our data and empirical analysis, and Section 5 concludes.

2. Literature Survey
   This paper relates to four bodies of literature. The first and most directly relevant is that on

profit sharing with workers (where profit sharing is often cited as an important cause of inter-
                                                                                                                                   4


industry wage differentials, e.g., Katz and Summers, 1989). Oswald (1996) carefully surveys
many empirical studies in this literature.                     Among these studies, ours is closely related to

Christofides and Oswald (1992), who also use Canadian bargaining-unit wages and find a

positive link between wages and Canadian industry profits. It is also closely related to Abowd

and Lemieux (1991, 1993), who also use bargaining-unit data but relate these wages to industry

product prices and shipments; and to Blanchflower et al. (1996), who link various measures of

U.S. wages with U.S. industry profits. Again, we build on these studies by examining how profit

sharing varies with different international linkages.2

     Second, our interest in whether multinational ownership conditions profit sharing is related to

other studies of how multinationals differ from their domestic counterparts. Globerman et al.

(1994) report that foreign affiliates in Canada pay higher wages than do Canadian

establishments, but that this differential is not due to ownership per se but rather to foreign

affiliates being larger and more capital intensive. Howenstine and Zeile (1994), Doms and

Jensen (1998), and Feliciano and Lipsey (1999) find the same for U.S. manufacturing: foreign

affiliates pay more than U.S. owned establishments, but only because of scale, capital-use, and

technology differentials rather than ownership per se. But Doms and Jensen also report that

multinational establishments, be they U.S. or foreign owned, pay significantly more than purely

domestic plants do even controlling for other performance factors.                                    Aitken et al. (1996)

document a pay-ownership differential for Mexico and Venezuela as well as the United States.

None of these studies examines whether foreign ownership implies different profit sharing, or

whether profitability in the parent country affects wages in the foreign affiliate. The answers to

these question matter a lot for how multinationals operate in host countries and whether

government policies should court these firms (e.g., Svejnar and Smith, 1984).



2 Our empirical focus is on profit sharing with unionized workers. We do not consider compensation for CEOs and other
corporate officers. There is now a large literature on the role of profit sharing in executive compensation (see Murphy, 1999, for
a survey). We also do not consider profit sharing with debt and/or equity holders. Hines (1996) finds that U.S. firms pay
dividends out of their foreign profits at three times the rate they do out of their domestic profits; his distinction between foreign
and domestic profits is in the same spirit of our study.
                                                                                                                               5


    Third, our focus on international unions extends other studies of the labor-market impacts of
international unions and enriches the literature on unions more generally.                                     In Canadian

manufacturing, roughly half of the unionized bargaining units are represented by an international

union ‚Äì i.e., a union headquartered in the United States (Budd, 1998).3 Unions are complex

political institutions, and case-study evidence suggests that international unions may be an

important transmission mechanism for importing U.S. conditions into Canadian wage

determination (Budd, 1998; Crispo, 1967; Yates, 1993), but international unions have been

overlooked by research on globalization and labor market outcomes.

    Finally, as stated in the introduction, our work is related to the large recent literature on

globalization and labor-market outcomes. This literature is far too large to summarize here (see

Slaughter, 1999 for a discussion). But one point of contrast is that much of the empirical work in

this area has followed from the perfectly competitive Heckscher-Ohlin trade model in which all

sectors earn zero profits and all workers earn their marginal revenue products. Thus, our focus

on profit sharing is closer to studies such as Borjas and Ramey (1995), who investigate whether

import competition squeezes rents paid to U.S. less-skilled workers in imperfectly competitive

industries, and Gaston and Trefler (1995), who examine a cross-section of U.S. unionized

workers and find U.S. tariffs to be negatively correlated with industry wage premia.

3. Empirical Framework

3a. Motivating Theory and Empirical Strategy
    The notion of profit sharing between workers and their firm can be easily formalized in a

bargaining framework.              Consider a situation in which risk-neutral workers enjoy some

negotiating power, œÜ, for bargaining with their firm over their wage, w. In a Nash bargaining

setting, the maximization problem for the negotiation is given by
                           (1) Maximize œÜ log{[u(w) ‚Äì u(wo)]n} + (1- œÜ) log(œÄ) ,




3 Despite the standard label of ‚Äúinternational union,‚Äù from a Canadian perspective these unions are essentially ‚Äúforeign unions.‚Äù
They are headquartered in the United States, and the Canadian membership is typically a small proportion of the total.
                                                                                                      6


where u(w) is worker utility from wage w; wo represents the outside wage available to workers if

bargaining breaks down; n is the number of workers; and œÄ is profits defined as firm revenue less

its wagebill. From (1) comes the following expression for the negotiated wage outcome.
                                                 Ô£´ œÜ Ô£∂Ô£´ œÄ Ô£∂
                                   (2) w ‚âà wo + Ô£¨Ô£¨       Ô£∑Ô£∑Ô£¨ Ô£∑
                                                 Ô£≠ 1 ‚àí œÜ Ô£∏Ô£≠ n Ô£∏
The equilibrium wage depends on the outside wage option and on profits per worker, where the

pass-through of profits to wages depends on relative bargaining power. Oswald (1996) derives

(2); Svejnar (1986) derives (2) and a more general expression for the case of risk-averse workers.

   Equation (2) is actually quite general. As it is derived directly from the optimization problem

in (1), it holds for any bargaining framework which can be characterized by (1). But equation

(2) also obtains from many other wage-setting situations. As Oswald (1996) demonstrates, it can

be derived from a perfectly-competitive setting in which short-run labor-mobility frictions make

the labor-supply schedule slope upward; or from a labor-contract model in which both workers

and firms are risk-averse, and thus optimally share profits in boom times; or from various models

of fairness in which not sharing profits is perceived to be somehow unjust.

   Many rent-sharing studies cited in Section 2 base their empirical analysis on equation (2),

with the repeated finding of a robustly positive correlation between wages for various micro-

units‚Äîfirms, individuals, union-firm bargaining units‚Äîwith profits per worker at the level of

that micro-unit‚Äôs industry. So if b indexes micro-units (such as bargaining units as in our data), i

industries, and t time, the common approach is to estimate an equation like the following.
                                  (3) wbit = Œ≤(œÄ/n)it + Œ≥Zbit + ebit .

Here Zbit is a vector of wage determinants other than profitability which may vary by micro-

units, industries, and/or time; (œÄ/n)it is industry-level profits per worker; ebit is an error term; and

the parameter of interest Œ≤ is commonly estimated to be significantly greater than zero.

   All studies using (3) delineate product markets by the same country as that of the micro-unit.
That is, (œÄ/n)it is constructed using data from the same country as the micro unit b (e.g., wages

for U.S. union contracts are regressed on profits per worker for industries located in the United
                                                                                               7


States). As stated in the introduction, this assumption that national borders bound the product
markets whose prosperity is relevant to wages might not square with the many forces that have

made product and labor markets in recent decades. Accordingly, this implicitly closed-economy

perspective may miss important international aspects of wage setting. Our analysis extends the

framework in (3) to test for international rent sharing.

    First, we want to examine whether the relevant product market for wage negotiations goes

beyond national borders. As product markets become more integrated across countries‚Äîand as

many industries in many countries account for an ever-smaller share of world output for those

industries‚Äîthis possibility seems quite plausible. So if there are two countries, home (h) and

foreign (f), this issue suggests the following regression specification.
                            (4) wbit = Œ≤(œÄ /n)hit + Œ¥(œÄ/n)fit + Œ≥Zbit + ebit .

For micro-units located in home, we want to allow wages to depend not just on home industry

profits but on foreign industry profits as well. We also want to allow different pass-through for

different countries‚Äô profits (i.e., to allow Œ≤ ‚â† Œ¥).

    Second, we want to examine whether pass-through varies with international linkages. One

important linkage may be being part of a multinational firm. On the one hand, as discussed in

Section 2 multinationals appear to pay higher wages than observationally equivalent domestic

firms, a fact which may be consistent with multinationals enjoying and sharing with workers

higher profits thanks to greater product-market power. On the other hand, Rodrik (1997) has

argued that international capital mobility grants multinationals more bargaining power over

workers, thanks to a more-plausible threat to relocate activity to other countries.        When

considering profits from more than one country, there may be interactions with ownership status.

For example, Canadian affiliates of U.S. multinationals may be more sensitive to U.S. profits

than are purely domestic Canadian firms.

    Another important linkage may be being part of an international union.         Budd (1998)

catalogs several differences between domestic and international unions that may matter for profit

sharing. International unions may enjoy more bargaining power than purely domestic unions
                                                                                                  8


thanks to greater resources and bargaining experience. Also, to the extent that the leaders of
international unions feel compelled to satisfy members located in many countries, how wages

vary with other-country profits may differ between domestic and international unions. For

example, if profits are unexpectedly lower at home, leaders of international unions may feel

compelled to spread this hardship among all members regardless of location. This may mean

lower foreign wages for members of international unions‚Äîbut not for members of purely

domestic unions.

   A third international linkage which may matter for profit sharing is trade barriers.           In

principle, the degree to which the closed-economy perspective implicit in equation (3) is

inappropriate depends largely on how insulated a country‚Äôs product markets are from the rest of

the world. Border barriers such as tariffs and transportation costs insulate domestic firms from

foreign competition; in the extreme, prohibitive barriers make (3) match the textbook case of a

country in autarky. Exactly how prohibitive border barriers are for the empirically relevant case

of less-than-free trade depends on market structure (e.g., Helpman and Krugman, 1989), but a

first-pass prediction is that higher border barriers mean more insulation for home micro-units and

thus less pass-through from foreign profits to home wages.

   Taken together, the preceding discussion suggests that equation (4) should be extended even
further to allow interactions between profits and various international linkages. Let ILbit be a set

of dichotomous variables coded 1 to indicate the presence of some international linkage and 0

otherwise (or coded continuously for quantifiable linkages such as trade barriers). Then this

information can be added to (4) to obtain a more general specification:
                       (5) wbit = Œ±(ILbit) + Œ≤(œÄ/n)hit + Œ≤IL[(œÄ/n)hit x (ILbit)]

                                           + Œ¥(œÄ/n)fit + Œ¥IL[(œÄ/n)fit x (ILbit)] + Œ≥Zbit + ebit

In (5), we enter these international linkages both individually and interacted with our profits
measures. Our pass-through parameters of interest are now subscripted, Œ≤IL and Œ¥IL, to indicate

that we now allow these quantities of interest to vary not just by country but also by linkages.
                                                                                                              9


We will estimate several specifications of the form given in equation (5). We now turn to a
description of our data and econometric issues.

3b. Data, Measurement, and Variable Construction
    To estimate equation (5) we need micro-unit-level data on wages, industry-level data on

profits per worker for multiple countries, data on international linkages at either the micro-unit

level or industry level, and various control regressors at various aggregation levels. In principle

these data could span all sectors, but we have data for manufacturing sectors only.

    The core of the data is a wage-settlement file for Canadian collective-bargaining agreements

covering 500 workers or more in manufacturing collected by Human Resources Development

Canada.4 Wages are reported at the bargaining-unit level of observation, where each bargaining

unit consists of a union and a firm. We use the reported starting base hourly wage rate (typically

the wage of the lowest paid bargaining-unit classification) for the beginning of each contract,
deflated by the Canadian consumer price index (CPI). Thus our wage measure, wbit, is the

logarithm of the real hourly wage for bargaining unit b in industry i at the start of the contract

going into effect in year t.

    In addition to the wage rate, the Human Resources Development Canada file also contains

the name of the company and the union, the primary industry of the firm, the number of

employees covered by the contract, contract duration, and the location (province) of the

bargaining unit.        By combining this additional information with outside data sources, we

constructed the various regressors in (5). We end up with an unbalanced panel of 1014

bargaining-unit/year observations spanning 242 bargaining units and 12 years, 1980 to 1992.

The data set includes observations from 54 different 3-digit manufacturing industries. Note that

different bargaining units have different numbers of observations and also different start years

for new contracts. The average contract duration is 30 months.




4 Abowd and Lemieux (1991, 1993) and Christofides and Oswald (1992) use earlier versions of this same file.
                                                                                                  10


   To construct industry profits per worker from Canadian operations, (œÄ/n)hit, we follow

Blanchflower et al. (1996). This study proposed three possible measures of industry profits.
               Profit1 = (Value Added ‚Äì Payroll)/CPI [per employee]

               Profit2 = Profit1 ‚Äì Depreciation [per employee]

               Profit 3 = Profit2 ‚Äì Opportunity Cost of Capital [per employee]
Profit2 adjusts simple real profits (Profit1) for depreciation, where Depreciationt ‚â° (Capital

Stockt ‚Äì Capital Stockt+1 + Investmentt). Profit3 further accounts for the opportunity cost of

capital, where Opportunity CoCt ‚â° (Risk-Free Interest Ratet ‚Äì CPI % Changet) x (Capital Stockt).

We constructed all three profit measures; data on CPI and treasury-security interest rates (our

proxy for the risk-free interest rate) come from the International Monetary Fund, and all other

industry data come from data provided by Statistics Canada.

   In constructing the profit measures, we maintained as much industry disaggregation as

possible. For 31 of the 54 3-digit industries in the wage settlements data, there was sufficient

data to construct profits at the 3-digit level; for 22 industries data availability only permitted

profit construction at the 2-digit level; the remaining industry is a combination of 2- and 3-digit

measures, depending on the year. The sample correlation among all three measures is quite high,

so our empirical results are robust to which measure we use. In the tables below, we report

baseline specifications using Profit2.
   For industry profits per worker outside Canada, (œÄ/n)fit, in principle we could include all

countries in the rest of the world. In practice, data constraints limit us to analyzing U.S. industry

profits. As discussed in the introduction, on many economic metrics the United States is

overwhelmingly the economic component of the rest of the world from Canada‚Äôs perspective.

U.S. profits are constructed analogous to our Canadian measures using data from the National

Bureau of Economic Research‚Äôs Manufacturing Productivity Data Base, an industry-year panel
                                                                                                                           11


of 450 4-digit U.S. SIC sectors (Bartelsman and Gray, 1996). To maintain comparability with
the Canadian data, U.S. profit measures were constructed at the same 2- and 3-digit levels.5

    As with the three Canadian profit measures, sample correlations among three U.S. profit

measures are high, so we report baseline specifications using Profit2. Our baseline results

measure U.S. profits in real U.S. dollars; we also report measures in real Canadian dollars.
    We construct four different variables to capture international linkages, ILbit. One is U.S.

ownership (i.e., foreign ownership, since the home country is Canada). Using firm names
reported in the wage-data file, we determined the nationality of each firm‚Äôs majority owner to

create various firm categories: parent of a Canadian-headquartered multinational, a purely

domestic Canadian firm, affiliate of a U.S.-headquartered multinational, or affiliate of a non-

U.S.-headquartered multinational. To determine nationality of ownership, we relied on various

corporate directories and paid careful attention to ownership changes.6 We dropped from our
sample affiliates of non-U.S.-headquartered multinationals, both because we measure (œÄ/n)fit

only for the United States and because we do not have data on linkages for countries other than

the United States (e.g., all international unions are U.S.-headquartered). These dropped affiliates

were only about 9% of the full data sample.

    A second measure of international linkages is international unions, i.e., U.S.-headquartered

unions.      The wage-data file reports the union representing each bargaining unit.                                   Using

information on international status from Labour Canada (various issues), we can identify each

observation‚Äôs union as either international or domestic.



5 Since this time frame pre-dates the common North American Industry Classification System, we needed to create a
concordance between 3-digit Canadian SIC codes and 3-digit U.S. SIC codes (as well as between the 1970 and 1980 codes for
Canada and the 1972 and 1987 revisions for the United States). The starting point was Statistics Canada (1991), but information
on the products produced by specific bargaining units was used when ambiguities arose. In two instances, the 3-digit Canadian
SIC code maps into two U.S. categories and so weighted averages of the two U.S. industry measures were used to construct a
single industry measure.
6 Corporate parentage was identified using International Directory of Corporate Affiliations (Skokie, IL: National Register
Publishing Company), Who Owns Whom (London: O.W. Roskill), Moody‚Äôs Industrial Manual (New York: Moody‚Äôs Investors
Service), Moody‚Äôs Public Utility Manual (New York: Moody‚Äôs Investors Service), Moody‚Äôs International Utility Manual (New
York: Moody‚Äôs Investors Service), Survey of Industrials (Toronto: Financial Post Corporation Service Group) and The Blue Book
of Canadian Business (Toronto: Canadian Newspaper Services International).
                                                                                                                      12


    Our other international linkages are border barriers: tariffs and transportation costs. Tariffs
measure the ad valorem bilateral tariff rate imposed by Canada on U.S. imports. These data

were constructed by using the rates from Deardorff and Stern (1990, Tables A7 and A8) for 1976

and 1987 and applying the relevant negotiated tariff reductions for other years.7                                    Our

transportation costs are calculated as the difference between imports into the United States

valued cost, insurance, freight (c.i.f.) and imports valued ‚Äúfree on board‚Äù(f.o.b.), all as a share of

imports valued f.o.b. This quantity is an ad valorem transportation cost capturing the actual

expenses incurred shipping and insuring goods. We use U.S. data because we do not have c.i.f.

and f.o.b. import data for Canada. Tariffs and transportation costs vary over time and industry.
    Finally, for the other measured determinants of wages, Zbit, we experimented with a large

number of variables used in studies such as Budd (1998) and Christofides and Oswald (1992). In

the tables below, our baseline specifications include the following variables: contract duration,

number of employees, industry average hourly earnings, industry employment growth, the

provincial unemployment rate, and provincial average weekly earnings as well as industry,
province, and year effects. All results are robust to the exact set of variables in Zbit.

3c. Econometric Issues
    Before presenting our estimation results for equation (5), there are three important

econometric issues to mention. First is the possibility of omitted-variables bias, in particular

because in (5) we correlate bargaining-unit wages with industry profitability but include no

measure of bargaining-unit profitability. As with many related studies (Christofides and Oswald,

1992; Abowd and Lemieux, 1993; and Blanchflower et al., 1996), this specification choice is

largely due to insufficient firm-level data. Moreover, as will be seen below, 40 percent of the

observations involve a U.S. parent company, and only rarely do these companies report Canada-

only profits.      That said, industry profits may be a measure of product-market prosperity


7 More specifically, the GATT Tokyo Round reductions were done in eight equal steps between 1980 and 1987 tariff rates for
each year are straightforward to construct using the starting and ending values. The 1987 Free Trade Agreement removed all
U.S.-Canadian tariffs between 1989 and 1998. These reductions were not uniform and we used the reduction schedule in Magun
et al. (1988) to calculate each industry‚Äôs tariff rate for each year.
                                                                                                                                 13


uncontaminated by profitability shocks idiosyncratic to the firm, and thus may be an important
focal point for unions and/or firms in collective bargaining. Traditional union rhetoric is that

differences in ability to pay across firms arise due to differences in management, not workers, as

illustrated by the UAW‚Äôs rejection of the idea that ‚Äúinefficiency in management should be

subsidized out of workers‚Äô living standards‚Äù (MacDonald, 1963, p. 215). Thus, to maintain

parity with Ford and other worldwide competitors, GM may have to pay high wages when the

overall auto industry booms even if GM itself is faring relatively poorly.

     More generally, one can imagine how wage setting may depend on profits at many levels:

the establishment, the product division within a firm for multi-product firms; the geographic

division within a firm for multinationals; the overall firm; the industry in the residence country;

and the industry worldwide. Ideally, we could measure and analyze profits at all these levels.

But in reality we simply do not have the establishment, firm, and industry detail to do this. This

data problem faces all related profit-sharing studies we know of, and we think our specification
in equation (5) tries to move existing work closer to this ideal.8 Note the error term ebit needs to

account for the fact that profits regressors vary at a more-aggregated level than the regressand;

we report results for standard errors which are robust to arbitrary forms of heteroskedasticity.

     A second econometric issue is endogeneity. Wages and profits are, of course, simultaneously

determined. To the extent that higher wages mean lower profits, ceteris paribus, equation (5)

will understate the true pass-through from profits to wages. Instrumenting is one possible

solution, but this requires data on one or more variables which are positively correlated with
profits yet uncorrelated with ebit. Oswald (1996) discusses the difficulties in finding ex ante

plausible instruments for profits. The alternative solution is to lag the profits regressors, under

the assumption that shocks to profits take time to pass through to wages (e.g., because of multi-

year contracts). Christofides and Oswald (1992) report results lagging profits one year;
Blanchflower et al. (1996) find the strongest results for three-year lags. We split the difference

8 In the literature on profit sharing, Svejnar (1986), Currie and McConnell (1992), and Hildreth and Oswald (1997) link firm-
level wages with firm-level profits as reported in corporate annual reports. But these studies do not include industry-level profits.
                                                                                                                            14


and report our baseline specifications lagging (œÄ/n)hit and (œÄ/n)fit two years. Both one-year and

three-year lags were also used extensively; we report some results from three-year lags. We also
attempted instrumenting for profits using exchange rates, and will discuss this below.

    The third econometric issue is how best to exploit the panel nature of our data. In principle,

our baseline specifications could include a full set of bargaining-unit fixed effects. In practice,

bargaining-unit fixed effects are highly collinear with two of our regressors of greatest interest,

our indicator variables for multinational ownership and international union. This is because our

data contain very few bargaining units which switch ownership and/or union representation over

time. Of the 242 bargaining units in our full sample, only 10 ever change ownership status and

33 ever change union status.9                 This is not surprising, since we average only about four

observations over time per bargaining unit. Given this collinearity problem, in our baseline

specifications we include a full set of industry, province, and year fixed effects (with coefficient

estimates not reported, for brevity). Some results using bargaining-unit fixed effects will be

reported, to help gauge the robustness of other regressors.

4. Empirical Results

4a. Profit Sharing and International Organizations
    Table 1 reports summary statistics for our key variables of interest. Recall that the data cover

1,014 union wage settlements for 242 union-firm pairs in Canadian manufacturing from 1980 to

1992. Column 1 reports sample means (and standard deviations) for our full sample. To

preview some of the variation across our international linkages, columns 2 and 3 report means

(and standard deviations) for the subsamples of Canadian-owned firms and U.S.-owned firms,

respectively. Column 4 reports t-tests for whether means differ between the subsamples.

    Nearly three-quarters of the observations in the overall sample have at least one of the

organizational-structure international linkages of interest: 40.1 percent are part of U.S.-owned

multinationals and 53.1 percent of observations involve international unions.                                 Also, of the

9 More than five percent of the bargaining units experience an ownership change, but if parent nationality remains constant then
our ownership indicators do not change. Moreover, if a firm is bought from or sold to a non-U.S. international company, the
bargaining unit enters or leaves the data set.
                                                                                                    15


Canadian-owned firms, 46.0 percent are Canadian-headquartered multinationals. Tariff levels
are much higher than transportation costs. And there appear to be notable differences among the

two ownership subsamples:        U.S. affiliates are located in faster-growth industries, lower-

unemployment regions, and industries with lower border barriers (transportation costs and tariff

rates). Average wages in U.S. affiliates are slightly lower than in domestically-owned firms, but

this difference is not statistically significant and does not control for any observable differences.

   Tables 2 through 6 investigate the role of foreign ownership and international unions, our

organizational structures. In Tables 7 through 10 we add to the analysis tariffs and transportation

costs, our border barriers. In all tables, columns represent different specifications while rows

represent different regressors, with cells reporting coefficient estimates (and heteroskedastic-

consistent standard errors) from OLS estimates.

   Table 2 reports initial estimation results for equations (3), (4), and (5). Column 1 starts with

equation (3), to match the typical profit-sharing specification used in the previous literature.
Other than the Zbit regressors, the only regressor is (œÄ/n)hit. As in related studies, this variable is

significantly positive, indicating higher industry profits in Canada pass through to higher wage

settlements in Canada, and precisely estimated (t statistic = 4.384). Since the mean of the

Canadian profits variable is 0.036 (see Table 1), the column 1 coefficient of 1.583 implies a

profit elasticity of wages of 0.06. Thus, a doubling of industry profits would boost real wages by

6 percent. This is very similar to profit elasticities estimated previously, e.g., the range of 0.06 to

0.08 estimated by Blanchflower et al. (1996) for U.S. manufacturing wages.
   Column 2 moves to equation (4), which adds the regressor (œÄ/n)fit. The coefficient on U.S.

profits is insignificantly different from zero, while that on Canadian profits is basically

unchanged. Column 3 adds foreign ownership using a categorical variable, U.S. Parent, equal to

one if the bargaining unit is an affiliate of a U.S.-headquartered multinational, and zero

otherwise. This column also adds a categorical variable, International Union, equal to one if the

bargaining unit involves an international union and zero if it involves a purely domestic union.

The coefficient estimate on U.S. Parent is insignificant, while that on International Union is
                                                                                                  16


significantly negative (consistent with Budd, 1998). The profitability coefficients are basically
unchanged from column 2.

   Were one to stop at this point, one might conclude that international linkages do not matter

for rent sharing.     But column 3 does not interact profits per worker with U.S. Parent or

International Union, as in equation (5). Columns 4 through 6 do this, and reveal strong evidence
that international linkages condition the pattern of profit sharing.

   First, consider column 4 in which both Canadian and U.S. industry profits are interacted with

U.S. Parent. For domestic Canadian firms, the responsiveness of wages to Canadian industry
profits has increased substantially from our earlier estimates which pooled all firms. Our point

estimate has risen from 1.583 in column 1 to 2.740, implying a rise in the profits-wages elasticity

from 0.06 to 0.10. U.S. affiliates show significantly less wage responsiveness to Canadian

industry profits than their Canadian-owned counterparts, as indicated by the ‚Äì1.708 coefficient (t

statistic = 2.530). The absolute wage effect for U.S. affiliates is positive, with an elasticity of

0.04, but this effect is only borderline significantly different from (an F test for the sum of the

coefficients on Canadian profits and Canadian profits interacted with U.S. Parent equaling zero

has p-value 0.093).

   The responsiveness to U.S. industry profits also varies with ownership. Our pooled estimates

in Columns (2) and (3) suggested no wage effects from U.S. industry profits. But column 4
indicates that for domestic Canadian firms, wages are significantly lower the higher are U.S.

industry profits, with an implied elasticity of ‚Äì0.08. In contrast, wages at U.S. affiliates are hurt

much less by higher U.S. industry profits, as indicated by the significant point estimate 2.399 (t

statistic = 3.602). The absolute wage effect for U.S. affiliates is positive, with an elasticity of

0.01, but not significantly so (an F test for the sum of the coefficients on U.S. profits and U.S.

profits interacted with U.S. Parent equaling zero has p-value 0.595).

   The overall rent-sharing story in column 4 is much richer than has been previously

documented. The positive Canadian profits‚ÄîCanadian companies linkage is the standard profit-

sharing situation: boom times in the product market create surpluses for firms to share with
                                                                                                 17


workers (Blanchflower et al., 1996; Christofides and Oswald, 1992). The weaker Canadian
profits-U.S. affiliates linkage suggests the standard profit-sharing situation is somehow tempered

by the additional complexities of multinational ownership. One plausible mechanism might be

that U.S. parents feel competitive pressure when Canadian industry profits are high, and thus try

to restrain wages firm-wide. This restraint might mute the upward pressure from standard rent

sharing, and therefore yield a lower responsiveness of Canadian wages to Canadian profits in

U.S.-owned firms than in Canadian-owned firms. Alternatively, if there are other factors (e.g.,

firm-wide compensation policies) that affect wages in foreign-owned firms more than wholly-

domestic entities, then wages at U.S. affiliates might be less responsive to Canadian profits.

   The negative U.S. profits-Canadian companies linkage again suggests international

competitive forces: boom times in U.S. industry pressures Canadian firms to restrain wages.

The U.S. affiliates are presumably subjected to this pressure, but if there is international rent

sharing then higher U.S. profits would also raise wages. The marginally positive U.S. profits-

U.S. affiliates linkage is consistent with these two features offsetting each other: higher U.S.

profits increase wages, by virtue of international rent sharing through the multinational linkage,

but also decrease wages, by virtue of product-market competition in Canada.

   Column 5 of Table 2 examines our other international organizational linkage ‚Äì international

unions. As with column 4, rent sharing varies across groups. Higher Canadian industry profits
imply significantly higher wages for domestic unions‚Äîagain, much higher than our earlier

pooled estimates‚Äîbut insignificantly higher wages for international unions.           Higher U.S.

industry profits imply significantly lower wages for domestic unions‚Äîagain, different from our

earlier pooled estimates‚Äîbut higher wages for international unions, albeit insignificantly so.

Using the point estimates in column 5, a 10 percent increase in Canadian profits increases

domestic-union wages by 0.9 percent, but increases international-union wages by only 0.1

percent. A 10 percent increase in U.S. profits decreases domestic-union wages by 0.5 percent,

but raises wages in international unions by 0.3 percent.         For both profits measures, the

differential wage response between international and domestic unions is statistically significant
                                                                                                                       18


(as indicated by the two interaction variables), but the overall wage effect for international
unions is not statistically significant.10

    As with foreign ownership, union structure conditions profit sharing.                                One possible

explanation is that for domestic unions, higher Canadian profits are seen as a boon to be shared,

whereas higher U.S. profits are seen as a pressure to be endured. For international unions, by

virtue of representing both Canadian and U.S. workers, higher profits might cut both ways within

the membership, with no clear net wage implications. The significant differences between

domestic and international unions are consistent with expressed dissatisfaction with international

unions in Canada and the importation of U.S. goals and constraints into Canadian collective

bargaining (Budd, 1998; Crispo, 1967; Yates, 1993). A prominent example was the automobile

industry in the early 1980s, in which the U.S. UAW leadership was accused of blocking wage

increases for its Canadian members during the U.S. auto slump.

    Our robustness checks start with Column 6 of Table 2, where we report the results of

including both the U.S. Parent and International Union profit interactions in a single regression.

This does not change the pattern of results, and each of the organizational structures appears to

matter (in that all four interaction terms are significantly different from zero) even with the other

included in the specification.             If anything, profit-sharing patterns for ‚Äúpurely Canadian‚Äù

bargaining units‚Äîi.e., those with both a Canadian firm and a domestic union‚Äîare even larger

than the baselines of the previous two specifications.

    Tables 3 and 4 report a number of robustness checks on the role of foreign ownership and

international unions, respectively. In each table, the first column reports the relevant baseline

specification from Table 2. Columns 2 through 4 report results using alternative profit measures

(see Section 3b): our baseline profit variable lagged three years rather than two; an alternative

                                                                                                    19


profit variable lagged two years; and our baseline profit variable measured in Canadian rather
than U.S. dollars. All results are qualitatively as before.

   As an additional robustness check, recall that many of the bargaining pairs in our data appear

more than once as they negotiate new contracts. Column 5 of Tables 3 and 4 reports results from
including in Zbit in equation (5) a full set of bargaining-unit fixed effects, rather than the full set

of industry/province/year effects. In broad terms, the pattern of results is similar to the OLS
specifications. In Table 3, Canadian profits for Canadian firms is significantly positive, U.S.

profits for Canadian firms is significantly negative, and the interacted profit variables with U.S.

Parent lessen the Canadian profits effect and increase the U.S. profits effect. However, the
interacted coefficients are imprecisely estimated. This is to be expected, as controlling for

bargaining-unit fixed effects drastically reduces the independent variation in the key U.S. Parent

variable. In fact, given that only 5 percent of the bargaining units change ownership status, it is

surprising that the interacted U.S.-profits coefficient is even close to statistical significance (p-

value = 0.173). Things look similar in Table 4. The coefficient estimates are smaller and the

standard errors larger, with identification of the interaction terms again tenuous because of so

few union-status switchers.

   Column 6 of Tables 3 and 4 reports results for the OLS baseline specification estimated on a

sample excluding the auto industry. Because of the extent of cross-border integration stemming
from the 1965 Auto Pact, we want to ensure that our results are not driven by this single industry.

As can be seen, the results are unchanged.

   Table 5 estimates equation (5) separately for different international-organization subsamples.

These split-sample results are more general than the interacted results of Tables 2-4, because

coefficients on all regressors are now permitted to vary across groups.             The findings are

qualitatively identical as before. In columns 1 and 2, the sample is split between Canadian firms

and U.S. affiliates. Canadian profits have a significantly positive wage effect only for Canadian

firms. As discussed earlier, this is consistent with standard rent-sharing theories for domestic

firms and a more complicated wage-setting process for foreign-owned firms. U.S. profits are
                                                                                                  20


significantly negative for Canadian firms, but are borderline significantly positive for U.S.
affiliates. As discussed earlier, this suggests that a positive U.S. economic climate pressures

Canadian firms and thus their workers. In contrast, higher U.S. profits benefits workers in U.S.

affiliates thanks to international rent sharing but also hurts them via the product-market

competition in Canada: thus the magnitude of this last effect is smaller than the baseline

Canadian profits-Canadian firms rent-sharing effect.

   Columns 3 and 4 of Table 5 split the sample by international-union status. The results are

similar to those in columns 1 and 2, but with less-precise estimates on U.S. profits. The positive

effect of Canadian profits on wages for workers represented by a domestic union is consistent

with standard rent-sharing theories. The other profit estimate significant at the 10 percent level

is U.S. profits for international-union wages, again is consistent with international unions

importing the sharing of U.S. profits into Canadian wage determination.

   Our final set of robustness checks is in Table 6, which presents two different manipulations

of the international organizational linkage idea. First, thus far the variable U.S. Parent has

combined two kinds of Canadian-owned firms as the omitted category: those that are parents of

Canadian-headquartered multinationals, and those that are purely domestic firms. In column 1,

an additional Canadian-multinational variable is added and interacted with Canadian and U.S.

profits. For U.S. profits, the results are as before. Interestingly, the non-interacted dummy
variables indicate that holding all else constant, wholly domestic Canadian firms have the highest

wage levels on average.

   To investigate the combined effect of ownership and union status, rather than each institution

separately, column 2 of Table 6 separates out bargaining units that involve both a U.S. affiliate

and an international union. The combined effect of U.S. ownership and union status is stronger

than each individually, as indicated by the much larger coefficient estimates on the two

interaction terms than in earlier tables. In fact, here the absolute effect of U.S. profits in the

presence of both a U.S. parent and international union is significantly positive, not insignificantly
                                                                                                                             21


positive as in earlier tables.11 This suggests that international linkages for profit sharing are

particularly important when jointly present: U.S. firms bring U.S. conditions into Canada via

international rent sharing, and the added presence of U.S.-based labor unions magnify this.

4b. Profit Sharing and Trade Barriers
    In Table 7, we turn our attention to our other two measures of international linkages, the

border barriers. We have industry-level data on ad valorem transportation costs and tariffs for

Canada, higher values of which indicate larger trade barriers (see Section 3b for details on data

construction). Column 1 re-reports the (non-interacted) baseline specification from column 3 of

Table 2. Column 2 adds transportation costs; the estimate of 0.034 indicates wages tend to be

higher in industries with higher transport costs. Column 3 interacts transportation costs with

both Canadian and U.S. industry profits. Canadian profits is again significantly positive, and

U.S. profits is marginally negative (p-value = 0.062). The interacted coefficients are very

imprecisely estimated, suggesting rent sharing does not systematically vary with transport costs.

    Columns 4 and 5 repeat the analysis for tariffs. In column 4, tariffs are not significantly

correlated with wages. Column 5 interacts tariffs with Canadian and U.S. industry profits, and a

richer picture emerges. Higher Canadian industry profits imply higher Canadian wages, with no

significant variation in this rent sharing across tariff levels. But tariffs do matter for the sharing

of U.S. industry profits, as indicated by the significantly negative coefficient for U.S. industry

profits, along with the significantly positive coefficient on U.S. industry profits interacted with

tariffs. In low-tariff industries higher U.S. industry profits imply significantly lower Canadian

wages, but as tariffs rise this wage pressure diminishes. The implied profits-wage elasticity goes

from ‚Äì0.13 in unprotected sectors to just above zero in the most heavily protected sectors

(crossing zero at the 90th percentile for tariffs).
    Taken together, the estimates in Table 7 are consistent with our earlier finding that higher

U.S. industry profits can put downward pressure on Canadian wages‚Äîbut with the new finding

11 The F test for the sum of the coefficients on U.S. profits and U.S. profits interacted with both U.S. Parent and International
Union equaling zero has p-value < 0.001.
                                                                                                                            22


that higher tariffs can mitigate this pressure. This is broadly plausible, as standard trade theory
shows quite clearly that trade barriers insulate domestic firms from foreign competition. That

tariffs but not transport costs matter might reflect the fact that average transport costs are much

lower: just under 1 percent versus over 7 percent (Table 1), with free trade at zero.

    Robustness checks analogous to Tables 3 and 4 are reported in Table 8 and 9. Our findings

are broadly the same: transport costs don‚Äôt matter, but tariffs do. In Table 8, none of the

interaction terms with transportation costs are significantly different from zero. For tariffs, in

Table 9 all specifications but the fixed-effect specification in column 5 are qualitatively the same

as those in Table 7.

    The final robustness check we report is to verify that the international-organization variables

and the border-barrier variables are not estimating the same underlying effect. Table 10 presents

regression results from including both the foreign-parent or international-union interacted

variables and the interacted border-barrier variables. In all columns, international-organization

interactions are all significantly different from zero, consistent with Tables 2-6.                                 And the

estimates for tariffs and transport costs are consistent with Tables 7-9. Thus, columns 3 and 4 in

Table 10 indicate that profit sharing across borders is conditioned both by organizations and by

trade barriers as well.

    We briefly mention two other unreported robustness checks.                               First, to address possible
concerns about endogeneity (see Section 3c) we estimated an instrumental-variables (IV) model

by instrumenting for U.S. profits with exchange rates. Specifically, for each industry-year we

constructed a trade-weighted multilateral U.S. exchange rate, where all relevant bilateral

exchange rates are weighted by U.S. import shares.12 Exchange rates make good candidate

instruments: they are correlated with profitability (as is commonly discussed in the financial

media), yet are plausibly uncorrelated with the error term in equation (5). Thus, we estimated (5)

using two-stage least squares (2SLS). Our 2SLS results were mixed: the overidentification tests

12 These industry-year exchange rates vary over time due to time-series exchange-rate movements, and also across industries
due to different trading partners. Very similar results were obtained using export shares, as much U.S. trade is intra-industry.
                                                                                                 23


indicated profits are valid instruments, but we obtained very imprecise coefficient estimates due
to poor first-stage regressions. Hausman specification tests failed to reject the null hypothesis of

OLS consistency, so for brevity we have not reported IV estimates.

   Second, our analysis has assumed that rent sharing of industry profits works through

organizational structures of multinational firms and/or international unions at the bargaining-unit

level. We also examined if these organizational structures matter at the industry level, to allow

for the possibility that the industry presence of U.S. parents or unions might transmit U.S. profits

into Canadian wage bargaining. On the corporate side, we constructed the fraction of (2-digit)

industry sales in Canada accounted for by affiliates of U.S. multinationals. On the labor side, we

created the fraction of union employees represented by international unions in each industry.

These industry-level results broadly matched our bargaining-unit findings.

5. Conclusions and Directions For Future Research
   Previous research has established that profits are shared:        industry profits are robustly

correlated with wages. In this paper we have asked whether profits are shared across borders,

i.e., whether rent sharing extends across national borders, conditioned by corporate or labor

organizational ties and/or by trade barriers. To answer this question, we combined wage data

from a panel Canadian manufacturing collective bargaining agreements with data on industry

profits for both Canada and the United States, data on whether each bargaining unit was owned
by a Canadian or U.S. parent and was represented by a domestic or international union, and data

on transportation costs and tariffs. Our main finding is yes, profits are shared across borders:

there are international dimensions of rent sharing that have not been documented before.

   First, international organizations matter. Consistent with earlier studies, there is strong

evidence for rent sharing of Canadian industry profits. However, we found that this rent sharing

is much less pronounced or even negative when a U.S. parent company and/or international

union is involved. Moreover, we found that U.S. industry profits are negatively related to

Canadian wages for domestic companies and unions, but that this effect is much less negative, or

even positive, when a bargaining unit has a U.S. corporate and/or labor parent. This is consistent
                                                                                                                              24


with strong industry profits in the United States placing downward pressure on Canadian wages
because of product-market competition, while at the same time placing upward pressure on

Canadian wages via international rent sharing in the presence of U.S. institutions that import

U.S. conditions into Canadian collective bargaining.

    Second, there is some evidence that border barriers matter as well. We analyzed the extent to

which rent sharing of U.S. profits varies with trade protection. The results were weak for

transportation costs, but higher Canadian tariffs mitigate the extent to which U.S. industry profits

are negatively associated with Canadian wages.

    Our findings raise possible directions for future work. We have offered explanations for our

findings in terms of product-market competition, but we have not tested these explanations

against possible alternatives. It would be ideal to have data on product-market profitability at

different levels that might be relevant to wage setting, above and beyond our industry-level

focus. And it would be interesting to examine whether the international linkages we documented

hold for non-union wage settlements and/or for other countries.

    Although we think these possible directions will be fruitful, we do think our findings for

Canadian bargaining units reveal international aspects of profit sharing not previously

documented. We interpret these findings as evidence of international rent sharing. As such, they

are relevant for work on rent sharing and, more broadly, on how globalization conditions labor-
market outcomes. Research on rent sharing would benefit from a more international perspective;

research on globalization and labor markets would benefit from investigating issues of imperfect

competition and institutions, above and beyond Heckscher-Ohlin considerations.13




13 Our findings may also relate to the international-macro literature on cross-country movements in macro aggregates (see
Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2000, for a survey). It has been documented that Canada and the United States experience common
movements in many macro aggregates. Using nine-variable vector autoregressions on monthly time-series data, Burbidge and
Harrison (1985) find a positive response of Canadian industrial production following shocks to U.S. industrial production. Altonji
and Ham (1990, S231), using annual time-series data across provinces and industries, conclude that U.S. aggregate gross national
product shocks are ‚Äúthe dominant influence on aggregate employment growth in Canada.‚Äù Our findings suggest that micro-level
linkages such as multinational ownership and international unions may underlie these Canadian-U.S. macro co-movements.
