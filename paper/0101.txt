 Introduction and Sunmarv
                                                                                                    C
         This paper deals with the links between the          development    of new drugs,
 and   particularly of innovative new drugs, and the international activities

 of U.S. drug companies. While U.S. drug companies have developed new

production processes--the most notable being the fermentation process for

making penicillin——we concentrate in this paper on new products. Since pro-
                                                                         1
duction costs comprise less than LQ percent of the selling price of drugs

and since the person choosing the drug rarely pays for it,2 growth in company

sales and         profits   comes more from introducing new products than from cutting

costs and         prices   of old products.3

        The main novelty of our        study   is our examination of "innovative" as

contrasted with "imitative" new drugs. Previous studies have generally

focussed on the total number of new drugs produced each year, but since



        1For example, in 1973 materials and production costs were 36 percent

of Merck's sales of $1.1 billion. Marketing and administrative expenses

comprised 29 percent, research and development expenses were 8 percent, and

profits before taxes were 28 percent of sales. Merck g Co. 1973 Annual

Report. Materials arid production costs were 3L percent of Miles' 1973 sales

of $348 miflion. Miles Laboratories 1973 Annual Report. As discussed in

Section III, Merck is a very "innovative" drug company, and Miles is a

ex'y "imitative" drug company.

              physician selects the drugs;       the   government or an   insurance   company

usually pays for           it, at least in the U.S.    and Western Europe.

our' interest       is in the causes and consequences of innovation, we have con-

centrated on the products we have rated as innovative. Section I explains

our criteria for this distinction and presents our enumeration of the innova-

tive new drugs for each of the 22 companies in our sample from 1963 through

1972.

        In Section II we discuss trends in the rate of drug innovation and the

factors influencing those trends. We conclude that while the 1962 changes

in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act did produce an increase in research costs,

there were other influences acting in the same direction, particularly the

exhaustion     of   the 'stock of knowledge previously accumulated over a period

of   years.
        Section III     describes   our   sample   of drug companies arid        characterizes

them    with respect       to their size, research investment,           and   innovativeness.

All   the available measures of irinovativeness, which can be divided into

those measuring inputs and those measuring outputs, are flawed to some

degree. Those we consider indicators of output, such as the ratio of inno—

vative      drug   sales   to total drug   sales,     are   positively   correlated with each
other, and also with measures of the quality of new drugs, such as R&D
expenditures per new drug or sales per new drug introduced. However, they
are   notrelated to the frequently used indicators of input, such as the
ratio of R&D expenditures to sales, and they are negatively related to
what we refer to as measures of R&D efficiency, such as R&D expenditures
er dollar of sales of new drugs.
        Section    1V examines the relation of innovativeness to the foreign
activities of individual firms.            We   conjecture that the more innovative
                                                                                              0
drug companies were less likely to open up new foreign manufacturing
subsidiaries in the 1960's; the regressions reported in Section IV are

consistent with this        conjecture.   Lack    of   data for our   sanple   precludes

our testing a corollary of this conjecture: that the more                 innovative
drug    companies are. more likely to serve foreign markets via exporting
from the U.S. and via licensing.
•   .   In Section .V we analyze, for a sample of 7 new drugs introduced by
tbo companies,        the rate at which use of the drugs      was diffused among
various countries arid the impact of the presence of manufacturing plants
on the rate of diffision. Our results hint that the lag between first introduction
of a new drug and its introduction into a particular country tended to be
shorter      if there were a U.S.-owned manufacturing affiliate in that country

and     if the drug were     an innovative one.

        We   should make   explicit that our results,       by themselves, do     not in-

dicate the economic benefits to either the U.S. or foreign countries of

the     activities of these companies. To estimate such benefits, one would
need to look also at the prices of individual drugs in various markets;
for     example, an "imitative" drug sold at a cheaper price than an "innovativ&'

drug may greatly benefit the consuner)



        1Any   estimate    of such benefits depends on one's values and          cannot,
because      we are   dealing   with new products, be derived from       the   analysis of

formal    welfare     economics. This analysis assumes that           at each point in time
consumers could purchase, perhaps at a very high price, any product. How-
ever, nobody, for example, could purchase penicillin or its equivalent in

the 1920's. "The introduction of new things is more serious. Indeed,

they cannot be introduced into the analysis at all." I.H.D. Little, A

 I. Input and Output Measures of the Flow                 of Innovation
         Any manufacturing firm can be thought of as producing goods of at
 least    two   different   kinds: on the one          hand, a specific industrial commodity,
 and on    the other hand,     a   flow of minor and      major   innovations which eventually

 find their way into the product turned out by the firm or into the produc-

 tion process used for such p'poses. This flow                 of innovations can be
looked at both in terms of the resources its gestation actually absorbs

or, alternatively, in terms of the specific units of output which emerge

from     the   knowledge-creation section of the firm.1



        1The lack of an explicit department engaged in RCD                activities is not

enoughevidence on which to argue that any given firm does not produce any
new knowledge. A great deal of knowledge new to the firm, and subsequent
minor and/or major technological changes at the plant level, emerge either
as   a by—product of production, or as a consequence of technical activities

performed by the engineering sections of the firm which normally receive

names    such as 'Trouble-shooting' or 'Technical assistance to production'
departments. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that a large fraction of
the observed total factor productivity growth of any given plant has to do
precisely       with the application of incremental knowledge coming from            such
sources. See, in this respect: S. 1-lollander, The Sources of Increased

Efficiency. A Study of the Dupont Rayon Plants (Cambridge, 1966; MIT Univer-

sity   Pres3); R. Shishko, "Technological Change Through Product Improvement
in   Aircraft Turbine Engines" (Rand Corp., Monograph 1061,                May 1973); G. E.
Box, "Some General Ccnsiderations in Process Optimization," Journal of Basic

Eng5neerinc,      No. 82    (March 1960);   J.   Katz, Importacion de Tecnologia,

1974).

         Measures of the input into innovation include data on R&D expenditure
                                                                                     C
 or manpower figures on the size of the R&D operation plus      other   knowledge-

 creation    activities performed within the    firm. Output measures of the flow

 of   innovation   in the context of the pharmaceutical industry might be:

 (1) Number of compounds synthesized, (2) Number of new product candidates,

 (3) Patents filed, (4) Written scientific monographs, (5) NDA's (Ne.' Drug

 Applications), (6) IND's (Investigative new drug applications), (7) Sales

 value of new products, (8) Nurthers or sales of pa.rticularly innovative

 products.

       Conceptual and statistical    difficulties in empirical research in this
 field   are: a) Where to draw the line between R&D activities and those

 other knowledge-creation activities also performed by the firm1 and b) How

 to take into account quality changes which obtain with the passage of time?

 The first of these set of problems is associated with input measures of

 innovation,   the second set with output     measures. Let us briefly exanine

• some of these problems.




       1Surveys on contemporary R&D expenditures in the U.S. and in Eupe

• are currently carried out by NSF and OECD respectively. The instruction

 manuals distributed by both agencies indicating what and how to measure as

 R&D expenditt'e are far from being conclusive concerning the so-called

 "Associated Technical Activities" also performed by the firm. See, for

 example,   NSF, a) Research and   Development in Industry (Washington: U.S.

 Government Printing Office, June 1968), in particular p. 125 with the

 instructions for R&D measurement; b) OECD, Proposed Standard Practice

 for Surveys   of R&D, Doc. DAS/PD/62.47, Paris, 1966.
                                                                                     0
                                       —7—




        Besides carrying out explicit R&D activities, manufacturing firms

 also   perform other technical jobs such as: process development arid pilot

plant production, quality control, clinical evaluation, research and develop-

ment carried out with the purpose of assisting other areas of the firm       such
as patenting, medical informnatio, etc. The accounting treatment of expendi-

tures in these activities varies widely among pharmaceutical firms. It

'therefore follows that inter-firm differences in R&D expenditure should be

expected and that such data should be handled in a cautious way. The recent

study by the National Economic Development office (NEDO) on the British

pharmaceutical industry presented valuable information on this respect. It

shows that       . .the majority of clinical evaluation was invariably included
in R&D and the majority of quality contl was excluded."' Such uniform

practice, however, was not found to prevail in relation to process develop-

ment and pilot plant production. "Thus, the only really significant varia-

tion in accounting practices appears to relate to process development and

pilot plant production. .   . exclusion which could possibly lead a company to
understate its R&D expenditure by as much as 15%.t,2

        Moreover, quality considerations are difficult to incorporate when

dealing with input measures of the flow of innovation. Presumably we

could speak of R&D personnel of various different levels and abilities

and about scientists of different calibre, but the economists' tool-box

is still poorly furnished to handle questions of this sort. SurrE'narizing,

though   R&D expenditure data are normally employed a a 'proxy' variable
for   innovative effort,     their potential hazards should be kept in mind.
Inter-firm   differences in accounting practices can he rightly suspected,

and   changes in the   quality of the knowledge-creation process which do take

place   through time    only imperfectly captured.
                       are

       Output measures of the flow of innovation are also far from being
faultless. On the one hand, some firms synthesize all the compounds they
test, while yet other firms buy from third parties a great deal of the
compounds they study. Similarly, a new product brought to the market can
be the result of internal R&D activities, but can also be the outcome of
license, thus not being a true indicator of internal knowledge-creation
processes. On the other hand, quality differentials among             products, patents,

scientific papers, etc., are clearly present, making it a rather               heroic

assi.mption to work with straight counts of these variables as if they were
homogeneous entities.
        Consider briefly the differential quality of some of the various
indicators mentioned before. The number of compounds actually synthesized
by any given firm greatly depends on the approach such a
                                                         firm has towards


           valuable discussion of    this   point in relation to the usefu.inoss
of    patent statistics can be found in Chapter 2 of J. Schmookler's book,

Invention and Economic Growth (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, lg66).

The value of scientific papers as a 'proxy' for the rate of innovation is

examined by R. Evenson and Y.       Kislev,    "Research arid   Productivity   in Wheat

and    Maize" (New Haven: mimeo, 1972); see also Derek de Solla Price,
"Measuriug the Size of Science," Proceedings of the Israeli Academy of

ences, 1969.

R&D    activities. The mcre 'rational' the R&D strategy, i.e., "based on

theoretical biological propositions that certain types of compounds should

be    expected to demonstrate a certain type •of pharmacological activity,"1
the smaller the nurbcr of synthesized corripomds to be expected. Contrariwise,
the more random the screening, the larger the number of compounds actually
handled. Thus, inter-comany differences in research          strategy   qualify the
usefulness of the number        o compounds synthesized by each firm as an adequate
'proxy' for inter—firm differences in innovation. Similarly, and as a con-
sequence of the fact that a great deal of cross—licensing takes place in
this market,      inter-firm   differences in the number of new products brought
to the market might not be a good 'proxy' variable either.
       There were large inter-firm differences in the propensity to patent,
with size and nationality appearing as the principal determinants of these
differences.2 Thus, also the number of patents filed by each company should
be   used in a very cautious way as a 'proxy' for the firms' innovative

              D. Reekie has recently shown that "Continental and particularly
German companies appear to file more patents in Britain than their record

of conmercially successful innovations would have led one to expect." Also

       NDAsu isicns also have problems of their own. A growing rate of
 trition--and what's more, unknown inter-firm differences in the rate of
attrition——Cast       some doubt upon     the use of NDA's    as an   indication of the
actual     innovative effort performed by the firm. Finally,            the number of
 :oduct        candidates, or the number of IND applications, have been singled

out by industry officials as probably the best 'proxy' for the variable

we   want to measure, but such data are not published by pharmaceutical

companies        and are   not available for detailed examination. The FDA-—the

only   government agency with ready access to such information--does not

provide company figures in this respect.2

 differentials can     be captured through chemical evaluation and from                clinical
 or   therapeutic inve3tigation of each specific drug. Whereas in the first

 case the molecular structure of any given drug has to be examined in order

 to decide whether or not such molecular structure has been previously used

by the industry, in the second case judgment has to be passed at the clinical

and therapeutic level, considering for such purposes whether or not the drug

introduced identifiable advances over pre-existing substitutes. We have

attempted to evaluate     innovation through          a selective pharmacologic assessment

of 196 single entity drugs produced by 22 major U.S. firms between 1963 and

1972. The Paul de Haen New Drug Analyses and Nonproprietary Name Index were

used as primary sources for the listing of new drugs marketed in the U.S.
during this ocriod.
       Our sample   consists of the     22   U.S. drug companies that met either of
the   following criteria: (.1) U.S.       drug sales      in   1972 were in excess of

    of    the new drugs (including vaccines, diagnostics, and vitamins)           introduced

    into    the U.S. by U.S. companies between 1963 and 1972. As shown in Table              1-2,

    the new drugs (excluding vaccines, diagnostics, and vitamins) introduced by
    tese 22 companies, as a share of aU new drugs introduced in the U.S., rose

            A "proprietary product" usually does not require a prescription, has a
    brand    name,   and is advertised to the public.1 An "ethical pharmaceutical"
    is promoted primarily to the medical, pharmacy, and allied professions and
    includes both prescription and non-prescription products. One should note
    tht a drug which does not require a prescription in the U.S. may require
    cie    some other countries; conversely, some drugs requiring a prescription
          in

    in the U.S. may not require one in some foreign countries. A "non-proprietary"
    drug, sometimes called a "generic" drug, does not involve a trade name. So

    a prescription drug could be either proprietary or         non-proprietary.      Finally,

    one   must distinguish a "drug" from "cosmetics," "toiletries ,"        and   "medical
    onc urgica1 supplies."
            For our purposes,     we have defined a "drug" as a single chemical entity

    belonging to a chemical class which exerts a       major   pharmacologic action     on
    people (e.g., diuretic, analgesic, ataraxic, antihistamiriic, etc.). We have

excluded      combination products (two or more chemicals), vitamins, vaccines,
and diagnostics.
        The new drugs listed in the de Haen sources have been analyzed to
determine if they are innovative or novel products, or if they are imita-
tive    of   pre-existing entities already marketed. Innovation has been assessed
through      an examination of both the pharmacologic action and the chemical

class or structure of the drug. Thus,         the diuretic ethacrynic acid (Edecrin,
Merck, 1967), a new chemical entity, is        classified as innovative because it
acts    on the kidney differently from   the diuretic chiorothiazide (Diuril,
Merck, 1957) even though it produces the same fundamental result, diuresis.
        Modifications of pre-existing structures (additions or deletions of

chemical     groups), although marketed as    new chemical entities, are iot neces-
sarily considered as innovative by     these criteria. These modifications
often    enhance a drug's pharmacologic action and therapeutic effectiveness

while decreasing undesired side effects. However, the modified structure

is considered imitative of the original drug if it exerts the same basic

phrmaco1ogic effect and is marketed for the same therapeutic purpose.
For   example, cyclothiazide (Anhydron, Lilly, 1963),        although   a new potent

thiazide—type diuretic, is nevertheless similar in its chemical structure

and   pharmacologic   action to chiorothiazide, and    is   therefore regaied as

imitative      by our definition. As another example, two of the most popular
drugs   in   the U.S. and Europe, Librium and Valium    (Roche),1 benzodiazepine



       1This   example is illustrative, as Hoffman-LaRoche is e>:cluded from
our sample because it is a non-U.S. company.



                                                                                       f
                                                                                        C
tranquilizers7 are very similar in chemical structure and have        furidaitentally

the   re   pharmacologic effects. Thus, by the criteria developed here,

 a.liurn, marketed in 1963, does not represent any significant pharmacologic

1—novation     over its antecedent, Librium, which was marketed    in 1960.

       There are some cases, however, in which pharmacologic innovation can

ce chicd by slight modification of a pre-existing drug.            For exariple,

methotrimeprazine (Levoprone, Lederle, 1966) is a drug similar in structure

and effects to other tranquilizers of the henothiazine         class, such as
chlorprorrtazine   (Thorazine, Smith Kline and French, 19514). However, the

analgesic    properties    that are present to a negligible degree in Thorazine

are greatly increased in Levoprome. Therefore, although of the same chemical

c1as,    tc pharmacologic effects of Levoprome are       significantly different

from   earlier phenothiazines to justify its rating as a pharmacologic innova-
tion by our definition.

       It is   therefore   seen that pharmacologic action, as well as cherr.ical

nD.elty, are     evaluated   to determine innovation in pharmaceuticals. Each

drug was assigned1 to one of the following categories:         (1) innovative,

'2) m.tatcs a drug of the same company marketed in the U.S. between 1960

ari. 1972, (3) :.mitates a drug of another company marketed in the U.S. between

196f' arid 197?, (14)   imitates   a drug of the same company marketed in the U.S.

    "chemical novelty," arid McVicker3          has evaluated new drugs for 1960-1969

    in   termsof their "therapeutic advance." As these studies are unpublished,
    we present only a surn'nary comparison of their results with ours for 1963-
    1967. As shown in Table 1—5, we considered 30 of the 82 drugs introduced
    in this period by these firms to be innovative, as compared to 36 for study
    A and 20 for study B. The Chi-square coefficient for our evaluation is
    13.L46   when cc;pared with study A and 29.56 when compared with study B, which
    indicates       that at a significance level of less than ipercent, we can say

    that our evaluation is not independent of each of the other eva1uations.'

II. Trends     in Pharmaceutical Innovation

      Two kinds of observations are      available   for studying drug innovations

and their relation to foreign investment: time series on new products, or

on various types of new products, and cross-sections of pharmaceutical

firms, some of which are active innovators and some of which are responsible

for few, if any, innovations. In this section we discuss the main trends

in the rate of pharmaceutical innovation.

      We   shall concentrate here on three types of new products emerging
from drug firms. They are: a) New Single Chemical Entities, b) Duplicate
Products, and c) Combinations. The first item          iodicates products which are

new   single chemical   agents,   not previously marketed in the United States.
Duplicate products     are drugs which are offered as single chemical entities

and which are already sold by another manufacturer within the U.S. market.

Finally, a co'thination is a preparation consisting of two        or   more   active
ingredients.     lle drug firms also produce such items as New Dosage Forms

(tablets, ampu.ls, solutions, etc.), Biologicals, and       Hospital    Solutions,

our study concentrates upon the three previously mentioned groups of cormr.odi-

ties. New chemical entities and        duplicate   products are classified by Paul

de   Haen and do   not always correspond   to our distinction of innovative and
imitative, as developed in the previous Section.
     Table Il-i. presents information regarding the number of Single Chemical

Entities, Duplicate Products, and Combinations introduced into the U.S.
market during the period 1950_1972.1 Using such data, Chart 1 describes

       he data presented in Table 11-1 and Chart 1 come from
different    numbers of Paul de Hae&s publication, New Products Parade, Annu.31
Review of New Drugs.      We hereby thank Mr. de Haen for letting       us have access
to this valuable information.

in a semi—logarithmic scale, the time path of the cumulated number of new

products in each one of the three above-mentioned categories. The year

1962, in which the U.S. Congress passed the so-called Xefauver-Harris Amend-

ments to the Food, Drug arid    Cosmetic   Act which regulated the introduction

of new pharmaceuticals to the US. market, is distinguished in the chart.

The Amendments significantly changed the regulatory climate underlying the

operation of the pharmaceutical industry, and      they   need to be taken into

account   as one   of the possible determinants o the observed decline     in the
rate   of new product introduction.
       Both Table 11-1 and Chart ]. provide a distinct impression of a 1ong-ter
tailing off in the rate of new product introduction. This trend is certainly
present in all the series, but is more dramatic in Combinations than in
Single Entities. There appears to be a long-term relative shift away from
Combinations. Thus, we can observe both an absolute fall in the rate of
ni product introductions and a change in relative composition within the
aggregate.
       There is another sense in which the aggregate series for new product
introductions   has shown significant changes in    its relative composition.
This   is related to the rate of product innovation in specific therapeutic

classes. In many therapeutic areas in which well established arid useful

agents were already marketed, innovation practically dried up in the 1960's.

Comparing the nurr.ber of new drugs introduced in the U.S. in 1957-1962 with

 963-1967, one finds a marked     decline for nine categories   (antihistamines,

antitussives, aritispasmodics, muscle relaxants/antiparkinson drugs, thiazide-

type diuretics, sulfonamide antibacterials, aritiobesity drugs, corticosteroids,

arid antinau.seants),   a slight decline for tranquilizers and psychostimulants,

                                                                                    e

and no change for antibiotics and cancer cherrtotheraPy
                                                        drugs.1 Thus, the

aggregate fall in new product       introductionS hides a dramatic abandonment
                                                              of efforts in a
of many areas of research and       a gradual concentration

smaller number of fields.

       least two different explanations have been offered for this long-
       At

term decline in the rate of new product introductions. On the one hand,
                             some members of the academic   community   have blamed
industry officials     and

the fall in the rate of product
                                      innovation entirely cn the FDA and the       1962


Amendments.

            "I conclude from these data that:       a) The 1962 Amend-

            inents significantly reduced the flow of new      chemical

            entities and, what is perhaps more interesting, b)

            that all of the observed differences between the pre-

            and post—1962 New Chemical Entities flow
                                                            can be

            attributed to the 1962 AmendmentS."2

On the other hand,     it    has been suggested that the rate of innovation has

       )ther authors have presented essentially the same,        though   less


 extreme, diagnosis of what is going on in the industry.         Company

 officials are particularly       inclined   to take this line of reasoning. See,

                                                                                        •0
ledge that took some time to exploit.
             "Despite all efforts, useful results nowadays are rarer
             and rarer, and some drug houses have to face the problem
             of how   long   it will be possible for them to support their
             research   departments....My first prediction is that, like

             other golden ages, the golden age of drugs will not return,

             and never again will so many new and efficient drugs be-

             come available within such a short period as during the

             fifties and sixties."1

A similar view is expressed by de Haen. "...traditional methods in new

drug development seem to be impeded and less fruitful....we have reached

a temporary plateau of knowledge in new drug development because so much

has been made in the short span of 30 years."2

         More likely than not, both of these views can claim a certain degree

 of explanatory power,1 their relative              significance   /arying   as   between thera-

 peutic classe.2 Both theories would predict and be compatible with: a)

 A prominent escalation of product research and development costs, b) A

 marked lengthening of product development times, and c) An increased level

 of uncertainty in new drug development.3 Let us briefly consider these



 economics profession. As far back as 1930, S. Kuznets developed the idea

 of an eventual exhaustion of an industry's inventive potential-—which in his

 view obtains when the industry's techniques aptroach a certain plateau of

perfection——which in turn leads to a retardation of the rate of technical

progress and, eventually, to a tendency for output to describe an S-shaped

curve    through   time.   He called that the Law of Industrial Growth. See, S.

Kuznets, Secular 4overents          in Production and Prices (Boston: Houghton
Mifflin,    1930). The same causal nechanism has been later re—discovered by

W.E.G. Salter in his Productivity arid Technical             Change (Cambridge: Cambridge
University    Press, 1960).

     1See Martin Neil Baily, "Research and Development Costs and Returns:

The U.S. Pharmaceutical Industry," Journal             of Political    Economy, Vol. 80

(January/February 1972), p. 77.

            one uses supply and demand analysis, one could say the FDA regulations

impose "a tax" on the development of new drugs and the.exhaustjori of knowledge

reflects    an upward shift      in the supply curve. Increased expenditures on
medical care   suggest     an   upward shift in the demand for all drugs. For a
supply   and demand analysis, ignoring "taxes,"           see   N. Rosenberg, "Science,

Invention and Economic Growth," Economic Journal, 84 (March l97L),                   pp.   90-108.

                                                                                                     I

three   aspects, which pretty much reflect the contemporary trends underlying

the innovative process of the pharmaceutical industry.

        Consider first research and development costs. The available evidence

indicates that these have been rocketing upwards at the incredible pace of

                                                        new chemical entity
about 30 percent per annum. "The industry was getting a

in the 1950's for 1.5 million dollars of R&D. Today it is costing between

          20 $US million and   even   more."1 Increases in R&D costs have     not
3.0 and

resulted exclusively from increased          research 'equirements imposed under the

1962    airendnents. From 1951 to 1962 research and development        costs per single

ne chemical entity grew at the rapid pace of 20 percent per annum. Research
and development in drugs is becoming an          increcing1yexpensive propociticn

through    time   part-J-y because science and research today is more rigorous than
a   decade   (or two) ago.2 It 5s     not   clear how we can isolate how much of the


the lengthening of the development times result from FDA increased require-
ments prior to approval. Though this is c1dr1y so. there ic nothing to
preclude the possibility that such features also result from research gradu-
au)     shifting   towards more complex     an time consuming therapeutic fields

as a consequence of the exhaustion of the profit potential (and intellectual
attraction) of more conventional therapeutic areas. Such an effect might
be present quite independently of increased regulatory measures.

increased      costs in new drug development is due to a         more advanced    (and more

expensive) knowledge-creation process and how much               of   it is a consequence

of imposed new standards by the FDA.

       There   are indications     that rising U.S. costs of drug development and

declining rates of innovation are not solely a consequence of changes in

FDA regulations, since the same phenomena have been noted in Europe, which

is   not directly      affected by such regulations. After studying the British

case, Cooper finds that:

            "Since 1951 a six-fold increase in expenditure has

            yielded     half as many drugs per     unit expenditure (This

            statement     applies to the U.S. case). This has been
            blamed on     the   FDA and its slowness in giving clearance
            to new drugs, but the findings of the last chapter, and
            the fact that this tendency is certainly equally true
            throughout Europe, cast some doubt on          the   claim that
            this is the sole reason. It          is probably   that the world
            awaits     the next major therapeutic advances which are
            likely     to be in the cancer or cardio-vascu.lar fields."1

       The   European scene in general shows pretty much a similar trend. Data
recently published by Paul de Hacn indicate that: "Marketing of newly
synthesized drugs in England, France, Germany and Italy has declined over
an   eleven-year period. For the period 1960-1965 marketing of 521 drugs

has been recorded, and for the period 1966-1971 only 3 drugs have been

counted."1 The       European trend receives independent confirmation from a
study   which found a drop in the number of new discoveries through the
1960's.2
       At least four important consequences follow from the rapidly increasing
research     and development costs demanded for new drug      introduction.    First,
fewer firms are      now able to   maintain their innovative effort. Whereas 89

companies introduced new pharmaceutical products in 1963, only 33
in   l972. Second, the number of research and development projects            effectively
pursued by any      given company has tended to fall.4 Third, research aimed at

"me too" drugs has significantly declined, as previous evidence (in Table

11-1)    on the introduction of Duplicate Products has already shown. Finally,

R&D resources are         gradually   being reallocated away from the U.S. and brought

into operation elsewhere, particularly in the UK, France, Germany and Italy.1

        The available evidence indicates an upward trend in drug deveLpment

times. At the end of the 1950's, the time span from the selection of                   a
product candidate to the filing for regulatory approval was estimated at
about    two   years. By the middle 1960's, this same period had gone up to
about four years, and        during the early 1970's, industry officials already

spoke    of   seven to eight years.2

        Finally, not only did R&D costs and development time increase during

the last decade, but the uncertainties and            risks   underlying   new drug de-
velopment rose      pan    passu with the former two. The attrition rate of ccpour.ds
enteringthe development process, i.e.,             having passed the filing     of   an IND

(investigational new drug application) and entering into clinical trials,

is    frequently used by the industry as an indicator for risk and uncertainty.
The evidence shows that the attrition rate has been going up or, in other
words, that a growing number of compounds are falling by the way somewhere

       2The evidence in this respect comes from L. H. Sarett, op. cit.

       3H. A. Clymer in his paper, "The Changing Costs and Risks of Pharma-

ceutica.]. Innovation," OD._cit., gives statistical information concerning the

rate of attrition. Whereas in 1965, 32% of the IND filed during that same

      Sunarizing, we    can say that both the        cost and   timc   of new drug develop-

ment are   rapidly increasing through time and so also are the uncertainties
and   risks which underlie the process of innovation in this area of manufac-
turing. Industrial firms presumably react in different ways to these struc-
tural trends. Some of them might decide to drop the innovitive race alto-
gether. Yet others might try to concentrate on fewer research projects.
While some companies will probably increase their efforts at the marketing
end of the spectrum, reducing their cormnitments to basic research, other
companies will do just the opposite and invest more heavily in more basic
research.1      Some companies might try     to   compensate for their inability to

gri thxvugh new product introductions in the U.S. market by giving priority

to foreign markets, or to industrial diversification. One specifip aspect

of these behavioral differences is to he explored later on in Section IV

of this paper, where :e shall try       to   explain the number of foreign subsidi-

arics opened up by each drug company during the l960', using the relative

quality of the firm's portfolio of new products as an independent variable.



°r had been terminated, &42% of these same filings had been terminated by
 h nd ef 19, ad 53% by the end of 1968. "We have taken a look at the

SKF record of IND's      filed during   the last five years and find            that 70%

never reached the NDA stage. It is too early            to know the      exact fate of

those still active. However, my     guess      would be that only about one in ten

of those that started will reach the market," p. 120.

       3There   are clear indications   that some     of   these trends are      very   much

among us   already.    Hoffman-LaRochc, Lilly, and         Zierck have   in   recent   years

iii. Characteristics of     U.S. Drug Firms
                                                                     companies.
      As discussed in Section I, our sample consists of 22 U.S. drug
The main characteristics of these 22 companies are described in Table 111-1.

We use as a measure of company size in this industry total U.S. drug sales.

Total U.S. sales of the parent company are included on the possibility that

investment behavior is related to the size of the firm as a whole. The

numbers   of R&D personnel ir   laboratoriesdevoted to pharmaceutical research

and   estimated   R&D expenditures for pharmaceutical research are measures of
research input, while numbers and     sales    of new drugs, single entity drugs,
and   innovative   drugs are measures of R&D output. Promotional expenses are
included   as a possible alternative or supplement to R&D investment as a

source of sales.

       Our use of 1972 sales of new or innovative drugs might be thought to

bias this measre against companies that developed drugs early in our period,

if the use of these drugs had run its course by 1972. Table 111-2 tests

this possibility by comparing 1972 sales for drugs introduced at different

 dates. If there is any bias, rather than only chance variation or the

 results of a rise in the cost of successful innovation, it seems to be in

 the opposite direction. It is the earliest years' innovations that may be

 disproportionately represented in 1972 sales.        Perhaps the most recent innova-

 tions had not yet reached their    peaks in sales in    1972 and the innovativeness

 of recently successful ccmpanie5 may therefore be understated.

personnel per dollar of total drug sales are           indicators      of R&D effort.

R&D expenditures and personnel per new or innovative drug introduced can

be    thought of a indicators     of the investment in each new drug, and thus

possibly   of the quality of the companies' innovations. Ratios of new or
innovative drug sales to      total drug sales, of innovative to total new drug
sales,   or of nubers of single entity or        innovative drugs to total new drugs
introduced are all indicators of the output from R&D input. The two other
measures, R&D expenditures and personnel per dollar of new drug sales, are,
possibly, indicators of the efficiency of the R&D effort, or the extent to
which it is aimed at objectives other than innovation or riew.drug production.
       We refer to these as indicators because they are              mostly imperfect

proxies for the characteristics they are         suoposed to measure. The invest-
ment per drug   arid   per dollar of drug sales should        be measured by relating

the input of R&D to the particular drugs produced by that input, or at

least to the drugs produced by inputs preceding their introduction.                 Our

output   measures relate to 196 3-72 or to 1972 alone while            our input   data are

for   single years, 1969 and     1971.    The relevant inputs for some of these

outputs may have     been made   in the early 1960's, and       in   any case the outputs

•are not the product of single year's input. The R&D data should refer to

ethical drugs   only,    but we were not able to exclude inputs for proprietary

drugs. The R&D expenditure data, in fact, refer to whole companies, rather

than to pharmaceutical portions of them, and          we had   to assume    that the
division   of expenditures between drugs and other products was the same as

the division of R&D personnel.

       Some indication of the relationships among these indicators is given

by   Table III—4 which shows     the   simple correlations between each pair.
Those we describe above as relating to output from R&D are positively
correlated with each other, although not closely in all cases. The output
measures are not related in any clear way to the indicators of
                                                               research
effort. R&D expenditures and           personnel    per new drug   introduced,   which we

called      an indicator   of the quality of new drugs, are positively related to
the    output indicators. On the other hand, R&D expenditures and                personnel

per dollar     of new drug    sales   are 'negatively   related to the quality and

output indicators, a result which suggests that there may be an efficiency

factor involved. High R&D per new drug is associated with high sales per

new drug and with high shares of new drugs in total sales and innovative

drugs    in new drug   sales,   or, in   other words, with success in innovation.

                                                                                     of new
High R&D per dollar of new drug sales is associated with low shares

or    innovative drugs, which we might interpret as lack of success in innova-
tion    or an indication that for        these companies R&D is not devoted to

innovation.

        From the data in Table 111-3 we can judge whether the companies

 Into natural groupings which may reflect different research strategies.

We have used the ratio of sales of innovative drugs, by our definition, to

sales of all drugs in 1972 as o.ir most logical indicator of innovativefless,

 and   have   separated the firms, by this criterion, into four most             innovative,
 six   of   medium innovativeness, and      eight   least innovative. Table 111-5 shows

 the average characteristics of these three groups with respect to all the




                                                                                               I.

           With one exception, the ratio of single entities to all new drugs,

      the indicators we describe as measuring innovativeness, and the average

      ranking of these indicators, vary appropriately with our preferred measure.

*     The firms that are most innovative by that standard are innovative by the

      other standards also. The indicators of R&D effort, on the other hand,

      show very little relation to the production of innovative drugs. The drug

      quality measures, also with one exception, are positively related to innova-

      tiveness, as is efficiency. That is, the least innovative cc*panies spent

      the most per dollar of new drug sales. Size of firm varied directly with

      innovativeness, quality of new drugs introduced, and R&D efficiency.

           Of course, these figures and    the    description of the companies is based

      on the assumption that R&D has as its only purpose the development of new

      or innovative drugs. Since the firms may have other objectives of R&D in

      mind (safety, quality, dosage reduction, process improvements, development

      of non-prescription drugs), what appears here as inefficiency or lack of

      innovativeness may really reflect a smaller interest in innovation and a

      concentration on other objectives.

IV. Impact of New Drugs on Foreign Investment
       As an innovative drug for a rare disease may be less important to a
company than an innovative drug for a common disease, w       weight each drug

by its 1972 sales in the U.S. Lack of data precludes our looking at sales
in the U.S. prior to 1972. Although cons'ptior. of specific drugs and types

of drugs differs considerably among countries of      similar cliTr.ate and per
capita income,1 lack of data also precludes our looking at foreign sales
of specific drugs.
       The empirical work on multinational firms   .haz stressed differences
among industries. Vernon, for example, allocated his 187 multinational

firms among 23 industries and found that    their importance in the 1966 sales
of the entire industry ranged from    85 percent (motor vehicles and equipment)

to    4 percent (pDirting and publishing); the 15 multinational drug firms in
his   sample acounted for 77 percent of all sales in 1966 by U.S. drug com-
panies.2 He ex:ilained these differences by arguing that in comparison with
other firms the multinational firms are "of extraordinary size and high
profitability, corritted to activities that involve the relatively       heavy

use of skilled manpower and of   advertising outlays."3 The pharmaceutical



       1Cooper compared the prices of 1,042 drugs sold in 1964 in     Great Britain
.d at least one of the following: Germany, Italy, France, and Spain; only
 50 drugs were sold in all five countries. Antibiotics accounted for 23 per-
cent of pharmacy    drug sales in Great Britain in   1964, compared to 15 percent
in    the U.S., 8 percent in France, and 4 percent in Germany. Michael H. Cooper,

industry spends     a great deal on both R&D and     advertising.    R&D expenditures

fluctuated between seven and       nine   percent of the value of pharmaceutical

shipments in the 1960's,1 compared with two percent of sales for the average

firm in Vernon's group of 187 multinationals. Advertising expenditures in

the U.S. drug companies, as shown in column (5) of Table 111-1, are well

above the three percent of sales of Vernon's 187 multinational firms.

       Will these three   variables2——size,      emphasis on research, and   emphasis
on advertising-—explain differences in foreign investment within the drug

industry? Table 111-1 shows total corporate sales in 1272, total U.S. drug

sales. in 1972, U.S. sales in 1972 of innovative drugs, U.S. sales in 1972

       2Many of these companies also sell "proprietary drugs," and many of them

also   sell   items other than drugs. So we cannot derive profit data on the

drugs in our list from        published   data on company profits. The advertising

data are   mainly   for ethical pharmaceuticals. Some of the R&D personnel may

be for products other than the drugs we are considering. There is also the

problem wit'    profit data that reported profit rates may not be .relevant for
nanagerI      decisions, since current accounting practice treats expenditures

on research arid    development   as a current expense rather than as an investment.

See T. R. Stauffer, "Profitability in a Discovery-Intensive Industry: Phar-

maceuticals," (paper read at the Conference on Drug Development and Marketing,

The American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, Washington,

July 197+).

       3Drug sales are   to   drug stores and civilian hospitals and exclude vitamins

and   non-prescription   drugs; these latter two     categories   are included in Table I-i.

of   new drugs,    the   number of research and development (RED) personnel per

million   dollars of U.S. drag sales, and promotion expensez as a percentage
of U.S. drug sales.

       Preliminary       analysis showed that the Latin American experience was so

different from        that   of the rest of the world that one obtained no signifi-

cant   results    by using combined data. One might expect that result by looking

at Table IV-l. Latin America has 35 percent of the manufacturing                subsidi-

aries and has more than all of Europe, even though Western Europe               has a

higher per capita income and a larger population.1 So throughout the regres-

sion analysis we report results separately for Latin America and for the

rest of the world.

       It is conceivable that total corporate sales might influence a drug

company's propensity to establish foreign drug plants. For example,

Lederle and A.           Robins each had about $100 million of U.S. drug sales

in 1972, but Lederle is part          of   American Cyanarnid, which had worldwide

sales in 1972 of $l.L billion. Lederle may acquire from its parent cor-

poration knowledge about foreign investment opportunities.

       Table    IV-2 shows the ordinary least squares regressions in which the
dependent      variable is the number of non-Latin American countries2 with


        11n 1970 Latin America had about 280 million persons and             Western

Europe had about 371 million persons. Per capita income in              the    average
Latin American country was about one-fourth that of Western Europe. Data

many firms, we do not present logarithmic regressiorisffor Latin America.

      Column   (1) of   Tables IV-6 through IV-2   uses as   independent variables

the   two measures   of firm   size,   the importance of RgD, and the importance
of promotional expenses. Again none of the equations is significant.
     Column (2) of Tables IV-6 through IV-8 uses the two measures of firm
size and the importance of new drugs; column (3) uses the two measures of

firm size and the importance of innovative drugs. Again none           of   the Latin

American regressions is significant. The logarithmic           non-Latin American
regression is significant, and firm size as measured by 1972 U.S. drug

sales is significant.

      Concentrating only on non-Latin America, we consider columns (Li-) and

(5) of Tale.s IV-6 and IV-8. In terms of R2, the logarithmic equations

are superior arid are both significant at the 1 percent level. The loga-

rithmic regression using the share of innovative drugs is somewhat superior

to the one using the share of new drugs--column (5) as compared to column

(k) of Table IV-8--in terms of            (.52 versus .e2). Throughout the analysis

the coefficients for the importance of new drugs arid the importance of

innovative drugs have been negative, but their significance levels have not

leen overwhelming. In the regressions shown in column (5) of Table IV-8,

the coefficients of the independent variables are different from zero at

the following levels of significance: size of firm—-i percent, importance

of innovative drugs--15 percent, importance        of   antibiatics—-9 percent.

With this sample size, the large degree of multicollinearity (see Table IV-9)

makes it   difficult    to obtain   significant T-ratios for all   the independent

variables.

           In   conclusion, the total nuiber of non-Latin American countries with

 manufacturing plants            in   1970 is positively related to the size of the

 firm     as measured by J.S. drug sa2.es.(Tab1IV-. The number ofiion-Latin
 knerican  countries with manufacturing plants first eztablished in the 1960's
 is positively related to the size of the firm as measured by U.S. drug sales
 in l972 and the relative importance of antibiotics' to the finn and is nega-
 tivaly     related to     th relative importance of innovative drugs to the firm
 (Table     IV-8). We conjecture that innovative firms are more               able   to   serve
 these foreign         markets via exporting from the                               1 unrcr-
                                                              U.S. or via 1:.censing;   -


tunately, we do         not have data on exports or licensing income for all the
firms in our        sample and so cannot test this part of the hypothesis.

        Within Latin America neither the total number of countries with manu-

facturing plants in i970 nor the number of countries with plants first estab-

1.ished     in the 1960's is related to any          of    the variables we measured (Tables
IV—3, IV-5, and         IV-7).        Noting that in the   1960's 78   percent of these new
plants     were established outside Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico,              we feel that

V.     Diffusion of Individual Drugs

       Table    V-i shows for seven new drugs the         average lag between the first

sale and the sale in each major world market.1 One should remember that
the first sale, as shown in column         (1),     did not always take place in the
U.S.     The extremely snail size of the sample makes it          difficult to control
for    the company, the type of drug, and         the   calendar date, and   so   we use    the
data to state three conjectures rather than             to draw conclusions:
        (1)   the time lag for the diffusion of drugs has fallen over time in

rich countries and shows no trend in developing countries;

        (2) as between rich countries and developing countries, there               is   not

much difference in the rate of diffusion;

       (3) company B diffused its sole innovative drug more rapidly than                   its
three imitative drugs.

       To what extent does the presence of a foreign manufacturing plant

affect    the speed with which a new drug is introduced in          foreign countries?

We   conjecture that the lag     (in   years) between the date of first introduction
of a new drug and     its   introduction into countr,r x CL1) depends on whether
there is a manufacturing plant in country x CM), on whether country x is a
rich country     or a developing country2         CR), and on whether the drug is

innovative or imitative (I). The three independent variables are durry
variables as follows:

        M = 1 if       manufacturing plant in     country         x at time drug introduced
                  in   country   x and zero if no plant
        R = 1 if       x is a rich country and        zero       if x is a developing country
        I       1 if drug   is imitative arid    zero       if   innovative.

The least        squares regression, for n =          48,   is:

            =   1.69   —   .91 M + .30     R+ .52 I                            =   .10

    While neither the overall regression nor any                       of   the individual vari-

ables   is significant at even the 10 percent level, the regression is con-

sistent with the hypotheses that the presence of a manufacturing plant

increases the speed with which a drug                 is    diffused around the world and that

innovative drugs are diffused more rapidly than imitative drugs.
