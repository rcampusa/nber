This paper presents a procedure for estimating and forecasting disease scenarios for COVID-19
using a structural SIR model of the pandemic. Our procedure combines the flexibility of
noteworthy reduced-form approaches for estimating the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic
to date with the benefits of a simple SIR structural model for interpreting these estimates and
constructing forecast and counterfactual scenarios. We present forecast scenarios for a
devastating second wave of the pandemic as well as for a long and slow continuation of current
levels of infections and daily deaths. In our counterfactual scenarios, we find that there is no clear
answer to the question of whether earlier mitigation measures would have reduced the long run
cumulative death toll from this disease. In some cases, we find that it would have, but in other
cases, we find the opposite — earlier mitigation would have led to a higher long-run death toll.

1    Introduction

This paper presents a procedure for estimating and forecasting disease scenarios for
COVID-19 using a simple structural SIR model of the pandemic. An SIR model
is a Markov model of the spread of a pandemic in a population in which the total
population is divided into categories of being susceptible to the disease (S), actively
infected with the disease (I), recovered and no longer contagious (R), or dead (D).
How a pandemic plays out over time is determined by the transition rates at which
people move between these states.

   Our procedure for estimating this SIR model and constructing forecasts combines
the flexibility of noteworthy reduced-form approaches for estimating the progres-
sion of the COVID-19 pandemic with the benefits of a simple structural model for
interpreting these estimates and constructing scenarios for the development of the
pandemic going forward. We implement our method to estimate the model using data
on deaths for large states and Census regions of the United States and for a number
of additional countries. We then use the estimated model to conduct counterfactuals
studying how the pandemic would have progressed under alternative scenarios for
mitigating the transmission of the disease and to construct forecasts under various
scenarios for the transmission of the disease going forward.

  Our procedure for estimating the SIR model and using it for counterfactuals and
forecasting has three steps.

   In step 1, for each geographic region that we consider, we estimate an empirical
specification for cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 observed between an initial
date t0 at which cumulative deaths reaches a threshold of 50 and the present. The
specific empirical specification we consider models the data on daily deaths in the
region as derived from a mixture of Weibull functions. This specification allows for a
very flexible model of the observed data on cumulative deaths, daily deaths, and the
change in daily deaths over time (corresponding to the first and second derivatives
of cumulative deaths with respect to time).


                                          1
   Conceptually, the estimation conducted in this first step is similar to the widely
cited empirical model for cumulative deaths developed by researchers at the Institute
for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington.1 See
also Linton (2020)2 for a similar reduced-form approach to modeling the evolution of
cases and deaths over time. Where we differ from these reduced-form approaches to
estimation and forecasting is in how we then use a structural SIR model to interpret
this empirical model of observed deaths due to COVID and to develop counterfactual
scenarios and scenarios for forecasting the progression of the disease in the next two
steps.

   In step 2, we use the best available information to choose parameters for the fatality
rate (the fraction of active infections that end in death) and the recovery rate (the
rate per unit time at which people who are actively infected stop being infectious)
of COVID-19, or a range for these parameters to be considered. Given these fatality
and recovery rates, we then use the equations of the SIR model to recover the time
paths of the distribution of the population across states S(t), I(t), R(t), D(t) and the
time path of the effective reproduction number of the disease (the ratio of the rate
at which actively infected people spread the infection to the recovery rate) between
the initial date t0 and the present for which the model fits exactly the empirical
specification for deaths from the initial date t0 to the present estimated in step 1.
Note that our estimates in this step of the evolution of the transmission rate of the
disease over time in different geographies do not use any additional ex-ante structural
assumptions beyond those imposed in our empirical estimates in step 1 and by the
basic assumptions of the SIR model.

   In this way, in step 2, we use the SIR model to give a structural interpretation of
the empirical specification for the data on deaths estimated in step 1 in terms of a
full model of the progression of the pandemic. Not only do we uncover an estimate
of the current distribution of the population across states S, I, R and D, but also we

can use the model to decompose the evolution over time of the effective reproduction
number of the disease in each geographic region into a component due to changes
in the transmission rate of the disease (due to changes in behavior or mitigation
efforts) and a component due to changes in the population of agents that continue
to be susceptible to the disease.

   In step 3, we use our structural model to address questions about future scenarios
for the evolution of the pandemic and to conduct counterfactual exercises regarding
how the pandemic would have progressed in a region if the transmission rate of
the disease in that region had followed a different path due to different timing and
severity of disease mitigation efforts. We construct forecast scenarios for the evolution
of the pandemic going forward from the present date by positing alternative paths
for the evolution of the transmission rate of the disease going forward from the
present date and solving the SIR model starting from the current distribution of
the population across states S, I, R and D estimated in step 2. We construct
counterfactual scenarios for the evolution of the pandemic by considering alternative
paths for the transmission rate of the disease both historically (corresponding to
alternative initial timing of mitigation efforts) and going forward and solving the
SIR model starting from the initial distribution of the population across states at
date t0 . In this regard, our forecast and counterfactual scenarios are based on a
structural disease model as is done by some leading epidemiological models.3 We see
the transparency of our model estimation approach as one of its key advantages in
helping the reader interpret our forecast and counterfactual results.

  We apply this procedure to estimate our SIR model and to construct forecast and
counterfactual scenarios for ten large U.S. states and nine U.S. Census Regions as
well as a number of other countries.

  We model the patterns of daily deaths with a mixture of Weibull functions. We

for a description of the forecasting project at Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health us-
ing a structural SEIR model that estimates the impact of mitigation measures on the normalized
transmission rate.

                                              3
use the Bayesian procedure to fit these functions to daily deaths for each state or
Census region or country. The residual term in this nonlinear regression follows a
Markov-switching process with multiple regimes to capture large spikes of deaths as
random events in one regime and small death fluctuations in another regime. The
number of Weibull functions needed to fit death data is determined by the marginal
data density (the marginal likelihood).

  The Bayesian procedure allows us to characterize the uncertainty about the pa-
rameters of Weibull functions by simulating random draws of all the parameters in an
estimated mixture of Weibull functions from the posterior distribution. We feed each
posterior draw of these parameters into our SIR model and solve for paths of all the
SIR model variables such as the transmission rate and the fraction still susceptible
within the sample as well as out of the sample. We then generate the posterior distri-
butions of these model variables, which are used to produce probability (uncertainty)
bands of various variables both in and out of sample.

  As of the end of May, 2020, our key findings can be summarized as follows.

   First, across almost all regions and countries that we consider, the growth of the
pandemic as measured by its effective reproduction number has fallen dramatically
from the initial date at which cumulative deaths reached 50 and the present. In many
cases, we see declines of the effective reproduction number from levels well above 3
to levels well below 1. This rapid decline in the effective reproduction number of
the disease seen in the regions that we consider accounts for the observation that
infections and deaths have not reached the levels that were forecast by some in mid
March. At the same time, we find that the estimated fraction of the population
that remains susceptible to the disease is very high in almost all regions and the
fraction of the population that is actively infected, while not extraordinarily high, is
substantially larger than it was in early March.

   Second, we find that in most regions and countries that we consider, the current
levels of susceptible and infected agents are both sufficiently large to trigger the
rapid emergence of a very large second wave of the pandemic if the relaxation of


                                           4
mitigation measures leads to transmission rate of the disease to return to levels seen
in early April (consistent with an effective reproduction number close to 2). Under
this scenario, the pandemic would progress very quickly through the population and
would extinguish itself in 90-100 days. Under this scenario, daily deaths would rise
to very high levels over the next few months — much higher levels than have been
seen in the United States to date, even in New York City. This scenario corresponds
to a devastating but short pandemic.

  In contrast, if disease mitigation efforts going forward are successful in constraining
the transmission of the disease to levels similar to those seen in late April (consistent
with an effective reproduction number close to 1.3), then the number of infections
and daily deaths would remain roughly constant or grow only slowly across most
regions for many months going forward. In many regions, under this second scenario,
the cumulative burden of the disease in terms of infections and deaths would be
substantially reduced, but the pandemic would drag on for a long time.

   Third, in our counterfactual exercises, we find no consistent pattern across regions
regarding the answer to the question of whether earlier or later mitigation efforts
would have reduced the cumulative death toll from the disease. The answer to this
question regarding the impact of changes in the timing of mitigation on cumulative
deaths depends on the data for each region and on the assumed scenario for the
transmission of the disease going forward from the present date. We illustrate this
finding with a focus on our estimates for Pennsylvania. We consider counterfactual
scenarios under which the decline in the transmission rate of the disease estimated in
these locations started seven days later than is estimated. We show that under one
scenario, this counterfactual timing of the mitigation of the disease leads to a large
increase in long-run cumulative deaths and in another scenario to a large decrease in
long-run cumulative deaths. We give an intuitive explanation for this finding in terms
of the key role played by the fraction of the infected population at the moment when
the population reaches herd immunity in shaping the long-run cumulative deaths
from the disease in an SIR model as noted in Toda (2020) and Rachel (2020).



                                           5
   To implement our estimation procedure, we have to obtain estimates of the fatality
and recovery rates for COVID-19 from outside sources. In particular, the first two
steps of our estimation procedure highlight the problem of identifying the fatality and
recovery rates of the disease from time series data on deaths alone discussed in Atke-
son (2020), Stock (2020), Korolev (2020), and Lourenco et al. (2020). Specifically,
we obtain the following lack-of-identification result: given any empirical specifica-
tion for data on cumulative deaths that is strictly increasing and twice differentiable,
then, for a large set of parameters for the fatality and recovery rates of the disease,
there exists a path for the transmission rate of the disease over time and an initial
distribution of the population across states (at the initial date t0 ) for which the SIR
model with these parameters reproduces this specification for the data on deaths
exactly. The only restrictions on the set of fatality and recovery rates implied by the
death data are that the fractions of recovered and infected agents cannot exceed one
and that the effective reproduction number can never be negative.4

  Our procedure in step 2 for recovering an estimate of the evolution of the effective
reproduction number over time from the empirical specification for deaths estimated
in step 1 is related to widely cited methods for using data on the evolution of the
number of active infections or deaths over time to estimate the effective reproduction
number of a disease developed in Wallinga and Teunis (2004), Wallinga and Lipsitch
(2006), Cori et al. (2013), and Chowell et al. (2007). Under these methodologies,
the effective reproduction number of a disease at a point in time is obtained from
an estimate of the growth rate of active infections at that point in time and of the
recovery rate of the disease.5 Under the assumption of a constant fatality rate, our
SIR model implies that one can infer the growth rate of active infections from the
growth rate of new deaths. Our empirical specification of daily deaths as following
a mixture of Weibull functions with regime-switching errors allows us a very flexible

   4
     These restrictions put lower bounds on the fatality rate and on the recovery rate.
   5
     Our simple SIR model imposes an exponential distribution of recovery times. More generally,
the length of time over which an infected person is contagious may follow some other distribution
and then one must also estimate the distribution of serial intervals of the disease. See https:
//staff.math.su.se/hoehle/blog/2020/04/15/effectiveR0.html for a discussion.

model for modeling both the first and second derivatives of cumulative deaths while
also allowing us to deal econometrically with the fact that the observed data on
daily deaths is subject to a great deal of noise. We see the fact that we can construct
Bayesian uncertainty bands for our estimates as one of the primary advantages of
our specific empirical specification.

   Our work is related to Fernandez-Villaverde and Jones (2020), who also use the
death data to estimate a similar structural model. Both papers address some common
identification issues related to the fatality and recovery rates. Our paper, however,
differs from their work in several important respects. First, we use the full Bayesian
procedure to characterize the uncertainty of death patterns. This approach enables
us to provide probability bands of all the SIR model variables in and out of the
sample. Second, we focus on the issue of how earlier or later mitigation measures
would have impacted the total death toll from the disease.6 Our estimation shows
a considerable degree of heterogeneity in death impacts across geographic regions.
Third, we provide a critical analysis of how such heterogeneous results are related
to what we call “the IS curve,” which is the phase diagram showing the relationship
between the fractions of the population actively infected and still susceptible as
implied by the structural model. Our estimation reveals rich model dynamics as well
as complex IS relationships across geographic regions as well as forecast scenarios,
an empirical finding that is absent in the literature.

  This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present the equations of a basic
SIR model and discuss the sources of data used to choose the disease parameters
governing the recovery rate and fatality rate of the disease. In section 3, we present
our procedure for matching the SIR model to empirical estimates of cumulative
deaths outlined as step 2 of our procedure. This presentation is kept general as it can
be applied to any strictly increasing and twice differentiable empirical specification
for cumulative deaths. We contrast our specification to that used by the IHME

specification for the deaths data. In section 5, we report our main findings. In section
6, we conclude.



2      A Basic SIR Model:

The SIR model we use is as follows.

   The population is set to N . At each moment of time, the population is divided into
four categories (states) that sum to the total population. These states are susceptible
S, infected I, resistant R , and dead D. Agents that are susceptible are at risk of
getting the disease. Agents that are infected are contagious and may pass it on to
others through some form of interaction with susceptible agents. Agents that are
resistant are not at risk of getting the disease, either because they have immunity
built up from a vaccine or from previous experience with this or similar diseases.
Likewise, those who have died from the disease are no longer at risk of getting the
disease. In this specification of the model, we assume that immunity is permanent
so that being resistant R or dead D is an absorbing state. We normalize the total
population N = 1, so all results regarding S, I, R and D should be interpreted as
fractions of the relevant population.

   The initial distribution of the population across these states at time t = 0 is given
by S(0) > 0, I(0) > 0, R(0) ≥ 0 and D(0) ≥ 0. For a new disease such as COVID-19,
we assume that all agents are at risk of getting the disease, so that R(0) = D(0) = 0,
S(0) is very close to one, and I(0) is a small number corresponding either to the
initial cases of the disease transmitted to humans from some animal source (as in
Wuhan) or introduced into a country or other local geography through travel.

    These fractions of the population evolve over time as follows

                                                 S(t)
                            dS(t)/dt = −β(t)            I(t)
                                               1 − D(t)


                                           8
                                            S(t)
                        dI(t)/dt = β(t)            I(t) − γI(t)
                                          1 − D(t)
                              dR(t)/dt = (1 − ν)γI(t)

                                 dD(t)/dt = νγI(t)

Since all of the parameters in these equations are positive, agents flow only in one
direction, from the state S to the state I and then to state R or D.

  We treat the evolution of the population as deterministic. This may be appropriate
once the disease has infected a large number of individuals, but at the early stage
of a pandemic with a small number of infected agents, it is more appropriate to
think of the evolution of the number of infected agents as stochastic because of
the small number of these agents. We abstract from that issue here, but it is of
substantive importance if one wishes to model the dynamics of the pandemic early
on or contemplates the possibility of completely eliminating the disease (driving
I(t) from a positive number to zero). In light of our use of a deterministic model,
we focus our estimation on relatively large geographic regions and we model the
pandemic starting from an initial date t0 at which point a threshold number of 50
cumulative deaths have occurred. We then apply the model under the presumption
that the Law of Large Numbers allows this deterministic model to be an accurate
representation of the underlying stochastic evolution of the disease and we treat the
errors in our empirical specification of deaths as reporting or measurement errors.

  The parameters of the model can be interpreted as follows.

   The parameter γ governs the rate at which agents who are infected stop being
infectious and hence stop transmitting the disease. Here we model this as a transition
from the state I to the state R or D. We refer to this parameter as the recovery
rate. Because there is no cure for a viral disease such as COVID-19, this parameter
is considered a fixed parameter determined by the biology of the disease. There is a
range of estimates of this parameter γ taken from clinical observations of data such




                                            9
as the length of time agents known to be infected shed the virus7 as well as data
from contact tracing determining who got sick from contact with whom.8 Estimates
for COVID-19 continue to be updated as new data comes in.9 . Values of γ between
1/4 and 1/14 are considered in the literature, corresponding to an infectious period
of 4 to 14 days on average. In this paper, we use γ = 1/5. We discuss sensitivity of
our results to this parameter below.

   We denote the fatality rate from the disease by ν. That is, ν is the fraction of
infected agents who stop transmitting the disease because they died.10 Measurement
of the fatality rate of the disease is difficult because of incomplete measurement of the
number of infected people and of the number of deaths from COVID-19. There is a
wide range of estimates of this parameter. Early estimates of the fatality rate among
infected people from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in which both infections and
fatalities were well measured are in the range of 1.2%.11 Recent estimates of the
infection fatality rate obtained from trends in the case fatality rate and testing data
worldwide and in the United States lie in the range of 1.0% and 1.3% respectively.12 .
The website Worldometer combines data on antibody testing and fatalities for New
York City to estimate and infection fatality rate of 1.4%.13 A number of estimates
based on antibody testing (serology studies) elsewhere imply a much lower infection
fatality rate in the range of 0.2%.14 We consider values of ν = 0.5% as our baseline
value and 1% as an alternative value.

       For the purposes of this paper, we assume that this death rate is constant and thus independent
of the stress placed on the health care system at points of peak infection. That assumption is clearly
incorrect. Evidence from Wuhan, Italy, and New York City all suggest that case fatality rate from
COVID-19 and the overall mortality rate is much higher in periods of peak infection.

  The parameter β(t) is the rate at which infected agents spread the virus to (or
“shed” the virus onto) others that they encounter at date t. We refer to this param-
eter as the transmission rate. This parameter is a reduced-form parameter that is
impacted by the biological disease transmission mechanism, the rate at which agents
bump into each other in the course of their daily activities, and the extent to which
agents use prophylactics in their meetings. This parameter can thus be impacted by
mitigation measures such as social distancing, hand washing, and the use of masks,
etc. This parameter is also subject to natural, or apparently random, fluctuations
over time and across space due to changes in the biological disease transmission
mechanism.15

   Note in the first two equations governing the flow of agents from the state S to the
state I over time, we assume that the transmission of the disease from infected to
susceptible agents is mitigated through random and uniform matching of agents in
the population as indicated by the term S(t)/(1−D(t)) in those two equations. That
is, we interpret β(t) as capturing the rate at which an infected agent interacts with
and sheds virus onto agents of any kind in the population.16 Under the assumption
that the interaction of infected agents with other agents is random and uniform,
then the the rate at which an infected agent meets a susceptible agent and sheds
virus onto that agent is given by β(t)S(t)/(1 − D(t)). This assumption that the
transmission of the disease is mitigated by random and uniform matching is a very
  15
      Seasonal influenza is an example of a disease whose transmission rate fluctuates regularly
with the weather. The Spanish Flu of 1918-19 came and went in three big waves in the Spring
and Fall of 1918 and the Spring of 1919. It is not fully understood what drove the changes over
time in the transmission rate of that disease. The available data on COVID-19 indicates that
the transmission rate varies tremendously across different geographies. See https://www.cidrap.
umn.edu/sites/default/files/public/downloads/cidrap-covid19-viewpoint-part1 0.pdf for a careful
discussion of natural fluctuation in transmission of similar diseases. See https://www.nytimes.com/
2020/05/03/world/asia/coronavirus-spread-where-why.html for a discussion of geographic variation
in transmission of COVID-19.
   16
      Note that in this simple model, we do not differentiate between infected agents with mild and
severe cases of the disease in terms of their role in spreading the disease. Clearly, the severity of
the disease may impact the spread, particularly since the very sick are likely to stay at home or
go to the hospital. Research is ongoing into the question of the extent to which those who are
infected but asymptomatic spread the disease. See, for example this research in Science https:
//science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/24/science.abb3221

stark assumption maintained here for simplicity.

  The following notation is useful in presenting our results.

  We define the ratio β(t)/γ to be the normalized transmission rate. It is standard
to refer to the value of the normalized transmission rate at the start of the pandemic
before any mitigation measures and use of prophylactics are undertaken as the basic
reproduction number of the disease. We denote this basic reproduction number by
R0 ≡ β(0)/γ. This parameter corresponds to the parameter cited in many news and
academic studies.17

   We refer to the term R(t) as the effective reproduction number of the disease
at date t. This effective reproduction number is the ratio of the rate at which
infected agents infect susceptible agents to the recovery rate of infected agents from
the disease at date t when the the pandemic has progressed for some time. In the
model, we assume that the effective reproduction number of the disease is given
by the product of the normalized transmission rate and the fraction of agents who
remain susceptible to the disease, R(t) = (β(t)/γ)S(t)/(1 − D(t)). Thus, in the
model, the effective reproduction number of the disease can differ from the basic
reproduction number for two reasons. First, as discussed above, the normalized
transmission rate β(t)/γ may vary over time with changes in the transmission rate
β(t), either due to steps undertaken to mitigate the transmission rate of the disease
or through naturally occurring changes in the transmission of the disease. Second,
the effective reproduction number falls as the fraction of agents remaining susceptible
to the disease S(t)/(1 − D(t)) falls.

   With this notation, we can restate the equations of the model in terms of the
effective reproduction number as

                                    dS(t)/dt = −R(t)γI(t)                                         (1)


   17
     The use of the notation R0 to denote the basic reproduction number and the letter R to denote
the fraction of agents who are resistant is an unfortunate choice of notation, but it is standard. See
for example https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Kermack-McKendrickModel.html

3    Model Estimation and Identification Strategy

In this section we provide an overview of our strategy for estimating our SIR model
given an empirical specification for the data on cumulative deaths and we discuss
which model parameters are identified in our procedure.

   To understand our procedure for estimating our SIR model, consider the following
thought experiment. Assume that we have complete data on cumulative deaths D(t)
in some region from dates t = t0 to T , where t0 is the calendar date on which
cumulative deaths Dt0 are equal to some threshold (we use 50) and T represents the
current period. Assume that we also have data on the first and second derivatives
of cumulative deaths during this time period. These derivatives are continuous time
versions of data on daily deaths and the change in daily deaths. Assume that we do
not have data on the number of agents with active infections or who are resistant.

  Consider the following thought experiment based on these assumptions. Imagine
that we fix parameters ν and γ governing the fatality rate and recovery rate of the
disease. What state of the population at date t0 , S(t0 ), I(t0 ), R(t0 ) and D(t0 ) and
course of the time-varying normalized transmission rate β(t)/γ from dates t0 to T
would allow the model to match exactly the data on deaths from t0 to T ?

  We have the following equations to work with in estimating these additional pa-
rameters of the model. Note that we assume that these equations apply for all t > 0


                                          13
but we only have data on the level and derivatives of cumulative deaths from t ≥ t0 .
From (4), we have
                                        1
                                I(t) =    dD(t)/dt
                                       νγ
Using (3) and (4) together and the assumption that R(0) = D(0) = 0, we have that

                                            1−ν
                                   R(t) =       D(t)
                                             ν

Using that the states must sum to one, we have

                                      1        1 dD(t)
                            S(t) = 1 − D(t) −          .
                                      ν       νγ dt

These equations then give the full path of the state of the population from dates t0 to
T . Note that the intuition behind these equations is straightforward. To determine
the number of resistant agents at time t, we simply use the observation that level
of cumulative deaths together with an estimate of the fatality rate of the disease
tells us how many agents are resistant to the disease. To determine the number of
actively infected agents at time t, we use the observation that the level of daily deaths
(the derivative of cumulative deaths) together with an estimate of the fatality and
recovery rates of the disease tells us the number of active infections. The number of
susceptible agents at time t is then one minus these two quantities.

  One can measure the effective reproduction number from the growth rate of deaths
as follows. From equation (2), the evolution of the true number of infected agents is
given by                                   Z         t
                          I(t) = I(0) exp(γ              (R(s) − 1)ds)
                                                 0

From equation (4), we then have that
                                                     Z       t
                       dD(t)
                             = νγI(0) exp(γ                      (R(s) − 1)ds)
                        dt                               0


where this time derivative of deaths is approximated in the data by the daily number


                                            14
of new deaths. If we differentiate this expression again, we get
                                                        t
                     d2 D(t)
                                                   Z
                             = νγ 2 I(0) exp(γ              (R(s) − 1)ds)(R(t) − 1)
                       dt2                          0


Thus, we can get an estimate of the effective reproduction number of the disease at
time t from18
                                               d2 D(t)
                                            1 dt2
                               R(t) = 1 + dD(t)                                 (5)
                                            γ
                                                                dt


  To recover the implied path of the normalized transmission rate, note that equation
(5) together with the death data gives the following estimate for the path of the
product of the effective reproduction between dates t0 and T . This estimate together
with the estimate of S(t) above imply that the normalized transmission rate β(t)/γ =
R(t)(1 − D(t))/S(t) needed to match the deaths data exactly for t ∈ [t0 , T ] is given
by
                                                   d2 D(t)
                                               1     dt2
                          β(t)           1+    γ    dD(t)
                               =                      dt
                                                               (1      − D(t))
                           γ     1 − ν1 D(t) −      1
                                                   νγ
                                                      dD(t)/dt

  This estimation procedure makes clear the identification problem in pinning down
the parameters ν and γ from deaths data alone. In particular, if we start with a prior
for ν and γ, we should not be able to update this prior based on deaths data alone
unless the estimates above result in inadmissable values of implied I(t), R(t) or S(t)
(above 1 or negative) or some implausible path for the normalized transmission rate
β(t)/γ (negative).

  To implement this estimation of the SIR model, one must construct an empirical
estimate of the data on cumulative deaths and the first and second derivatives of
cumulative deaths. It is here that our method makes contact with widely noted
reduced-form approaches to estimating the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic.
To illustrate this connection, we discuss the reduced form approach developed by
researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the Uni-

   We focus on the estimation of the IHME model using data on cumulative deaths.
The simplest version of this model assumes that the path of cumulative daily deaths
from some initial calendar date t0 on is given by
                                                                                 !
                                               Z     a(t−t0 −b)
                             p         2
                      D(t) =       1+ √                           exp(−τ 2 )dτ
                             2          π        0


where the parameter p denotes the limiting number of deaths D∞ , a is a growth
parameter, and b is an inflection point. This specification produces an implication
for daily deaths (approximated by the derivative of cumulative deaths) given by

                            dD(t)   pa
                                  = √ exp(−a2 (t − t0 − b)2 )
                             dt      π

that peaks at time t = b + t0 and then falls thereafter. Note that the implied growth
rate of the logarithm of daily deaths is given by

                                  d2 D(t)
                                    dt2
                                  dD(t)
                                            = 2a2 (b + t0 − t).
                                     dt



  The model is fit to the available data on deaths between the initial date t0 and the
current date, and then the assumed parametric form is used to project daily deaths
beyond the current date. This projection is based on the claim that this parametric
form fits the data for locations that are further along in disease progression. One
can incorporate measures of the extent and timing of mitigation in the estimation as
covariates for the parameters p and b based on experience across locations.

  If, as our model implies with a constant fatality rate ν, observed deaths are related

to active infections by equation (4), then equation (5) implies that the path of the
effective reproduction number over time implied by the parameters of this empirical
specification for cumulative deaths is given by

                                               2a2
                                 R(t) = 1 −        (t − t0 − b)
                                                γ

That is, for our SIR model to replicate this pattern of cumulative deaths, the normal-
ized transmission rate β(t)/γ would have to vary over time so as to produce the path
for the effective reproduction number R(t) = (β(t)/γ)S(t)/(1 − D(t) given above.

   Note then that this empirical specification implies that the effective reproduction
number falls linearly over time, not only in the period of estimation, but also going
forward beyond the current period.20 Thus, in the context of a structural model,
unless one assumes that the current value of S(t)/(1 − D(t) is substantially below
one, this is equivalent to assuming that the impact of mitigation measures on disease
transmission will continue to lower the transmission rate over time rather than keep
it stable at current levels or even allow it to rise. It is not clear that this is a natural
assumption regarding the impact of lockdowns or other disease mitigation measures
— that their impact on disease transmission would grow over time.

   The empirical specification for the deaths data that we use is considerably more
flexible than that used in the IHME model in that it is based on Weibull functions. In
the simplest version of our specification (with one regime), the data on daily deaths
is modeled as
                           "            b−1                      b !#
               dD(t)        b t − t0 − c                 t − t0 − c
                      =d                      exp −
                 dt         a       a                        a

where the parameter a > 0 is the scale parameter, b > 0 is the slope parameter, and
c is the location parameter of a Weibull density, while d > 0 allows us to scale this

  20
     Clearly, at some point, this implied effective reproduction number becomes negative, which is
inadmissable. This observation implies that this functional form for cumulative deaths cannot be
reproduced by our SIR model with any set of parameters and time varying transmission rate β(t).

density function up or down to integrate to d. The implied effective reproduction
number is                      "                         b−1 #
                             1    b−1        b t − t0 − c

                             γ t − t0 − c a         a

This prediction for the effective reproduction number given our empirical specifica-
tion for daily deaths can take on various shapes parameterized by a, b, and c. In
particular, with b = 1, the Weibull function implies a constant path for the effective
reproduction number. With b < 1, the implied effective reproduction number rises
over time. With b > 1 it falls over time. This critical dependence on the parameter
b corresponds to the properties of the density of the Weibull distribution here rep-
resenting the pattern of daily deaths itself. With b = 1, daily deaths start at t = t0
at a constant value and decline monotonically as t increases. With b > 1 and c = 0,
daily deaths approach zero as t approaches t0 , but the implied effective reproduction
number approaches infinity. With a large enough value of b (say 4), this function
produces a hump-shaped pattern of daily deaths. Setting c > 0 with b > 1 allows
for a finite implied effective reproduction number at t = t0 .



4      Empirical Implementation of the Model for Daily
       Deaths

In this section we describe and estimate the empirical model that we use for daily
deaths.

    Consider a mixture of Weibull functions:
                 I
                          (                 bi −1    "              bi #)

where ai > 0 is the scale parameter, bi > 0 is the slope parameter, ci < t − t0
is the location parameter, di > 0 is the height parameter, the weight parameter

wi (t) is positive for all i and t, I is a positive integer indicating the number of
mixtures, and Ii=1 wi (t) = 1. The term in the curly bracket on the right-hand side
                P

of equation (6) is the three-parameter Weibull distribution density function scaled
by di . In the I = 2 case, we set, w1 (t) = e−s(t−m) /(1 + e−s(t−m) ), where s is the
steepness parameter and the parameter m represents the sigmoid’s midpoint.

  Let ∆DtData be the measured object for dDt /dt and denote

 ∆Dt, Data ≡ ∆DtData , ∆Dt−1

where εt is a state-dependent standard normal random residual. The switching state
kt ∈ {1, . . . , K} can accommodate both an expectedly large surge in daily deaths
and a low death volatility typically associated with a low number of deaths. Since
the first term on the right-hand side of equation (7) can be very large for some
t, moreover, negative values of εt allow for actual daily deaths substantially lower
than the value implied by the first term on the right-hand side of equation (7). The
transition matrix Qk = [qi,j k
                               ] for kt is unrestricted except that each column of Qk
sums to one. For our deterministic SIR model to offer an accurate account of health
consequences of the pandemic, we set t0 at the time when the number of deaths
accumulates to 50.

5      Findings

The data sources for daily deaths are New York Times for U.S. states and regions
and Johns Hopkins University for other countries. We do not smooth the data with
a preset filter but rather estimate the death pattern using the Bayesian procedure
presented in Section 4. The estimation enables us to incorporate the uncertainty
about deaths into our structural model.

   We present estimates, forecasts, and counterfactual exercises for ten large U.S.
states, nine U.S. Census Regions, and a number of additional countries. The ten
states we consider are New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsyva-
nia, Illinois, California, Connecticut, Louisiana and Maryland. The Census Regions
are South Atlantic, East North Central, Mountain, West North Central, West South
Central, Pacific, and New England. The additional countries that we consider are
the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Spain, Brazil, Belgium, Germany, Iran, Mexico,
Canada, Netherlands, Sweden India, Peru, Russia, and Switzerland. The presenta-
tion is ordered from most deaths to least deaths on May 21, 2020 first for states,
then for Census regions, and finally for countries.

    For each region, we start the estimation at a region specific date t0 at which

prior. For our nonlinear regression here, the inverse Gamma prior is no longer conjugate. Moreover,
since the death data implies that the values of σkt are far less than one, the inverse Gamma prior
only with no moments can cover such small values. This makes the inverse Gamma prior not only
undesirable but also unpractical.

                                                21
cumulative deaths first reach 50 and let T denote the number of days in the estimation
period. We then present forecast and counterfactual scenarios for an additional time
period equal to twice the number of days in the estimation period (2T ).

  We consider two forecast scenarios for each state, region, or country. In the first
forecast scenario, we set the normalized transmission rate to βt /γ = 2 from the end
of the estimation period to the end of the forecast period. In the second forecast
scenario, we set the normalized transmission rate to βt /γ = 1.3 from the end of the
estimation period to the end of the forecast period.

   To construct counterfactual scenarios, we shift the estimated/forecast path for the
normalized transmission rate β(t)/γ back by seven days and fill in the first seven days
of this counterfactual path for the transmission rate of the disease with its initial
value β(0)/γ. That is, the counterfactual path for the normalized transmission rate
is given by β̃(t + 7)/γ = β(t)/γ for t ≥ 0 and β̃(s)/γ = β(0)/γ for 0 ≤ s < 7. Note
that this shift is for both the estimation and forecast period. Thus, there are two
counterfactual scenarios for each state, region, or country, corresponding to the two
forecast scenarios outlined above. We interpret this shift as corresponding to a one-
week delay in the imposition and relaxation of mitigation measures. Mechanically,
given our estimation of a rapidly declining effective reproduction number early on in
the estimation period in nearly all regions, this counterfactual corresponds to adding
a week of rapid transmission of the disease after the region reaches 50 cumulative
deaths beyond what actually occurred.

  We present our results in a collection of tables and figures below.


5.1    Organization of the figures and tables

For each state, census region, and country considered, we present our estimation,
forecast, and counterfactual results in a collection of four figures.

  In each case, the first figure, with two panels, shows the data on daily and cumu-


                                          22
lative deaths over the estimation period with the estimated Weibull specification for
daily and cumulative deaths.

   The second figure, also with two panels, shows our estimated and forecast paths
for daily and cumulative deaths under the two forecast scenarios that we consider.
The normalized transmission rate after the estimation period is set to 1.3 for the
first forecast scenario (blue curve) and 2 for the second forecast scenario (red curve),
except for West South Central where the normalized transmission rate is set to 1.9
for the second forecast scenario.

   The third figure has six panels that shows other model outcomes for the estima-
tion and forecast period under the two forecast scenarios. These are the effective
reproduction number, the normalized transmission rate, the fraction of the popu-
lation remaining susceptible, the fraction actively infected, the fraction resistant,
and the change in daily deaths (the second derivative of our empirical specification
for cumulative deaths). Outcomes under the forecast scenario with the normalized
transmission rate set to 1.3 after the estimation period are shown in blue and with
the normalized transmission rate set to 2 after the estimation period are shown in
red.

   The fourth figure also has six panels. These panels show six model outcomes for
the estimation and forecast periods under our counterfactual scenarios. These are
the effective reproduction number, the fraction remaining susceptible, daily deaths,
cumulative deaths, the normalized transmission rate (the counterfactual), and the
fraction of the population actively infected.

  In tables 1 and 2, we summarize the results of our counterfactual experiments
across states and census regions (table 1) and countries (table 2) by showing the
number of cumulative deaths at the end of the forecast period for the two baseline
and counterfactual scenarios (normalized transmission rates for the forecast period
equal to 1.3 and 2 respectively).

  In tables 3 and 4 we show how the change in the effective reproduction number


                                          23
over the estimation period for New York and the United Kingdom is decomposed
into a change in the normalized transmission rate and a change in the fraction of
agents still susceptible to the disease.


5.2     Key Findings

Consider our key findings.


5.2.1   Decline in the transmission of the disease in the estimation period

Across almost all regions and countries that we consider, the growth of the pandemic,
as measured by its effective reproduction number, has fallen dramatically from the
initial date at which cumulative deaths reached 50 to the present (the end of the
estimation period marked by a vertical line in the figures). In many cases, we see
declines of the effective reproduction number from levels well above 3 to levels well
below 1.

  In almost all regions, we see that the decline in the effective reproduction number
has occurred primarily through a reduction in the normalized transmission rate rather
than through a decline in the fraction of the population remaining susceptible to the
disease. We illustrate this point in greater detail in Tables 3 and 4.

   This rapid decline in the effective reproduction number of the disease seen in the
regions that we consider accounts for the observation that infections and deaths have
not reached the levels that were forecast by some in mid March. In fact, across the
regions that we study, we see within the estimation period a clear first wave in terms
of daily deaths — these have peaked and begun to decline rather than continue to
grow to very high levels.

   Our estimation also indicates that in almost all states, Census regions, and coun-
tries, the fraction of the population that remains susceptible to the disease is still
quite high and the fraction of the population with active infections, while not ex-

                                         24
traordinarily high, is considerably higher than it was in mid-March. These findings
regarding the current distribution of the population across the states S, I, R, and
D then play an important role in shaping our forecast scenarios.


5.2.2   Forecast scenarios

Our two forecast scenarios for the normalized transmission rate of the disease go-
ing forward (1.3 in blue and 2 in red) correspond to normalized transmission rates
seen in many states, regions, and countries late and early in the estimation period
respectively. We see in our forecast scenarios in red with a normalized transmission
rate of 2, the threat of a severe second wave of infections and daily deaths that in
many cases is much larger than the first wave (in New York these are of roughly
equal size). In this second forecast scenario, this large second wave would be over
in about 100 days from the end of the estimation period. In most cases, under our
forecast scenario with the normalized transmission rate set to 1.3, we also have a
second wave of daily deaths and infections, but this second wave is milder and lasts
longer. These forecast scenarios of a second wave are driven by our estimates that
the fraction of the population that remains susceptible to the disease is very high in
almost all regions and the fraction of the population that is actively infected, while
not extraordinarily high, is substantially larger than it was in early March.

   In terms of the cumulative burden of the disease, we see that these two forecast
scenarios have dramatically different implications for cumulative deaths at the end of
the forecast period. In each case, the forecast scenario with the normalized transmis-
sion rate at 2 results in substantially more daily deaths than that with the normalized
transmission rate at 1.3. To see this point, compare the cumulative deaths reported
in tables 1 and 2 under the columns labeled baseline scenario 1 (with normalized
transmission rate 1.3) and baseline scenario 2 (with normalized transmission rate 2).

   It remains to be seen whether it will be possible to keep the normalized transmis-
sion rate as low as considered in our blue scenario for the next 100 days or so. Note
that the fraction of agents still susceptible under this milder scenario remains high

                                          25
at the end of the forecast period in many regions. This observation implies that,
under this scenario, regions that did succeed in keeping the normalized transmission
rate low for the next 100 days or more would still be vulnerable to a large increase
in daily deaths and infections were the transmission rate to rise substantially above
1.3 after the end of the forecast period.


5.3    Counterfactuals

Perhaps most interesting are our counterfactual results regarding the implications
for changes in the timing of mitigation of disease transmission on the cumulative
number of deaths from the disease over the long run. Recall that we consider a
counterfactual scenario under which the path of the normalized transmission rate
through time is pushed back seven days in both the estimation and forecast period.
Because we have two forecast scenarios, we thus have two counterfactual scenarios
as well, corresponding to the assumed path of the normalized transmission rate after
the estimation period. Results on counterfactual model outcomes including active
infections and daily deaths for both the estimation and forecast periods are shown in
the fourth figure for each state, Census region, and country. Recall that the vertical
lines in these figures mark the end of the estimation period. Results on cumulative
deaths at the end of the forecast period under these two counterfactual scenarios are
reported in tables 1 and 2 for each state, Census region, and country.

   One can see in the lower left panel (first panel of the third row) of the fourth
figure for each state, Census region, and country, the counterfactual normalized
transmission rate considered, with that in the scenario corresponding to a normal-
ized transmission rate in the forecast period of 1.3 shown in blue and that with a
normalized transmission rate of 2 in the forecast period shown in red. In each of
these figures, one can see the small flat portion at the start of the estimation period
which is where we are assuming that rapid transmission of the disease would have
continued for seven days after the region first reached the threshold of 50 deaths.



                                          26
   We report on the counterfactual paths of daily deaths in the first panel of the
second row and on active infections in the second panel of the third row of this
figure of counterfactual outcomes. In many regions, the counterfactual paths for the
normalized transmission rate result in a significantly larger first peak of daily deaths
and infections in the estimation period. This finding confirms the common wisdom
that delayed mitigation of the disease in this early phase of the pandemic would have
resulted in a more severe first wave than actually occurred. Corresponding to this
observation, this counterfactual also typically results in a significantly larger number
of cumulative deaths (shown in the second panel of the second row) at the end of
the estimation period than actually occurred.

  But what do these counterfactual scenarios imply for the cumulative number of
deaths in the longer run at the end of the forecast period? Here the results can
go either way — a seven day delay in the reduction (and subsequent increase) in
the normalized transmission rate can result in either an increase or a decline in the
number of cumulative deaths at the end of the forecast period.

   This finding can be seen most clearly in tables 1 and 2. For New York, we see that
the counterfactual number of cumulative deaths at the end of the forecast period
is either substantially or mildly larger than that under the baseline paths for the
normalized transmission rate. For California, we see that the counterfactual out-
comes for cumulative deaths at the end of the forecast period hardly differ from the
baseline.

  But this is not always the case. For Pennsylvania, and for the aggregate for the
United States, we see that the counterfactual number of cumulative deaths at the
end of the forecast period under the scenario with a normalized transmission rate
equal to 2 during the forecast period is actually lower than the baseline number, and
for Pennsylvania in particular this difference is quite large. We see the same result
that the counterfactual cumulative deaths at the end of the forecast period are lower
than the baseline cumulative deaths under scenario 2 for Italy, Brazil, Iran, Canada,
and Switzerland.


                                          27
  How should one understand this result? Here, as suggested by Rachel (2020),
examination of the phase diagram of the model is quite useful for building intuition
for this result. We show such a phase diagram for our two baseline and counterfactual
scenarios in the case of Pennsylvania in figure 24. Each of the two panels of this figure
show the model outcomes for S(t) on the x-axis and I(t) on the y-axis in the first
scenario (with the normalized transmission rate after the estimation period set to
1.3) on the left and in the second scenario (with the normalized transmission rate
set to 2) on the right. There is a vertical line in each figure marking the point of
herd immunity once the normalized transmission rate reaches it long run value. For
the first scenario, this is at S = 1/1.3. For the second scenario, this is at S = 1/2.

   One can use this figure to understand the model dynamics as follows. The model
outcomes start at S(t0 ) very close to one and I(t0 ) very small at the extreme lower
right part of the panel. The long run outcome for S(t) as t gets very large must
occur at a point to the left of the vertical line in the panel — in the long-run, active
infections do not decline unless the population has herd immunity relative to the
long-run value of the normalized transmission rate marked by the vertical line in the
figure.

   But exactly how far to the left of the vertical line marking herd immunity the
fraction of the population that is susceptible at the end of the pandemic lands when
infections shrink to zero depends on what fraction of agents are actively infected at
the moment in the forecast period that the population reaches that point of herd
immunity. If that fraction is high, then it will take a long time for the number of
active infections to decline to zero and many more susceptible agents will be infected
in the long run. If that fraction is low, then, the remaining active infections will die
out quickly and the fraction of agents remaining susceptible in the long run will end
up close to the line marking herd immunity. Counterfactual changes in the timing
of mitigation as represented by a delay in the decline of the normalized transmission
rate can thus raise or lower the long run burden of the disease, measured as one minus
the fraction of susceptible agents left in the long run, depending on the impact of
these changes on the fraction of agents actively infected when the population reaches


                                           28
herd immunity in the forecast period.

   Consider first the left panel in figure 24 showing the evolution of S(t) and I(t) for
Pennsylvania in our baseline and counterfactual scenarios in which the normalized
transmission rate is 1.3 during the forecast period. In this case, in the baseline
scenario, the early decline in the effective reproduction number as estimated implied
that the fraction of agents still susceptible at the end of the estimation period is
above that needed to achieve herd immunity in the forecast period (1/1.3). Thus, in
the forecast period, we see a second wave in the solid black line, as infections rise,
reach herd immunity, and then fall. In contrast, under the counterfactual for this
scenario, the seven-day delay in initial decline in the transmission of the disease leads
to a very large first wave of infections — so large that infections are very high at
the point at which they start to decline in the forecast period due to herd immunity.
Thus, in this counterfactual scenario as shown by the dotted pink line, the long run
fraction of the population that is still susceptible is quite a bit smaller than under
the baseline scenario, resulting in a substantial increase in the long-run number of
deaths.

   But now consider the right panel in figure 24. This panel shows the evolution of
S(t) and I(t) for Pennsylvania in our baseline and counterfactual scenarios in which
the normalized transmission rate is 2 during the forecast period. In this case, the
ordering for cumulative long-run deaths is reversed. Under the baseline scenario
shown in the solid black line, the first wave of the pandemic is very small. Thus,
when the second wave builds during the forecast period, it builds to a high level of
active infections at the point at which the population hits herd immunity, and the
fraction of the population that remains susceptible in the long run is very low. In
contrast, under the counterfactual scenario in this case, because the first wave of the
pandemic is larger, the population actually reaches herd immunity before the end of
the estimation period and active infections at the start of the forecast period are so
low that the pandemic dies out very quickly once that period starts. Thus, in this
case, a delay in mitigation leading to a larger first wave of infections leads, in the
long run, to a smaller cumulative death toll.

   One can see how these rich model dynamics make it very difficult to draw firm
conclusions about the impact of changes in the timing of mitigation measures on the
long run cumulative death toll by considering alternative counterfactual scenarios
with a shorter delay of mitigation of 5 days (shown in figure 25) and a longer delay
of mitigation of 14 days (shown in figure 27). In the left panel of figure 25, we see
that a five day delay of mitigation would have had no impact on cumulative deaths
if the normalized transmission rate was 1.3 in the forecast period, while in the right
panel of that figure, we see that the five day delay would again have been helpful in
reducing the cumulative death toll. In contrast, in figure 27, we see that a 14 day
delay in mitigation would have resulted in an increase in the cumulative death toll
under both scenarios for the normalized transmission rate during the forecast period.


5.4    Uncertainty bands
                                                                                              
We simulate 100, 000 random draws from the posterior probability distribution p θ | ∆DData
and use these draws to generate 68% probability bands of various SIR model vari-
ables as they provide an informative description of the posterior shape (Sims and
Zha, 1999).22 Using Pennsylvania as an example, we report these uncertainty bands
in figures 21, 22, and 23. As one can see from the left panel of figure 21, the posterior
distribution is skewed. During April 22-28, for instance, the posterior mode (the solid
line) is outside and above the 68% probability bands, indicating that the posterior
distribution is skewed downward to reflect the sudden drops in daily deaths. During
May 6-10, the posterior mode is below the 68% probability bands, indicating that
the posterior distribution is skewed upward to reflect a large rise in daily deaths. For
cumulative deaths, the 68% probability bands contain the actual observations (right
panel of figure 21).

  The left panel of figure 22 displays 68% probability bands of daily deaths under
our two scenarios of the normalized transmission rate. After cumulating these daily

    On our standard modern desktop, this whole computation process takes about 192 minutes.
The program is coded up in a combination of C++ and Matlab.

deaths, the right panel of the figure shows a large degree of uncertainty about the
total death toll. This uncertainty can be explained by figure 23, which shows that
the posterior distribution for the normalized transmission rate is skewed downward
during the 25-day period around the end of the sample because the mode estimate
is above the 68% probability bands for both forecast scenarios. As a result, the
68% probability bands for the effective reproduction number stay below the mode
estimate during the same period, even though there is more probability assigned
to larger values of S(t)/N (t) than the mode estimate. A majority of the posterior
probability of Rt below the mode estimate explains a large probability of daily and
cumulative deaths that stay below the mode estimate at the beginning of the forecast
period.



6    Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented a method for estimating a structural SIR model
of the COVID-19 pandemic that shares the flexibility of reduced-form models of the
evolution of this pandemic with a structural model for forecasting and counterfactual
exercises. Our Bayesian approach allows us to not only quantify the uncertainty in
our estimates, but also to model the impact of that uncertainty on our forecasts and
counterfactual exercises.

  We have estimated the model and used it to construct forecast and counterfactual
scenarios for ten large states, nine Census regions, and a number of other countries.
In further work, we plan to update, on a regular basis, our estimates and forecast
and counterfactual scenarios along with uncertainty bands.
