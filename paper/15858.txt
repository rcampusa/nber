                                              ABSTRACT

Are many prisoners in jail or prison because of their mental illness? And if so, is mental health treatment
a cost-effective way to reduce crime and lower criminal justice costs? This paper reviews and evaluates
the evidence assessing the potential of expansion of mental health services for reducing crime. Mental
illness and symptoms of mental illness are highly prevalent among adult and child criminal justice
populations. The association between serious mental illness and violence and arrest is particularly
strong among individuals who are psychotic and do not adhere to medication. Two empirical studies
augment the empirical research base relating mental illness to crime. In a recent community sample
of adults, we find higher rates of arrest for those with serious mental illness and with substance abuse.
 Among youth, even with family fixed effects, antisocial personality scores predict future school problems
and arrests. A large body of research tracks mental health and criminal justice outcomes associated
with treatments and social policies. Reviews of the cost-effectiveness of treatments for children with
behavioral problems, mental health courts, and mandatory outpatient treatment are inconclusive.

1. Introduction

       Tragic data relate mental illness and crime. The Los Angeles County Jail, Cook County

Jail, and Riker’s Island in New York each house more persons with mental illness (about 1,400

in LA, alone) than any psychiatric institution in the country (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2009).

Two-thirds of the nation’s juvenile inmates have at least one mental illness (Moore, 2009). By

Skeem et al.’s (2009) calculations, on a typical day, over one million people with mental

illnesses are in jail, in prison, on probation, or on parole. These figures raise natural questions:

Are many prisoners in jail or prison because of their mental illness? And if so, is mental health

treatment a cost-effective way to reduce crime and lower criminal justice costs? The main goal

of this paper is to review and evaluate the evidence assessing the potential of expansion of

mental health services for reducing crime. We also undertake two empirical studies to augment

the empirical research base relating mental illness to crime.

       A simple logic offers a starting point for analysis. If: a) mental illness causes crime, and

b) mental health treatment reduces mental illness, then: c) increasing mental health treatment can

reduce mental illness and crime. National efforts based on this reasoning, some led by the

Council of State Governments (2009), have been underway for some time, targeting expansion

of access to community-based mental health care to the criminally involved.

       A good deal of research evaluates premises a) and b). The social science literature

bearing on the link of mental illness to crime (a), is the main focus of this paper, whereas the

clinical literature regarding the effectiveness of mental health treatment (b), is also relevant. As

we will see later on, the connection between mental illness and crime is predominantly among

persons with severe mental illness such as psychosis and major depression. These illnesses are




                                                                                                       1
serious and persistent in about 2 percent of the adult population. Development of and evaluation

of the effects and costs of treatments for people with these conditions has long been a focus of

public and private research. In the cases of both illnesses, effective treatments, largely drug

treatments with appropriate monitoring and supportive psychosocial services, have been known

for some time.1 Major advances in the treatment of schizophrenia with psychoactive drugs, date

from the early 1950s and the marketing of chlorpromazine. Many other antipsychotics are now

available, most with very comparable effectiveness and side effect profiles (clozapine,

introduced in 1989 in the US, may be particularly helpful for patients who fail on other drugs).

A large number of these drugs are now available as generics. The unresolved problems with

treatment for schizophrenia is that while many drug treatments have some effectiveness, it is rare

for full function to be restored, adjunctive treatments such as vocational rehabilitation and family

counseling are expensive and themselves of modest effectiveness, and, unpleasant side effects of

drugs lead many patients to discontinue therapy. Less than half of patients with schizophrenia

are on a treatment likely to be effective.

         Depression is an episodic illness for which there are also many effective drug treatments

(which have a major effect on symptoms). Tricyclic antidepressants have been available since

the early 1960s, and the selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (the first and most famous of which

is Prozac) since 1988. Many effective drugs for depression are available as low-cost generics

and are frequently prescribed by non-psychiatrists. While overtreatment or inappropriate

treatment is a concern for people with mild symptoms, a positive trend in the past several

decades has been the large increases in share of people with serious depression who are taking

                                                                                                                      2
medications likely to help them, with recent estimates of over 80% (Frank and Glied, 2006,

p116).

          Two difficulties encountered by researchers in assessing the causal link between mental

illness and crime are worth calling attention to at the outset. First, mental illness is correlated

with many factors (e.g., criminal attitudes) that cause crime and may be difficult to measure. In

community and survey data, indicators of mental illness might be picking up effects of other

criminogenic factors correlated with mental illness (being raised in a family where there is

violence). Related to this common problem of “unobservables” in social science research is a

second issue. Mental illness may affect crime directly and indirectly, mediated by other factors,

and this process may occur over an extended period of time. Mental illness may have a

contemporaneous effect on crime, and in addition, mental illness in the past may have an indirect

effect on current crime working through the role of mental illness in elevating other risk factors

contributing to current crime (e.g. growing up in bad neighborhoods, substance abuse). These

complications are depicted in Figure 1. Past problems with mental illness, going back to

childhood, are tied up with personal and social factors, and are a potential cause of current

mental illness and other personal and social factors (some of which are unobserved) causing

crime. The link to childhood raises similar issues and possibilities discussed by Heckman and

Masterov (2004) related to workplace outcomes. The direct effect of current mental illness on

crime (arrow a) is the limited sense in which it is usually meant by the question “does mental

illness cause crime?” but the full effect of mental illness on crime goes beyond a

contemporaneous causal relation.

         To preview one conclusion from the literature: a small fraction (Skeem et al. (2009)

judge it to be one in ten) of criminals with mental illness commit crimes because of their current




                                                                                                      3
illness, but the elevated risk is small. Current treatment can ameliorate current illness and

symptoms, but cannot reverse the past effects of illness on the accumulation of other risk factors

over a person’s lifetime. In light of this, we pay attention in our review to the role of past on

current illness and on other social factors leading to crime. Although the research base is less

developed, the effects of childhood mental illness and treatments for children are an important

consideration for the intersection of mental health and criminal justice policy.

       We also note that our syllogism is a sufficient, but not a necessary, condition for

improved mental health treatment to reduce crime and criminal justice costs. Policies that link

people at risk for committing crimes to community mental health treatment comprise more than

simple mental health care interventions and their route of cause might be by some mechanism

other than by improving mental health. Some treatments, like hospitalization or outpatient case

management, may keep potential offenders out of trouble simply by keeping them off the streets

and providing supervision. A “mental health court,” to take another example discussed in more

detail below, is a package of interventions which includes an active judge, frequent court

monitoring, as well as mandated mental health care. In evaluating the role of “mental health”

interventions in reducing crime, we will comment on whether the mechanism seems to be

through improved mental health.

        The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review research on the association

and causal relationship between mental illness and crime. If mental health treatment is to be

cost-effective in terms of criminal justice outcomes, it should be targeted to “high-risk”

populations. The next two sections study mental health treatment in two high-risk groups who

are candidates for mental health interventions targeted to reduce crime: children with serious

behavioral problems, and adult criminals. Section 3 is concerned with the effect of past illness




                                                                                                    4
and treatment on subsequent criminal justice contact in the case of children with conduct

disorder. Section 4 is concerned with current mental health interventions targeted to criminals

who are also mentally ill. A large range of programs are designed for this second population –

mental health courts, specialty probation programs, forensic-oriented community treatments,

among others. We focus on mental health courts. We also consider mandatory outpatient

treatment, a widely applied policy with implications for criminal justice. We return, in Section

5, to the question of the cost-effectiveness of expanding various forms of mental health treatment

based on favorable effects on crime and criminal justice costs.



2. Mental Illness and Crime

        The association between mental illness and crime, with a special focus on whether

“mental illness causes crime,” has attracted a great deal of interest among social scientists. The

literature features some excellent analytic reviews.2 We begin with a review of the association

between mental illness and crime.

Mental Illness and Crime in Community Samples

        The “dangerousness” of people with mental illnesses emerged as a social concern as state

mental hospitals closed beds during the 1960s and 1970s and patients with serious mental illness

found themselves in the community, often struggling to maintain stable living arrangements,

social support, and basic services. Former mental patients, or those who formally would have

been hospitalized for long periods of time, were largely without jobs and visible on city streets.

Advocates for the mentally ill claimed that people with mental illness “pose no more of a crime

threat than do other members of the general population” (National Mental Health Association,

 Skeem, Manchak and Petersen (2009) review a wider literature than is covered here in Section 4, and their views
will be highlighted below. Marcotte and Markowitz (2009) contain a nice review from an economic perspective.

                                                                                                                   5
1987), but this conclusion was premature because data to that point were not well-suited to test

the relationship (Monahan and Steadman, 1983). For example, with data from a psychiatric

epidemiologic survey, Swanson et al. (1990) found that violence (self-reported hitting, fighting

or weapon use) was five times higher among persons meeting diagnostic criteria for mental

illness than community residents without illness, even after adjusting for demographic and

socioeconomic factors, and the presence of a substance abuse diagnosis.3 This partial association

is not necessarily casual.4

         The conclusions of a community-based study around this time by Link, Andrews and

Cullen (1992), based on comparison of former patients and community residents in one

neighborhood in New York City, remain a good summary of the literature. Mental patients had

elevated rates of self-reported violence. Substance abuse, correlated with mental illness, also

elevates violence but does not account for the full effect of mental illness. Notably, the presence

of psychotic symptoms mediates the effect of mental illness. 5 In other words, the elevated

violence is found among the patients with more severe and current illness. Other studies come to

similar conclusions about the role of substance abuse and mental illness. One review (Friedman,

2006) concluded that substance abuse alone dramatically increases the lifetime prevalence of




3
  See also Harry and Steadman (1988). Data on the association of mental illness and crime has been found in other
countries. In Australia patients with schizophrenia more likely to have been convicted of a violent offense than
matched controls without schizophrenia (8.2% versus 1.8%) (Wallace, Mullen & Burgess, 2004). In Sweden men
with major mental disorders are four times more likely than men without a mental disorder to be registered for a
violent offense; women with major mental disorders 27 times more likely to be registered for a violent offense than
women with no disorder (Hodgins 1992). In Switzerland men with schizophrenia were five times more likely to
commit violent crimes than matched controls without schizophrenia (Modestin and Ammann, 1996). Stueve and
Link (1997) found elevated rates of violence and weapon use among persons diagnosed with psychosis or bipolar
disorder in Israel. The evidence for the association of mental illness and crime is not uniform, however. A meta-
analysis of 58 studies found clinical variables (eg diagnosis, treatment history) did not predict criminal recidivism
(Bonta, Law and Hanson, 1998).
4
  Causality is irrelevant for many purposes. Community residents do not care why someone might be more
dangerous.

  One notable study, Applebaum et al (2000), however, did not this relationship.


                                                                                                                        6
violent behavior, and among people with serious mental disorders, the effects were almost

additive.

        We add to this literature and characterize the association between crime and mental

illness with recent data from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiological Surveys (CPES),

designed to capture the prevalence of psychiatric illness and service use with a national sample

including an oversampling of minority groups. The CPES combines three surveys conducted

with a unified approach during 2002-4, allowing for integration of design-based weights to

combine the data as if they were a single, nationally representative study (NIMH, 2007).6 These

data accurately identify recent (12-month) and lifetime presence of psychiatric disorder. We

focus on the effects of serious mental illness, defined to include bipolar disorder or

schizophrenia, and substance abuse, defined as abuse of alcohol or illicit drugs.7 Respondents

answered a single question about their arrest history (“have you ever been arrested”) which we

use as a dependent variable in our models. After excluding some cases because of missing data,

we analyzed a sample of 10,686 individuals.

        Figure 2 shows both the unadjusted and adjusted association between serious mental

illness (SMI) and arrest. The left-hand section of the figure shows the unadjusted rates of arrest

at any time during a respondent’s lifetime according to whether the respondent reported having




6
  The University of Michigan Survey Research Center (SRC) collected data for the CPES, combining data from the
National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS; Alegria et al., 2004), the National Comorbidity Survey
Replication (NCS-R; Kessler & Merikangas, 2004) and the National Survey of African American Life (NSAL;
Jackson et al., 2004). Design and methodological information can be found at the CPES website
(https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/CPES/index.html).

  Bipolar disorder was present in the past 12 months if the respondent met DSMIV criteria for either Bipolar I or
Bipolar II Disorder in the past 12 months. A designation of substance abuse was present if the respondent met DSM
IV criteria for Alcohol or Drug Abuse or Dependence. Psychosis was designated differently on the basis of
symptom report and is therefore less reliable. The respondent was regarded as having psychosis if they reported
experiencing at least one of a set of symptoms associated with psychosis in the past 12 months, such as (when not
dreaming/sleeping/using substances): Ever saw visions others couldn’t see; even felt their mind was being
controlled; ever experienced communication attempts from strange forces; and three others.


                                                                                                               7
an SMI in the past twelve months.8 Not surprisingly, those with an SMI are at an elevated risk of

having been arrested, though in these data the arrest could have predated illness. The adjusted

bars on the right-hand side of the figure report results from a linear model of arrest rates on age

categories, gender, race, and having an SMI and abusing substances in the past 12 months. For

presentation, rates are compared against a “base case” rate of 42.2% for white males aged 25-34

with neither SMI nor substance abuse. Presence of an SMI alone elevates the rate of lifetime risk

of arrest to 57.9%, and substance abuse alone is much higher. As shown by a negative and

significant interaction term for substance abuse and serious mental illness, a person reporting

both SMI and substance abuse has adjusted arrest rates more like someone with SMI alone than

with substance abuse alone. We added an indicator of “other mental illness” into the model, and

the estimated coefficient for this variable was not significant at conventional levels, implying

that elevated rates of arrest are concentrated among those with serious mental illness or

substance abuse.9 (Regression results from the basic model are included in Appendix A.) From

these data, we would conclude that both serious mental illness and substance abuse have an

independent effect on arrest rates.

Overlap in Criminal Justice and Patient Samples

         Community samples exclude individuals that are institutionalized, those in hospitals, jails

and prisons, and may undercount people that are homeless and others without established

community ties. A powerful impression of the association of mental illness and criminal

involvement emerges from studies of jail and patient samples.



8
  The CPES also collected information about lifetime rates of SMI. The unadjusted rate of arrest is about 40 percent
for this group.
9
  We have estimated models separately for males and females, and adjusting also for income and education. The
results are similar. SMI raises risk of arrest, but not as much as substance abuse. The interaction effect between the
two conditions is negative. The CPES contains an alternative arrest variable but it is only reported for about half the
sample used here.


                                                                                                                     8
       Mental illness and symptoms of mental illness are highly prevalent among adult and child

criminal justice populations. In 2002, 25% of inmates in local jails had at least one previous

diagnosis of a mental illness; in 2004, 25.5% of inmates in state prisons and 14.8% of inmates in

federal prisons had at least one previous diagnosis of a mental illness (Wilper et al. 2009). The

prevalence of mental disorders among inmates of the Cook County Department of Corrections

was significantly higher than that of the general population, including major depression (3.9%

versus 1.1%), bipolar disorder (1.4% versus 0.1%), and schizophrenia (2.7% versus 0.9%);

overall, the rate of any severe mental disorder among inmates was elevated more than three-fold

(6.4% vs. 1.8%) in comparison to the general population (Teplin 1990). Inmates with major

psychiatric disorders, particularly bipolar disorder, are more likely to return to jail (Baillargeon

et al. 2009). Among inmates, prisoners with any psychiatric disorder were more likely to have

committed violent crimes that prisoners with no psychiatric disorder – this rate was further

elevated among prisoners with schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder (Baillargeon et al.

2009). The association between serious mental illness and violence and arrest is particularly

strong among individuals who are psychotic and do not adhere to medication (Ascher-Svanum et

al. 2006).

Criminal Opportunities and Victimization

       Before considering the causal connection between mental illness and committing a crime,

it is worth mentioning another link between crime and mental illness, through the elevated rates

of victimization experienced by persons with severe mental illness. Issues of reverse causality

may confound associations in this literature as in connections already discussed. Teplin et al.

(2005) matched a sample of 936 patients with severe mental illness to a much larger comparison

group from the National Crime Victimization Survey and found dramatically elevated rates for




                                                                                                       9
the mentally ill. Persons with mental illness were eight times more likely to be robbed, 15 times

more likely to be assaulted and 23 times more likely to be raped than the general population.

Vulnerability of community-based mentally ill makes them easy marks and creates criminal

opportunities contributing to overall criminal activity.10 Vulnerability of persons with mental

illness is exacerbated in prisons. Wolff et al. (2007) found male prisoners in New Jersey who

were mentally ill were three times more likely to be raped that those without mental illness.

Does Mental Illness Cause Crime?

         Are people more likely to commit crimes due to having a mental illness? There are many

routes by which mental illness may make it more likely for an individual to engage in criminal

activity.11 Mental illness disrupts lives and may put people at higher risk for committing crimes

or being victimized. Mental illness interferes with human capital accumulation and wealth

building generally. Some psychotic symptoms, such as feeling threatened, may lead directly to

criminal conduct. Cognitive distortions associated with mental illness may erode interpersonal

relationships and lead individuals to approach situations in maladaptive fashion. Finally, mental

illness can make it more likely that individuals abuse drugs and alcohol, both of which also

contribute to crime.

         Monahan and Steadman (1983) observe that some mental illnesses (such as bipolar

disorder) may predispose individuals to crime whereas others (such as catatonia) may inhibit

many activities including crime. Swanson, Swartz, Van Dorn et al (2008), find a complex mix of

effects of correlates and symptoms of schizophrenia on violence. In particular, negative

psychiatric symptoms (such as social withdrawal) predicted less violence.12 Most of the

                                                                                                  10
empirical research investigating the causal effect of mental illness on crime has concentrated on

serious mental illnesses that blend conditions that may have a positive and negative effect.

        As Link et al. (1992), Skeem et al. (2009) and others have emphasized, interpreting

correlations in community-based studies of illness and self-reported violence and crime is

problematic because mental illness and crime are both associated in complicated causal webs

with disadvantaged social backgrounds: poverty, bad housing, unsafe neighborhoods, among

other factors (Swanson et al., 2002). The poor and disadvantaged are both more likely to commit

crimes and more likely to be in the hands of the state mental health system. Without being able

to control for all of these factors it is difficult to attribute causality to mental illness using data

from a community sample.

        To what degree is the observed correlation between mental illness and crime due to

unmeasured third factors? Skeem et al. (2008) studied 112 parolees with mental illness matched

to an otherwise similar group of parolees without mental illness. The parolees with mental

illness had more antisocial personality patterns, earlier and more diverse criminal histories, more

criminal attitudes and a pattern of generalized trouble in comparison to the non-ill parolees.

These variables, linked to crime, are often unmeasured in empirical investigations and could

account for the observed association between mental illness and criminal behavior.

        It is useful to place our discussion in the context of more general theories of criminal

behavior. Bonta et al. (1998) regard crime as partly a learned behavior (“crime pays”) reinforced

by environments that tolerate crime and criminals, and personality traits, such as impulsivity or

antisocial attitudes. Mental illness has a role within this framework as it may have a direct affect

on personality traits, and an indirect effect on the environments a person spends time. Such a

more general theory also however points up the possibility that causes of crime, like




                                                                                                          11
neighborhood characteristics or even personality are simply correlates of mental illness.

Perspectives from criminology develop broad-based theories of criminal behavior that can

accommodate mental illness, but emphasize other more general factors, such as a life-course

developmental perspective, or a local life circumstances perspective (Fisher, Silver and Wolff,

2006). The life-course perspective, for example, stresses early parenting styles. These theories

are an alternative to conceptualizing crime by persons with mental illness within theories of

mental illness and tend to deemphasize the salience of the illness as a cause of crime.

       Interpretation of a correlation as causation is subject to other hazards. Teplin (1983,

1984) and others refer to the “criminalization of mental illness.” Fisher, Silver and Wolff (2006)

in their review of the conceptual connections between mental illness and crime see

criminalization as in reaction to the stricter requirements for involuntary inpatient psychiatric

treatment imposed in the 1970s. The burden of “social control” of persons with serious mental

illness shifted form the mental health to the criminal justice system. On a day-to-day basis,

criminalization implies that a person with mental illness committing offenses is more likely to be

arrested even with the offending behavior is similar. Higher arrest rates under this explanation

can be accounted for by police reaction to disturbed behavior, not a causal effect of mental

illness. Presumably this explanation is more relevant to less serious and nonviolent crimes, and

the data supporting this contention are equivocal (Fisher, Silver and Wolff, 2006). Conversely,

crime and mental illness could be correlated due to the “psychiatrization of criminal behavior”

noted by Monahan (1973). Aggression, violence, abuse of substances, among other behaviors,

has increasingly fallen within the domain of psychiatry. Those who at one time had been simply

called “bad,” are now instead or in addition labeled “ill.” If we, by definition label criminal

behavior to be mental illness, the positive link is not so much causal as definitional. Some




                                                                                                    12
mental illnesses, like conduct disorder in adolescents, include criminal behavior as symptoms of

the illness itself. This explanation is likely to be more relevant to more serious offenses.

          Studies of the clinical situation and the actual criminal behavior of persons with serious

mental illness have assessed the degree to which offenses are related to the immediate effects of

the symptoms of mental illness. Junginger et al. (2006) and Petersen et al. (2009) both find some

but a small part of the criminal behavior of offenders with mental illness is due to their

immediate symptoms; in Junginger et al. (2006), for example, it is only 8%. (The percentage

was higher, 26%, for substance abuse effects on arrests). The “immediate effect” of symptoms

means that a person may have reacted violently if, by disordered reasoning, he thought he being

threatened. Serious mental illness can put persons in positions of being likely to commit crimes

(e.g. by causing them to be homeless) which would not be accounted for in the methods in these

papers.

          If current illness causes crime, effective treatment for the illness ought to reduce rates of

criminal activity. Another way to test for a causal relationship between serious mental illness

and crime is to see, in a treatment study, if randomization to treatment reduces crime. In effect,

treatment assignment becomes a kind of instrument for illness, avoiding endogeneity of illness

and other social factors. A “no treatment” group for schizophrenia may make such studies hard

to find, however. Reporting results from a prominent trial of treatment for schizophrenia, for

example, Swanson, Swartz, Van Dorn et al (2008) report that violence declined by around 15%

after treatment with antipsychotic medication. The violence reports in this study are pre-post.

Randomization was among alternative drug treatments for schizophrenia, and there, no

differences were found in violence reduction by drug assignment.




                                                                                                      13
       Marcotte and Markowitz (2009) call attention to the contemporaneous drop in violent

crime during the 1990s, and the rapid growth in treatment for mental disorders, particularly drug

treatment that occurred during the same period. Large national surveys estimate that between the

early 1990s and early 2000’s the percent of those with a mental disorder being treated rose from

20.3 percent to 32.9 percent (Kessler, Demler, et al., 2005). In an analysis of a panel of US

states from 1997-2004, they find that violent crime is negatively correlated with rates of

prescriptions for some antidepressants, antipsychotics, and stimulants for ADHD (in separate

models) after adjusting for some other variables likely to affect crime. If those results were

interpreted as causal, the observed growth of medication treatment over their time period would

account for 12 percent of the crime reduction.

       Another perspective on the relationship of mental illness and crime derives from

longitudinal data, permitting the study of childhood mental health problems on adult criminal

behavior. Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder are both

prevalent illnesses whose consequences for many adult outcomes have been subject to study.

ADHD has been linked to risky behaviors, lower academic performance, and poor adult human

capital outcomes (see, e.g., Currie and Stabile, 2006). A recent paper by Fletcher and Wolfe

(2009) uses the large sample from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add

Health) to examine the association between ADHD symptoms and crime in young adulthood.

ADHD is positively associated with a range of criminal outcomes. For example, ADHD

increases the likelihood of being arrested (by a mean age of 22) by four percentage points (on a

sample average of about 12 percent) in a regression with extensive controls for individual,

family, and neighborhood characteristics. A significant positive estimated effect of ADHD is

maintained in a smaller sample identifying the effect off of sibling differences within families.




                                                                                                    14
        This strong research design, extensive controls including family fixed effects in a large

longitudinal data set, is applied in the next section, to study of conduct disorder.



3. Prevention and Treatment of Mental Disorders to Reduce Crime: The Case of Conduct
Disorder

        Conduct disorder is characterized by aggression towards people or animals, property

destruction, deceit or theft, and serious rule violation, and is one of the most prevalent of

childhood mental disorders, with estimated lifetime prevalence rates of about 10% for males and

7% for females (Kessler, Berglund, et al. 2005 and Nock et al. 2006). The median age of onset is

11 years. Childhood onset of conduct disorder, defined as occurring prior to age 10, is regarded

as distinct from adolescent onset at ages 10 and above (Kazdin 2002). Childhood onset is more

likely to be severe and persistent (Nock et al. 2006). Untreated childhood onset is associated

with poor long-term development and poor social and economic outcomes in adulthood (Moffit,

1993). Many behaviors associated with the disorder are indeed criminal, and moderation of the

symptoms of conduct disorder, by definition, reduces criminal activity. No definitional

relationship connects childhood conduct disorder to adult crime. We focus on conduct disorder

in children, and its links to adult criminal activity.

        Children with conduct disorder are at elevated risk to develop adult mental disorders,

drop out of school, abuse substances, and become pregnant as teenagers (Nock et al. 2006,

DHHS, 1999). Conduct disorder has also been associated with adult crime whereas the

association between crime and other childhood mental disorders is generally weaker. We discuss

this evidence in below. Prevention and treatment programs aimed at conduct disorder have been

found to be effective in controlled evaluations (Kazdin, 2002; Farmer et al. 2002). Investment in




                                                                                                    15
treatment and prevention of conduct disorder is a candidate policy for an efficient way to reduce

criminal activity, the issue we investigate in this section.

       3.1 General Framework

       Cunha and Heckman (2007) regard the social and economic capabilities of adults as

being produced by a developmental process that starts in early childhood. Inputs into a child’s

development include parental capabilities, the household and community environment in which

the child grows up, and the investments made in the child and young adult by parents and others

(including the child him or herself). Research in psychiatric epidemiology and developmental

neuroscience calls attention to what might be called “toxic inputs” (our term) into the production

of mental health. Adversity early in life can literally damage the structure of a child’s brain in a

way that increases the likelihood of subsequent mental health problems (National Scientific

Council on the Developing Child, 2008). Toxic inputs include persistent poverty, abuse, neglect,

witnessing domestic violence, and maternal depression (Nock et al. 2006; Rubin et al. 2003;

IOM, 2009). Social programs may be able to counteract some of these negative effects.

Investment in prevention and early treatment of conduct disorders include teaching parenting

skills, treatment of parental substance abuse and depression, early recognition and treatment of

disruptive behavior and training of teachers in management of disruptive behavior (Kazdin 2002,

IOM, 2009).

       3.2. Childhood Conduct Disorder and Adult Crime

       We next consider the connection between childhood conduct disorder and adult crime,

with a focus on the question of whether conduct disorder in childhood can be considered a cause

of adult crime. The causal path could be from early to late mental illness, or from early illness to

a personally and socially disadvantaged young adulthood. We know children with conduct




                                                                                                   16
disorder are less likely to do well in school and otherwise have a troubled adolescence. How

much of this carries over into young adulthood showing up in higher rates of criminal activity?

       Swanson, Van Dorn, Swartz et al. (2008) used data from a large clinical trial on

treatment for schizophrenia to compare rates of violence in adults in patients who did and did not

have conduct disorders as children. Rates of violence were significantly higher among patients

who had had conduct disorder problems, and the rate of elevation varied uniformly with the

number of conduct problems, even in the presence of extensive controls, including substance use.

The investigators also found that medication adherence was associated with lower violence only

among adults with schizophrenia who did not have a history of antisocial conduct as children.

       Large longitudinal data sets enable the study of the relationship between childhood

conduct disorders and consequences in later life. The U.K. collects data on birth cohorts

enabling longitudinal analyses of birth cohorts from 1946, 1958, and 1970 (Sainsbury Center for

Mental Health, 2009). The 1946 cohort of 5,362 people was followed until age 53. The 1958

cohort included 17,416 people followed up first at age 7 and until age 45. The 1970 cohort

consisted of 16, 571 subjects with the first follow-up at age 5, continuing until age 34. In each

cohort questions were asked of each child’s parents and teachers that enable conduct and other

emotional problems to be identified. The 1958 and 1970 cohorts used the Rutter A scale and the

1946 cohort used a prequel to the scale (Rutter et al. 1970).

       Recent analyses of the 1958 and 1970 cohorts examine the relationship between

childhood and adolescent conduct problems and adult criminal activity (Sainsbury Center for

Mental Health, 2009). Analysis of the 1958 cohort estimated the relation between the presence

of either a severe or mild conduct problem during the teenage years on adult offending between

ages 32 and 42. Analysis of the 1970 cohort estimated the relation between severe and mild




                                                                                                    17
conduct problems and lifetime offending up to age 34. Logit models stratified by gender and

controlling for IQ and father’s occupation revealed elevated rates of adult offending (arrested,

convicted of a crime) for people with severe conduct problems as teenagers in the 1958 cohort.

The estimated relative odds for men were between 1.1 and 1.9 compared to otherwise similar

people without conduct disorder. Analysis of the 1970 cohort linked severe conduct problems at

age 5 and offending between the ages of 16 and 34. The estimated logit models showed the

relative odds of being arrested for men were 3.4 fold and 2 fold for women, and the relative odds

of being convicted of a crime for men was 1.4 times that for men without childhood conduct

problems of any kind. The corresponding estimate for women was 1.5. Analyses of severe

conduct problems during early adolescence and lifetime offending between 16 and 34 years of

age showed relative odds of being arrested for men was about 4 times that for people with no

history of conduct problems. Women with severe conduct problems in adolescents had relative

odds that were 5 times those for women with no history of conduct problems. These estimates

are consistent with but do not establish causality because there are a variety of unobserved

factors that might affect both the development of conduct problems and criminal behavior later

in life.

           Nagin and Tremblay (1999) followed a cohort of 1037 boys in Montreal, Canada to

investigate the effects of externalizing disorders, including indicators of conduct disorder, to

juvenile delinquency. Aggression and oppositional behavior persisted from childhood into

adolescence. Fergusson et al. (2005) studied a 25-year cohort of 973 children beginning at age 7

to 9 in New Zealand. Conduct problems were identified through teacher and parent interviews.

A variety of educations, economic and social outcomes were measured at age 25, including

criminal and anti-social behavior. The authors controlled for a variety of individual and family




                                                                                                   18
covariates including child and family adversity, family socioeconomic status, parent educational

background, family stability (divorce, single motherhood, domestic violence), demographics

(ethnicity, age of parents) and child cognitive ability. The analysis compared children with rates

of conduct problems in the top 5% at ages 7-9 with those below the median. Multivariate

analysis showed that those in the top 5% of the distribution of conduct problems had rates of

property offenses that were 3 times those below the median (15.3% v 4.8%), rates of violent

offenses that were roughly four time those below the median (15.9% v. 3.9%) and rates of

arrest/conviction nearly 5 times higher (19.5% v 4.2%).

       Currie and Stabile (2007) use the U.S. National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY)

and the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) to study the

effect of mental and emotional problems in children on educational and behavioral outcomes.

They measure behavior for the Canadian children age 4 to 11 years in 1994 and observe

outcomes for the same children in 2002. For the NLSY they examine children aged 4 to 11 in

1994 and outcomes measured in 1998-2004. To address the problem of unobserved factors in an

analysis seeking a causal relationship, they examine households with multiple children and

including a household fixed effect. Thus, estimates of the impact of early life behavior problems

on subsequent delinquency in young adults are identified based on differences between siblings

growing up in the same household. Children with higher levels of antisocial and aggressive

behavior at ages 4-11 are more likely to display delinquency as young adults. The results were

similar for both the U.S. and Canadian cohorts.

       We pursue a similar analysis of the NLSY as that conducted by Currie and Stabile (2007)

but focus on behavior problems at the most serious end of the spectrum for children ages 6 to 9

years. Specifically, we create an indicator for a child with behavioral problems that are in the




                                                                                                   19
top decile of the age specific population. We also construct an indicator of whether the symptom

scale is between the 50th and 89th percentile of the age specific population. Like Currie and

Stabile (2007), we estimate the impact of conduct problems on expulsion/suspension from school

and the likelihood of having been arrested/convicted by age 16 using household (mother) fixed

effects, thereby basing identification on sibling differences.

           We identified 6329 children living in multiple-child households where at least two

children had reached age 15 in 2008. Item non-response reduced the sample size for the

suspended/expelled and arrested/convicted regressions.13 Descriptive statistics from the

estimation samples are included in Table 1. Note that the percentage of children in our sample

who exceed the 90th percentile on the BPI antisocial scale is about 24 percent for each outcome,

indicating that the children in this sample are considerably more disturbed than a nationally

representative sample. The NLSY data guide acknowledges that the BPI distribution was above

national values in the early rounds of the NLSY, possibly due to oversampling children born to

younger and less-educated women.

           Table 2 contains the results from three models, one with no controls, one with controls

listed in the Table, and one adding family fixed effects to the analysis. The dependent variable is

the 0-1 suspension/explusion by age 17. All models are estimated with a linear probability

models by a GLM. Key regressors are indicators of externalizing disorder symptoms (measured

at the 50-89th percentile and the 90+ percentile) and the household fixed effects.

            The estimated coefficient for the 90th percentile for the externalizing disorder score is

positive and significant for being suspended/expelled in all specifications, though the estimated

magnitude drops as controls and then fixed effects are added. Having a high level of symptoms

of externalizing disorder increases the likelihood of being suspended or expelled by age 17 by
13
     A delinquency scale was asked only in 1994, 1996 and 1998, and led to a smaller sample size.


                                                                                                        20
14.3 percentage points in the model with fixed effects. The sample mean for suspended/expelled

is about 21% so this estimate implies a large elevation in the risk.

       Table 3 contains the results bearing directly on criminal activity, with specifications and

analysis identical to those described for Table 2. The estimated impact of high levels of

externalizing disorder symptoms on probability of being arrested/convicted prior to age 16 and

on the delinquency score are positive and significant in all models, including with family fixed

effects where the point estimate indicates a 5 percentage point elevation on a base of about

4.6%, another large increase. To argue that the estimated effects in Tables 2 and 3 are causal,

we need to rely on the longitudinal research design with family fixed effects to control for

pervasive unobserved factors that might lead to both conduct disorder problems and later

behavioral problems. Overall, our findings are consistent with early conduct disorder causing

later criminal involvement. Of course if delinquency in teen years is seen simply as a

continuation of externalizing disorder in younger children identifying this “cause” does not help

much in understanding the developmental process behind the later criminal behavior.

       3.2. Cost Effectiveness of Prevention of Conduct Disorder

       Another way to approach the question of whether extension of mental health treatment to

a high-risk group reduces criminal behavior is to examine the results of social programs

changing access to, in this case, children with conduct disorder. A variety of prevention and

treatment programs aim to reduce the individual and social impacts of conduct disorder.

Effective prevention of conduct disorders requires identification of at-risk populations and

interventions in place early in a child’s life (Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group,




                                                                                                   21
1992; IOM, 2009). While a number of prevention interventions have been shown to be effective

we focus on prevention interventions where cost-effectiveness has also been assessed.14

        A pair of meta analyses identifies prevention programs for which measured benefits,

including in terms of crime reduction, exceed costs (Aos et al. 2001, 2004). These are Nurse-

Home visitation programs targeted at low income single mothers; Parent Child Interaction

Therapy; Home Visiting Programs for At-Risk Mothers, and the Good Behavior Game

(delivered in school). Overall the early childhood home visitation programs reviewed by Aos and

colleagues (2004) yielded net social benefits of about $6000 per child in 2003 dollars. The Good

Behavior Game which uses behavioral techniques in the classroom to prevent conduct problems

from developing yielded small positive benefits of less than $200 per child.

        More recently Foster and colleagues (2005) conducted a cost-effectiveness study of the

Fast Track program which focuses specifically on prevention of conduct disorder and violence.

The program was likely to be cost effective (70%) when targeted at high risk children but had a

less than 1% chance of being cost effective when applied to the general population in “high risk”

communities.

        3.3. Cost Effectiveness of Treatment for Conduct Disorder

        Kazdin (2002) identifies 550 psychosocial treatments for conduct disorder in children and

youth, noting paradoxically that treatments with the strongest evidence base are those less

frequently applied in practice.15 The treatments most frequently used to treat conduct disorder

are psychodynamic psychotherapy, eclectic psychotherapies and family therapy. Few of these are


14
   Only a small portion of all the interventions that have been shown to be effective have been subjected to
economic evaluations (IOM, 2009 Chapter 9 p.254). Furthermore, where economic evaluations have been done, the
report notes that the findings are subject to considerable uncertainty from low statistical power, short follow-up
periods, and generalizability outside of research contexts.
15
   Psychosocial treatments are emphasized because existing research suggests that pharmacotherapies are not
effective in treatment of conduct disorder.


                                                                                                                22
supported by evidence of effectiveness.16 Kazdin (2002) identified five main classes of evidence

based treatments for conduct disorder. They are Parent Management Training (PMT),

Multisystemic Therapy (MST), Problem Solving Skills Training (PSST), Functional Family

Therapy (FFT) and Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT). Recently, the National Institute for

Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom issued a technology appraisal guideline

indicating that parent training programs were cost-effective in treating conduct disorder (NICE,

2006).

           PMT, MST, FFT and a program that combines several of these elements known as the

Incredible Years program have been subject to economic evaluations. Parent Management

Training (PMT) trains parents to modify their child’s behavior at home and in the context of their

family. PMT is based on the theory that poor parenting is a source of conduct disorder. Parents

are trained to identify problem behaviors and to intervene in ways that do not reinforce bad

behavior. NICE (2006) concluded that PMT was cost-effective in relation to usual care of

conduct disorder due to savings from the health and education sectors. Some evidence of

reduced crime related activity has been reported in outcome studies but the net economic

consequences for criminal activity have not been established (Brestan and Eyberg, 1998).

            Multi Systemic Therapy extends PMT by adding other types of skills and treatment

including family communication skills, marital therapy, and problem solving therapy among

others. Aos and Barnoski (1998) estimated significant net cost savings for MST, on the order of

$13,000 in 1997. Aos et al. (2004) conducted a later review of MST on the application of the

technology to violent offending youth aged 12 to17 years. The assessment was based on three

evaluations of MST targeted at offending youth. MST incurred direct costs of $4,473 on average

in year 2000 dollars, whereas the savings to the criminal justice system were estimated at
16
     An exception is Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT), discussed below.


                                                                                               23
$31,661. The large benefits in this study appear to stem from the highly targeted nature of the

populations treated with MST.

           Functional Family Therapy (FFT) was evaluated in Washington State (Washington State

Institute for Public Policy, 2004) by randomly assigning youth offenders to FFT, MST,

Aggression Replacement Training (ART) or a waiting list (with usual care).17 FFT focuses on

teaching families to change problematic family behaviors through the development of problem

solving skills. Families participate in 12 therapy visits over a 90-day period. ART is a group

therapy method administered to youth offenders for 30 hours over a 10 week period. It focuses

on teaching youth to control impulses and anger. Therapists running the groups received

intensive training and their adherence to the ART model was measured. ART has been widely

adopted by juvenile courts in Washington State. The meta analysis by Aos et al. (2004) estimated

savings, based on four controlled evaluations, of $10 to $30 in criminal justice spending for each

dollar of direct program spending.

           The Washington State evaluation found no significant differences between rates of

overall recidivism or felony recidivism between FFT, ART and the controls. However, for

therapists that adhere to the treatment the two experimental programs yielded savings of between

$10 and $12 for each dollar of program spending. This analysis however, sacrifices the virtues of

randomization since adherence rates may be associated with a variety of unmeasured

characteristics of the youths assigned to different therapists. Furthermore, fidelity to program

design is higher in experimental than real-world settings, implying that the overall results might

be more of what we could expect in non-experimental settings rather than results for the

therapists with the greatest fidelity.

           3.4. Summary Comment

     Implementation problems for MST limited the ability to evaluate the MST intervention.


                                                                                                   24
        Evidence from longitudinal surveys in the New Zealand, the U.K., Canada and the U.S.

imply that the association between early life conduct problems and later criminal activity is

partly causal. Prevention and treatment programs have potential to reduce the economic and

social costs of crime stemming from conduct disorder to a degree that may more than pay for

treatment. Some studies yield very favorable payoffs in terms of lowering criminal justice costs

from investment in treatment and prevention. However, this potential has not been clearly

established in the real world of the constrained, poorly coordinated, unevenly staffed social

service, education, and criminal justice sectors.



4. Mental Health Treatment for Offenders

       An obvious high-risk candidate group for enhanced investment in mental health treatment

is those how have already offended and are at some stage in the criminal justice system. The

left-hand side of Figure 3 depicts a typical sequence of events for an offender. After a policy

encounter, arrest and arraignment, the accused proceeds to trial, and if found guilty, is sentenced

to prison or jail. Eventually the offender would be released to the community and may be put on

probation, remaining for some period under the supervision of the criminal justice system.

       Movement down the left hand side is slow, expensive and may not be effective in

forestalling future problems, especially for people with serious mental illnesses. At virtually

every step in the process interventions addressing role of mental illness have been devised to

divert the offender from the criminal justice system; some of these are indicated in Figure 3.

Some police officers have special training in mental health issues and are trained to handle

mentally ill offenders with recognition of the role of symptoms and illness in behavior. Mental

health courts, reviewed in detail below, are an alternative to regular court trials. Judges in these




                                                                                                   25
courts work with mental health system professionals, more actively supervise progress, and

employ jail-prison as a backup for lapses in progress. Mental health courts are one but not the

only way that offenders, upon release, can be referred and in many cases forced to receive

community treatment (such as medication and counseling). During the probation period, some

jurisdictions use probation officers with special training and who specialize in persons with

mental illness.

           Criminal justice system involvement identifies good targets for intervention, and,

furthermore, enforces a link between offenders and mental health treatment. One would expect

that closely targeted mental health treatment, with sanctions of the criminal justice system

backing up adherence, would have a good chance of being cost-effective. We review here the

evidence for mental health interventions associated with mental health courts and mandated

community treatment, two prominent policies diverting offenders from the left-hand side of

Figure 3.18

           4.1 Mental Health Courts

           Mental Health Courts (MHCs) are alternatives to regular courts for offenders whose

mental illness may have contributed to their criminality, and employ resources of both the

criminal justice and the mental health system within a framework of therapeutic jurisprudence

(Wexler and Winick 1991). Therapeutic jurisprudence is based on the principle that punishment

should not be the sole concern of the courts, but rather the well-being of the accused as well as

the potential mitigating circumstances regarding mental health are required for a more complete

sense of justice (Rottman and Casey, 1999). MHCs were modeled on drug courts established

earlier (Steadman et al. 2001), with the important distinction that while drug possession and use

are crimes, having a mental illness is not. The monitoring-sanctioning function of MHCs thus

                                                                                                    26
works differently than drug courts, and the enforced treatment handed down by MHCs is also

more controversial than treatment mandates set for drug offenders (Slate and Johnson, 2008).

         Broward County, Florida, established the first MHC in 1997, one county north from the

nation’s first drug court in Dade (Poythress et al. 2002). Broward’s MHC was established with

the goals of making sure mentally ill patients were released from jail in a timely fashion, got

connected with both legal representation and mental health resources, and were oriented well in a

return to the community (Cristy et al. 2005). MHCs have proliferated, mainly in southern and

western states (Slate and Johnson, 2008). By December, 2005, the National Alliance for the

Mentally Ill (2005) counted 113 courts; Steadman recently estimated that there are about 150

courts in operation (Slate and Johnson, 2008).19 The Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime

Reduction Act of 2003 awards grants to counties for mental health courts or other court-based

programs fueling growth of MHCs. Research on MHCs must contend with local idiosyncrasies

(Steadman et al. 2001), and the malleable nature of court administration (Bernstein and Seltzer,

2003).

         MHCs are usually defined as courts with a separate docket for mentally ill

patients with specialized personnel to handle the cases. Courts set criminal and mental

health criteria for selecting candidates (Redlich et al. 2005).20 To establish leverage,

some MHCs require that the defendant enter a guilty plea (Bernstein and Seltzer, 2003).
19
  There is no consensus on the definition of a MHC (Christy et al., 2005).
20
  Some courts test potential clients after the initial arrest, and some require confirmed diagnosis before considering
the candidate eligible for treatment. Referrals to MHCs come from law enforcement personnel, court personnel,
district attorneys, public defenders or patient families. In an early study of 20 MHCs, Bernstein and Seltzer (2003)
report that four courts excluded offenders with any history of violent behavior. Ten courts accepted offenders with
felony charges, and ten were restricted to those with misdemeanor only charges. In Broward County, referrals to the
MHC must come post-arrest and may only come from other judges, district attorneys or lawyers for the defense
(Christy et al. 2005). Redlich et al. (2005) distinguish between what they refer to as first and second-generation
MHCs. Those following the Broward County model, accepting only misdemeanor patients, are termed first
generation courts. Second generation courts modify the Broward County model on four dimension: “(a) type of
charges the court accepts (felony vs. misdemeanor), (b) type of adjudicative model the courts follow (pre- vs.
postadjudication), (c) sanctions used in the court (specifically the expressed willingness to use jail as a sanction),
and (d) supervision of MHC participants (mental health vs. criminal justice professionals).” (Redlich et al. 2005)


                                                                                                                   27
Discharge from an MHC may take months or years, and may extend well beyond the time

a defendant would have spent in jail had he followed the normal route of criminal justice.

Although mental health courts may help mentally ill offenders avoid jail time, they are

designed to incur additional costs in terms of MHC supervision and contacts, and in the

mental health treatment system.

         MHCs have been studied from several perspectives. Legal scholars question the concept

of therapeutic jurisprudence and whether offenders with mental illness are competent to abdicate

their rights to regular judicial processing including jury trial (Slobogin 1995, Allen and Smith,

2001). Others question whether clients in MHCs should be coerced or “leveraged” into

treatment (Griffin et al. 2002).21 MHCs mandate the mental health system to treat court-

supervised clients at a high priority, and in a setting with limited community-based resources,

some other clients, possibly with greater need from a clinical perspective, will be crowded out

(Clark 2004; Goldkamp and Iron-Guynn 2000; Steadman et al. 2001; Watson et al. 2001).22

Discretion in application of who is “appropriate” for MHCs, access to mental health courts may

not be fair, in the sense of leading to systematic discriminating on the basis of gender or race.23


21
   See Monahan et al. (2005) for an empirical review of the application of “leverage” in mental health courts.
22
   In principle, any impact of “queue-jumping” on the mental health system should be taken into account in
evaluating the impact of MHCs, this is very difficult to do in practice (Wolff 2002, Petrila 2003). In resource
constrained mental health systems, persons with mental illness have incentives to offend in order to access
treatment, an “unintended consequence” referred to by a number of observers (Sinaiko and McGuire 2006, Wolff
2002).
23
   MHC clientele differ systematically from traditional criminal caseloads. Referring agents may select for ‘good’
risks based upon personal characteristics. Steadman et al. (2005) studied selection in seven MHCs concluding that
older, white females tend to be preferentially referred to MHCs. Naples et al. (2007) confirmed the Steadman
finding in that older, white women without felony or violent charges (even among courts that accept felony cases)
appear to be preferentially selected for entry into mental health court. The other way to state these results is that
young Black males are less likely to be referred to MHCs. Whether this represents unfair discrimination or
decisions based on application of reasonable criteria for likely success in MHCs has not been established. Fairness is
an issue in other application of mental health treatments for criminal justice populations, though the treatment is not
always regarded as a positive as in the case of MHCs. Blacks are more, not less likely to be referred to mandated
outpatient treatment, though in the case of New York State at least, this is due to Blacks’ overrepresentation in the
denominator population of those at risk for crime with extensive contact with the public mental health system rather
than any race-based discrimination by referring agents. See Swanson et al (2009).


                                                                                                                    28
         Our main interest is evaluation of MHCs from the standpoint of their impact on criminal

justice and mental health system outcomes and costs. Table 3 summarizes the findings of eight

case studies of particular courts. The reports are generally positive, but study designs are not

uniformly strong.24

         Cosden (2003) investigated the Santa Barbara MHC/ACT system for clients that received

MHC treatment compared to TAU using a randomized design. Clients in the MHC system

reported marginally better quality of life increases, but similar criminal outcomes in terms of

number of times arrested and time in jail. Cosden notes however, that MHC patients had less

intensive jail stays and were more frequently released with no charge.

         Ridgely et al. (2007) studied the Allegheny County (Pittsburgh, PA) MHC, oriented to

non-violent offenders (though some aggravated assault cases are admitted). The court accepts

only those individuals with a documented diagnosis of mental illness and requires a guilty plea

be entered before beginning the MHC intervention. Like most MHCs, the intervention is a form

of monitored probation with integrated community treatment and ‘reinforcement hearings’ in the

MHC. Participants are discharged as having completed the program, potentially earlier than a

normal sentence, after the MHC team rules treatment to have been effective. The pre-post

component of the study yielded savings after one year and even larger savings, over $9,000 over


24
   Hendrickx et al. (2005) studied the MHC in Clark County Nevada using a 12-month pre-post time comparison.
Crime dropped after MHC participation, and dropped most for those completing court participation. Boothroyd et
al. (2005) and Christy et al. (2005) studied mental health and criminal justice outcomes, respectively, for the
Broward court, comparing trends for MHC participants from a matched group of misdemeanants from Hillsborough
County. Although the MHC participants were more likely to be linked to treatment, this did not improve mental
health outcomes. Christy reported mainly favorable criminal justice outcomes.
Compared to offenders handled in regular court, Moore (2006) finds reduced recidivism in a MHC in the
southeastern U.S., particularly for those completing MHC. Trupin (2003) investigated the effect of MHCs in Seattle
on recidivism, clinical outcome measures and severity. In a pre-post comparison, recidivism dropped. Notably,
offenders were in jail longer pre-booking with MHCs, offsetting any savings in reduced recidivism. McNiel (2007)
examined the San Francisco county MHC which included violent offenders. Compared to a matched sample,
recidivism fell 55%, but McNiel cautioned that the propensity matching may not be picking up unobservable
characteristics related to being “most likely to violently reoffend,” biasing findings in favor of the MHC, a problem
plaguing the nonexperimental studies.


                                                                                                                  29
two years. The savings were largely in the form of reduced jail days, set against estimated MHC

and mental health system costs. Investigators attempted to compensate for weaknesses of the

pre-post design by construction of a hypothetical counterfactual group. With the assumptions

behind this hypothetical group, Ridgely et al. (2007) believed there would be a net savings from

MHCs if subjects were followed at least for two years.

        The evidence is highly uneven on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MHCs.

Some but not all of the evaluations of MHCs point to a reduction in criminal activity associated

with participation in the court. Little evidence connects the mental treatment component of the

mental health court to these positive outcomes. In some studies mental health outcomes were not

evaluated. In others there was a weak or no effect, even when the criminal justice outcomes

were affected (as in the Broward evaluations). Good cost data to evaluate the cost-effectiveness

of this set of interventions is essentially absent.

        4.2 Voluntary and Involuntary Community Treatment

        By voluntary treatment we have in mind the typical client-provider relationship in which

treatment is sought freely by the client, who may terminate treatment at any time, and

symmetrically, the provider is under no obligation, other than due to normal professional

responsibility, to treat the client. Access to public and private mental health care is restricted by

non-price rationing, such as capacity constraints. Relaxation of these constraints will lead to

more use, and possibly reduction in criminal justice costs. Expansion of access to voluntary

treatment for mental health care is generally not done for the purpose of affecting the criminal

justice system. Any such offset would be a kind of bonus over and above the main purpose of

providing good mental health care to those who need it.




                                                                                                   30
         Two studies of the introduction of managed mental health care in King County (Seattle),

Washington, investigate how an exogenous shift in the availability of community-based mental

health services affects jail use.25 For Medicaid enrollees in 1995, a prospective payment system

replaced a fee-for-service payment system to community-based mental health care providers in

Seattle, giving them new incentives to “manage care.” Managed care introduces an incentive to

providers to reduce costs and even to “cost shift” care of persons with mental illness to other

sectors, such as jails. The authors posit this incentive may affect jail use: “If managed care

worsens access to adequate mental health treatment and resulting worsened mental health status

leads to more criminal offenses, then jail detentions should increase.” (Norton et al. 2006, p720)

         Outpatient mental health costs fell after the introduction of managed care, and according

to the analysis in Domino et al. (2004) of about 40,000 Medicaid enrollees, in which non-

Medicaid enrollees were used as a control group, managed mental health care resulted in a 5

percent increase in the likelihood of jail for a typical Medicaid enrollee (on a base rate of about 3

percentage points). In a subsequent analysis of a subset of 6800 persons who were likely to be

severely mentally ill, however, the authors found no effect of managed care on the likelihood of

jail (Norton et al. 2006).26

         Involuntary outpatient commitment, sometimes euphemistically referred to as “assisted

outpatient commitment” is a form of civil commitment for persons with mental illness modeled

on earlier civil commitment to inpatient care. Under involuntary outpatient commitment laws, a

court determines that a person is remanded to care of the mental health system. The subject is




25
  Domino et al (2004) and Norton et al (2006) are essentially the same research team.
26
  The statistical methods of the two studies are quite different (two-part model vs Markov model), leaving it unclear
how to understand the different findings of the two studies.


                                                                                                                  31
obliged to get care and the system is obliged to give it to him.27 Patient non-compliance can

result in transport to an inpatient facility to be evaluated for an involuntary inpatient admission.

The impression patients have that they are required to comply with treatment is probably more

powerful than any actual legal sanction (Borum et al., 1999). Maximum available sanctions are

not always employed. More than forty states have some provision for outpatient commitment,

and although the primary legislative intention behind assisted commitment is to convince

noncompliant but needy patients to get treatment, outpatient commitment is probably the most

prevalent policy with the potential for using the mental health system to avoid crime and

criminal justice costs. Outpatient commitment can be evaluated from numerous perspectives, its

ethical principles, the experience of coercion, improvements in mental health, as well as its

impact on criminal justice (Monahan, 2008; Swartz et al. 2002).

           The Duke Mental Health Study (Swartz et al. 2001) recruited 331 persons committed by

a court in North Carolina to community treatment, and randomly assigned about half of these to

be released from the orders. Both groups had access to enhanced mental health care, so the

randomization is associated with mandating, not the availability of services. A reduction in

arrests was associated with extended outpatient commitment for a subset of seriously ill patients

(Swanson et al., 2001). The comparison in this paper is no or short versus extended commitment

without randomization. The experimental vs. control group found no significant differences in

arrests.

           New York State (NYS) established an outpatient commitment law (Chapter 408 of the

Laws of 1999) known as Kendra’s Law, named after a young woman pushed in front of a

subway train in New York City by a man with serious mental illness. NYS evaluated the law

  “Mandated” or involuntary treatment can commit the client to go to care, the provider to supply care, or both. See
Sinaiko and McGuire (2006) for discussion and classification.


                                                                                                                 32
itself (NYS OMH, 2005), and commissioned an independent evaluation (Swartz et al., 2009). In

addition, researchers have studied the law’s impact (Link, 2010).

        NYS created strict criteria for a person to be eligible for assisted outpatient treatment

(AOT) including illness, dangerousness, noncompliance history, and likelihood of benefiting

from AOT (Swanson et al 2009). By December 2004, 3,493 had received court-ordered

treatment through AOT. New York State’s evaluation used a pre-post design and showed very

large favorable changes comparing the six-month period prior to AOT assignment to the months

afterwards. Rates of incarceration fell from 23% pre to 3% during AOT (NYS OMH, 2005,

p.18). Arrests fell from 30% to 5%; psychiatric hospitalization from 97-22%; homelessness

from 19% to 5%. In the NY evaluation, AOT assignment is catching individuals at a time of

crisis, and they are likely to have improved in any case without AOT.

        Link (2010) compared 76 individuals assigned to AOT with 108 patients recently

discharged from a psychiatric hospital. Matching via propensity scores he found the AOT group

had significantly lower rates of suicide risk, serious violent behavior, and better illness-related

social functioning. Interestingly the AOT group reported less subjective coercion associated

with treatment compared to the non AOT group. This matched, cross-sectional, post design

relies heavily on the ability to find comparable patients to those assigned to AOT.

        Involuntary outpatient commitment shows some promise in improving both mental health

and reducing crime. Costs, however, have not yet been systematically studied, and they key

question of how the costs of enhanced outpatient treatment stack up against any savings in

criminal justice has not yet been answered.28



28
  Ongoing research on Kendra’s Law will address this issue. The costs of enhanced services for criminal offenders
through involuntary treatment generally fall on the public mental health system. If this system is capacity-
constrained, the cost will be manifest as other patients not getting treatment. See Sinaiko and McGuire (2006) for


                                                                                                                33
5. Conclusions

         As others have argued, persons who are severely mentally ill should be offered treatment,

independently of any social externalities that might flow to others (Monahan and Appelbaum,

2000). This paper bears on whether extra priority ought to be put on services for persons with

mental illness who also commit crimes, in terms of providing these individuals better access,

more extensive treatment, or even in terms of imposing sanctions against not adhering to

treatment. The potential spillover benefits – less crime, lower criminal justice costs – are

experienced by others, not the patient, implying the patient would put little weight on them in

deciding about treatment, and creating the classic externality rationale for special subsidy or

quantity targets.

         The correlation between serious mental illness and crime, especially based on criminal

justice-involved samples, lends curb-appeal to the case for special priority. Time-series data are

also highly suggestive of a close connection between mental illness and the way we manage it,

and crime. Frank and Glied (2006) tracked the living arrangements of persons with serious and

persistent mental illness (SPMI) over the 50-years between 1950 and 2000.

“Deinstitutionalization” reduced the percent of persons with SPMI in psychiatric hospitals from

23 percent to seven percent over this period; during the same period, the percent of persons with

SPMI residing in jails and prisons went from one percent to five percent.29 These associations

do not of course amount to a sound case for elevated priority.




discussion, and Swanson, Van Dorn, Swartz et al. (unpublished) for evidence that in the early phase of the
implementation of Kendra’s Law, there was some “crowd-out” effect.
29
   As Frank and Glied point out, the increasing incarceration rates in the 80s and 90s swept up larger portions of
criminals in the net, including those with mental illness.



                                                                                                                     34
        Researchers do find some convincing causal connection between mental illness and

crime, but it is not large, and it is specific to certain groups of patients at certain stages of their

illness. The case for broad-based expansion of mental health prevention or treatment would need

to rest on grounds other than crime reduction. We identified some potential areas for effective

care targeted to high-risk groups, youth offenders with conduct disorders and adults with serious

mental illness. Some criminal justice offsets seem to follow enhanced mental health services for

these groups.

        The strength of the evidence for positive spillover is not overwhelming. Two recent

reviews came to similar conclusions about the limited role of crime-related arguments for putting

more resources into mental health care. Skeem et al., (2009) conclude that while “theoretically,

effective psychiatric treatment would reduce recidivism for the subgroup of offenders for whom

mental illness has a direct effect on criminal behavior,” there is no evidence to date “that

insufficient psychiatric treatment causes criminal justice involvement for this population.” (p.

16). Fisher, Silver and Wolff (2006), referring to the high prevalence of persons with mental

illness in the criminal justice system: “…Targeting mental health treatment services as “the”

problem and “the” solution is … likely ineffective as a means of addressing this issue.” (p.548)

        The evidence on criminal justice impacts needs to be understood within the context of the

package of social needs and deficits bearing on this group. Among disadvantaged populations

with elevated rates of crime, homelessness, welfare, and poverty, effective mental health care

produces joint products, better mental health, and better social functioning, including less crime

and its associated costs. To judge the value in relation to cost of mental health care, it is

insufficient to track just one of the potential joint products and compare value in this one sphere

to the costs. Although the interventions reviewed here have in common that they seek to




                                                                                                          35
improve mental health and functioning as well as impact criminal justice, the scope of each type

of program, and the need to take into account a range of factors, differs across intervention types.

       The most focused intervention we covered is the mental health court. These courts are

adjuncts to the criminal justice system, and their costs and benefits are directed primarily to

criminal justice considerations. Rigorous evaluation of mental health courts are lacking, in spite

of the years of experience in many jurisdictions with the courts. Cost data are particularly

needed. Comparison of the full social cost, of crime, criminal justice, court operation, and the

mental health system will lead to an accounting of a sufficient set of effects to make a

determination of the net value of this policy. Based on the evidence available to date, it seems

unlikely that any effect of mental health courts is not mediated through improvement in the

mental health of the offenders under supervision. If this turns out to be correct, it may suggest

ways to economize on mental health treatment per se, and make an effort to identify the active

ingredient in the “mental health” court.

       Involuntary outpatient treatment is more complex for purposes of evaluation than mental

health courts. Involuntary treatment can be targeted to the set of patients/offenders who are most

likely to benefit from treatment both from a clinical as well as a criminal justice standpoint. The

criminal justice/mental health cost-effectiveness of this policy is an important but one piece of

the set of information needed to conduct a social evaluation. Cost-effectiveness is ill-suited to

valuing the subjective and ethical social costs of coercion associated with involuntary treatment.

In practice, those committed to involuntary treatment seem only mildly bothered by the coercion,

but this finding does not fully answer the ethical question about whether society should be

forcing mental health care.
