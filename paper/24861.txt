Wilderness Conservation and the Reach of the State: Evidence from National Borders in the

                                          ABSTRACT

Preserving wilderness ecosystems in developing countries is challenging because their remote
location places them far from state control. We investigate this using 30x30 meter satellite data to
determine how Amazonian deforestation changes discretely at the Brazilian international border.
In 2000, Brazilian pixels were 30 percent more likely to be deforested, and between 2001 and
2005 annual Brazilian deforestation was more than 3 times the rate observed across the border. In
2006, just after Brazil introduces policies to reduce illegal deforestation, these differences
disappear. These results demonstrate the power of the state to affect whether wilderness
ecosystems are conserved or exploited.

1     Introduction
A central challenge in global conservation is that the ecosystems to be preserved are, by
their very nature, extremely remote. In many developing country contexts, governments
can project some authority in national or regional capital cities, but in frontier areas,
their authority becomes much weaker (Herbst, 2000; Michalopoulos and Papaioannou,
2014). This, in turn, may open up opportunities for illegal extraction. Because wilderness
ecosystems, which represent about 20 percent of the world’s land area (Allan et al., 2017),
are by definition in the hinterlands, it is an open question whether the state can have
effective reach so far from the bastions of state power. Despite substantial de jure rules
that restrict development and promote conservation, states may have little room to affect
de facto what happens in these outlying locations.
    This paper explores the degree to which the state can exert regulatory control over
these remote wilderness areas by examining whether there are discrete changes in defor-
estation at national borders. Because political and hence policy jurisdictions stop at the
national border – but satellite data on conservation outcomes can be measured uniformly
across the geography – by analyzing satellite data on deforestation at the international
border we can examine the effect of national policies in these remote locations.
    We focus on one of the most important global wilderness ecosystems – the Amazon
rainforest. Covering more than 2 million square miles – about the size of the contiguous
United States west of the Mississippi River – the Amazon plays a crucial role in the
global carbon cycle and hosts an astounding amount of biological diversity. Its immense
size implies that the rate at which it is deforested will affect the pace of global warming
(IPBES, 2018). Hence understanding whether conservation efforts by Amazonian nation
states are effective is an issue of international importance. Indeed if these national policies
have no de facto bite then this renders meaningless both national and international accords
to slow Amazonian deforestation.
    To study the impact of national policy in the Amazon, we use a new annual 30 meter
resolution Landsat 7 data set which allows us to monitor deforestation in a consistent
manner over time and space from 2000 to 2014 (Hansen et al., 2013). The high resolution
allows us to zoom in close to the border – our preferred specification uses a bandwidth of
only 17km on either side of the national border – to identify precise effects. We show that
areas on both sides of the border look similar in most important geographic respects, such
as slope and distances to urban areas, water, and roads. While our focus is on results
analyzing the entire 12,800km Brazilian border in the Amazon, we find similar results
restricting attention to “artificial borders”, i.e. typically straight lines drawn in unknown
territory by former colonizers and which do not correspond to any preexisting natural
or institutional border (Alesina et al., 2011). For these borders, there is no geographic


                                              1
feature at the border – and indeed, usually not even so much as a fence.1
    We investigate the role of national regulation of deforestation by running spatial re-
gression discontinuity designs, using as running variable the distance to the Brazilian
national border. This paper therefore fits within a rich literature using borders to look at
policy effects.2 Before proceeding to empirical estimation, we present a brief theoretical
model that clarifies precisely what this type of estimation does, and does not, recover.
This makes it clear that changes in national environmental regulations can both have a
direct effect by changing the returns to illegal deforestation (and hence the propensity to
engage in it) but also an indirect effect by changing the investment behavior of potential
users of forested land (including their location choice). The model makes it clear that for
forestry where (i) the share of capital in production is low, (ii) local supply of capital is
likely elastic and (iii) the key factor of production (land) is fixed in space, the regression
discontinuity is likely to recover the policy impact, and the direct effects are likely to
dominate. This is in contrast to other sectors like capital intensive manufacturing where
the control group (pixels on the other side of the border) are affected by the land regu-
lation of the treatment group by the potential for people, firms, and capital to relocate
across the border.
    We document three striking facts. First, we show that up until about 2005, the level
and rate of deforestation was dramatically higher on the Brazilian side of the border than
in its neighbors. When our data starts in 2000, Brazilian lands were about 30 percent
more likely to be have been deforested than similar lands located just a few kilometers
away in neighboring countries. And from 2001 to 2005, the annual deforestation rate
was more than three times higher on the Brazilian side of the border than in neighboring
countries.
    Second, we show that the discontinuity in deforestation rates disappears precipitously
in 2006 – just as Brazil was implementing substantially tougher national policies targeting
illegal deforestation. In November 2004 Brazil launched the Action Plan for the Prevention
and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm) which strengthened the
legal penalties associated with illegal deforestation, particularly on unclaimed and private
land outside protected areas (Nepstad et al., 2009). PPCDAm was bolstered in 2006 by
the Law on Public Forest Management, and by the Center for Environmental Monitoring
becoming fully operational, which together enabled the Brazilian state to couple satellite-
based detection of deforestation with police and army enforcement operations targeted at
areas where illegal deforestation had been detected (MMA, 2008).
   1
     In fact, in one famous incident, President-elect Cardoso of Brazil went hiking near the border in 1994,
and accidentally ended up in Bolivia – and was there for over an hour before anyone realized he was in
the wrong country (Cardoso and Winter, 2007, pp. 218-219).
   2
     While borders have been shown to be associated with policy outcomes in developed countries (Black,
1999; Holmes, 1998; Turner et al., 2014) where regulations are tightly enforced, the evidence in developing
countries is more mixed (Michalopoulos and Papaioannou, 2014; Pinkovskiy, 2017).


                                                     2
    Third, we show that de jure land use restrictions on the Brazilian side matter – even
at the border. We find that areas designated as protected areas in Brazil have always
been less deforested than unprotected lands just on the opposite side of the international
border, and this remains the case from 2006 onwards. The Brazilian state was therefore
able to enforce environmental regulations when there was the will to do so even in these
outlying areas. Instead, reductions in deforestation following the mid-2000s policy changes
in Brazil were most pronounced on unclaimed and private lands outside protected areas –
precisely the types of lands where the increase in enforcement by the Brazilian state was
most pronounced (Appendix B.2).
    Combined, these results – the sharp discontinuity in deforestation levels and rates
at the border, the dramatic change in deforestation at the border when then national
government cracks down, and the fact that protected areas in Brazil were always less likely
to be deforested than corresponding lands just across the national border – demonstrate
the remarkable reach of the Brazilian state. They suggest that the rapid deforestation in
the Brazilian Amazon was a consequence of lax enforcement of laws prior to the mid-2000s,
and conversely, that the precipitous decline in deforestation seen since the mid-2000s is
the consequence of better monitoring and tighter enforcement.
    Our results help to understand why the Brazilian Amazon is the only major area
of tropical forest that has experienced falling rates of deforestation since the mid-2000s
(Figure 1). Brazil (which contains 65% of the Amazon rainforest) moves from having
almost the highest rate of deforestation in 2001 to having the lowest rate in 2014, with
the trend reversal occurring in the mid-2000s (see, e.g., Nepstad et al., 2009; Nolte et al.,
2013; Godar et al., 2014) In strict contrast Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of Congo
and the non-Brazilian Amazon (which contain the bulk of the remaining tropical forest)
experience rising deforestation rates across the 2001-2014 period. Identifying the role
of Brazilian government policies in causing this decline in deforestation is challenging as
these policies were applied throughout the country.3 By zooming in on the national border,
where Brazil’s policy reach ends, we can precisely identify the limits and impacts of being
in Brazil and under the Brazilian policy regime.4 The methods employed here therefore
may be usefully employed by governments concerned with wilderness conservation in other
contexts.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we sketch a brief
   3
      Several papers use variation across Brazilian municipalities for identification. Assunção et al. (2013a)
compare areas with more or less cloud cover to argue that satellite-based enforcement contributed to
reductions in deforestation, Assunção et al. (2015) compare municipalities with greater or lower “tightness
of land constraints” for farmers and Godar et al. (2014) shows that the decline in deforestation is larger
in census tracts dominated by large landholders.

      A related literature studies how regulation and infrastructure affect deforestation (e.g., Adman, 2014;
Souza-Rodrigues, 2015; Anderson et al., 2016; Asher et al., 2017) and violence in the Amazon (e.g.,
Chimeli and Soares, 2017).

model to clarify our identifying assumptions. Section 3 sets our empirical specification
and discusses our data. We present results in Section 4. Section 5 concludes.


2     Theoretical framework: what do we learn from
      looking at borders?
2.1    Model setup
We build on Turner et al. (2014) and consider a static model of heterogeneous plots of
land (pixels) over a line. Each pixel x ∈ [−1, 1] is a parcel of land of equal size covered
with native vegetation: x is our index. There is a unit mass of people uniformly spread
over the area. The person occupying pixel x chooses whether to preserve the land, or
whether to deforest it and produce using land as an input. The value the person derives
from preserving the land in each pixel is zero. If a pixel x is put to productive use, the
individual chooses how much capital, a mobile factor of production, to use in production.
    Pixels are heterogeneous in their productivity. The gross production using capital
kx ≥ 0 in pixel x is A (x, kx ). We assume that A (x, kx ) is continuous everywhere w.r.t x
(including at x = 0) and that capital has diminishing returns: ∂A/∂kx ≥ 0 and ∂ 2 A/∂kx2 ≤
0.
    Suppose that land is spread across two countries, L and R, with x < 0 belonging to
country L and x ≥ 0 belonging to R. Each country imposes different land use regulations.
The pixel productivity net of regulation is given by f (x, kx ) = A (x, kx ) V (x), in which:
                                         
                                          vL
                                         
                                                     , if x < 0
                                V (x) =                                                   (1)
                                          vR        , if x ≥ 0

where vL , vR ∈ [0, 1].
   For each pixel, the individual chooses whether or not to use the land and how much
capital to use. If producing, she chooses kx∗ to maximize the private returns from using
the land, Π (x, kx ) = A (x, kx ) V (x) − rkx , where r is the price of capital. Implicitly, we
assume an elastic global market for output, with price normalized to 1. The optimal
capital use in pixel x conditional on producing is

                                   kx∗ = arg max Π (x, kx ) .                              (2)
                                             kx ≥0


If Π (x, kx∗ ) < 0, pixel x is preserved and no capital is used.
    Imagine the researcher observes productivity, f (x, kx ), for each pixel and runs a spatial
regression discontinuity at the border. Comparing the log productivity of pixels on both


                                                4
sides of the border and sufficiently close to x = 0, we have

  lim ln f (x, kx∗ ) − lim− ln f (x, kx∗ ) = lim+ ln A (x, kx∗ ) − lim− ln A (x, kx∗ ) + |ln vR {z
                                                                                                − ln vL}
 x→0+                  x→0                   x→0                     x→0
                                             |                  {z                   }          ρ
                                                                 Φ
                                                                                                      (3)

where ρ is the (local) difference of the direct cost of land regulation on productivity and
Φ is the combination of differences in pixel productivity and optimal capital use on each
side of the border.5
    The key point is that Φ will not necessarily be equal to 0 – even though limx→0+ ln A (x, k) =
limx→0− ln A (x, k) for any particular value of capital k, the optimal capital choice k ∗ may
differ on both sides on the border, and if kL∗ 6= kR∗ then we cannot assume Φ = 0. The
next subsections discuss the interpretation of equation (3), and in particular, we show that
what we recover from (3) hinges on the elasticity of capital supply around the border.


2.2     Interpretation with elastic capital supply
Assume that the capital market is locally competitive and capital is supplied elastically at
constant price r. This implies that capital investment is independent across pixels. In this
setting, under the standard assumption that A(x, .) is continuous in x (e.g., as in Holmes,
1998; Turner et al., 2014), a spatial regression discontinuity design as in (3) identifies the
combination of the direct costs of land regulation, ρ, and the indirect costs of the land
regulation on productivity, Φ, as regulation in x changes the optimal capital investment
in that pixel. This is still the effect of the land regulation, but one that incorporates an
endogenous capital response.
    To clarify this intuition, suppose A (x, kx ) = a(x)kxα , where a(x) > 0 is the pixel pro-
ductivity and α ∈ [0, 1). By continuity of a(x), we can write Φ = α [limx→0+ ln kx∗ − limx→0− ln kx∗ ].
This term will be equal to zero only if the capital share in the production function is zero
(α = 0) or limx→0+ kx∗ = limx→0− kx∗ . From the first order condition of the capital invest-
ment problem (2):
                                                       ! 1
                                                 r      α−1
                                    kx∗ =                                                  (4)
                                            αa(x)V (x)
Since regulation, V (x), is discontinuous at the border, we have that limx→0+ kx∗ 6= limx→0− kx∗
in all interior solutions of optimal capital investment.
    This suggests when the capital share (α) is equal to 0, the regression discontinuity
in (3) directly identifies the policy parameter ρ. When the capital share is non-zero, Φ
   5
    Whilst equation (3) is interpreted in terms of productivity, our empirical specification below employs
a discrete variable for being deforested which is a transformation of equation (3) where, for each person,
they deforest their land if Π(x, kx∗ ) > 0.



                                                    5
would be zero only when there is no interior solution on optimal capital use on both sides
of the border.6 Otherwise, the regression discontinuity in (3) identifies the total direct
and the indirect effect of regulation on productivity, Φ + ρ.
    Both parameters are of interest, but it is worth understanding when they diverge. In
settings where the capital share α is large (e.g. when land is used for capital-intensive
manufacturing), small differences in regulation ρ may lead to large indirect effects (Φ)
of land regulation on land productivity. In contrast, when the capital share is low, as is
the case with logging and cattle ranching, estimates of the border regression discontinuity
will approximate the direct effect of land regulation ρ.


2.3       Inelastic but locally mobile capital supply
Imagine now that capital is inelastically supplied, but is locally mobile in an area (−x̄, x̄)
around the border. Let r (KL (r) + KR (r)) be the inverse supply function, where r0 > 0,
and KL (r) and KR (r) are the total quantity of capital used in pixels x ∈ (−x̄, 0) and
x ∈ (0, x̄), respectively. From (4), we have
                                                               1
                                 Z   0                r α−1 Z 0
                                                          
                                                                            1
                       KL (r) =          kx∗0 (r)dx0
                                                 =                 a(x0 )− α−1 dx0
                                 −x̄                 αvL      −x̄
                                Z x̄                      1 Z x̄
                                                      r α−1
                                                   
                                                                           1
                       KR (r) =      kx∗0 (r)dx0 =                a(x0 )− α−1 dx0 .
                                 0                   αvR      0


The equilibrium capital price r∗ is set by substituting the inverse supply curve and solving
for KL∗ and KR∗ .
    The key point here is that the local capital price r∗ is a function of land regulation on
both sides of the border. In other words, the optimal capital investment in pixels close
to the border in country L , kx∗ ∀x ∈ (−x̄, 0), is affected by land regulation in country R
, and vice versa. Thus, when factor markets are locally inelastic but mobile across the
border, the regression discontinuity design from ((3)) does not identify either the net (ρ)
or gross (Φ + ρ) effect of land regulation, because the control group (pixels on the other
side of the border) are affected by the land regulation of the treatment group via prices
and factor allocation. For example, in the study by Holmes (1998) of state policies and
manufacturing output, one might be concerned that a given factory might locate in either
state L or state R, in which case there may be crowd-out of the sort considered here.


2.4       Forestry versus other sectors
The above discussion suggests that one of two conditions are necessary for the RD to
be interpretable: either the supply of the mobile factor is completely elastic locally (i.e.
  6
      That is, α ≥ 1 and limx→0+ kx∗ = limx→0− kx∗ = 0.


                                                       6
r0 = 0), or the share of the mobile factor is small (i.e. α u 0).
    In the forestry case we consider here, it seems that both these conditions are likely to
hold. Most of the land deforested in the Amazon hinterlands is driven by illegal logging
and cattle ranching, activities with very low capital investment.7 Most importantly, the
key factor of production (land) is completely fixed in space, so concerns about cross-border
reallocations of the type discussed in Section (2.3) are unlikely to be first-order. Thus, in
our case – deforestation – our empirical strategy identifies Φ + ρ – the net impact of the
policy. Moreover, since Φ is likely small in our case, the net impact Φ + ρ we identify is
likely quite close to the direct impact ρ.


3       Empirical methods and data
3.1     Empirical specification
Our empirical analysis takes place at the 120m pixel level. Our running variable is distance
to the border. Positive distances represent pixels in the Brazilian Amazon, while negative
distances represent pixels in the Amazon outside Brazil.
    Our main estimating equation is

                       Yi = α + γBrazili + f (DistBorderi ) + δXi + εi                              (5)

where Yi is the outcome of interest (forest cover in 2000 or forest loss in a given year)
in pixel i. Brazili is a dummy equal to one if pixel i is in Brazil. f (DistBorderi ) =
Brazili ∗f Brazil (DistBorderi )+(1−Brazili )∗f OutsideBrazil (DistBorderi ) is a polynomial
of distance from the border, separately on each side of the border. Following Gelman and
Imbens (2014), we use separate linear polynomials f on each side of the border for our
preferred specification, and use separate quadratic polynomials as robustness. Xi is a
vector of controls explained below. We cluster standard errors in blocks of size 50km by
50km to allow for geographical spatial error correlation.8
    The coefficient of interest is γ, which measures the difference in the share of a pixel
that is forested in 2000, or deforested in a given year after 2000, on the Brazilian side of
the border compared to the other side. We estimate equation (5) by OLS in our main
specifications. When we perform exercises to assess if there is heterogeneity in institutional
effects across different segments of the border and land types within Brazil, we estimate
    7
     For cattle ranching, which represents 73% of the productive land use in Amazonian states of Brazil,
the 2006 Census of Agriculture records the average value of tractors and machines employed as $29 per
hectare; for agriculture, it is $71 per hectare. Even logging, which requires some machinery to cut and
process wood, does not invest capital in the land as all equipment is carried to the next forested plot.
   8
     Conley (1999) would be an alternative but is computationally challenging due to the extremely large
number of observations.



                                                   7
equation (5) using a Poisson model.9 We do this because there are substantial differences
in baseline magnitudes of deforestation across the Amazon across land types, and Poisson
estimates remain interpretable as percent changes across land types.
    Our identifying assumption is that other factors that might affect deforestation change
smoothly across national borders. If this assumption is valid, by controlling for a poly-
nomial in distance from the border, we remove additional sources of biases and allow for
causal inference. The idea that the borders are largely arbitrary is consistent with the
historical evidence - they were largely set by the 1750 Treaty of Madrid (see Appendix
B.2.3) when many of these areas deep in the jungle were largely unexplored and appeared
as blank spaces labeled “unknown country” in maps from that time (Furtado, 2012).
    To explore this assumption in the data, we check for discontinuities at the border
on four factors that may influence deforestation: slope, distance to water, distance to
urban areas, and distance to roads. Appendix Table A2 shows the estimates of γ which
represent the discontinuous change in the level of these variables at the Brazilian border,
for various subsets of the border and bandwidths. Overall, columns 1, 4, 7, and 10
show that that these factors are smoothly distributed around the Brazilian border (the
remaining columns are for robustness subsamples we discuss in more detail in Section 4.1).
Nonetheless, in our main specification we estimate (5) controlling for natural covariates:
land slope and distance from water. We present results both without any controls and
including additional controls for distance to infrastructure in the robustness tables.
    We report results using bandwidths around the border ranging from 5 km to 100
km. Since we have different dependent variables in different columns, we do not have a
single theory-driven optimal bandwidth. We calculate the optimal bandwidth for each
dependent variable as Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012). The optimal bandwidth of forest
cover in 2000 is 5 km from the border, but varies for our annual deforestation variables.
To ease comparability across equations, our preferred bandwidth is the average of the
optimal bandwidths calculated across all variables, which is 17 km from the border. In
our preferred specification using all 120m pixels within 17 km of the border, we have 301
clusters and 20,537,712 observations each year.


3.2     Data
Hansen et al. (2013) worked with Google Earth Engine to detect deforestation using
Landsat 7 data, resulting in a map of global forest cover in 2000 and consistent longitudinal
annual forest measures from 2001 to 2014, at a spatial resolution of 30 meters across the
whole earth. The forest cover map is constructed for 2000 exactly because Landsat 7 was
launched in the previous year, so Hansen uses it as the base cover on which he constructs
   9
    Since each 120m pixel is comprised of 16 30m pixels, our dependent variable is effectively a count
variable with range [0,16].


                                                  8
annual forest loss. Importantly, since this dataset is worldwide and does not use any
national data as inputs, we can examine deforestation rates on both sides of the border
using an exactly comparable metric. We aggregate pixels to create a resolution of 120×120
meters. Annual forest loss is defined as the share of 30m Landsat pixels within our 120m
pixels deforested within one year. Forest cover in 2000 is the average tree cover canopy
of the Landsat pixels. Summary statistics are shown in Appendix Table A1.
    We limit our analysis to the Amazon area as defined by RAISG (La Red Amazónica
de Información Socioambiental Georreferenciada), taking into account the biome and the
legal Amazon limits as defined by the various countries in the region. On net, we have
more than 277 million observations in the Amazon each year.
    Figure 2 shows an example of the data, displaying forest cover as of 2000. Panel (a)
shows the entire Amazon, and Panel (b) zooms in on one particular border segment, which
consists largely of straight lines. The substantially higher deforestation on the Brazilian
(right-hand) side of the border is visually apparent.
    We supplement this deforestation data with a variety of other data sources. Hydrology
data from 2000 was extracted from Google Earth Engine. Remaining data including
administrative boundaries, protected areas, elevation, slope, waterways,roads and urban
areas were extracted from OpenStreetMap’s API.


4      Results
4.1     Deforestation as of 2000
We begin by examining the level of forest cover in 2000, the year our data begins. Figure
3 shows the percentage of forest cover in 2000 averaged by eighty equal-sized bins of
distances from the Brazilian border, up to one hundred kilometers from each side of the
border. The sharp discontinuity in deforestation is visually apparent: forest cover drops
sharply exactly at the national border.
    Our regression estimates using equation (5) indicate that this discontinuous change in
forest cover at the border is sizable and statistically significant. Using a 17km bandwidth,
forest cover in the Brazilian Amazon was around 3.3 percentage points smaller than in its
neighboring countries (p-value < 0.01; see Appendix Table A3).10 Since 89% of the land
outside of Brazil was forested in 2000, this implies that deforestation prior to 2000 was
30 percent higher just inside the Brazilian border than just on the other side.
  10
    Results vary from 1.2 percentage points to 5.6 percentage points, depending on bandwidth, which we
vary from 5km to 100 km. Estimates remain statistically significant at the 5% level in all specifications.




                                                    9
4.2     Annual Forest Loss
We next plot annual deforestation rates on both sides of the border annually between 2001
and 2014 in Figure 4. The figures show a dramatic difference in deforestation rates in 2001-
2005 that comes to an abrupt halt in 2006. Between 2006 and 2012, deforestation activity
is smoothly spread on both sides of the Brazilian border. Note also that the change in
2006 comes from decreased deforestation in Brazil, rather than increased deforestation on
the other side of the border.
    We estimate RD models separately for each year. Figure 5a plots the RD coefficient
– γ in equation (5) – from each year, along with 95% confidence intervals, using OLS
regressions and a 17km bandwidth.11 We estimate annual deforestation rates of about
0.2 percentage points higher per year on the Brazilian side of the border through 2005.
Since deforestation on the other side of the border ranged from 0.05 to 0.8 percent in
the other Amazonian countries, the estimates imply deforestation rates in Brazil were 3-4
times faster than on the other side of the border.
    The dramatic changes we observe at the border correspond to a period of policy
strengthening in Brazil (Appendix B.1).12 Although the PPCDAm plan was released in
2004, its actions were implemented gradually: most notably with the Law on Public For-
est Management and Center for Environmental Monitoring becoming fully operational
in 2006. This allowed the satellite-based deforestation detection system (DETER) to
become a key tool for targeting law enforcement activities in the Brazilian Amazon in-
cluding sending in federal police and troops to arrest illegal loggers and confiscate their
machinery. (MMA, 2008). Consonant with this, Figure 4 shows that in 2006 deforesta-
tion on the Brazilian side of the border collapses and the discontinuity at the border is
eliminated. Taken together these results to point to an important role for Brazilian policy
in determining deforestation rates at the border.13
    These results are robust to a series of alternative specifications and samples. Our
baseline RD specifications use OLS and control for slope and distance to water, use linear
polynomials, and are estimated using the entire Brazilian border. Appendix Table A4
shows that the results are qualitatively similar if we: a) do not include the slope and
distance to water controls; b) add additional ’infrastructure’ controls; c) estimate using
Poisson models; d) use quadratic polynomials; and e) exclude a 220km buffer around the
  11
      Estimates with alternate bandwidths are shown in Appendix Table A3 .
  12
      These followed the appointment in 2003 of Marina Silva as Minister of Environment who was from a
poor family in the Amazon region and had a strong predilection towards conserving the rainforest.
   13
      An alternative explanation for the precipitous change we observe in 2006 is a differential change in
output prices. To investigate this, we obtained national domestic farmgate prices for soybeans, the main
crop in these regions, for both Brazil and Bolivia (the border country closest to the Brazilian agricultural
frontier), from the FAO (consistent data on cattle prices are not available). As shown in Appendix
Figure A3, farmgate prices move almost directly in parallel in both countries through 2011, and there is
no differential break in prices around 2006.

peak of Mount Roraima, a small section of the northern border with Venezuela, which
is coincident with a mountain ridge and the only part of the border where there are
differences in slope at the border.
    Perhaps most importantly, we also estimate results restricting the sample to areas
around artificial borders, as in Alesina et al. (2011) – i.e. borders arbitrarily drawn by
former colonizers which appear as straight lines on a map (Appendix B.2.3).14 For these
borders, there is no geographic feature at the border. Nevertheless, we find even larger
effects, as shown in Figure A1 (see Appendix Table A4 Panel C).


4.3     Heterogeneity by land classification within Brazil
We next probe heterogeneity in effects based on the land use classification of different
areas within Brazil. Since 1998, destroying or harming native vegetation in Protected
Areas (PAs) was a felony subject to potentially harsh legal procedures and punishments
– including possible jail time. This category of land thus faced the highest level of de jure
sanction throughout the 2000-2014 period. In contrast, PPCDAm made several changes
that increased enforcement outside PAs.
    Most notably, until 2005, deforesting untitled, or unclaimed land, outside PAs was
just an infraction, punishable at most with fines and individuals caught harming native
vegetation or extracting resources in these lands could not even have their equipment
seized. PPCDAm made deforestation of unclaimed land a felony punishable with jail
time, as in PAs, and legislated that equipment (i.e. trucks and chainsaws) of violators
could be seized and confiscated.
    Similarly until 2005, private properties outside PAs were required to set aside at least
35% of their area as native vegetation – i.e., it was illegal to deforest more than 65%
of the private property area. Non-compliance with this threshold, however, was just an
infraction. Starting in 2005, PPCDAm both increased the required set aside area of
private properties from 35% to 80%15 and conditioned access to agricultural credit lines
from public banks on environmental compliance (Assunção et al., 2013b).
    To explore whether differences in de jure enforcement regimes translated into differ-
ences in de facto deforestation at the border, we re-estimate equation (5) separately for
each of these three classes of land. Figure 5b presents the results, where every point is an
estimated RD coefficient (i.e. γ from (5)) from a separate Poisson regression. As above,
these estimates all use a bandwidth of 17km.
    We see that when the national border abuts PAs we observe less deforestation on the
Brazilian side consistent with these areas enjoying greater de jure protection throughout
  14
    We map the segments of artificial border in Figure A4b in the appendix.
  15
    Pre-2005 infringements were not prosecuted but landowners were liable for any deforestation above
the 20% requirement from 2005 onward.


                                                 11
our whole period. In strict contrast, for unclaimed lands we observe more deforestation
on the Brazilian side up until 2005 but this discontinuity is eliminated from 2006 when
PPCDAm comes into full force. For private lands, while there is a dramatic fall in the
difference in deforestation rates in 2006, it is not eliminated entirely, consistent with
the fact that some deforestation was still allowed in these areas. These results confirm
that – even in these remote areas very close to the international border – differences in
deforestation map to changes in land use regulations within Brazil.


5    Conclusion
By using fine grained satellite data we are able to test whether Brazilian conservation
policies had any bite at the national border. This is an interesting exercise as there has
been considerable skepticism regarding the ability of the state to exercise control over the
hinterland. In effect, the ability of the state to conserve ecosystems may fall as locations
become remote, which opens up opportunities for those who want to illegally extract
resources. Given that rapid environmental degradation in developing countries is being
driven by illegal extraction it is important to empirically assess whether or not the state
has the power to conserve natural resources in these remote locations.
    This is the contribution of this paper. We observe sharp discontinuities in forest loss
at the border and a diminution in these as Brazil implemented policies to detect and
and penalize illegal logging. Our results therefore demonstrate the power of the state to
determine whether remote wilderness ecosystems are conserved or exploited. Moreover,
the pattern of diminution within Brazil, where post-2005 deforestation rates fall mainly
in non-protected areas, again points to the influence of national policies on conservation.
    This finding has implications not only for Brazil but also for the rest of the world.
The future path of the earth’s climate will, to some significant extent, be determined by
whether vast wilderness ecosystems like the Amazon can be kept intact. The fact that
Brazil moves from having almost the highest rate of deforestation in 2001 to having the
lowest rate in 2014 is testament to how conservation policy can be turned around. Part of
this turnaround was achieved by the Brazilian state coupling better monitoring (through
use of satellite data) with more stringent enforcement (through the use of federal police).
    The success of wilderness conservation, therefore, ultimately depends on the policy
choices of national governments. Information on illegal logging, for example, is regularly
available to any government at a 30 meter resolution (Hansen et al., 2013). Whether or
not governments act on this information is another matter and depends largely on the
political willingness to do so. Nevertheless, the remarkable reversal we document in Brazil
suggests that it is possible to reduce the gap between de jure and de facto conservation
policy, even in wilderness areas in developing countries.

       Figure 3: Average Forest Cover in 2000 by Distance from Brazilian Border
This figure shows the average forest cover in 2000 by 80 equal-sized bins of distances from
the Brazilian border, up to 100 kilometers away from the border. Positive distance represents
Brazilian land, while negative distance represents non-Brazilian land. The vertical bars (not
always visible) depict 95% confidence intervals of the local average within each bin. The red
line shows the linear function of distance weighted by the number of observations in each bin.

     This figure shows the average annual forest cover lost each year between 2001 and 2014 by 80 equal-sized bins of distances from the Brazilian
     border. Each figure present pixels more distant from the border, up 100 kilometers away from the border. Positive distance represents Brazilian
     land, while negative distance represents non-Brazilian land. The vertical bars (not always visible) depict 95% confidence intervals of the local

                     Figure 5: Regression Discontinuity Coefficients by Year
This figure shows the regression discontinuity coefficients of the Brazilian effect, γ, on the per-
centage of annual forest loss by year, from equation (5) with linear polynomials and 17 km
bandwidth. The top panel (a) shows the overall effects estimated using the whole Brazilian
border trough OLS regressions (presented in Panel A Table A3 in Appendix). The vertical
bars represent 95% confidence intervals. The bottom panel (b) shows the heterogeneous effects
by land type estimated using a Poisson model (presented in Table A5 in Appendix). These
estimates can be interpreted as a relative increase in the Brazilian side of the border.
