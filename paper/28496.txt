Intellectual Property Infringement by Foreign Firms: Import Protection through the ITC or
Court

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper examines intellectual property litigation as a method of protection from patent-
infringing imports. Claims against patent-infringing imports entering the United States may be
filed before the International Trade Commission (ITC) or in district court. The ITC applies
injunctions (import prohibitions) that would seem to provide more protection from infringing
imports than the standard license fee remedy in court. Settlements prior to legal adjudication are
common in both venues. Using a model with Nash bargaining and Cournot competition, we show
that an ITC filing may restrict imports by less than in court. This result tends to apply if product
differentiation is high and the size of the patented cost-reducing innovation is large.

Introduction

       There is increasing concern in the United States about intellectual property (IP) theft by
foreign parties, both foreign firms and foreign governments. Sometimes the federal government
becomes directly involved but more commonly legal action is left to the IP owner. Large
technology-intensive companies such as Apple and Google are engaged in IP litigation on an
essentially constant basis. This paper addresses the implications of IP litigation for protection
from patent-infringing imports.

       When domestic IP is infringed by imports, two major types of relief are typically
available: fee-based relief or injunctive relief. In the United States, the type of relief depends
mainly on where the IP claim is filed. Claims may be filed in federal district court, where relief is
normally in the form of license fees. 1 Alternatively, claims against imports may be filed before
the "quasi-judicial" International Trade Commission (ITC). The remedy used by the ITC is an
injunction that prohibits imports using the infringed IP. The ITC has become an important venue
for IP cases, which are now arguably more important in economic terms than other types of ITC-
administered trade policy such as anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties.

       On the surface, the ITC seems to provide more import protection than the courts. With a
court-imposed license fee, imports can still be sold in the domestic market, whereas injunctive
relief at the ITC normally excludes imports entirely. However, in both the ITC and court,
negotiation between the parties is important and many cases are settled before final legal
adjudication. And, in both forums, license fees are the normal outcome of negotiated settlements.
Such settlements have important implications for the level of import protection.

       We develop the implications of an ITC versus a court filing for protection from patent-
infringing imports using a standard differentiated-product duopoly model with Cournot
competition. Nash bargaining is used to model the potential for negotiated settlements. We
address two main research questions. First, we ask if and when the ITC would provide more
import protection than the courts in the sense that an ITC case results in lower import levels. The


1The preference for fee-based relief in district court has been in place since a landmark
unanimous U.S. Supreme Court decision, eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, 547 U.S. 388 (2006),
specifying that courts should use injunctions only when license fees or other monetary awards
are insufficient.

answer will help explain why many firms seeking redress from IP infringement choose to file in
court, given the more extreme remedy available at the ITC. Second, we seek to explain the
incentives underlying the common use of negotiated settlements.

       We consider the case in which the infringed innovation reduces marginal cost and
adjudication by the court takes the form of a per-unit license fee or royalty applied to infringing
imports. In our base model, the default royalty imposed by the court equals the value of the
innovation as measured by its effect in reducing the foreign firm's marginal cost. Also, firms
engage in Nash bargaining over a royalty to reach a settlement. Our choice of the default royalty
and the effects of fixed license fees in Nash bargaining are considered in an extension section.
However, as noted by Kamien (2002, p. 345) and others, some form of output-based payment or
royalty is much more common than fixed license fees. The main reasons include risk aversion,
liquidity constraints, and informational asymmetries.

         The answers to our research questions depend on two primary considerations. One
consideration is the degree of differentiation between domestic and imported products. The other
is the "size" or value of the infringed innovation as measured by whether the innovation is
"incremental" or "drastic" in the sense of Arrow (1962). The domestic firm faces two conflicting
incentives, namely to reduce competition from infringing imports and earn royalties from those
same imports. 2 If the products are perfect substitutes then the competitive effect dominates, as
the best possible outcome for the domestic firm is to be a monopoly. But if products are even
slightly differentiated, we show that the outcome at the ITC is a settlement with a royalty that
allows some imports. For court cases, the outcome for almost all incremental innovations is an
adjudicated royalty equal to the value of the innovation. For drastic innovations, the royalty
negotiated in either venue is less than the value of the innovation and therefore provides the
foreign firm with a net benefit from infringement.

       Greater product differentiation always reduces the negotiated royalty in ITC cases and
hence reduces the import protection provided by the ITC. For small incremental innovations, an
ITC filing does result in greater protection from imports than in court. However, for larger
incremental innovations, sufficiently high product differentiation reverses this result ­ court

2We refer to the "domestic firm" and the "foreign firm" although what matters for the ITC is
where the product is produced, not the headquarters location of the producing company.

cases provide a higher level of protection than ITC cases, even thought the ITC uses import
prohibitions. For drastic innovations, it is never the case that a filing at the ITC provides more
protection from imports than the courts.

       The current paper builds on Brander and Spencer (2021), who also compare injunctive
with fee-based relief for patent infringement allowing for settlements based on Nash bargaining.
The setting in that paper is purely domestic as a monopoly firm infringes a patent held by a
patent assertion entity (PAE). The PAE produces no output so the infringing firm has no
competitive effect. Product differentiation does not arise.

       Section 2 contains a short literature review. Section 3 presents the basic model structure,
section 4 describes the final-stage output game and section 5 concerns homogeneous products.
For differentiated products, section 6 addresses the Nash bargaining outcomes from an ITC or
court filing. Section 7 examines the decision by the domestic firm as to where to file its claim.
Section 8 concerns extensions and generalizations. Section 9 contains concluding remarks.

2. Literature Review

       ITC protection of U.S. intellectual property through injunctive relief is a form of
administered trade policy, as are the more extensively studied anti-dumping and countervailing
duty policies. Blonigen and Prusa (2019) provide a recent overview of the literature on anti-
dumping policy, and Irwin (2005) describes the history of anti-dumping policy. Countervailing
duties are often studied in conjunction with anti-dumping duties as in, for example, Gallaway,
Blonigen, and Flynn (1999) and Rovengo (2013). Prusa (1992) uses Nash bargaining to model
negotiations in anti-dumping cases, and we take a similar approach to IP filings in the ITC or
courts based on patent infringements by foreign firms.

       Although the role of intellectual property in international trade has received significant
attention (such as Maskus and Penubarti, 1995, Chen, Ishikawa, and Yu, 2004, McCalman, 2005,
Qiu and Yu, 2010, and Bond and Saggi, 2020), we have found only a few papers that address
administered protection based on intellectual property. Specifically, Aoki and Prusa (1992) focus
on R&D incentives arising from administered IP protection and Schwarz (1991) provides some
explicit calculations illustrating the cost to consumers from the exclusion of imports based on
patent infringement. Mutti and Yeung (1996) estimate various empirical effects of IP-based ITC


                                                  3
actions, Co (2004) assesses the value of the patents underlying IP-based ITC cases, and Brander
(2007) considers strategic trade policy incentives for IP protection.

       Our analysis is related to the large literature on patent policy, patent licensing, and patent
litigation. Gallini (2002) reviews U.S. patent reforms and the major principles underlying patent
policy. Kamien (1992) summarizes major early contributions to the theory of patent licensing.
The Nash bargaining solution has been used to study patent licensing and patent litigation by
several authors, including Shapiro (2010), Kishimoto and Muto (2012), Kishimoto (2020),
Crampes and Langiner (2002) and Brander and Spencer (2021). Daughety and Reinganum
(2012) provide an overview of the economic literature on litigation and settlement of disputes.

3. Modelling Preliminaries

       A domestic firm produces good x and a foreign firm produces and exports good y to the
domestic country. The demand for the two substitute goods derives from the following
symmetric quadratic utility function where M represents consumption of a numeraire good.

       U = a(x+y) ­ (x2+y2)/2 ­ sxy + M                                                             (1)

The goods are substitutes, so s must be positive and cannot exceed 1: 0 < s  1. (The goods are
unrelated if s = 0 and complements if s < 0.) Utility function (1) implies that the slope of each
firm's demand function is normalized to be ­1. Therefore, letting px and py denote the prices of
goods x and y, the inverse demand functions are:

       px = a ­ x ­ sy; py = a ­ y ­ sx                                                             (2)

       The domestic firm owns a patent on a cost-reducing innovation that it uses for its own
production. The foreign firm violates the patent by using the innovation without permission.
Without the technology embodied in the patent, the marginal cost of production for both firms
would be a constant, c. Letting v denote the value of the patented innovation in reducing per-unit
cost, both firms have a marginal cost of production of c ­ v. We refer to v as the "value of the
innovation". The following regularity conditions apply.

Regularity Conditions: i) c ­ v  0 (marginal cost cannot be negative)
                       ii) v > 0 (the patented innovation has value)
                       iii) a > c (maximum willingness to pay exceeds marginal cost)

                                                 4
If ii) is not satisfied no infringement cases would be filed and we do not consider that case
further. As a ­ c > 0 from iii), production would take place in the absence of the innovation.

        The value of the innovation, v, is assumed to be known by both firms, by the ITC, and by
the court. Therefore, if the case goes to legal adjudication in the ITC, it follows from v > 0
(regularity condition ii) that an injunction will prohibit imports. In court, a default royalty of v is
imposed if there is adjudication, just offsetting the per-unit cost reduction due to the innovation.
In either venue, the firms attempt to reach a settlement through Nash bargaining over a royalty.

        In section 8 concerning extensions and generalizations, we consider the effects of
introducing uncertainty over the ITC's decision and the court's decision. We also consider an
alternative default royalty to be imposed by the court and argue that a default royalty of v is
broadly consistent with the case record. In addition, we show that our main results are robust, at
least qualitatively, to Nash bargaining over a fixed fee rather than a royalty.

        To examine the effect of the size of the innovation, following Arrow (1962), we adopt the
following definitions.

Definitions:    i) if v < a ­ c, the innovation is incremental.
                ii) if v = a ­ c, the innovation is intermediate.
                iii) if v > a ­ c, the innovation is drastic.

        Our analysis presumes that the foreign firm has previously incorporated the infringing
technology of value v in its current production infrastructure. Accordingly, use of the technology
is "sunk" for at least some period of time and the domestic firm cannot undo it over the time
horizon of the game analyzed here. In practice, firms that receive adverse patent infringement
rulings will sometimes restructure production to avoid infringing the patent in question. But such
restructuring, even if feasible, is costly and time-consuming and is outside the scope of the
current analysis. The degree of product differentiation is also pre-determined, as is the decision
of the domestic firm to file an infringement claim.

        Our overall equilibrium concept is the sequentially rational equilibrium in the following
three-stage game:

        Stage 1: The domestic firm decides whether to file a claim before the ITC or in court.


                                                    5
       Stage 2: The two firms engage in Nash bargaining over a royalty. If they settle, that
settlement determines the royalty. If they do not settle, the outcome (royalty of v in court or ITC
injunction) is determined by legal adjudication.
       Stage 3: Firms play a Cournot output game unless imports are excluded by injunctive
relief, in which case the domestic firm has a domestic monopoly. The foreign firm pays the
royalties determined in stage 2 to the domestic firm.

4. Stage 3 -- Output Determination

       Letting r denote the value of a royalty, the profit of each firm is made up of the standard
profit from production plus the effect of the transfer of royalty revenue, ry, from the foreign to
the domestic firm. Letting m  a ­ (c ­ v) > 0 denote the difference between the demand
intercept, a, and the net marginal cost, c ­ v and, using (2), domestic and foreign profits are
respectively given by

        = [px ­ (c - v)]x + ry = (m ­ x ­ sy)x + ry
       f = [py­ (c - v)]y ­ ry = (m ­ r ­ sx ­ y)y                                                   (3)

       If both firms are in the market, they act as Cournot duopolists. Each firm chooses its
output to maximize its profit in stage 3, taking the output of the other firm and also the royalty r
determined in stage 2 as given. The degree of substitutability, s, and the value, v, of the patented
innovation are exogenous variables. From (3), the first order conditions for profit maximization
by the domestic and foreign firms are

       /x = ­2x ­ sy + m = 0
       f/y = ­sx ­ 2y + m ­ r = 0                                                                    (4)

It follows immediately from (4) that corresponding second order conditions are satisfied. Solving
the equations in (4) for x and y, equilibrium outputs can be expressed as

       x(r; s) = ((2 ­ s)m + sr)/(4 ­ s2);
       y(r; s) = ((2 ­ s)m ­ 2r)/(4 ­ s2)                                                            (5)

The equilibrium profits of the domestic and foreign firm are as follows.

       (r) = (x(r))2 + ry(r); f(r) = (y(r))2                                                         (6)


                                                     6
The domestic firm's profit is the sum of its profit from good x and royalty revenue, whereas the
foreign firm's profit includes its royalty payment as a component of its marginal cost.

        If the ITC imposes an injunction against imports or if a royalty is so high that it prevents
imports, then the domestic firm has a monopoly. Referring to the smallest royalty that prevents
imports, denoted by rP(s), as the prohibitive royalty, it follows, setting y(r; s) = 0 in (5), that

        rP(s) = (2 ­ s)m/2                                                                            (7)

From (7) and m  a ­ c + v, the prohibitive royalty is increased by greater product differentiation
(a smaller s) and by a larger value v of the innovation. As the domestic firm would never pay the
foreign firm, without loss of generality we restrict attention to royalties satisfying r  [0, rP(s)].

5. Homogenous Products

        With homogeneous products, the best possible outcome for the domestic firm is for
imports to be prohibited so that it gains a monopoly of the

domestic market. Letting r*(s) represent the domestic firm's profit-maximizing royalty, it
follows using (5), (6) and (7), that with homogenous products (s = 1), domestic profit is
maximized at the prohibitive royalty: 3

        r*(1) = rP(1) = m/2 = (a ­ c + v)/2                                                           (8)

        For ITC cases, the domestic firm achieves its maximum profit by letting the case go to
legal adjudication, as the ITC will prohibit infringing imports. Therefore, no settlement is
possible. In court, the two firms have diametrically opposed preferences as the foreign firm
always prefers a lower royalty while the domestic firm always prefers a higher royalty. No
settlement is possible and the court imposes a royalty of v. Imports occur if and only if v is less
than the prohibitive royalty, which, as can be seen from (8), applies if and only if the innovation
is incremental. Proposition 1 summarizes these results.

Proposition 1: ITC and court outcomes with homogeneous products
With homogeneous products:

3For s = 1, from (5) and (6), we obtain (r) = (m + r)2/9 + r(m - 2r)/3, (r) = 5m ­ 10r and (r)
< 0. Maximizing (r) subject to r  rP(1) = m/2 (see (7)), we obtain (r) = 0 at r = m/2 and hence
r*(1) = rP(1) = m/2 as in (8).
                                                   7
i) An ITC filing always goes to legal adjudication, so imports are prohibited.
ii) A court filing always goes to legal adjudication. Imports are eliminated if the innovation is
drastic or intermediate and are positive if the innovation is incremental.
iii) The domestic firm will choose to file in the ITC.

6. Stage 2 - Nash bargaining with differentiated products

6.1 Incentives of the Domestic firm with differentiated products

       To understand the incentives underlying Nash bargaining for ITC or court cases with
differentiated products, we first examine the domestic firm's profit maximizing royalty. As
shown in (A4) of the Appendix,

       r*(s) = (4 + 2s ­ s2)(2 ­ s)m/2(8 ­ 3s2)                                                     (9)

Proposition 2 describes the properties of r*(s), including a comparison with the royalty that
maximizes royalty revenue, denoted rR(s). The proofs of Proposition 2 and all subsequent
propositions are in the Appendix.

Proposition 2: The domestic firm's profit-maximizing royalty
i) For any given s  (0,1), domestic profit is maximized at a unique royalty, r*(s), that exceeds
the level that maximizes royalty revenue, but does not prevent imports: rR(s) < r*(s) < rP(s).
ii) The profit-maximizing royalty, r*(s) for s  (0,1), approaches m/2 as s approaches either limit
(0 or 1) and reaches a unique minimum at an interior value of s, denoted s.

       Product differentiation fundamentally changes the incentives of the domestic firm
towards imports. As shown in Proposition 2(i), any degree of product differentiation reduces the
profit-maximizing royalty, r*(s), below the prohibitive level. With the reduction in the intensity
of competition, the domestic firm is always better off collecting some royalty revenue than by
excluding imports so as to become a monopolist. The domestic firm prefers a royalty that
exceeds rR(s) because the reduction in imports from a small increase in r above rR(s) increases its
profit from production by more than enough to offset the loss of royalty revenue.

       From Proposition 2(ii), r*(s) is U-shaped in s. If products were completely independent (s
= 0), the domestic firm would want to charge rR(0) = m/2 so as to maximize royalty revenue.
Greater substitutability of products reduces the revenue-maximizing royalty, rR(s), because a

                                                  8
reduction in variety reduces consumer demand and imports also become more responsive to the
royalty. If s is small, r*(s) also falls. However, as the products become closer substitutes, the gap
between r*(s) and rR(s) increases, reflecting the increasing efforts by the domestic firm to reduce
imports in the face of greater competition. As a result, r*(s) reaches a minimum and then rises in
accordance with the U-shaped pattern until at s = 1, the royalty r*(1) = m/2 becomes prohibitive.

       As we show in Proposition 3, the domestic firm may prefer a royalty either above or
below the value, v, of the innovation, depending on the size of the innovation.

Proposition 3: Innovation value and the domestic firm's profit-maximizing royalty
With differentiated products:
i) If the innovation is incremental (v < a ­ c), the domestic firm's profit-maximizing royalty
equals or exceeds the value of the innovation (r*(s)  v) for almost all values of v, specifically
for v  0.9559(a ­ c). If 0.9559(a ­ c) < v < a - c, then the comparison between r*(s) and v
depends on s and v.
ii) If the innovation is intermediate (v = a ­ c) or drastic (v > a ­ c), the domestic firm's profit-
maximizing royalty is always less than value the innovation (r*(s) < v).

       From Proposition 3, the domestic firm's profit-maximizing royalty, r*(s), exceeds v for
over 95% of the range for incremental innovations. This result arises from the fact that the U-
shape of r*(s) as s varies is very shallow. The minimum of r*(s) = 0.48873m (reached at s =
0.7117) is not much below its maximum of m/2 (see the proof of Proposition 3). For intermediate
and drastic innovations, a royalty of v sufficiently reduces imports and royalty revenue that the
domestic firm wants to charge less than the value of the innovation.

6.2 Nash Bargaining with Differentiated Products for ITC Cases

       Since a ruling by the ITC will provide injunctive relief that blocks imports, in Nash
bargaining at the ITC, the disagreement payoff for the domestic firm is its monopoly profit.
Evaluating profit at the prohibitive royalty, we express this monopoly profit as (rP(s)). The
foreign firm has a disagreement payoff of zero. We use the superscript I to identify variables
associated with the ITC. Following Nash (1953), the Nash product, denoted BI(r) (B for
"bargain") is given by

       BI(r) = ((r) ­ (rP(s))f(r)                                                                  (10)

                                                   9
The Nash bargaining solution is the royalty, denoted r = rI(s), that maximizes BI(r) subject to 0 
r  rP(s). A settlement is a Nash bargaining solution in which each firm obtains positive surplus
relative to its disagreement payoff.

        Proposition 4 shows that ITC cases with differentiated products always result in
settlements and provides an explicit solution for the negotiated royalty. Greater product
differentiation (smaller s) reduces the negotiated royalty and increases imports.

Proposition 4: Negotiated settlements at the ITC:
For ITC cases with differentiated products and Nash bargaining by firms:
i) There is always a settlement with some imports. The negotiated royalty is unique and is given
by rI(s)  (2 + 3s)(2 ­ s)m/2(8 ­ 3s2).
ii) The negotiated royalty is less than the domestic profit-maximizing royalty: rI(s) < r*(s)
iii) Greater product differentiation reduces the negotiated royalty and increases imports.

        The proof of Proposition 4 establishes that BI(r) is strictly concave for r  (0, r*(s)) and
finds rI(s), the value of r that globally maximizes the Nash product. The prohibitive royalty,
rP(s), is shown to minimize BI(r), so the constraint r  rP(s) is not binding and there are always
some imports. From (10), the royalty, rI(s), satisfies the first order condition:

        dBI(r)/dr = [(r) ­ (rP(s)]f(r) + f(r)(r) = 0                                                 (11)

        Proposition 5 examines whether royalties established though negotiation in the ITC are
above or below v. The answer depends on the size of the innovation and the degree of
substitutability between the imported and domestic product.

Proposition 5: Royalty rates and the value of innovation for ITC cases
For ITC cases with differentiated products:
i) An increase in the innovation's value v increases the negotiated royalty, rI(s), but by less than
the increase in v: 0 < rI(s; v)/v < 1.
ii) For small incremental innovations defined by v  (a ­ c)/3, the negotiated royalty rI(s) strictly
exceeds the value of the innovation (rI(s) > v).
iii) For larger incremental innovations ((a ­ c)/3 < v < a ­ c), there exists a critical value of s 
s(v)  (0,1) satisfying rI(s) = v, such that rI(s) < v if and only if the products are sufficiently


                                                   10
differentiated (s is sufficiently small) that s  (0, s(v)). As v becomes larger, s(v) increases,
expanding the range of cases for which rI(s) < v to include products that are more similar.
iv) For intermediate or drastic innovations (v  a - c), the negotiated royalty is strictly less than
the value of the innovation (rI(s) < v).

        From Proposition 5, the royalty, rI(s), negotiated at the ITC is higher for higher value
innovations, but the increase is less than the increase in v. For small incremental innovations (v <
(a ­ c)/3), the royalty exceeds the value of the innovation. However, greater product
differentiation reduces rI(s) (Proposition 4(iii)) and for larger incremental innovations,
Proposition 5 shows that sufficient product differentiation will reduce rI(s) below v. For
intermediate or drastic innovations (v  a ­ c), rI(s) is always below v.

6.3 Nash Bargaining with differentiated products for Court Cases

        Court cases subdivide into two categories depending on whether or not the default royalty
of v imposed by the court would prevent imports. For innovations large enough that the default
royalty equals or exceeds the prohibitive level (v  rP(s)), the court and the ITC have the same
disagreement payoffs and the same Nash bargaining solution. The outcome of a case filed in
court is then a settlement at the same royalty that would be negotiated at the ITC.

        For innovations for which a royalty of v allows imports, the disagreement payoffs in
court are the strictly positive profits of the domestic and foreign firms at r = v. Letting the
superscript C identify variables associated with the court, the Nash product is:

        BC(r) = ((r) ­ (v))(f(r) ­ f(v)) for v < rP(s)                                             (12)

Proposition 6 sets out the results of a court filing when court adjudication allows imports. From
the proof of Proposition 6, the Nash bargaining solution for court cases, denoted rC(s), is unique
and satisfies the first order condition:

        dBC(r)/dr = [(r) ­ (v)]f(r) + (f(r) ­ f(v))(r) = 0                                         (13)

Proposition 6: Settlement or adjudication in court when v < rP(s).
For cases filed in court with differentiated products and v < rP(s):
i) If v  r*(s) the firms do not settle and the court adjudicates a royalty of v.
ii) If v > r*(s) there is a settlement. The firms negotiate a unique royalty, rC(s), that exceeds zero

                                                  11
and is less than the domestic profit-maximizing royalty: 0 < rC(s) < r*(s).

       If v  r*(s), then the domestic firm will not accept less than v and the court adjudicates a
license fee of v. Conversely, if r*(s) < v < rP(s), then both firms would prefer a royalty less than
what the court would impose, so a settlement is reached. It might be argued that a court would
not impose a royalty that exceeds the amount that both firms prefer. However, in practice, courts
are often influenced both by legal precedent and by the deterrent effect of decisions and are not
guided just by the interests of the two parties. Such "high" default royalties are possible. In
Section 8, we consider an extension in which the default royalty is the smaller of v and the
domestic firm's preferred royalty.

       Proposition 7 relates the conditions under which v < rP(s) (so outcomes in court and the
ITC differ), to the magnitude of the v and the degree of product differentiation.

Proposition 7: Conditions for v < rP(s)
i) For differentiated products, a royalty of v allows some imports (v < rP(s)) if:
    (a) the innovation is incremental or intermediate (v  a ­ c) or
    (b) the innovation is drastic (v > a ­ c) and v  (a ­ c, (a ­ c)) where   (2 ­ s)/s > 1.
ii) In the limit as products become independent (s tends to zero), a royalty of v can never prevent
imports. As products become more substitutable, the range of values of v for which there are
imports is reduced and, in the limit as s tends to 1, there are no imports for v  a ­ c.

6.4 Comparing the ITC and Court Regimes

       Assuming that venue outcomes differ (v < rP(s)), Proposition 8 addresses our central
research question concerning whether the ITC regime provides more protection from imports
than the court. For any given level of product differentiation, imports increase as the royalty
falls. Therefore, the question of which venue provides more protection against imports is
equivalent to asking which venue leads to a higher royalty. We obtain the seemingly
counterintuitive result that, even though the ITC uses exclusion and the court does not, filing a
claim in court provides more protection in some cases.

Proposition 8: Does the ITC or the Court provide more import protection?
With differentiated products and v < rP(s):
i) The ITC provides more import protection than the court if rI(s) > v.

                                                 12
ii) The two venues provide equal import protection if rI(s) = v.
iii) The ITC provides less import protection than the court if the negotiated royalty for an ITC
case is less than the cost-reducing value of the innovation: rI(s) < v.

        Proposition 8 provides a simple condition that determines which venue provides more
protection from imports. Specifically, the court venue leads to lower imports if the royalty
negotiated at the ITC is less than the value of the innovation. Whenever the royalty, rI(s),
negotiated at the ITC is below v, it is also below the royalty, rC(s), that would arise for a case
filed in court, including cases in which rC(s) < v due to a settlement.

         The above condition relates comparative import protection to the endogenous variable
rI(s). This relationship could be useful in an empirical context as rI is potentially observable.
However, more conceptual understanding is provided by solving for relative import protection
purely as a function of underlying structural (exogenous) parameters, as in Proposition 9.

Proposition 9: Innovation size and protection from imports by venue
With differentiated products:
i) For small incremental innovations (v  (a ­ c)/3), the ITC provides more protection from
imports than the court. A royalty of v is adjudicated by the court, whereas in the ITC, the firms
settle at r = rI(s) that strictly exceeds v.
ii) For larger incremental innovations ((a ­ c)/3 < v < a ­ c), the ITC provides less protection
from imports than the court if and only if the products are sufficiently differentiated that s < s(v)
where s satisfies rI(s)  v. If s < s(v), firms settle on a royalty, rI(s), in the ITC that is strictly less
than v and less than any royalty, rC(s), negotiated in court. The higher is the value of v, the
greater is the range of product differentiation for which the ITC provides less protection from
imports than the court.
iii) For innovations that are intermediate or drastic but not so drastic that a royalty of v is
prohibitive (v  [a - c, (a - c)) where   (2 ­ s)/s > 1), the ITC provides less protection from
imports than the court. The firms settle on a royalty below v in both venues, but the royalty is
strictly lower in the ITC.
iv) For very drastic innovations (v  rP(s)), the ITC and the court provide the same protection
against imports. There is a settlement in both venues and Nash bargaining in the court and the
ITC yield the same royalty giving rise to the same (positive) level of imports.

                                                    13
       Propositions 8 and 9 show that relying on the ITC does provide greater import protection
than court-based relief in some cases. The counter-intuitive outcome in which the court provides
more protection is favored by greater product differentiation (lower values of s) and by values of
v that are quite high, but not high enough such that a royalty of v would be prohibitive.

       To understand these results, it is useful to recall from Proposition 3(ii) that the desire to
increase royalty revenue reduces the domestic firm's profit-maximizing royalty, r*(s), below v
for intermediate and drastic innovations (v  a ­ c). The foreign firm always wants a lower
royalty, so in both venues, the parties settle at a royalty below v. The settlement is at a lower
royalty in the ITC than the court, making the ITC less protective of imports because the domestic
firm has a more attractive disagreement payoff relative to the foreign firm in court than in the
ITC. With a - c  v < rP(s), the default royalty of v in court provides sufficient royalty revenue
that the domestic firm's profit exceeds its monopoly profit from an ITC injunction. The foreign
firm gains profit, f(v), from adjudication in court and zero profit in the ITC, but f(v) is
sufficiently small due to the high marginal cost from the royalty that the domestic firm has a
relative advantage in court. 4

       In contrast, for small incremental innovations with v  (a ­ c)/3, the domestic profit-
maximizing licensee fee exceeds v (Propositions 3(i)). In court, the domestic firm will choose to
accept adjudication of a royalty of v rather than negotiate. Negotiation in the ITC results in a
royalty that exceeds v (Proposition 5(ii)) making the ITC more protective than the court in this
case. For the remaining (i.e. larger) incremental innovations, which venue provides more
protection (lower imports) depends on the extent of product differentiation.

7. Stage 1 ­ Where to File?

          The first stage is relatively straightforward as only one firm acts. Specifically, the
domestic firm decides where to file its patent infringement complaint. In practice, firms are
allowed to file in both venues, which is fairly common. Allowing the possibility of filing in both
venues raises a variety of interesting issues that relate largely to uncertainty as filing in both
venues is a form of diversification for the plaintiff firm. However, many firms choose to file in


4
 For a - c  v < rP(s) and s  (0,1), it can be shown using (A10) of the appendix, (6) and (5) that
(v) ­ (rP(s)) ­ f(v)  vy(v)(1 ­ s)/2 > 0.
                                                  14
only one venue. In our setting there is no uncertainty and no advantage to the domestic firm from
filing in more than one venue. As shown in Proposition 10, if the venues differ (v < rP(s)), the
domestic firm always chooses the venue with the higher royalty, which is the venue with the
higher level of protection as set out in Proposition 9.

Proposition 10: Choosing where to file
For v < rP(s) and s  (0,1), the domestic firm would choose to file in the venue that yields the
higher license whether by settlement or adjudication. Some imports occur, but the chosen venue
has lower imports.

       Even our relatively simple model can explain the important and seemingly puzzling fact
that the courts are commonly selected by plaintiff firms, despite the apparent advantage
conferred on domestic firms by the import prohibition remedy used by the ITC. ITC filings are
favored by low levels of product differentiation and low-value patents. For high levels of product
differentiation and fairly high-value patents, the court is preferred, and for very high value
patents, the domestic firm is indifferent between the two venues.

       In cases with relatively low innovation value or not much product differentiation, the
royalty negotiated in ITC cases may exceed the cost-reducing value of the innovation. In such
cases, the foreign firm would be better off foregoing use of the innovation and just producing at
marginal cost c if it could make that change at sufficiently low cost. The potential for such an
outcome may increase the incentive for the domestic firm to file in court. However, this
possibility is excluded by our assumption that the innovation is sunk over the relevant period.

8. Extensions and Generalizations

8.1 Fixed License Fees
       Suppose that the firms bargain over a fixed license fee F (as, for example, in Hylton and
Zhang, 2017) instead of a royalty. If imports are not excluded, the two firms operate at the same
marginal cost, c ­ v, and, from (6) and (5), earn the same variable profit (0) = f(0) = m2/(2 +
s)2. For a case filed at the ITC, letting M = m2/4 represent the domestic firm's monopoly profit,
the Nash product is BIF(0)  ((0) + F ­ M)(f(0) ­ F). Maximization of BIF(0) yields FI = M/2
= m2/8. The two firms agree to a settlement in the ITC if and only if f(0) ­ FI > 0, which



                                                 15
requires that products be sufficient differentiated that s < 0.828. If s  0.828, which includes
homogenous products, the ITC imposes an injunction that excludes the infringing imports.

       If the case is filed in court, legal adjudication gives rise to royalty of v. Provided v is not
prohibitive (v < rP(s)), the Nash product is BCF(0)  ((0) + F ­ (v))(f(0) ­ F ­ f(v)). The firms
settle at the Nash bargaining solution, FC = ((v) - f(v))/2, if and only if

       f(0) ­ FC ­ f(v)  f(0) ­ ((v) + f(v))/2 > 0                                                 (14)

If the products are highly differentiated, there tends to be a settlement because fixed fees are a
more efficient way to collect revenue. For sufficiently similar products, a reduction in imports
raises the average profit of the two firms making (14) negative, so a royalty of v is the outcome.

       With respect to the domestic firm's choice of venue, we find that the court tends to be
favored if products are highly differentiated and the value of innovation is large. 5 Details differ,
but these are the same characteristics that favored a court rather than an ITC filing when a
royalty was the bargaining instrument. Despite the generality of this result, the fact that a
settlement based on a fixed fee provides no protection from imports and therefore has no effect
on domestic production remains an important difference between the two instruments for settling
international IP disputes.

8.2 The Default Royalty
       We have assumed that the default royalty in court is the value of the innovation. This is
consistent with our reading of the case record. The most important U.S. legal precedent in this
area is Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. United States Plywood Corp (1970), which sets out various
principles for courts to consider in royalty determination in patent infringement cases. The major
principles are "the advantages of the patent property over the old modes [of production]", the
"realizable profit that should be credited to the invention", and a hypothetical negotiation "if both
[firms] had been reasonably and voluntarily trying to reach an agreement". While the effect of




5For independent products, it follows from (14) that (0) ­ ((v) + f(v))/2 = v2/8 > 0. The
parties settle at FC = m2/8 + (a ­ c)(2v ­ (a ­ c))/8 in court, which exceeds FI = m2/8 from an ITC
settlement if v > (a - c)/2. For homogeneous products, (0) ­ ((v) + f(v))/2 = - v(a ­ c)/18 < 0,
so the court imposes v, but the domestic firm prefers an ITC injunction preventing imports.
                                                  16
these principles can be modelled in different ways, are all consistent with a default royalty of v
for plausible model specifications.

        One notable feature of our analysis (see Proposition 3) is that for innovations with a
sufficiently high value, the domestic firm's profit-maximizing royalty, r*, is less than v so both
firms prefer a lower royalty. Legal precedent and concerns about deterrence of patent
infringement might cause courts to impose a royalty of v even in such cases. However, it is
interesting to consider an alternative in which the default royalty is the minimum of v and r*.
This change would rule out any settlements in court. If v  r*(s), then the domestic firm would
continue to prefer a court adjudication of v rather than a settlement as shown in Proposition 6(i)
and if v > r*(s), the domestic firm would enjoy its profit-maximizing royalty. Since the
negotiated royalty, rI(s), for an ITC case is less than r*(s) (Proposition 4(ii)), it follows that if v >
r*(s), the domestic firm will choose to file in court. In this case, we have rI(s) < r*(s) = rC(s) < v
so the condition, rI(s) < v, in Proposition 8 under which the court provides more import
protection still applies.

8.3 Other Extensions
        Much of the literature on patent licensing emphasizes the role of uncertainty. Patents may
be ruled invalid and, even for valid patents, there is often uncertainty over whether infringement
will be found by the ITC or the court and, for court cases, over the size of the default royalty. If
the firms are risk neutral and symmetrically informed, we can simply interpret the payoffs as
expected values and the analysis is essentially unchanged. However, if there are important
informational asymmetries or if the firms are risk averse, then our analysis would be more
significantly affected.

        We also abstract from legal costs, including the cost of filing a claim, the cost of
litigating a case in court or before the ITC, and negotiation costs. Filing costs would be sunk
costs in the context of our model and would have no effect. To the extent that litigation costs
exceed negotiation costs, the effect would be to shift the outcome in the direction of settlements.
Such costs would not otherwise affect our analysis.

        Our model does not address the decision of the foreign firm to infringe the domestic
firm's patent, but it is nevertheless interesting to determine when such patent infringement is or


                                                   17
is not profitable for the foreign firm. For almost all incremental values of v (i.e for v  0.9559(a ­
c)), Proposition 3 shows that v < r*(s) so, from Proposition 6, the outcome in court is an
adjudicated royalty of v. Consequently, the foreign firm will typically gain no benefit from
infringement of incremental innovations for cases filed in court and, from Proposition 5, will
suffer a net loss for a broad range of cases filed at the ITC.

        But why would the foreign firm choose to infringe if it anticipates a possible reduction in
profits? The most obvious answer is based on uncertainty at a stage before our formal model
begins. Specifically, the foreign firm may not know if its chosen production process involves
infringement and may be uncertain as to whether a domestic firm will file a claim. Therefore, the
foreign firm's decision over its production process could have a positive expected value, even if
it has some probability of leading to profit-reducing litigation. Our model starts after the
resolution of such uncertainty and focuses on those cases in which infringement has occurred and
a case is filed.

        For intermediate or drastic innovations (v  a ­ c), Proposition 3 has shown that v > r*(s),
so from Proposition 6, the firms settle in court at a royalty that is less than r*(s) and v. As this
last result also applies for cases filed at the ITC (Proposition 5), it is notable that for intermediate
or drastic innovations there is always a negotiated settlement and the resulting royalty is less than
the value of the innovation. The foreign firm therefore obtains a net benefit from infringement of
intermediate or drastic innovations whether the case is filed in court or in the ITC. For high value
innovations, the strong incentive for the domestic firm to settle at a royalty below the value of
the innovation suggests that the existing IP protection available through the ITC or the courts
may not be very effective as a deterrent.

9. Concluding Remarks

        This paper draws attention to several important features of IP litigation applying to U.S.
imports. First, cases alleging infringement by imports may be filed either in district court or in
the International Trade Commission (ITC) and both venues are commonly used. Second, the ITC
normally uses injunctive relief (imports are excluded from the domestic market) whereas the
courts normally use fee-based relief (imports pay a royalty). Third, a majority of cases filed in
both venues are settled through negotiation between the parties before final legal adjudication.


                                                   18
        We provide a model of IP litigation that addresses these institutional features. With
homogenous products, the ITC provides more protection from infringing imports than the court
for incremental innovations and provides the same protection for intermediate or drastic
innovations. Thus, the homogenous products case is consistent with the standard intuition
expressed in much of the legal literature.

        When products are differentiated, we show that for a broad range of higher-value
innovations, the standard intuition is overturned. For these cases, an ITC filing provides less
protection from infringing imports than a filing in court. For any level of product differentiation,
the domestic firm's profit with a suitably chosen royalty exceeds the monopoly profit it would
earn from an ITC injunction. Consequently, the domestic firm is motivated to avoid an ITC
injunction by negotiating a settlement with the foreign firm. For drastic innovations and for
higher value incremental innovations with sufficient product differentiation, the domestic firm's
position in Nash bargaining at the ITC is weakened to the point that the negotiated royalty is
lower and imports are higher than if the case had been filed in court.

        Our model makes several important simplifications to make the underlying principles
clear. Relaxing these simplifications suggests natural areas of extension or generalization. In
addition to the extensions discussed in Section 8, we could also consider alternative demand and
market structures. While such extensions are potentially interesting, we believe that they would
not eliminate the primary economic forces identified in our model. Specifically, the role of
product differentiation and the role of innovation size should be robust to most reasonable
directions of generalization.

        Finally, the incentives identified here may apply in a much wider range of contexts, not
just to the enforcement of international IP claims. The general question as to the effects of
injunctive relief as opposed to fee-based relief for firms in an international trading environment
could be important for the design of other policies, such as environmental policy or competition
policy. We believe that our paper provides at least an interesting first step in a general
comparison of injunctive and fee-based relief for firms adversely affected by the actions of
foreign rivals.




                                                 19
Appendix A: Proofs of Propositions

Proposition 2: The domestic firm's profit-maximizing royalty
i) For any given s  (0,1), domestic profit is maximized at a unique royalty, r*(s), that exceeds
the level that maximizes royalty revenue, but does not prevent imports: rR(s) < r*(s) < rP(s).
ii) The profit-maximizing royalty, r*(s) for s  (0,1), approaches m/2 as s approaches either limit
(0 or 1) and reaches a unique minimum at an interior value of s, denoted s.

Proof: i) To maximize (r) for r  rP(s), we first use (5) to obtain

       x(r) = s/(4 ­ s2) > 0 and y(r) = ­2/(4 ­ s2) < 0                                          (A1)

Expanding '(r) = 2x(r)x'(r) + y(r) + ry(r) from (6), using (A1) and (5), it can be shown that

       (r) = [(4 + 2s ­ s2)(2 ­ s)m ­ 2r(8 ­ 3s2)]/(4 ­ s2)2                                     (A2)

where (r) = ­ 2(8 ­ 3s2)/(4 ­ s2)2 < 0. From (A2) and rP(s) = (2 - s)m/2 (see (7)) we obtain

       (rP(s)) = ­ 2(2 ­ s ­ s2)(2 - s)m/(4 ­ s2)2                                               (A3)

It follows from (A3) that (rP(s)) < 0 for s  (0,1) and hence r*(s) < rP(s). Setting (r*) = 0 in
(A2), we obtain

       r*(s) = (4 + 2s ­ s2)(2 ­ s)m/2(8 ­ 3s2)                                                  (A4)

Maximizing R = ry(r), rR(s) satisfies y(r) + ry(r) = 0, which, using (5) and (A1), implies

       rR(s) = (2 ­ s)m/4                                                                        (A5)

Comparing (A5) with (A4), it follows that rR(s) < r*(s) < rP(s) for s  (0,1).
ii) We have r*(1) = rP(1) = m/2 from (8) and r*(0) = m/2 from (A4). Using the continuity of r*(s)
for s  [0, 1], it follows that for s  (0,1), r*(s) approaches m/2 as s approaches 1 or 0. To find
the value of s that minimizes r*(s), we express (A4) as r*(s) = u(2 - s)m/2(8 - 3s2) where u  4 +
2s ­ s2 to obtain dr*(s)/ds = [(8 - 3s2)(2(1-s)(2-s) ­ u) + 6su(2-s)]m/2(8 - 3s2)2, which reduces to:

       dr*(s)/ds = s[­16 + 24s - 3s3]m/2(8 - 3s2)2                                               (A6)

We can express (A6) as dr*(s)/ds = 3s(s ­ 0.71173)(s + 3.12)(2.405 ­ s)m/2(8 - 3s2)2, which
implies that the unique solution to dr*(s)/ds = 0 for s  (0,1) is s = 0.71173. Since d2r*(s)/(ds)2


                                                  20
= 3sm/2(8 - 3s2)2 > 0, r*(s) is the unique minimum of r*(s) for s  (0,1).

Proposition 3: Innovation value and the domestic firm's profit-maximizing royalty
With differentiated products:
i) If the innovation is incremental (v < a ­ c), the domestic firm's profit-maximizing royalty
equals or exceeds the value of the innovation (r*(s)  v) for almost all values of v, specifically
for v  0.9559(a ­ c). If 0.9559(a ­ c) < v < a - c, then the comparison between r*(s) and v
depends on s and v.
ii) If the innovation is intermediate (v = a ­ c) or drastic (v > a ­ c), the domestic firm's profit
maximizing royalty is always below the value v of the innovation (r*(s) < v).

Proof: i) From the proof of Proposition 2(ii), the unique minimum of r*(s) for s  (0,1) is at s =
0.7117 and, from (A4), we obtain r*(s) = 0.48873m. Since r*(s)  r*(s) for all s  (0,1), a
sufficient condition for r*(s)  v is r*(s)  v. Using m  a ­ c + v, we obtain r*(s)  v for v 
0.9559(a ­ c). If 0.9559(a ­ c) < v < a ­ c, then v > r*(s), so v must equal r*(s) at two values of
s  (0,1). The comparison then depends on particular values of s and v.
ii) For intermediate or drastic innovations, it follows from v  a ­ c that v  m/2. Since r*(s) <
m/2 for s  (0,1) (Proposition 2(ii)), we obtain v > r*(s) for s  (0,1).

Lemma 1: Assume s  (0,1). If r  [0, r*(s)), the Nash product for an ITC case is strictly
concave in r:

        d2BI(r)/(dr)2 = - 12y(r)(r)/(4 ­ s2) < 0                                                  (A7)

If r  (r*(s), rP(s)], BI(r) is strictly convex in r.

Proof: From BI(r)  ((r) ­ (rP(s))f(r) as in (10), we obtain

        dBI(r)/dr = [(r) ­ (rP(s))]f(r) + f(r)(r)                                                 (A8)

Examining the terms in (A8), it follows from f(r) = (y(r))2 (see (6)) and (A1) that

        f(r) = -4y(r)/(4 ­ s2)                                                                    (A9)

From (6) and (5), we have (r) ­ (rP(s)) = (x(r))2 ­ (m/2)2 + ry(r). Manipulating (5), we obtain
x(r) = (m - sy(r))/2, which implies (x(r))2 ­ (m/2)2 = -sy(r)(x(r) + m/2)/2. Substituting x(r) from
(5), we can show that (x(r))2 ­ (m/2)2 = - sy(r)[(4 + s)(2 - s)m + 2sr]/4(4 ­ s2) and hence:

                                                       21
       (r) ­ (rP(s)) = - y(r)[s(4 + s)(2 - s)m ­ 2r(8 ­ 3s2)]/4(4 ­ s2)                          (A10)

Using (rP(s)) from (A3) and (r) from (A2), (A10) can be expressed as

       (r) ­ (rP(s)) = - (4 ­ s2)y(r)[(r) + (rP(s))]/4                                           (A11)

Using (A11), f(r) = -4y(r)/(4 ­ s2) and f(r) = 8/(4 - s2)2 from (A9), (A8) can be expressed as

        dBI(r)/dr = (y(r))2[2(r) + (rP(s))]                                                      (A12)

From (A2) and (A3), a useful relationship is:

       (r) = (rP(s)) + y(r)(8 ­ 3s2)/(4 ­ s2)                                                    (A13)

From (A12), using (r) = ­ 2(8 ­ 3s2)/(4 ­ s2)2 and (A13), we obtain d2BI(r)/(dr)2 = -
12y(r)(r)/(4 ­ s2) which is (A7). For r [0, r*(s)), using (r) < 0 and r*(s) < rP(s) for s  (0,1),
we have (r) > 0 and y(r) > 0 and hence d2BI(r)/(dr)2 < 0. If r (r*(s), rP(s)), then (r) < 0 and
d2BI(r)/(dr)2 > 0.

Proposition 4: Negotiated settlements at the ITC:
For ITC cases with differentiated products and Nash bargaining by firms:
i) There is always a settlement with some imports. The negotiated royalty is unique and is given
by rI(s)  (2 + 3s)(2 ­ s)m/2(8 ­ 3s2).
ii) The negotiated royalty is less than the domestic profit-maximizing royalty: rI(s) < r*(s)
iii) Greater product differentiation reduces the negotiated royalty and increases imports.

Proof: i) We maximize BI(r)  ((r) ­ (rP(s))f(r) from (10) subject to 0  r  rP(s) to obtain the
Nash bargaining solution, rI(s). From d(BI(rP(s))/ds = 0 from (A8) and d2BI(rP(s))/(dr)2 > 0 from
(A7) due to r*(s) < rP(s) for s  (0,1) (Proposition 2(ii)), BI(r) is minimized at r = rP(s). Thus, the
constraint r  rP(s) is not binding and from (A12), using (A2) and (A3), r = rI(s) satisfies:

       dBI(r)/dr = 2(y(r))2{(2 + 3s)(2 - s)m ­ 2r(8 ­ 3s2)}/(4 ­ s2)2 = 0                        (A14)

Since y(r) > 0 from r < rP(s), (A14) implies that:

       rI(s)  (2 + 3s)(2 - s)m/2(8 - 3s2) > 0                                                    (A15)

It follows from BI(rI(s)) > BI(rP(s)) = 0 that the firms always settle and from rI(s) < rP(s) that
there are always some imports.

                                                  22
ii) From (A4) and (A15), we obtain r*(s) ­ rI(s) = (2 ­ s ­ s2)(2 ­ s)m/2(8 ­ 3s2) > 0 for s  (0,1).
From the strict concavity of BI(r) for r  [0, r*(s)) and s  (0,1) (Lemma 1), rI(s) is unique.
iii) From (A15), we can show drI(s)/ds = 2(8 ­ 6s + 3s2)m/(8 ­ 3s2)2 > 0. Using y/r < 0 and
y/s < 0 from (5), we obtain dy/ds < 0, so a reduction in s increases imports.

Proposition 5: Royalties and the value of innovation for ITC cases
For ITC cases with differentiated products:
i) An increase in the innovation's value v increases the negotiated royalty, rI(s), but by less than
the increase in v: 0 < rI(s; v)/v < 1.
ii) For small incremental innovations defined by v  (a ­ c)/3, the negotiated royalty, rI(s),
strictly exceeds the value of the innovation (rI(s) > v).
iii) For larger incremental innovations ((a ­ c)/3 < v < a ­ c), there exists a critical value of s 
s(v)  (0,1) satisfying rI(s) = v, such that rI(s) < v if and only if the products are sufficiently
differentiated (s is sufficiently small) that s  (0, s(v)). As v becomes larger, s(v) increases,
expanding the range of cases for which rI(s) < v to include products that are more similar.
iv) For intermediate or drastic innovations (v  a - c), the negotiated royalty is strictly below the
value of the innovation (rI(s) < v).

Proof: i) From rI(s; v)  (4 + 4s ­ 3s2)m/2(8 - 3s2) (see (A15)) and m  a ­ c + v, we obtain
(rI(s; v)/v = (4 + 4s ­ 3s2)/2(8 - 3s2) > 0 and 1 - (rI(s; v)/v = (12 ­ 4s ­ 3s2)/2(8 - 3s2) > 0.
ii) From (A15), we obtain

        rI(s) ­ v = [(4 + 4s ­ 3s2)(a ­ c ­ 3v) + 2s(8 ­ 3s)v]/2(8 ­ 3s2)                            (A16)

From (A16), rI(s) ­ v > 0 for v  (a ­ c)/3.
iii) For (a ­ c)/3 < v < a ­ c, letting s = s  (0, 1) satisfy rI(s; v) = v, it follows from (A16) that

        3(a ­ c - v)s2 ­ 4ms + 4(3v ­ (a - c)) = 0                                                   (A17)

From (A17), s = 0 if v = (a ­ c)/3 and s = 1 if v = a ­ c, then s = 1. Totally differentiating rI(s; v)
= v and using rI(s; v)/v) < 1 from Part i and drI(s)/ds > 0 from Proposition 4, we obtain ds/dv =
(1 ­ rI(s; v)/v))/drI(s)/ds > 0. Hence s = s(v)  (0, 1) if and only if (a ­ c)/3 < v < a ­ c. From
rI(s) = v and drI(s)/ds > 0 (Proposition 4), it also follows that rI(s) < v for v  ((a ­ c)/3, a ­ c) if
and only if s  (0, s(v)). Since ds/dv > 0, an increase in v  ((a ­ c)/3, a ­ c) expands the range of


                                                   23
s for which rI(s) < v to include more substitutable products.

       For an incremental innovation (v < a ­ c), solving the quadratic function, (A17), for s, we
obtain a unique solution given by:

       s = s(v) = 2{m ­ [m2 ­ 3(a ­ c ­ v)(3v ­ (a ­ c)]1/2}/3(a ­ c ­ v)                      (A18)

There is a second, higher value, of s satisfying (A17), but this solution is ruled out because it
exceeds 2m/3(a ­ c ­ v), which, by itself, exceeds 1 for all v > (a - c)/5.
iv) For v  a ­ c and for s  (0, 1), we have rI(s) < r*(s) from Proposition 4(i) and r*(s) < v from
Proposition 3(ii), which implies rI(s) < r*(s) < v.

Lemma 2: Assume s  (0,1). If r  [0, v] where v < r*(s) or if r  [0, r*(s)] where r*(s) < v <
rP(s), then the Nash product for court cases, BC(r), is strictly concave in r:

       d2BC(r)/(dr)2 = ­ 4[3y(r)(r) ­ y(v)(v)]/(4 ­ s2) < 0                                    (A19)

Proof: From BC(r) = ((r) ­ (v))(f(r) ­ f(v)) for v < rP(s) and BI(r) = ((r) ­ (rP(s))f(r) (see
(12) and (10)), we obtain BC(r) = BI(r) + (r) where (r)  ­ ((r) ­ (v))f(v) ­ ((v) ­
(rP(s)))f(r). Hence,

       dBC(r)/dr = dBI(r)/dr + (r)                                                            (A20)

where (r) = ­ (r)f(v) ­ ((v) ­ (rP(s))f(r). From (A20) and d2BI(r)/(dr)2 as in (A7), we
obtain d2BC(r)/(dr)2 = ­ 12y(r)(r)/(4 ­ s2) + (r) where (r) = ­ f(v)(r) ­ ((v) ­
(rP(s))f(r). Using (v) ­ (rP(s)) from (A11), (r) = ­ 2(8 ­ 3s2)/(4 ­ s2)2 and f(r) = 8/(4 ­
s2)2, we can show

       (r) = 2y(v){y(v)(8 ­ 3s2)/(4 ­ s2) + [(v) + (rP(s))]}/(4 ­ s2)                          (A21)

Substituting (v) = (rP(s)) + y(v)(8 ­ 3s2)/(4 ­ s2) from (A13) in (A21), we obtain (r) =
4y(v)(v)/(4 ­ s2) and it follows that d2BC(r)/(dr)2 is as stated in (A19).

       From (r) < 0, we have (r)  0 for r  r*(s) and (v) < 0 for v > r*(s). If r  [0, r*(s)]
where r*(s) < v < rP(s), then, using y(r) > 0, we obtain d2BC(r)/(dr)2 < 0 from (A19). If r  [0, v]
and v < r*(s) then (v) > 0 and manipulating (17H), we obtain d2BC(r)/(dr)2 = - [4y(r)(3(r) -
(v)) + (v)(y(r) ­ y(v))] < 0. The sign follows from (r)  (v) and y(r)  y(v) for r  [0, v]
due to (r) < 0 and y(r) < 0.

                                                  24
Proposition 6: Settlement or adjudication in court when v < rP(s).
For cases filed in court with differentiated products and v < rP(s):
i) If v  r*(s) the firms do not settle and the court adjudicates a royalty of v.
ii) If v > r*(s) there is a settlement. The firms negotiate a unique royalty, rC(s), that exceeds zero
and is less than the domestic profit-maximizing royalty: 0 < rC(s) < r*(s).

Proof: For v < rP(s) and s  (0, 1), we maximize BC(r)  ((r) ­ (v))(f(r) ­ f(v)) from (12)
subject to 0  r  rP(s) to obtain the Nash bargaining solution, rC(s). The constraint r  rP(s) is
not binding: if r  (v, rP(s)], then f(r) ­ f(v) < 0 (see (A9)) and BC(r) < 0, whereas BC(v) = 0.
Consequently, rC(s) satisfies

       dBC(r)/dr = ((r) ­ (v))f(r) + (f(r) ­ f(v))(r) = 0                                       (A22)

which is (13) of the text.
i) If v  r*(s), then using (r) < 0, we obtain (r) > 0 and (r) ­ (v) < 0 for r  [0, v). Using
f(r) < 0 (see (A9)), we have f(r) - f(v) > 0 and hence dBC(r)/dr > 0 for r  [0, v) from (A22).
Since dBC(v)/dr = 0 from (A22), the unique maximum of BC(r) for r  [0, v] is at r = v (the
trivial solution). The domestic firm will not settle and the court imposes r = v.
ii) For r*(s) < v < rP(s), it follows from (r*(s)) = 0 and (r) < 0 that (v) < 0 and, from (A19),
we obtain d2BC(v)/(dr)2 = ­ 8y(v)(v)/(4 ­ s2) > 0. At r = v, we have dBC(v)/dr = 0 from (A22),
so BC(v) = 0 represents a minimum of BC(r) for r  v. The parties will choose to settle.

       To show that there exists rC(s)  (0, r*(s)) that maximizes BC(r), we show that dBC(0)/dr
> 0 and dBC(r*(s))/dr < 0. From (A22), (0) ­ (v) < 0, f(0) ­ f(v) > 0, f(r) < 0 and (0) > 0,
we have dBC(0)/dr > 0. From (A22), using (r*(s)) = 0, (r*(s)) ­ (v) > 0 and f(r) < 0, we
have dBC(r*(s))/dr = ((r*(s)) ­ (v))f(r*(s)) < 0. From d2BC(r)/(dr)2 < 0 for r  [0, r*(s)]
where r*(s) < v < rP(s) (Lemma 2), rC(s) satisfying (A22) is unique.

Proposition 7: Conditions for v < rP(s)
i) For differentiated products, a royalty of v allows some imports (v < rP(s)) if:
    (a) the innovation is incremental or intermediate (v  a ­ c);
    (b) the innovation is drastic (v > a ­c) and v  (a - c, (a - c)) where   (2 ­ s)/s > 1.




                                                  25
ii) In the limit as products become independent (s tends to zero), a royalty of v can never prevent
imports. As products become more substitutable, the range of values of v for which there are
imports is reduced and, in the limit as s tends to 1, there are no imports for v  a ­ c.

Proof: i) Using rP(s) = (2 - s)m/2 from (7) and m  a ­ c + v (see (3)), we obtain

        rP(s) ­ v = (2 ­ s)(a ­ c ­ v)/2 + v(1 - s)                                               (A23)

(a) From (A23), rP(s) ­ v > 0 if v  a ­ c. (b) Rearranging (A23), we obtain rP(s) ­ v = [(2 ­ s)(a
­ c) ­ sv]/2. Letting   (2 ­ s)/s for s  0, it follows that rP(s) ­ v > 0 if and only if v < (a ­ c),
where s < 1 implies  > 1. If the innovation is drastic (v > a - c), then v < rP(s) if and only if v 
(a - c, (a - c)).
ii) Setting s = 0 in (A23), we obtain rP(0) ­ v = a ­ c > 0, which shows that in the limit as s  0
there are always some imports at r = v. From d/ds = - 2/s2 < 0, an increase in s reduces the range
of v  (a - c, (a - c)) for which v < rP(s). From (A23), we obtain rP(1) ­ v = (a ­ c ­ v)/2  0 for
v  a ­c, so in the limit as s  1, a royalty of v is prohibitive for v  a ­c.

Proposition 8: Does the ITC or the Court provide more import protection?
With differentiated products and v < rP(s):
i) The ITC provides more import protection than the court if rI(s) > v.
ii) The two venues provide equal import protection if rI(s) = v.
iii) The ITC provides less import protection than the court if the negotiated royalty for an ITC
case is less than the cost-reducing value of the innovation: rI(s) < v.

Proof: i) If rI(s) > v, then rI(s) > rC(s) due to rC(s)  v when the default royalty is v. The ITC has
the higher royalty, so from (5), it provides more import protection.
ii) To show that rC(s) = rI(s) if rI(s) = v, the result follows immediately if v  r*(s), since then a
royalty of v is adjudicated in court (Proposition 6). The case v > r*(s) is not relevant since rI(s) <
r*(s) (Proposition 4) implies rI(s)  v.
iii) To show that import protection is lower at the ITC (rI(s) < rC(s)) for rI(s) < v, we first
consider v  r*(s). If v  r*(s), then rC(s) = v due to court adjudication (Proposition 6), proving
the result for rI(s) < v  r*(s). If v > r*(s), then rC(s) < r*(s) < v (Proposition 6) and rI(s) < r*(s) <
v (Proposition 4). From the strict concavity of BC(r) for r  [0, r*(s)] where r*(s) < v < rP(s)
(Lemma 2), to prove rI(s) < rC(s) for rI(s) < v, it remains to prove that dBC(rI(s))/dr > 0.

                                                      26
        From dBC(r)/dr = dBI(r)/dr + (r) as in (A20), it follows, setting dBI(r)/dr = 0, that
dBC(rI(s))/dr = (rI) = ­ ((v) ­ (rP(s))f(rI) ­ (rI)f(v). Substituting (rI) = -[(rI) ­
(rP(s))]f(rI)/f(rI) (from dBI(r)/dr = 0 and (A8)), and using f(r) = (y(r))2 and f(r) = -4y(r)/(4
­ s2 ) (from (A9)), we can show

        dBC(rI(s))/dr = 4[((v) ­ (rP(s))(y(rI))2 ­ ((rI) ­ (rP(s))(y(v))2]/y(rI)(4 ­ s2)             (A24)

Letting (r)  2r(8 ­ 3s2) ­ s(4 + s)(2 ­ s)m, it follows from (A10) that (r) ­ (rP(s)) =
y(r)(r)/4(4 ­ s2), so (A24) can be expressed as:

        dBC(rI(s))/dr = y(v)[(v)y(rI(s)) ­ (rI(s))y(v)]/(4 ­ s2)2                                    (A25)

From (A25) using (v) ­ (r) = 2(v ­ r)(8 ­ 3s2) and y(r) ­ y(v) = 2(v ­ r)/(4 ­ s2), we obtain
dBC(rI(s))/dr = 2(v ­ rI(s))y(v)[(rI(s)) + (4 ­ s2)y(rI(s))(8 ­ 3s2)]/(4 ­ s2)3 and hence

        dBC(rI(s))/dr = 8(v ­ rI(s))y(v)(2 ­ s)m[2 ­ s(1 + s)]/(4 ­ s2)3                             (A26)

It follows from (A26), s  (0,1) and y(v) > 0 for v < rP(s) that if rI(s) < v then dBC(rI(s))/dr > 0,
which proves that rI(s) < rC(s) for rI(s) < r*(s) < v and hence proves the result.

Proposition 9: Innovation size and protection from imports by venue
With differentiated products:
i) For small incremental innovations (v  (a ­ c)/3), the ITC provides more protection from
imports than the court. A royalty of v is adjudicated by the court, whereas in the ITC, the firms
settle at r = rI(s) that strictly exceeds v.
ii) For larger incremental innovations ((a ­ c)/3 < v < a ­ c), the ITC provides less protection
from imports than the court if and only if the products are sufficiently differentiated that s < s(v)
where s satisfies rI(s)  v. If s < s(v), firms settle on a royalty, rI(s), in the ITC that is strictly less
than v and less than any royalty, rC(s), negotiated in court. The higher is the value of v, the
greater is the range of product differentiation for which the ITC provides less protection from
imports than the court.
iii) For innovations that are intermediate or drastic but not so drastic that a royalty of v is
prohibitive (v  [a - c, (a - c)) where   (2 ­ s)/s > 1), the ITC provides less protection from
imports than the court. The firms settle on a royalty below v in both venues, but the royalty is
strictly lower in the ITC.


                                                    27
iv) For very drastic innovations (v  rP(s)), the ITC and the court provide the same protection
against imports. There is a settlement in both venues and Nash bargaining in the court and the
ITC yield the same royalty giving rise to the same (positive) level of imports.

Proof: i) If v  (a ­ c)/3, then v < r*(s) (Proposition 3(i)), which implies a royalty of v
adjudicated by the court (Proposition 6(i)). For ITC cases, the firms always settle (Proposition 4)
at a royalty, rI(s), that strictly exceeds v (Proposition 5). Since a higher royalty reduces imports
(y(r) < 0 from (A1)), the ITC provides more import protection than the court.
ii) If (a ­ c)/3 < v < a ­ c, then for ITC cases, the firms settle at rI(s) < v if and only if s < s(v)
where s satisfies rI(s)  v and s(v) > 0 (Proposition 5(iii)). Since rI(s) < rC(s) if and only if rI(s) <
v (Proposition 8(iii)), the ITC provides less import protection than the court if and only if s <
s(v). The effect of a higher value of v follows from ds/dv > 0 (Proposition 5(iii)).
iii) If v  a ­ c and v < rP(s) then v  [a - c, (a - c)) where   (2 ­ s)/s > 1 (Proposition 7) and
r*(s) < v for all s  (0,1) (Proposition 3(ii)). In court, the firms settle at r = rC(s) < r*(s) < v
(Proposition 6(ii)). In the ITC, the firms also settle at r = rI(s) < r*(s) < v (Proposition 5(iv)), but
since rI(s) < v and v < rP(s), we have rI(s) < rC(s) (Proposition 8(iii)), which proves that the ITC
provides less protection from imports than the court.
iv) If v  rP(s), then adjudication in either venue excludes imports and, in court, the parties
negotiate a royalty of the same value, r = rI(s), that would be negotiated in the ITC (see section
6.3 of the text). It follows from rI(s) < r*(s) (Proposition 4(i)) and r*(s) < rP(s) for s  (0,1)
(Proposition 2(i)) that rI(s) < rP(s), so imports are strictly positive at the settlement.

Proposition 10: Choosing where to file
For v < rP(s) and s  (0,1), the domestic firm would choose to file in the venue that yields the
higher license whether by settlement or adjudication. Some imports occur, but the chosen venue
has lower imports.

Proof: If v < rP(s), the royalty determined in the ITC or the court, whether by a settlement or
adjudication, is less than r*(s) (Propositions 4(i) and (5)). From (r) < 0, we have (r) > 0 for r
< r*(s) and hence the domestic firm will increase its profit by choosing the venue that results in
the higher royalty.
