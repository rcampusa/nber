                                               ABSTRACT

A central challenge in the measurement of entrepreneurship is accounting for the wide variation in
entrepreneurial quality across firms. This paper develops a new approach for estimating entrepreneurial
quality by linking the probability of a growth outcome (e.g., achieving an IPO or a significant acquisition)
as a function of start-up characteristics observable at or near the time of initial business registration
(e.g., the firm name or filing for a trademark/patent). Our approach allows us to characterize entrepreneurial
quality at an arbitrary level of geographic granularity (placecasting) and in advance of observing the
ultimate growth outcomes associated with any cohort of start-ups (nowcasting). We implement this
approach in Massachusetts from 1988-2014, yielding several key findings. First, consistent with Guzman
and Stern (2015), we find that a small number of observable start-up characteristics allow us to distinguish
the potential for a significant growth outcome: in an out-of-sample test, more than 75% of growth
outcomes occur in the top 5% of our estimated quality distribution. Second, we propose two new economic
statistics for the measurement of entrepreneurship: the Entrepreneurship Quality Index (EQI) and
the Regional Entrepreneurship Cohort Potential Index (RECPI). We use these indices to offer a novel
characterization of changes in entrepreneurial quality across space and time. For example, we are
able to document changes in entrepreneurial quality leadership between the Route 128 corridor, Cambridge
and Boston, as well as more granular assessments that allow us to distinguish variation in average
entrepreneurial quality down to the level of individual addresses. Third, we find a high correlation
between an index that depends only on information directly observable from business registration
records (and so can be calculated on a real-time basis) with an index that allows for a two-year lag
that allows the estimate of entrepreneurial quality to incorporate early milestones such as patent or
trademark application or being featured in local newspapers. Finally, we find that the most significant
“gap” between our index and the realized growth outcomes of a given cohort seem to be closely related
to investment cycles: while the most successful cohort of Massachusetts start-ups was founded in
1995, the year 2000 cohort registered the highest estimated quality.

     A central challenge of economic measurement arises from the inevitable gap between the

theoretical rationale for an economic statistic and the phenomena being measured. Not simply

an abstract concern, the ability to reliably and systematically link economic phenomena closely

linked to productivity or economic growth is central to the ability of policymakers and

researchers to evaluate policy or understand the drivers of economic performance.

     These concerns are particularly salient in the measurement of entrepreneurship. Though

entrepreneurship is often cited by economists and policymakers as central to the process of

economic growth and performance (Schumpeter, 1942; Aghion and Howitt, 1992; Davis and

Haltiwanger, 1992), measuring the “type” of entrepreneurship that seems likely to be associated

with overall economic performance has been challenging.      While studies of high-performance

ventures primarily rely on samples that select a population of firms that have already achieved

relatively rare milestones such as the receipt of venture capital, broader population studies of

entrepreneurs and small business emphasize the low growth prospects of the average self-

employed individual (Hamilton, 2000; Hurst and Pugsley, 2011).        As emphasized by Schoar

(2010) in her synthesis of entrepreneurship on a global basis, there is a gap between the small

                                               3
number of transformative entrepreneurs whose ambition and capabilities are aligned with scaling

a dynamic and growing business and the much more prevalent incidence of subsistence

entrepreneurs whose activities are an (often inferior) substitute to low-wage employment.

      It is important to emphasize that, though luck and unobserved ability undoubtedly play an

important role in the entrepreneurial process, the gap in the outcomes and impact of different

ventures also reflect ex ante fundamental differences in the potential of those ventures. While

most “Silicon Valley”-type start-ups fail, their intention at the time of founding is to build a

company with a high level of equity and/or employment growth (and often are premised on

exploiting new technology or serving an entirely new customer segment). At the same time, the

ambition and potential for even a “successful” local business is often quite modest, and might

involve building a firm of a small number of employees and yielding income comparable to that

which would have been earned through wage-based employment. In other words, as emphasized

by Hurst and Pugsley (2010), though policymakers and theory often treat entrepreneurs as a

homogenous group (at least from an ex ante perspective), entrepreneurs seem to be very

heterogeneous in terms of the ambition and potential of their ventures. For the purposes of

measurement, then, it is critical that we not only capture variation in entrepreneurial outcomes

but also develop the capability to measure variation in the quality of entrepreneurial ventures

from the time of founding.

      Building on Guzman and Stern (2015), 1 this paper develops a novel approach to the

estimation of entrepreneurial quality that allows us to characterize regional clusters of


1
  Guzman and Stern (2015) introduces the distinction between entrepreneurial quality and quantity and the broad
methodology in this paper of predicting growth outcomes from start-up characteristics available at or around the time of
founding for a population sample of business registrants. At some points in describing the methodology and data, we
draw from that paper to accurately describe our procedures and sample. This paper significantly extends and expands
upon Guzman and Stern (2015) in several respects, including the formal definition and proposal for two new economic
statistics (EQI and RECPI), the inclusion of additional start-up characteristics variables such as media mentions and a


                                                          4
entrepreneurship at an arbitrary level of granularity (placecasting), and examine the dynamics of

entrepreneurial quality over time on a near real-time basis (nowcasting). Our approach combines

three interrelated insights. First, because the challenges to reach a growth outcome as a sole

proprietorship are formidable, a practical requirement for any growth-oriented entrepreneur is

business registration (as a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company).                          We take

advantage of the public nature of business registration records (in this paper, from the state of

Massachusetts from 1988-2014) to define a population sample of entrepreneurs observed at a

similar (and foundational) stage of the entrepreneurial process. Second, moving beyond simple

counts of business registrants (Klapper, Amit, and Guillen, 2010), we are able to measure

characteristics related to entrepreneurial quality at or close to the time of registration. For

example, we can measure start-up characteristics such as whether the founders name the firm

after themselves (eponymy), whether the firm is organized in order to facilitate equity financing

(e.g., registering as a corporation or in Delaware), or whether the firm acquires or develops

measurable innovations (e.g., a patent or trademark). Third, we leverage the fact that, though

rare, we observe meaningful growth outcomes for some firms (e.g., those that achieve an IPO or

high-value acquisition within six years of founding), and are therefore able to estimate the

relationship between these growth outcomes and start-up characteristics.

      We apply our approach in the context of Massachusetts from 1988-20142. First, consistent

with Guzman and Stern (2015) (which uses our approach on California data), we find that a



measure for serial founders, extending the method to a second state (Massachusetts), evaluating the dynamics over time at
both the state level as well at more granular regional levels, and explicitly comparing an index that can be computed in
real-time versus one that incorporates information from early milestones over the first two years of the venture.
   2
     Our current results depend on a cross section of firms using the locations listed as of November, 2014, rather than
their founding location. In a series of tests, we find the probability of changing location to be low – for example, for
cohorts from 2008-2012, the probability of changing zip codes is 0.12. We are currently undertaking a data effort to
account, to the extent feasible using public data, for the full history of location changes for all firms.


                                                           5
small number of characteristics allow us to develop a robust predictive model that distinguishes

firm quality. In an out-of-sample test, we find that 77% of realized growth outcomes occur in

the top 5% of our estimated quality distribution (and nearly 50% in the top 1% of the estimated

quality distribution). Importantly, we find that there is significant benefit in predictive accuracy

from including multiple start-up characteristics (relative to, say, exclusively relating quality to a

single characteristic such as applying for a patent), and, at the same time, the quantitative

significance of different start-up characteristics are roughly similar in our sample here and our

sample of California firms in Guzman and Stern (2015).

     We then use these estimates to propose two new economic statistics for the measurement of

entrepreneurship: the Entrepreneurship Quality Index (EQI) and the Regional Entrepreneurship

Cohort Potential Index (RECPI). EQI is a measure of average quality within any given group of

firms, and allows for the calculation of the probability of a growth outcome for a firm within a

specified population of start-ups. RECPI multiples EQI and the number of start-ups within a

given geographical region (e.g., a town or even the state of Massachusetts). Whereas EQI

compares entrepreneurial quality across different groups (and so facilitates apples-to-apples

comparisons across groups of different sizes), RECPI allows the direct calculation of the

expected number of growth outcomes from a given start-up cohort within a given regional

boundary.

      We use these indices to offer a novel characterization of changes in entrepreneurial quality

across space and time. We start with an overall assessment of Massachusetts, where RECPI

increased dramatically during the second half of the 1990s, and then falls dramatically in the

wake of the dot-com crash. RECPI then increased by more than 25% from its low in 2003

through 2012.    We find that RECPI has predictive power:           while there is no meaningful


                                                 6
relationship between the pattern of growth outcomes and the number of new firms (i.e., a

measure of quantity), RECPI at the county-year level has a strong quantitative and statistical

relationship with the number of realized growth outcomes.

     We then turn to our placecasting applications, where we characterize entrepreneurial

quality at different levels of geographic granularity (but do not directly use information about the

location itself). We document striking variation in the level of average entrepreneurial quality

across different Massachusetts towns: the area around Boston has a much higher average level

of entrepreneurial quality than the rest of the state, and there is striking variation within the

Boston metro area, with Kendall Square, the northeast Route 128 corridor and the Boston

Innovation District registering a very high level of average entrepreneurial quality. Over time,

we document a striking change in entrepreneurial quality leadership as the Route 128 corridor

has ceded EQI leadership to Cambridge. We are also able to offer more granular assessments,

including comparing the areas immediately surrounding MIT / Kendall Square versus Harvard

Square, and illustrating the micro-geography of entrepreneurial quality with an address-level

visualization of the area immediately surrounding MIT.

     We then examine the potential for nowcasting entrepreneurial quality, where we evaluate

whether it is possible to make timely entrepreneurial quality predictions in advance of observing

the ultimate growth outcomes associated with any cohort of start-ups. We specifically compare

an index which relies only on start-up characteristics immediately observable at the time of

business registration (name, Delaware registration, etc) with an index that allows for a two-year

lag in order to incorporate early milestones such as patent or trademark application or being

featured in local newspapers. Our results suggest that, though there is information that is




                                                 7
gleaned from allowing for a lag, a nowcasted EQI is feasible and closely correlated with a more

patient index.

     Finally, we begin to consider the relationship between our measures and issues of

theoretical or policy interest. Specifically, we find that the most significant “gap” between our

index and the realized growth outcomes of a given cohort seem to be closely related to

investment cycles: while the most successful cohort of Massachusetts start-ups was founded in

1995, the year 2000 cohort registered the highest estimated quality. This finding is particularly

important in the light of recent work on capital market cycles, the need for follow-on financing

and innovative entrepreneurship (Nanda and Rhodes-Kropf, 2013; Nanda and Rhodes-Kropf,

2014). Though we are cautious in interpreting our results, our results are consistent with the idea

that an important loss from variation in the level of risk capital financing is the lack of follow-on

investment for precisely the cohort of ventures that actually registered the highest overall

potential impact.     More generally, consistent with earlier studies of the concentration of

innovation such as Audretsch and Feldman (1996) and Furman, Porter and Stern (2002), our

findings highlight the idea that, relative to the overall level of entrepreneurial activity,

entrepreneurial quality is highly clustered in both space and time.               Uncovering why

entrepreneurial quality is concentrated remains an important topic for future research.

     The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. We motivate our approach by discussing the

need for a measure of entrepreneurial quality in Section II, and then present a methodology for

constructing such a measure in Section III. Section IV introduces the data, and Sections V and

VI present our key findings. A final section concludes.




                                                 8
II. Why is the Measurement of Entrepreneurial Quality Important?

            Our motivation for developing an index of entrepreneurial quality stems from a growing

agreement within entrepreneurship scholars that while new firms seem to have a positive effect

in regional economic growth on average (Davis and Haltiwanger, 1992; Haltiwanger, Jarmin and

Miranda, 2013; Kortum and Lerner, 2000; Glaeser, Kerr, and Kerr, 2014), there is very

significant heterogeneity across firms from the time of their founding, and only a very small

fraction of start-ups seem to be driving the economy-wide benefits from entrepreneurship (Kerr,

Nanda, and Rhodes-Kropf, 2014). As emphasized by Schoar, even if entrepreneurship has a net

positive effect, policy efforts that aim to increase the supply of entrepreneurship without regard

to quality could have a negative economic effect: “I argue that unless we understand the

differences between those two types of entrepreneurs more clearly, many policy interventions

may have unintended consequences and may even have an adverse impact on the economy.”

(Schoar, 2010; also see Hurst and Pugsley, 2010, Lerner, 2010, and Decker, Haltiwanger,

Jarmin, and Miranda, 2014, for further discussion).

            While there is increasing understanding of the importance of accounting for

heterogeneity among entrepreneurs in the measurement of entrepreneurship, developing

systematic measures of entrepreneurial quality has been challenging.                                    In the area of

entrepreneurial finance, researchers have often proceeded by simply examining samples of firms

that have reached relatively rare milestones such as venture capital: while this facilitates the

examination of the dynamics of high-potential firms, it nonetheless creates a disconnect between

these small samples of selected firms and the overall population of start-up firms.3 At the same

3
    Self selection into the sample can result in a different type of selectivity. For example, the Startup Genome Project is a


                                                               9
time, researchers have attempted to use publicly available data to develop specific indices of

entrepreneurship, often at the regional level. Most of these indices have focused either on

measures of entrepreneurial quantity (e.g., the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity

measures the rate of start-ups per capita using data from the Current Population Survey, and

work by Leora Klapper and co-authors has provided benchmarking data for the rate of business

registration across countries and time (Klapper, Amit, and Guillen, 2010), or on surveys that

measure entrepreneurial attention, attitudes, or entrepreneurial activity (with the Global

Entrepreneurship Monitor being the most influential and systematic effort based on surveys on a

global basis (see Amoros and Bosma, 2014)). While these efforts have provided significant

insight into the overall rate and attitudes towards entrepreneurial activity, these approaches have

yet to directly address the interplay between the heterogeneity among entrepreneurs and the

process of economic growth. Finally, research exploiting establishment-level data such as the

Longitudinal Business Data (or the more aggregated Business Dynamics Statistics) have been

able to document the role of entrepreneurship in job creation (e.g., emphasizing the importance

of young firms rather than small firms in that process), and also highlighting an observed

reduction in the rate of business dynamism in the United States over time (Haltiwanger, 2012;

Decker, Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda, 2014; Hathaway and Litan, 2014a).                                      But, as

emphasized by Hathaway and Litan, the challenge in directly incorporating heterogeneity is a

measurement problem: “The problem is that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to know at the




private effort to characterize regional start-ups aiming to address challenges of measuring the nature of start-up activity
(Reister, 2014). However, the data they have gathered through self-submission and curated methods is very far from
comprehensive. For example, in the Cambridge Innovation Center at 1 Broadway, in Cambridge, MA, Startup Genome
identifies only 9 (presumably active) firms at the time of writing, while business registration records show 229 new firms
at this address between 2007 and 2012.


                                                            10
time of founding whether or not firms are likely to survive and/or grow.” (Hathaway and Litan,

2014b).

       Establishing a measurement framework for entrepreneurial quality would not simply be

of interest for policymakers but would also allow for the direct assessment of key questions in

entrepreneurship. For example, while clusters of entrepreneurship such as Silicon Valley or

Boston are associated with a disproportionate share of companies that achieve a meaningful

growth outcome (e.g., an IPO or acquisition), is this due simply to the fact that these areas are

home to higher quality ventures or is there a separate impact of being located in a fertile

entrepreneurial ecosystem? How does the quality of entrepreneurship vary across different types

of founders (e.g., men versus women, or other demographic distinctions)? Finally, how does

entrepreneurial quality vary with investment cycles (i.e., how does the level of entrepreneurial

quality change during an investment boom, and what happens to high-quality entrepreneurial

ventures that are founded just before an investment slowdown)? A measure of entrepreneurial

quality could also be used to evaluate the impact of specific policy changes and programs, and

also evaluate the role of institutions that impact some start-ups but not others. More generally,

systematic measurement of entrepreneurial quality has the potential to serve as a tool for a broad

range of questions relating to the causes and consequences of entrepreneurship.



III. Methodology

       Building on this motivation, we now develop a novel methodology for estimating

entrepreneurial quality for a population sample of start-ups at the time of founding, and propose

preliminary candidates for two novel economic statistics to track and evaluate regional

entrepreneurial performance: an Entrepreneurial Quality Index (EQI), a measure of the average


                                                11
quality of new firms, and a Regional Entrepreneurship Cohort Potential Index (RECPI), equal to

the average quality of new firms multiplied by the number of new firms within a given cohort-

region. Our approach combines three interrelated elements: the ability to observe a population

sample of entrepreneurs, a procedure to estimate entrepreneurial quality for each start-up at the

firm level, and a procedure to aggregate across quality into regional indices.

         Data Requirements. A first requirement for a timely and granular index of entrepreneurial

quality is an unbiased (ideally population) sample of new firms, and the ability to identify the

quantity and quality of entrepreneurship of new cohorts on a timely basis.4 As discussed further

in the Data section, we exploit publicly available business registration records to satisfy this first

requirement. Since business registration is a practical (and straightforward) requirement for

growth, the sample of business registrants in a given time period composes a meaningful cohort

of start-ups for which one could evaluate quantity (the number of business registrants, or the

number of business registrants of a certain type) as well as quality (by assessing the underlying

quality of each business registrant in a standardized way).

         Estimating Entrepreneurial Quality. To assess quality (at any level of granularity), we

must first be able to estimate entrepreneurial quality for any given firm. To do so, we take

advantage of the fact that, both directly within business registration records as well as through

other publicly available data sources (such as the patent and trademark record, the news media,

etc), we are able to potentially observe a set of “start-up characteristics.” The central challenge

is to develop a systematic approach that allows one to rank different start-ups based on these

start-up characteristics. We do so by creating a mapping between a meaningful growth outcome


4
  Limiting the sample to firms having achieved a meaningful intermediate outcome (e.g., the receipt of venture capital)
will inevitably conflate the process of selection into the intermediate outcome (which itself is likely to be changing over
time and location) with the variation in underlying quality of ventures across time and location.


                                                            12
(observed of course with a lag) and the characteristics observable at or near the time of founding.

More precisely, for a firm i born in region r at time t, with start-up characteristics                                , we

observe a growth outcome                    s years after founding and estimate:

                                                                                                                    (1)

Using this predictive model, we are able to predict quality as the probability of achieving a

growth outcome given start-up characteristics at birth, and so estimate entrepreneurial quality as

       .5 To operationalize this idea, we draw on standard approaches in predictive modeling and

divide our sample into three separate elements: a training sample, a test sample, and a prediction

sample. The training sample is composed of the majority of observations for which we can

observe both start-up characteristics and the growth outcome (i.e., the observable growth sample

ends s years prior to the present) and is the sample we use to estimate (1). 6 We are then able to

use the remaining data from the observable growth sample to conduct out-of-sample validation

of our estimates (and of course are able to draw these samples multiple times to evaluate the

robustness of our results to alternative draws of both samples). Finally, we are able to construct

a prediction sample in which we observe start-up characteristics but have not yet observed the

growth outcome. As long as the process by which start-up characteristics map to growth remain

stable over time (an assumption which is itself testable), we are able to then develop an estimate

for entrepreneurial quality even for very recent cohorts. In particular, we can examine the

tradeoff between relying exclusively on start-up characteristics immediately observable at the

time of business registration (which will allow one to create real-time statistics) with estimates


5
  While there exist several data mining methods to build a predictive model (including linear regression, binary regression,
and neural networks), our methodology uses a logit regression, which performs well in quality of predictions (relative to a
linear probability model) while still allowing interpretability of the economic magnitudes and significance of the
coefficients for the measures used (Pohlman and Leitner, 2003).
6
  We reserve 30% of the sample for which we observe both the growth outcome and start-up characteristics for the test
sample.

that allow for a lag in order to incorporate early milestones such as patent or trademark

application or being featured in local newspapers.

          Calculating an Entrepreneurial Quality Index.      To create an index of entrepreneurial

quality for any group of firms (e.g., all the groups within a particular cohort or a group of firms

satisfying a particular condition), we simply take the average quality within that group.

Specifically, in our regional analysis, we define the Entrepreneurial Quality Index (EQI) as an

aggregate of quality at the region-year level by simply estimating the average of          over that

region:

                                                                                              (2)

where         represents the set of all firms in region r and year t, and    represents the number

of firms in that region-year. To ensure that our estimate of entrepreneurial quality for region r

reflects the quality of start-ups in that location rather than simply assuming that start-ups from a

given location are associated with a given level of quality, we exclude any location-specific

measures Xr,t from the vector of observable start-up characteristics.

          Three particular features of EQI are notable. First, while the general form of            is a

panel format, it is possible to construct a cross-sectional distribution of quality at a moment in

time (i.e.,          ) to facilitate analyses such as spatial mapping.       Second, the level of

geographical aggregation is arbitrary: while the discussion of a “region” may connote a large

geographic area, it is possible to calculate EQI at the level of a city, ZIP code, or even individual

addresses. Finally, we can extend EQI in order to study an arbitrary grouping of firms (i.e., we

do not need to select exclusively on geographic boundaries). For example, we can examine start-

ups whose founder share a common demographic characteristic (e.g., sex), or firms that

undertake a specific strategic action (e.g., engage in crowdfunding).

                                                  14
       The Regional Entrepreneurship Cohort Potential Index (RECPI). From the perspective

of a given region, the overall potential for a cohort of start-ups requires combining both the

quality of entrepreneurship in a region and the number of firms in such region (a measure of

quantity). To do so, we define RECPI as simply           multiplied by the number of firms in that

region-year:

                                                                                            (3)

       Since our index multiplies the average probability of a firm in a region-year to achieve

growth (quality) by the number of firms, it is, by definition, the expected number of growth

events from a region-year given the start-up characteristics of a cohort at birth. Under the

assumption of excluding regional effects (e.g., agglomeration economies) or time-based effects

(e.g., changes in available financing), our index can be interpreted as a measure of the

“potential” of a region given the “intrinsic” quality of firms at birth, which can then be affected

by the impact of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, or shocks to the economy and the cohort between

the time of founding and a growth outcome.

        Assessing the Merit of our Quality Estimates. Our methodology estimates the quality of

new firms through a predictive model of probability of achieving a growth outcome, and as such

the predictive accuracy of the model must be evaluated before relying on its estimates to draw

economic inference. Specifically, given concerns about the potential for over-fitting (Taddy,

2013), we reserve 30% of the observable growth outcome sample in order to conduct out-of-

sample validation.    In particular, we conduct the analysis multiple times to evaluate the

robustness of our estimates to the sample from which it is drawn, and also plot the share of

realized outcomes (in the test sample) associated with different percentiles of our estimated




                                                15
quality distribution.      Robustness of the coefficients to different samples, and a model with

strong predictive accuracy in out-of-sample testing are stronger candidates as economic statistics.




IV. Data

        As mentioned earlier, our analysis leverages publicly available business registration

records, a potentially rich and systematic data for entrepreneurship and business dynamics.

Business registration records are public records created when individuals register a business.

This analysis focuses on the state of Massachusetts from 1988-2014 (see Appendix I for a short

description and discussion of these records). During the time of our sample, it was possible to

register several types of businesses: corporations, limited liability companies, limited liability

partnerships, and general partnerships. While it is possible to found a new business without

business registration (e.g., a sole proprietorship), the benefits of registration are substantial,

including limited liability, protection of the entrepreneur’s personal assets, various tax benefits,

the ability to issue and trade ownership shares, credibility with potential customers, and the

ability to deduct expenses. Furthermore, all corporations, partnerships, and limited liability must

register with the state in order to take advantage of these benefits: the act of registering the firm

triggers the legal creation of the company. As such, these records form the population of

Massachusetts businesses that take a form that is a practical prerequisite for growth.7

        Concretely, our analysis draws on the complete population of firms satisfying one of the

following conditions: (a) a for-profit firm whose jurisdiction is in Massachusetts or (b) a for-



7
 This section draws on Guzman and Stern (2015), where we introduce the use of business registration records in the
context of entrepreneurial quality estimation.


                                                       16
profit firm whose jurisdiction is in Delaware but whose principal office address is in

Massachusetts.          In other words, our analysis excluded non-profit organizations as well as

companies whose primary location is external to Massachusetts. Applied over the years 1988-

2014, the resulting dataset is composed of 541,666 observations 8 . For each observation we

construct variables related to (a) the growth outcome for each start-up, (b) start-up characteristics

based on business registration observables and (c) start-up characteristics based on external

observables that can be linked directly to the startup. Table 1 reports the summary statistics,

both for the overall sample (divided out by our estimation and prediction sample periods) and

conditional on whether the firm achieved a growth outcome or not.

         Growth. The growth outcome utilized in this paper, Growth, is a dummy variable equal to

1 if the startup achieves an initial public offering (IPO) or is acquired at a meaningful positive

valuation within 6 years of registration9. Both outcomes are drawn from Thomson Reuters SDC

Platinum.10 We observe 462 positive growth outcomes for the 1988-2005 startup cohorts (used

in all our regressions), yielding a mean of Growth of 0.0014. The median acquisition price is $77

million (ranging from a minimum of $11.9 million at the 5th percentile to $1.92 billion at the 95th

percentile).11




    8
      The number of firm births in our sample is substantially higher than the US Census Longitudinal Business Database
(LBD), done from tax records. For Massachusetts in the period 2003-2012, the LBD records an average of 9,450 new
firms per year and we record an average of 24,066 firm registrations. While the reasons for this difference are still to be
explored, there are at least two reasons which we expect will be in part causing this difference: (i) partnerships and LLCs
who do not have income during the year do not file a tax returns and are thus not included in the LBD, and (ii) firms that
have zero employees are not included in the LBD.
    9
      Our results are robust to changes in the time allowed for a firm to achieve growth. See Guzman and Stern (2015,
Supplementary Materials) for a subset of those robustness tests.
10
   While the coverage of IPOs is likely to be nearly comprehensive, the SDC dataset excludes some acquisitions.
However, though the coverage of significant acquisitions is not universal in the SDC dataset, previous studies have
“audited” the SDC data to estimate its reliability, finding a nearly 95% accuracy (Barnes et al, 2014).
11
   In our main results, we assign acquisitions with an unrecorded acquisitions price as a positive growth outcome, since an
evaluation of those deals suggests that most reported acquisitions were likely in excess of $5 million. All results are robust
to the assignment of these acquisitions as equal to a growth outcome.


                                                             17
         Start-Up Characteristics. The core of the empirical approach is to map growth outcomes

to observable characteristics of start-ups at or near the time of business registration. We develop

two types of measures:            (a) measures based on business registration observables, and (b)

measures based on external indicators of start-up quality that are observable at or near the time of

business registration. We review each of these in turn.

         Measures Based on Business Registration Observables. We construct ten measures based

on information observable in the business registration records. Four are measures that we

anticipate are associated with firm potential, four are dummy variables based on the industry

cluster most closely linked to the start-up, and two are associated with measures of serial

entrepreneurship to capture the underlying quality of the founder.

         We first create two binary measures that relate to how the firm is registered, Corporation,

whether the firm is a corporation rather than an LLC or partnership, and Delaware Jurisdiction,

whether the firm is registered in Delaware. Corporation is an indicator equal to 1 if the firm is

registered as a corporation and 0 if it is registered either as an LLC or partnership.12 In the period

of 1988 to 2005, 0.19% of corporations achieve a growth outcome versus only 0.03% of non-

corporations.13 Delaware jurisdiction is equal to 1 if the firm is registered under Delaware, but

has its main office in Massachusetts (all other foreign firms are dropped before analysis).

Delaware jurisdiction is favorable for firms which, due to more complex operations, require

more certainty in corporate law, but it is associated with extra costs and time to establish and

maintain two registrations. Between 1988 and 2005, 5.8% of the sample registers in Delaware;

74% of firms achieving a growth outcome do so.

12
   Previous research highlights performance differences between incorporated and unincorporated entrepreneurs (Levine
and Rubinstein, 2014).
13
   It is important to note that the share of corporations in Massachusetts has moved dramatically after limited liability
companies where introduced in 1995, from around 92% in 1994, to 36% in 2013.


                                                           18
         We then create two additional measures based directly on the name of the firm. Drawing

on the recent work of Belenzon, Chatterji, and Daley (2014) (BCD), we use the firm and founder

name to establish whether the firm name is eponymous (i.e., named after one or more of the

founders). Eponymy is equal to 1 if the first, middle, or last name of the top managers is part of

the name of the firm itself. 14,15 15% of the firms in our training sample are eponymous (an

incidence rate similar to BCD), though only 1.08% for whom Growth equals one. It is useful to

note that, while we draw on BCD to develop the role of eponymy as a useful start-up

characteristic, our hypothesis is somewhat different than BCD: we hypothesize that eponymous

firms are likely to be associated with lower entrepreneurial quality.                     Whereas BCD evaluates

whether serial entrepreneurs are more likely to invest and grow companies which they name after

themselves, we focus on the cross-sectional difference between firms with broad aspirations for

growth (and so likely avoid naming the firm after the founders) versus less ambitious enterprises,

such as family-owned “lifestyle” businesses.

         Our second measure relates to the length of the firm name. Based on our review of

naming patterns of growth-oriented start-ups versus the full business registration database, a

striking feature of growth-oriented firms is that the vast majority of their names are at most two

words (plus perhaps one additional word to capture organizational form (e.g., “Inc.”)).

Companies such as Akamai or Biogen have sharp and distinctive names, whereas more

traditional businesses often have long and descriptive names (e.g., “New England Commercial

Realty Advisors, Inc.”). We define Short Name to be equal to one if the entire firm name has




14
  We consider the top manager any individual with one of the following titles: President, CEO, or Manager.
15
  We require names be at least four characters to reduce the likelihood of making errors from short names. Our results are
robust to variations of the precise calculation of eponymy (e.g., names with a higher or lower number of minimum letters).


                                                           19
three of less words, and zero otherwise. 47% of firms within the 1988-2005 period have a short

name, but the incidence rate among growth firms is more than 80%.16

         We then create four measures based on how the firm name reflects the industry or sector

that the firm within which the firm is operating. To do so, we take advantage of two features of

the US Cluster Mapping Project (Delgado, Porter, and Stern, 2015), which categorizes industries

into (a) whether that industry is primarily local (demand is primarily within the region) versus

traded (demand is across regions) and (b) among traded industries, a set of 51 traded clusters of

industries that share complementarities and linkages. We augment the classification scheme

from the US Cluster Mapping Project with the complete list of firm names and industry

classifications contained in Reference USA, a business directory containing more than 10 million

firm names and industry codes for companies across the United States. Using a random sample

of 1.5 million Reference USA records, we create two indices for every word ever used in a firm

name. The first of these indices measures the degree of localness, and is defined as the relative

incidence of that word in firm names that are in local versus non-local industries (i.e.,

                                    ).   We then define a list of Top Local Words, defined as those

words that are (a) within the top quartile of  and (b) have an overall rate of incidence greater

than 0.01% within the population of firms in local industries (see Guzman and Stern, (2015,

Table S10) for the complete list). Finally, we define local to be equal to one for firms that have

at least one of the Top Local Words in their name, and zero otherwise.                      We then undertake a

similar exercise for the degree to which a firm name is associated with a traded name.                          It is



16
  We have also investigated a number of other variants (allowing more or less words, evaluating whether the name is
“distinctive” (in the sense of being both non-eponymous and also not an English word). While these are promising areas
for future research, we found that the three-word binary variable provides a useful measure for distinguishing
entrepreneurial quality.


                                                         20
important to note that there are firms which we cannot associate either with traded or local and

thus leave out as a third category. Just more than 15% of firms have local names, though only

3.7% of firms for whom growth equals one, and while 53% of firms are associated with the

traded sector, 57% of firms for whom growth equals one do.

       We additionally examine the type of traded cluster a firm is associated with, focusing in

particular on whether the firm is in a high-technology cluster or a cluster associated with

resource intensive industries. For our high technology cluster group (Traded High Technology),

we draw on firm names from industries include in ten USCMP clusters: Aerospace Vehicles,

Analytical Instruments, Biopharmaceuticals, Downstream Chemical, Information Technology,

Medical Devices, Metalworking Technology, Plastics, Production Technology and Heavy

Machinery, and Upstream Chemical. From 1988 to 2005, while only 5.6% firms are associated

with high technology, this rate increases to 20% within firms that achieve our growth outcome.

For our resource intensive cluster group, we draw on firms names from fourteen USCMP

clusters: Agricultural Inputs and Services, Coal Mining, Downstream Metal Products, Electric

Power Generation and Transmission, Fishing and Fishing Products, Food Processing and

Manufacturing, Jewelry and Precious Metals, Lighting and Electrical Equipment, Livestock

Processing, Metal Mining, Nonmetal Mining, Oil and Gas Production and Transportation,

Tobacco, Upstream Metal Manufacturing. While 14% of firms are associated with resource

intensive industries, the rate drops to 8% amongst growth firms.

       Finally, we sought to develop measures that would link entrepreneurial quality to the

quality and potential of the firm founders. Specifically, we construct two measures based on

whether the individuals connected to the firm have been associated with start-up activity in the

past. Repeat Entrepreneurship, equals 1 if the president, CEO, or manager of a firm is also listed


                                                21
as a president, CEO, or manager in a deceased firm that became inactive before the current firm

was registered. To guarantee we match the same individual we require an exact match on both

name and address. We then interact Repeat Entrepreneurship with the High Tech cluster dummy

to create High Tech. Repeat Entrepreneurship, a measure of serial entrepreneurship in high

technology start-ups.17

         Measures based on External Observables. We construct two measures related to start-up

quality based on information in intellectual property data sources and one measure related to

media presence close to birth.18

         Building on prior research matching business names to intellectual property

(Balasubramanian and Sivadasan, 2009; Kerr and Fu, 2008), we rely on a name-matching

algorithm connecting the firms in the business registration data to external data sources.

Importantly, since we match only on firms located in Massachusetts, and since firms names

legally must be “unique” within each state’s company registrar, we are able to have a reasonable

level of confidence that any “exact match” by a matching procedure has indeed matched the

same firm across two databases. Our main results use “exact name matching” rather than “fuzzy

matching”; in small-scale tests using a fuzzy matching approach (the Levenshtein edit distance

(Levenshtein, 1965)), we found that fuzzy matching yielded a high rate of false positives due to

the prevalence of similarly named but distinct firms (e.g., Capital Bank v. Capitol Bank,

Pacificorp Inc v. Pacificare Inc.).19


17
   While we only use these two founder measures in this paper, we have explored other measures including estimating
gender and ethnicity and plan to investigate these types of social and demographic variables in future work.
18
   While this paper only measures external observables related to intellectual property and media, our approach can be
utilized to measure other externally observable characteristics that may be related to entrepreneurial quality (e.g., measures
related to the quality of the founding team listed in the business registration (e.g., through LinkedIn profiles), or measures
of early investments in scale (e.g., a web presence)).
    19
       Our matching algorithm works in three steps. (1) First, we clean the firm name by: (a) expanding 8 common
abbreviations (“Ctr.”, “Svc.”, “Co.”, “Inc.”, “Corp.”, “Univ.”, “Dept.”, “LLC.”) in a consistent way (e.g., “Corp.” to


                                                             22
          We construct two measures related to start-up quality based on intellectual property data

sources from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Patent is equal to 1 if a firm holds a patent

application within the first year and 0 otherwise. We include patents that are filed by the firm

within the first year of registration and patents that are assigned to the firm within the first year

from another entity (e.g., an inventor or another firm). While only 0.6% of the firms

Massachusetts have a patent application, 7.2% of growth firms do. Our second measure,

Trademark, is equal to 1 if a firm applies for a trademark within the first year of registration.

While only 0.2% of firms have a trademark 3.7% of growth firms do.

         Finally, we construct a measure based on the firm’s presence in media outlets. Media

Mentions is equal to 1 if a firm has a news story with its name in the business section of the

Boston Globe, within a year of its founding date. To do so, we search for all firms names in the

historical records of the Boston Globe allowing a one year window before and after the founding

date and finding those that have articles on the business section.20 While we can identify an

early media mention for only 0.14% of firms, this number increases to 3.6% when considering

growth firms.21




“Corporation”); (b) removing the word “the” from all names; (c) replacing “associates” for “associate”; and (d) deleting
the following special characters from the name: . | ’ ” - @ _ . Second, we create three variables that hold (a) the
organization type (e.g., Corporation, Incorporated, Limited Liability Company), (b) the firm name without the
organization type, and (c) the firm name without the organization type and without spaces. Finally, we proceed to do the
actual matching of data sets. First on firm name and organization type, then only on name, and finally on collapsed name.
Our companion paper contains further tests on the name matching procedure and all our scripts are available in the online
appendix.
20
   We identify articles in the business section by using the journalist name and only keeping those that often report
business-related news.
21
   While this result might lead to some bias due to the geographic nature of the Boston Globe, the state of Massachusetts is
sufficiently small that we expect high potential firms to be mentioned in the Boston Globe regardless of specific locations.
Furthermore, all of our results are robust to excluding this measure.


                                                            23
    V.      Estimating Entrepreneurial Quality and Performance

    We undertake our analysis in several stages. First, we examine the relationship between our

growth outcome and various start-up characteristics, identifying a candidate set of start-up

characteristics from which to estimate entrepreneurial quality, and evaluate the performance of

our estimator in an out-of-sample test. We then turn to the calculation of our two proposed

indices, EQI and RECPI, implement and evaluate our key placecasting and nowcasting

applications, and consider the overall performance of our estimator and indices as well as the

interpretation of our results in the context of the broader literature.

    We begin in Table 2 with a series of univariate logit regressions of Growth on each of our

measured start-up characteristics. As mentioned earlier, these regressions (and all subsequent

regressions) are conducted on a random 70% training sample of the complete 1988-2005 dataset,

reserving 30% of the 1988-2005 data as a test sample. To facilitate the interpretation of our

results, we present the results in terms of the odds-ratio coefficient and the pseudo-R2.

    These univariate results are suggestive. Various simple measures directly captured from the

registration record (such as whether the firm is a Corporation or registered in Delaware, or is

named after the founder or using less than two words) are each highly significant and associated

with a large increase in the probability that a given firm achieves a growth outcome.       For

example, corporations are associated with a more than 5X increase in the probability of growth,

and those that register in Delaware are associated with more than a 40X increase in the

probability of growth. Conversely, firms named after their founders have only a 5% chance of a

growth outcome relative to those with a non-eponymous name. Equally intriguing results are

associated with measures of the degree of innovativeness and novelty of the start-up: Patent is


                                                   24
associated with nearly a 60X increase in the probability of growth, and Trademark and

Mentioned in Boston Globe are each associated with more than a 30X increase in the probability

of growth. Importantly, not all candidate measures are associated with a meaningful statistical

relationship: both of our founder measures are associated with much smaller and statistically

insignificant effects on the probability of growth.

    It is of course important to emphasize that each of these coefficients must be interpreted with

care. While we are capturing start-up characteristics that are associated with growth, we are not

claiming a causal relationship between the two: if a firm with low growth potential changes its

legal jurisdiction to Delaware that is unlikely to have any impact on its overall growth

prospects. 22 Instead, Delaware registration is an informative signal, based on the fact that

external investors often prefer to invest in firms governed under Delaware law, of the ambition

and potential of the start-up, as observed at the time of business registration. Reliance on a

univariate measure makes inference particularly tricky: in isolation, one cannot evaluate whether

any particular start-up characteristic is more or less important than others.

         We therefore proceed in Table 3 to consider these effects in tandem.                             We begin by

simply examining the impact of three measures directly observable from the business registration

record: Corporation, Short Name, and Eponymous. Each are statistically and quantitatively

significant: while corporations and short names are each associated with a more than 4X



   22
      One important concern in policy applications of this methodology, is that our measures might change incentives of
firms, such that they try to “game” the result by select into high-quality measures they previously did not care about (e.g.
changing its name form long to short). We note that this possibility, though real, is bounded by the incentives of the
founders. For example, it is unlikely that a founder with no intention to grow would incur the significant yearly expense
require to keep a registration in Delaware (which we estimate around $1000). Similarly, firms that signal in their name
being a local business (e.g. “Taqueria”) are unlikely to change their names in ways that affect their ability to attract
customers. Finally, we also note that any effects from “gaming” would be short-lived since, as low quality firms select into
a specific measure the correlation between such measure and growth – and therefore the weight our prediction model
would assign to it – weakens.



                                                            25
increase in the probability of growth, eponymy reduces the probability of growth by nearly 95%.

When we introduce cluster dummies in (2), the results for these business registration measures

remains similar; at the same time, the results suggest that businesses whose names are associated

with a traded high technology cluster are more than 3X more likely to grow and local businesses

register a 64% growth probability penalty. In (3), the inclusion of a dummy for whether the firm

registers in Delaware has several effects. First, and most importantly, Delaware registration is

associated with more than 40X increase in the probability of growth (we once again caution that

this effect is not causal but instead helps identify firms whose underlying potential both makes

them more likely to register in Delaware and more likely to realize a growth outcome). At the

same time, the inclusion of the Delaware dummy reduces the measured penalty associated with

eponymy and being associated with a local business name, and reduces the boost associated with

being in a high technology cluster.    Interestingly, the pseudo-R2 increases from 11% to 31%

with the inclusion of the Delaware dummy.      The specification in (3) is particularly interesting

since these data rely only on information directly observable from the registration record, and so

in principle can be observed on a nearly real-time basis for the purposes of a nowcasting version

of EQI.

          In (4), we move towards incorporating measures that capture key early milestone

achievements for a start-up that might serve as informative signals for their likelihood of

entrepreneurial success. Events such as the assignment of a patent, a patent or trademark

application, or mention in the media can only occur once the venture has been launched, but

might occur in a timely enough manner to still provide information for the purposes of

entrepreneurial quality estimation (particularly for EQI applications in which we would like to

examine particular regions and places on an historical basis). Model 4 includes two measures of


                                                26
intellectual property. Since the patent and Delaware indicators are highly correlated (62% of

patenting firms are also registered in Delaware), we separate the effect into distinct interaction

components. Having a patent increases the likelihood of growth 40 times, and Delaware firms

are 40 times more likely to achieve growth. Interestingly, the combined effect (131.9) is smaller

than the joint product of the individual effects. Finally, a firm with an early trademark is more

than 3 times more likely to grow. Importantly, the business registration coefficients remain

similar in magnitude and statistical significance to the results in (3).    Model 5 includes one

additional measure, Mentioned in Boston Globe, which captures whether the start-up was

mentioned in the business section of the primary Massachusetts newspaper within the first year

after registration.   Media is associated with more than a 5X increase in the probability of

growth, and the coefficients associated with the other variables remains similar.

        Finally, (6) and (7) include two measures to capture the impact of serial entrepreneurship

– one based on whether at least one of the founders has ever been associated with a

Massachusetts start-up before and the other interacting that measure with our high-technology

cluster variable. Though the direction of each of these measures is as predicted, neither is

significant nor large (relative to many of the other coefficients in these regressions). We should

emphasize that, since we require that the serial entrepreneur maintains their address between the

two ventures, we may be not yet capturing and tracking serial entrepreneurship in a meaningful

way. Identifying more precise and nuanced information from founders is an important agenda

for future research using this methodology.

        Overall, these regressions offer striking indicators of the relationship between observable

start-up characteristics and the realization of growth. There is dramatic variation in the estimated

probability of growth for individual firms. For example, using the estimates from (5), comparing


                                                 27
the growth probability of a Delaware corporation with a patent and trademark (116.3 * 3.4 * 7.9)

to a Massachusetts LLC without intellectual property yields an odds-ratio of 3097:1. 23

Importantly, the overall results accord well with Guzman and Stern (2015), which uses the same

methodology on California data:               if supported by further evidence from other states and

jurisdictions going forward, the stable nature of the markers of entrepreneurial quality provide an

important foundation for the creation of robust economic statistics in this area.

         Candidate Specification Choice and Evaluation. Before turning to the calculation of our

indices and exploration of our nowcasting and placecasting applications, we first investigate

whether it is possible to identify a preferred benchmark candidate specification that we can use

as our basis for entrepreneurial quality estimation going forward. To do so, we first compare

models that include or exclude specific sets of regressors using a standard likelihood ratio test.

Specifically, in each row of Table 4, we compare the likelihood function (as well as differences

in pseudo-R2 (McFadden, 1974)) between two models, one of which (M) is nested in the other

(N).     For the first five rows (where we introduce different combinations of restricted and

unrestricted specifications), we can reject the null hypothesis associated with the restricted

model. In other words, regardless of which variables we include first, we find significant

explanatory effects from the Media, IP, and full range of Business Registration measures.

However, regardless of specification, we find no robust effects associated with our founder

measures.      As such, for the remainder of our analysis, we adopt (3-5) as our preferred

specification in evaluating our estimator.




23
  More dramatically, at the (near) extreme, comparing the growth probability of a Delaware corporation with a patent (7.8
* 116.3), trademark (3.4), media mention (5.7) and non-eponymous short name (6.9 * 2.4) with an eponymous partnership
or LLC with a long name but no intellectual property or media mentions, the odds-ratio is 295,115 to one!


                                                           28
       We then evaluate our estimates using the 30% test sample of observations which have not

been used in the estimation but for which we observe both the growth outcome and start-up

characteristics. In particular, using only data from the test sample (but relying on the estimates

from (3-5) to estimate entrepreneurial quality), Figure 1 presents the relationship between the

distribution of realized growth events versus the distribution of firm-level entrepreneurial

quality. The results are striking. 77% of all growth firms are in the top 5% of our estimated

growth probability distribution, and 49% are within the top 1% (interestingly, these results are

extremely similar to the findings for California from Guzman and Stern (2015)). To be clear,

growth is still a relatively rare event even among the elite: the average firm within the top 1% of

estimated entrepreneurial quality has only a 14% chance of realizing a growth outcome.

       As well, we evaluate whether our results are driven by the particular sample which was

drawn for the training sample. This is particularly relevant as growth is rare in our dataset (only

462, or 0.14%) and several of our measures are also relatively rare (e.g., less than one per cent of

all firms patent or receive a trademark). To evaluate whether our sampling matters, we repeat

the process of separating out the sample into a training and test sample 100 times, implement (3-

5) with each draw to estimate entrepreneurial quality for each firm in that draw’s test sample,

and then calculate a test statistic which is equal to the number of realized growth outcomes in the

test sample which we estimate to be in the top 5% of the estimated quality distribution. Relative

to our baseline sample result of 77%, the mean of this test statistic is 79% (with a 95%

confidence interval between 73% and 84%). At least within the overall Massachusetts sample in

this paper, our estimates of entrepreneurial quality are robust to the sample that we draw.



VI. Calculating Entrepreneurial Quality and Performance Indices


                                                 29
       We now turn to the centerpiece of our analysis: the calculation of EQI and RECPI at

different levels of geographic agglomeration and across time in order to evaluate a number of

different placecasting and nowcasting applications. We now incorporate the full sample of

Massachusetts firms from 1988 through 2012, and so include the part of the prediction sample

for which we can observe the full set of start-up characteristics (recall that our baseline candidate

(3-5) involves a two-year lag between founding date and the incorporation of early patenting,

trademark, and media data).

       We begin with the calculation of RECPI for the state of Massachusetts for each year

between 1988 and 2012.        In Figures 2(A) and 2(B), we compare the realized level of growth

events (per start-up cohort) with two different entrepreneurship indices: a simple measure of

entrepreneurial quantity (the number of newly registered businesses for that cohort) versus

RECPI which scales the number of registered businesses by the EQI for those businesses for

each cohort year. While there appears to be no correlation between the realized growth events

from a cohort and entrepreneurial quantity, there is a much closer relationship with RECPI,

where we are incorporating entrepreneurial quality.      RECPI grows at a rapid rate from 1991-

2000 (with a very large spike in 1999-2000) and then falls dramatically (along with the realized

level of exits between 2001-2004). From 2004-2012, Massachusetts RECPI has increased by

approximately 17%. Intriguingly, as we discuss in the Conclusion (and consistent with the

emphasis on investment cycles and start-up dynamics by Nanda and Rhodes-Kropf (2013)), the

notable divergence between realized growth events and RECPI is coincident with the rapid rise

and collapse of the early-stage risk capital market in the late 1990s: realized growth events were

much “higher” than predicted for the 1995-1998 cohorts, essentially on-target for the 1999

cohort, and much lower for all subsequent cohorts.


                                                 30
Placecasting Entrepeneurial Quality

       We now turn to a set of placecasting applications where we calculate EQI and RECPI for

different regions in Massachusetts (and during different time periods); in order to illustrate the

range of potential applications with these tools, we begin at a relatively aggregate level of

geographic scope and then focus in on much more granular analyses (i.e., we move from the

state to the city to the neighborhood to the individual address level). We begin in Figure 3 where

we calculate EQI for all firms registered in each of 351 distinct municipalities in Massachusetts

from 2007-2012. Though this map completely abstracts away from quantity (EQI is simply the

average quality for each town), there is a striking concentration of quality around the Boston

metropolitan area. Relative to an average EQI for the state of 0.8, Cambridge records the highest

level of average quality at 5.7 (i.e., the average firm founded in Cambridge has a 5 in 1000

chance in realizing growth which is nearly 8 times higher than an average firm in

Massachusetts). Cambridge is followed by a cluster of cities around the north-west section

between the Route 128 and 495 corridors, including Bedford, Waltham, Burlington, Lexington,

and Woburn. Maynard (the founding town for DEC Computers) ranks seventh with an EQI of

3.4. Though by far the largest city in Massachusetts (and the clear leader in the total number of

business registrations), Boston ranks 23rd in the state with an EQI of 2.0 between 2007-2012.

Though quality is highly concentrated around Boston, there are clusters of entrepreneurial

quality around different parts of the Commonwealth, including Amherst, Foxborough, and

Beverly. Importantly, quality is in the bottom half of the distribution in several former industrial

cities, including Worcester. Finally, quality is consistently low in popular vacation destinations

such as Cape Cod, Martha’s Vineyard, and the Berkshires.




                                                 31
       These overall patterns of concentrated quality hold more generally over time. In Figure

4, we calculate EQI for the five largest counties in Massachusetts (associated with more than

95% of all growth outcomes) between 1988 and 2012.                Over the past twenty-five years,

Middlesex County (which includes both Cambridge and many of the key Route 128 towns) has

held a distinctive advantage in EQI, with a more recent period of convergence with Suffolk

County (i.e., Boston).        Within this broad pattern, there are striking dynamics among

entrepreneurial clusters within Boston. In Figure 5, we plot RECPI for three distinct areas: the

Route 128 Corridor (which we define as Waltham, Burlington, Lexington, Lincoln, Concord,

Acton and Wellesley), Cambridge, and Boston. During the 1990s, Route 128 contained the

highest level of RECPI, even though the combined populations of the Route 128 cities are only

29% of the total population of Boston. Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic shift in

overall entrepreneurial leadership in the Boston area. Cambridge now outpaces both Boston and

the Route 128 corridor, though both Boston and Cambridge experienced a significant estimated

increase in RECPI between 2009 and 2012. These changes are consistent with more qualitative

accounts: a range of media and academic commentators have highlighted the rise of Cambridge

as a hub of high-growth entrepreneurship (Katz and Wagner, 2014), and our estimates provide

direct evidence for this phenomena and also suggest that this rise is not simply the result of a

localized expansion of risk capital but instead reflects an increase in the intrinsic quality of start-

ups within Cambridge relative to more suburban locations.

       We further enhance the granularity of our analysis in Figure 6, where we calculate EQI

for each zip code in the Boston metropolitan area for the 2007-2012 period. Here we can see

that, even within cities such as Cambridge or Boston, there is considerable heterogeneity:

Kendall Square (02142) register the single highest level of EQI in the state, followed by the zip


                                                  32
code associated with the Harvard Business School (02163).               Other notable areas of

entrepreneurial quality include the area surrounding the Boston Innovation District (02210) as

well as a set of zip codes along the Route 128 corridor surrounding Lincoln Laboratories, as well

as the remaining zip codes within Cambridge. Wealthy residential districts such as Newton,

Brookline and Weston are associated with lower levels of average entrepreneurial quality.

       Looking over time at a comparison between MIT/Kendall Square (02142), the area

surrounding Harvard University (02138 and 02163) and the Boston Seaport area (which now

includes the Boston Innovation District) (02210), we see that each of these areas registered a

similar level of entrepreneurial quality in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, beginning

around 1994, the MIT/Kendall Square area began to experience a significant and sustained rise

in average entrepreneurial quality, and (contra the overall pattern of risk capital financing)

actually reached its highest level (in terms of an average) in 2003.         The average for the

MIT/Kendall Square area again increased over the second half of the last decade, and

experienced a very sharp increase in 2011 and 2012. A higher level of stability is observed in

the Harvard and Seaport District, though the Seaport District registers a significant rise starting

in 2010, coincident with the establishment of the Boston Innovation District in this area by

Mayor Thomas Menino.        While the rise of the MIT/Kendall Square area has been much

discussed (Katz and Wagner, 2010), it is nonetheless striking to see the impact of this sustained

pattern of economic on the geography of entrepreneurial quality.

       We further refine our analysis and illustrate the potential of our approach by examining

the micro-geography of entrepreneurial quality at the level of individual addresses. Figure 8

shows the complete set of new business registrants between 2008-2012 in the three zip codes

adjacent to MIT: 02139, 02141, and 02142.            For each address where at least one start-up


                                                33
registers, we include a circle whose radius is proportional to the number of business registrants,

and whose color is determined by the average level of entrepreneurial quality at that location.

The results are striking, with a very significant level of variation across individual addresses.

Across these two square miles, the average level of entrepreneurial quality (weighted by address)

is 6.0 but the median is 0.1, reflecting a highly skewed distribution. On the one hand, the area

around Central Square and Cambridgeport (to the north and west of MIT) are characterized by a

large number of addresses with a very small number of start-up events, each of which is

estimated to have a low level of quality (with EQI registering at 0.1 and lower for the majority of

individual addresses).   While there are some addresses in Central Square and Cambridgeport

registering significant levels of entrepreneurial quality (particularly along Massachusetts

Avenue), these are dwarfed by the intensive concentration of entrepreneurial quality (both in

terms of EQI and RECPI at each location) that immediately surrounds the Kendall Square area

(to the east of MIT). One Broadway, the home of the Cambridge Innovation Center, is the home

to 229 business registrants, with an average entrepreneurial quality score of 15. The Atheneum

(215 1st Street, a space that includes dedicated wet lab space for life sciences companies) hosted

15 firms with an average entrepreneurial quality score of more than 70. While entrepreneurship

is distributed across the MIT ecosystem, the cluster of world-class entrepreneurial quality

surrounding MIT is concentrated in an even smaller geographic area.

Nowcasting Entrepeneurial Quality

       While our placecasting applications offer significant insight into the geography or

entrepreneurial quality and change in entrepreneurial quality over longer time periods, the

development of a measurement approach for entrepreneurial quality for policymakers must be

able to be calculated in a timely manner in order for it to be relevant and useful for policy


                                                34
decisionmaking.    Indeed, a contribution of our method is the ability to predict entrepreneurial

quality for recent start-up cohorts (that have not yet realized growth outcomes or not) based on

observable start-up characteristics.   However, in our discussion of an estimation model in

Section V, we prioritized the inclusion of start-up characteristics that allow us to differentiate

between start-ups in nuanced ways rather than prioritizing the timeliness and ease of calculating

entrepreneurial quality. Most notably, our key measures associated with intellectual property

(either patents or trademarks) as well as our measure of media mentions are only observed with a

lag. For example, in the case of patents, inclusion of a measure of whether a firm files a patent

within one year after business registration necessitates a 2.5 year lag between business

registration and the inclusion of that firm in an entrepreneurial quality estimate (since patent

applications are not disclosed until 18 months after filing).   Alternatively, one could prioritize

being able to calculate a perhaps more noisy estimate of entrepreneurial quality with real-time

data that could be directly estimated from data available within the business registration record

itself. In Figure 9, we compare the patterns of indices that are based on EQI estimates that

depends only on information directly observable from business registration records (i.e., based

on (3-3)) with our baseline index that allows for a two-year lag that allows the estimate of

entrepreneurial quality to incorporate early milestones such as patent or trademark application or

being featured in local newspapers (i.e., (3-5)). In Figure 9(A), we simply compare the overall

RECPI for Massachusetts based on our baseline index versus an index that is explicitly

prioritizes nowcasting. The results are intriguing: there is a very close relationship between the

two through 2000, and, while there is divergence over time, the correlation between the two




                                                35
indices is very high through the end of 2012. Interestingly, Massachusetts continues to register

an improving level of RECPI in 2013 and through November 24, 2014. 24

         We then turn in Figures B and C to evaluate how our more granular analyses fare when

comparing the baseline and nowcasting indices. In Figure 9(B), we revisit the comparison

between Route 128, Cambridge and Boston. On the one hand, nowcasting advantages Boston

over these two other areas in terms of an overall ranking (presumably because Cambridge and

Route 128 are associated with firms that are more focused on formal intellectual property). At

the same time, beyond this level effect for Boston, the historical patterns are quite similar, with a

clear transition of entrepreneurial leadership from Route 128 to Cambridge over time. Indeed,

this gap sees to have only increased in the last two years. Finally, Figure 9(C) compares three

neighborhood clusters: MIT/Kendall Square, Harvard, and the Boston Innovation District. As in

Figure 9(B), the overall historical patterns are similar, though the absolute size of the gap

between the MIT area and the others is smaller. From a nowcasting perspective, the use of more

recent data documents the rise of the Boston Innovation District in a more sustained way, and

only suggests that the rate of new firm formation may have slowed after a dramatic rise between

2010 and 2011 (presumably because the initial firms within the District created an bump during

2011).

Evaluating Entrepreneurial Quality and Performance.

         As a final exercise, we examine how our proposed measures perform in terms of

predicting the number of realized growth events associated with a given regional cohort. In

Table 5, we perform a series of regressions in which the dependent variable is the number of


   24
      For the sake of comparison, we scale the measure for 2014 by estimating the number of firms that will register from
November 24 to December 31 in 2014 through an adjustment equivalent to the share of firms that were registered over
these dates in 2013 (i.e., we multiply our estimate by 1.09).


                                                           36
Growth events per county-year, and examine various measures of entrepreneurship (and include

county fixed effects to account for differences in county overall size and composition). In (5-1),

we simply examine a measure of quantity (ln(# of births)): the coefficient is small, noisy, and

negative. In (5-2), we employ churn, a standard measure of business dynamism (Haltiwanger, et

al) to examine the impact of this measure on the number of growth events within a conty.

Though positive, the coefficient is small and remains insignificant. Even taken at face value, the

effect would be modest: doubling the level of churn would be associated with just an 8%

increase in the total number of expected growth events. Turning to EQI, we find a far more

encouraging result: EQI is not only statistically significant but also associated with a meaningful

increase in the realized number of growth events. Finally, RECPI is associated with a very large

increase in the overall elasticity: doubling RECPI is associated with more than a 50% increase in

the number of expected growth events in a region-cohort-year.         Though we caution that we

need to investigate this result further, it points to an important potential additional lens through

which to utilize these tools: an important share of realized growth events are due to “intrinsic”

factors observable at the time of founding, with other factors such as regional ecosystems,

timing, and idiosyncratic factors playing separate roles.        The variance decomposition of

entrepreneurial growth remains an important topic for future research.



VII.   Conclusion

       Motivated by the need to account directly for heterogeneity among entrepreneurial

ventures, this paper has developed and applied a methodology that allows for the estimation of

entrepreneurial quality that facilitates both placecasting (identifying clusters of entrepreneurial

quality without direct use of location information in the prediction) and nowcasating (forecasting


                                                 37
the realized entrepreneurial quality of recent cohorts based on start-up characteristics but in

advance of realizing growth outcomes). We specifically introduce very preliminary exemplars

for two new economic statistics – an entrepreneurial quality index (EQI) and a regional

entrepreneurship cohort potential index (RECPI). While we emphasize that our approach is still

preliminary, we believe that the more general methodology offered here has the potential for

application by policymakers and analysts. Given the possibility that entrepreneurial quality is a

leading indicator for other outcomes in regional performance, tracking EQI would allow

government analysts to measure and manage entrepreneurial quality, and so track entrepreneurial

dynamics in a more proactive and informed way. Not simply a tool for direct measurement, our

methodology further allows government organizations (e.g., the Small Business Administration)

to design and evaluate interventions that focus on the quality of entrepreneurship rather than only

increasing rates of firm formation, thus facilitating an approach that could potentially increase

the impact of such interventions substantially.

       While our focus in this paper has been in the development and preliminary application of

our methodology to address key challenges in the measurement of entrepreneurship, our results

also highlight potential linkages with areas of theoretical or policy interest.     For example,

RECPI, our quantity-adjusted index, estimates the expected number of growth events from a

cohort given its start-up characteristics, without accounting for regional effects or financial

cycles. Thus, RECPI can be interpreted as the “potential” of a cohort of new firms given their

intrinsic qualities. In close interplay with recent theory that relates changes in the demand for

quality entrepreneurship to investment cycles dynamics (Nanda and Rhodes-Kropf, 2013), our

index documents substantial year to year changes in the supply of quality of entrepreneurship.

The relationship is pro-cyclical – cohorts increase in quality as the investment opportunities


                                                  38
improve and the market gets “hotter”. However, the realized performance of a cohort is affected

by two opposing effects from the investment cycle: while later cohorts in the cycle have more

intrinsic potential to generate growth, earlier cohorts have more time in the “hot” market (before

a recession like the dot-com bust) to achieve it. The changing time dynamics of the supply of

entrepreneurial quality and its interplay with regional outcomes is an open area of research.

       Spatially, in similarity to previous results that find substantial agglomeration of

innovation relative to overall industrial activity (Furman, Porter, and Stern,2002; Audretsch and

Feldman, 1996), we find entrepreneurial quality is substantially more concentrated than

entrepreneurial quantity or population. While there are several potential reasons for this pattern,

we find no reason to conclude any a-priori, and thus suggest this as an interesting finding with

potential for future research.

       Finally, our results highlight the micro-geography of the quality of entrepreneurship and

suggest that clusters of entrepreneurial quality may benefit from being analyzed at a very low

level of aggregation.    In the spirit of recent work emphasizing the highly local nature of

knowledge spillovers and the nuanced shapes of entrepreneurial clusters (Arzhagi and

Henderson, 2008; Kerr and Kominers, 2015), examining the factors that shape the boundaries of

high-quality entrepreneurship is an important area for future research.

                 APPENDIX I. Massachusetts Business Registration Records

       Business registration records are a potentially rich and systematic data source for

entrepreneurship and business dynamics. While it is possible to found a new business without

business registration (e.g., a sole proprietorship), the benefits of registration are substantial,

including limited liability, protection of the entrepreneur’s personal assets, various tax benefits,

the ability to issue and trade ownership shares, credibility with potential customers, and the

ability to deduct expenses. Among business registrants, there are several categories, and the

precise rules governing each categories vary by jurisdiction and time. This study focuses on the

state of Massachusetts from 1988-2014, at which point one could register the following:

corporations, limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, limited partnerships,

professional limited liability partnerships, and general partnerships (see (1) for further

information).

       The data in this paper comes from the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

Corporations Division (http://www.sec.state.ma.us/cor/coridx.htm, data received on November

27, 2014) containing four files, a master file, containing a master record for all firms ever

registered in Massachusetts at the moment of extraction; an individuals file, containing all the

directors and titles of each firm; a name history file, with previous names of each firm; and a

merger history file, with all mergers that have occurred in Massachusetts. The master file

includes the following fields: firm id, tax status (non-profit or for profit), firm type (corporation,

limited liability company, etc.), firm status (active, deceased, merged, etc.), jurisdiction

(Massachusetts, or another US state), address, firm name, Massachusetts incorporation date,

jurisdiction incorporation date (for foreign firms), address of the principal office (for firms




                                                  60
foreign to California), and Doing Business As names. The individual file includes the following

fields: firm id, title, first name, middle name, last name, business address and residential address.

       After combining these files, we generate unique firm identifiers. For this paper, we select

a dataset of the for-profit firms first registered in Massachusetts from January 1, 1988 to

November 25, 2014, satisfying one of the following two conditions: for-profit firms whose

jurisdiction is Massachusetts, and for-profit Delaware firms whose main office is in

Massachusetts. Table A1 lists the number of observations in our dataset for each annual cohort

year from 1988 to 2014. It is useful to note that, for those firms registered in Delaware, we use

the year they register in Delaware, not in Massachusetts, as their founding date. Both the links

to the underlying data and the program files used to construct the dataset are available as

requested from the authors.

       As a final note, this paper uses a subset of the business registration records we have now

gathered from several states, including California, Texas, Florida, Washington, and New York.

Though our evaluation of Texas, Florida, Washington and New York is at a more preliminary

stage, we have found very similar qualitative findings in terms of the impact of factors

observable at or near the time of registration on subsequent growth outcomes, and the ability of

these models to offer detailed characterization of growth entrepreneurship clusters.
