The black-white earnings gap has historically been larger in the South than in other regions of the
United States. Since 1970, however, the male annual earnings gap outside the South has increased
– dramatically, when the analysis factors in non-participants – while the gap within the South has
narrowed, to the point where 2000 Census figures indicate significantly lower racial inequality in the
South. Three proposed explanations for this trend focus on changing patterns of selective migration,
labor market trends including reduced discrimination and the decline of manufacturing employment,
and reductions in school segregation and school resource disparities in the South relative to the
North. Evidence suggests that selective migration can explain about 40% of the South’s relative
advance, and virtually all of the relative advance after 1980. Earlier declines can be attributed in
large part to reduced industrial segregation and other labor market advances in the South. Relative
improvements in school quality for Southern blacks explain at most 20% of the overall trend.

1. Introduction

         Over the past thirty years, labor economists have paid considerable attention to the persistent

gap in earnings between American whites and blacks. Early papers in this literature focused on the

significant reduction in racial inequality that took place in the 1960s and 1970s (Freeman 1973; Link

and Ratledge 1975; Smith and Welch 1989; Donohue and Heckman 1991; Card and Krueger 1992,

1993). Later papers focused on the slowdown and reversal of this trend that began sometime in the

late 1970s and continued through the 1980s (Juhn, Murphy and Pierce 1991; Bound and Freeman

1992; Grogger 1996). As new evidence, much of it indicating renewed progress in recent years,

continues to amass, a number of interesting and important questions remain without consensual

answers from the literature. How important are investments in primary and secondary schooling to

the eradication of racial disparities in socioeconomic outcomes? Does significant labor market

discrimination persist in the twenty-first century? Can we expect the cohorts reaching the labor

market in the next decade or two to experience greater racial equality than their immediate

predecessors?

         This paper provides insight into these and other questions by focusing on a relatively

understudied dimension of the black-white earnings gap: its regional variability.1 In 1960,

conditioning on a quadratic in age, the racial gap in annual earnings was about 75% larger in the

South than in other regions (see Figure 1).2 Over the subsequent forty years, this regional difference

in the racial earnings gap has vanished – by this measure, inequality in both regions lies at a level

         1
             Bound and Freeman (199 2) present the most noteworthy existing regional analysis of black-white earnings
gaps.

         2
          For sake o f brevity, the three C ensus region s other than the South (N ortheast, M idwest, and W est) will
occasionally be referred to as “the North” in this paper.

slightly below that exhibited in the North in 1960.3 While this trend could be explained as a

consequence or manifestation of regional economic convergence, as described in Wright (1986) and

Margo (1995), evidence presented below suggests that these two trendlines have actually crossed,

rather than converged. Why has the South demonstrated more rapid progress? What does the

South’s progress suggest about the likely future direction of racial inequality in America?

         To answer these questions, the paper develops three hypotheses, which are then tested in a

number of empirical specifications. First, the apparent accelerated progress in the South could

reflect selective migration. The “Great Migration” of rural Southern blacks to Northern cities prior

to World War II involved a disproportionately educated segment of the population (Margo 1990).

In later years this selection pattern moderated, and return migration associated with economic growth

in the South occurred (Vigdor 2002). The second hypothesis focuses on regional variation in labor

market trends, including gradual or discrete reductions in discrimination, or the decline of

employment in geographically concentrated industries. Finally, the eradication and reversal of the

excess racial disparity in the South may be associated with the transformation of Southern schools

from legally segregated – and highly unequal – to the most integrated in the country (see Figure 2;

also see Orfield 1983; Clotfelter 2004). School segregation is a necessary prerequisite for resource

disparities between children of different races, and school segregation was significantly higher in the

North than in the South for much of the 1970s and 1980s.

         Evidence culled primarily from US Census enumerations, but also from other sources,

         3
           The evid ence in Figur e 1 conflicts with s ome pre vious studies in in equality, prima rily in the 1970 s – this
figure shows w idening ineq uality in the Nor th over this pe riod, while oth er studies hav e found na rrowing bla ck-white
gaps using similar data sources (e.g. Card and Krueger 1992). The primary explanation for this conflict is the use of
annual, rather than weekly, earnings as a measure of economic well-being. The disparity in weekly and annual
earnings trends is discussed more thoroughly in Vigdor (2006). Note also that Bound and Freeman (19 92), using
CPS data, point to 1976 as a turning point in the time series on black-white inequality nationwide.

                                                             2
suggests that different explanations predominate at different points in time. About 40% of the net

improvement in the South relative to the North – and all the relative improvement since 1980 – can

be attributed to selective migration. The black-white gap among Southern residents closed over the

last two decades of the twentieth century, but the gap among Southern-born individuals did not.

         Prior to 1980, gains by Southern blacks relative to other groups can be explained by a decline

in industrial segregation and other indicators of reduced discrimination in labor markets. While the

overall contribution of improvements in Southern black education quality is modest, explaining at

most 20% of the overall trend, convergence in education quality remains the best explanation for the

tendency for Southern-born individuals to experience less inequality starting around 1980. Panel

data analysis of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort shows that the narrowest

black-white earnings gap for those educated just after the effective integration of Southern schools

is among those individuals who lived in the South at age 14, controlling for region of birth and

residence, further suggesting a strong role for schooling or other contextual factors specific to the

late childhood and adolescent years.4

         Section 2 presents basic evidence on the link between region, race and earnings. Section 3

discusses explanations for the observed patterns. Section 4 evaluates the importance of selective

migration. Section 5 presents evidence regarding general changes in labor force conditions. Section

6 considers the potential role of education quality changes. Section 7 concludes.


2. Racial inequality in the South and elsewhere, 1960-2000



         4
           The finding of a “critical period” in earnings determination associated with the teenage years mirrors the
findings of Persico, Postlewaite and Silverman (2004), who report a significant relationship between males’ height as
a teenager a nd earnings as an adult.

                                                         3
2.1 Age-adjusted differences

         Figure 1 presents the most basic evidence on economic inequality in the South and in other

regions, based on decennial Census data from 1960 to 2000. The graph displays the age-adjusted

difference log earnings, defined as the sum of wage and salary income and self-employment income

from a business or farm, between native born black and white males age 21-60 by region in each

year.5 The racial disparity is expressed as a positive number, with higher levels indicating greater

relative disadvantage for blacks and a value of zero indicating equality between races.

         In 1960, the black-white log annual earnings gap was roughly 75% larger in the South than

in the North. During the 1960s, the gap closed in both regions. While progress toward equality was

moderately faster in the South, the earnings gap in 1970 is actually more than 75% larger in that

region relative to others. The two regions travel remarkably different paths between 1970 and 1980.

The Southern trend over this decade mirrors that of the previous decade: rapid progress, perhaps

attributable to the enactment and enforcement of Civil Rights laws clearly targeted at the labor


         5
            Age adjustment is accomplished using a quadratic in age. The regression also controls for the main effect
of residence in the South, which identifies the North-South gap for white workers. This graph, and regressions
reported later, use the log of annual earnings as an economic outcome measure. This departs somewhat from
existing literature, which tends to focus on weekly or hourly earnings (see, for example, Grogger 1996; Card and
Krueger 1992). There are two primary rationales for using the annual earnings measure. From a statistical
perspec tive, the use of ea rnings eliminate s concerns regarding m easureme nt error in hou rs or weeks w orked.
Regression estimates based on annual earnings should therefore be more precise than those based on annual earnings
divided by the multiple of hours worked per week and weeks worked. From an economic perspective, the hours and
weeks worked decisions are potentially interesting in their own right: for example, discrimination against blacks
might take the form of being offered fewer opportunities to work o vertime, rather than pure wage d isparities. The use
of annual rath er than week ly earnings exp lains why this pap er shows a ge neral broa dening of the black-white ga p in
the 1970s, whereas earlier papers (see, for example, Card and Krueger 1992) show a narrowing. For a further
analysis of the impact of using annual rather than weekly earnings to gauge black economic progress since 1960, see
Vigdor (2006).
          It should also be noted that analysis of log e arnings elimina tes individuals w ith zero earn ed incom e.
Changes in labor force participation patterns over time may explain some portion of the trends observed here, but
past attempts to account for selective withdrawal from the labor market suggest that overall conclusions regarding
racial progress are not altered (Butler and Heckman, 1977; Brown 1984). Later analysis will employ a strategy
similar to that of Neal and Johnson (1996), imputing low earnings to labor force non-participants and estimating
wage gaps using median regression.

                                                           4
market discrimination practiced most vigorously in the South prior to 1964 (Donohue and Heckman

1991). The black-white gap outside the South increased over the same time period, possibly

reflecting the decline of manufacturing activity in Northeastern and Midwestern cities (Bound and

Freeman, 1992). The net result is substantial convergence across regions.

       Changes in black-white earnings inequality during the 1980s and 1990s were on the whole

more subtle than in the preceding decades, but convergence across regions continues to be evident

in Figure 1. Inequality widened in both regions in the 1980s, but more rapidly in the North.

Convergence resumed in the 1990s, but more rapidly in the South. As of 2000, the black-white

earnings gap was for all purposes identical in both regions. It is also interesting to note that there

has been no net progress in closing the black-white earnings gap outside the South since 1960. Any

such progress has taken place within that subset of individuals who reside in the South at the time

of a Census enumeration.

       Figure 1 presents a dramatic picture of differences in inequality across regions, but the

accuracy and importance of this simple picture can easily be questioned. Convergence of the black-

white gap across regions might be a straightforward manifestation of general convergence in regional

labor markets over this time period, as described in Wright (1985) and Margo (1995). Selective

attrition from the labor force could also easily skew these statistics. Earnings gap convergence might

also simply reflect convergence in other characteristics, such as educational attainment. The

following subsection presents more detailed regression-based evidence indicating that the narrowing

of the black-white gap in the South goes beyond mere regional convergence, becomes a more

striking pattern when labor force participation trends are incorporated, and persists in models that

control for educational attainment.


                                                  5
2.2 Regression evidence

         Table 1 presents the results of ordinary least squares regressions that identify the black-white

gap in the South and elsewhere, controlling for a quadratic in age and categorically for educational

attainment.6 The coefficient on the black indicator variable, reported in the first row, identifies the

proportional black-white earnings gap outside the South. The coefficient on the South indicator in

the second row shows the gap in earnings between Northern and Southern whites. The interaction

between the black and South indicators, in the third row, shows the difference in racial earnings gaps

across regions.

         Comparison of the coefficients in Table 1 with Figure 1, or with the coefficients used to

produce that figure reprinted at the bottom of the table, shows that between one-fourth and one-third

of the black-white gap outside the South, and a portion of the difference between Southern and

Northern gaps, can be attributed to differences in educational attainment across races and across

regions. While controls for education narrow the estimated gap, the overall portrait of faster

convergence in the South relative to the North is unchanged. The black-south interaction term

begins in 1960 at a level three-quarters the magnitude of the analogous coefficient taken from a



         6
           The sample in each regression is limited to black and white males born in the 48 contiguous states, age 21-
60 with positive earnings in the year prior to the C ensus enumeration. Th ese sample selection criteria follow those
employed by Card and Krueger (199 2) with two noteworthy exceptions: individuals with imputed data for any
covariates a re included in the sample, a nd individu als with implied weekly earnin gs above or below c ertain
thresholds are not excluded from the sample. See Vigdor (2006) for a more complete discussion of the impact of
sample selection criteria on estimates of blac k-white earnings gaps.
          Controls for educational attainment may be suspect here, as education is a potentially endogenous choice
variable (Jo hnson and Neal, 19 96). Th e median r egression es timates in Ta ble 2 belo w omit con trols for educ ation.
Ordinary le ast squares sp ecifications om itting education al attainment p roduce the black and black*south coefficients
printed at the bottom of Table 1; these coefficients were used to construct Figure 1.
          Similar regressions estimated using a sample of black and white females show a similar pattern of more
rapid con vergence in the South rela tive to the No rth. Conver gence acro ss regions is less co mplete than in the sample
of males, possibly because patterns of selection into the labor force differ importantly by race and region (see Neal
2004 for an analysis of racial differences in female selection into the labor force).

                                                            6
specification without education controls, printed at the bottom of the table. By the end of the time

period, the coefficients from the two specifications are essentially identical. This suggests that about

one-quarter of the “excess” convergence witnessed in the South between 1960 and 2000 can be

attributed to a combination of increases in educational attainment and changes in the returns to

education. As in Figure 1, there is no net progress in closing the black-white gap outside the South

between 1960 and 2000 – progress in the 1960s is followed by a remarkable widening between 1970

and 1990, and a return to convergence afterwards.

        Perusal of the educational attainment coefficients in the table show that the return to junior

high school and high school levels of education declined over this period, while the premium for

college education relative to high school expanded considerably. 7 It is also apparent in this table that

the period between 1960 and 2000 was marked by broader convergence between the Northern and

Southern labor markets. The gap between similarly educated and aged white Northerners and

Southerners declined from 0.189 to 0.034 during this time period.

         By focusing on the logarithm of earned income, the analysis in Table 1 necessarily omits

individuals reporting zero earnings in the year prior to the Census. Differential rates of labor market

non-participation by race and region could conceivably skew this analysis (Butler and Heckman

1977; Brown 1984; Neal and Johnson 1996). For example, apparent progress by Southern blacks

relative to whites and Northern blacks could result from an increasing tendency for low-potential

earnings members of this group to exit the labor force. The analysis in Table 2 tests this

interpretation using the relatively straightforward methodology put forward by Neal and Johnson



        7
         This evidence is consistent with previous research on changes in the returns to education over time (Juhn,
Murphy and Pierce, 1991).

                                                         7
(1996). Individuals with zero reported earnings are assigned a log earnings of zero, corresponding

to annual earnings of $1. Coefficients are then estimated by median regression. The assumption

made in this analysis is that labor market non-participants would have posted earnings below the

median among individuals with identical covariate values. It is important to emphasize that, as in

Neal and Johnson (1996), these specifications omit controls for educational attainment.8

          This procedure strengthens the conclusion that black-white earnings gaps have converged

more rapidly in the South. Relative to equivalent OLS specifications, the black*south coefficient

is more negative in 1960 and more positive – statistically significantly greater than zero – in 2000.

The failure to account for labor force non-participants leads to an understatement of inequality in the

South in 1960; by 2000 there is evidence of a bias in both regions but the bias is clearly stronger

outside the South. On net, the median regressions indicate that there has been a remarkable, even

catastrophic, erosion of the potential earnings of Northern blacks since 1970. Southern blacks posted

sizable gains between 1960 and 1980, but since then the gap in median annual age-adjusted earnings

has held steady. Thus the relative progress of Southern blacks is best understood as a period of rapid

convergence followed by a period of stagnation while conditions worsened elsewhere. The

regression estimates in Table 2 provide a basic measure of the “excess convergence” in the South

relative to the North: the difference between black-south interaction terms in 1960 and 2000, roughly

0.450, will serve as a denominator for purposes of decomposing the relative gains of Southern

blacks.



          8
           The rationale behind this omission is that the assumption of below-median earnings conditional on
covariates is les s credible w hen the set of co variates includ es endog enous indic ators of labo r market pro ductivity
such as education. Coefficients from OLS specifications that omit educational attainment appear at the bottom of
Table 1, and were used to construct Figure 1.

                                                              8
       By the measures shown in Table 2, the black-white earnings gap is now significantly

narrower in the South, and represents the smallest such gap in the post-Civil Rights era. Regional

convergence is definitely in evidence here, but a simple story of convergence alone cannot explain

the reversal of regional patterns that appears to have occurred during the 1990s.



3. Why has the South surpassed the North?

       Existing literature and basic economic theory point towards three explanations for the relative

erosion of Southern racial wage gaps. First, all or part of the apparent gains by Southern blacks in

the period since 1960 may be illusory, an artifact of changes in location decisions by whites and

blacks of varying ability levels. These gains may also reflect broad labor market trends, including

the decline in “rust belt” manufacturing and reduced racial discrimination in labor markets associated

with Civil Rights era legislation, which probably had a disproportionate impact in the South. Finally,

the transformation of Southern public schools from wholly segregated to the nation’s most integrated

may have brought, or accompanied, a reduction in racial discrepancies in the quality of human

capital investment. These relative increases in education quality may have spurred high quantities

of human capital investment among Southern blacks. This section discusses each hypothesis in turn,

and proposes simple empirical tests for their evaluation.


3.1 Selective Migration

       Millions of Southern-born blacks relocated to different regions of the country between 1910

and 1970. Figure 2 illustrates the impact of this migration, by decomposing the population of native-

born working-age black males by region of birth and residence in each Census year since 1940. In



                                                  9
1940, the majority of blacks residing in the North had been born in the South. While the number of

Northern-born blacks increases steadily over time, the share of blacks born in the South and residing

in the North remains steady through at least 1970.

       In the first major wave of migration, which took place before 1940, highly educated blacks

were disproportionately likely to migrate (Bowles 1970; Margo 1990; Vigdor 2002). Thus, in 1940

the population of blacks residing in the South would have occupied the lower ranks of the observed

human capital distribution. This fact would explain the discrepancy between the raw regional

differentials shown in Figure 1 and the considerably smaller gap estimated in regressions controlling

for education.

       In later years, the flow of black migrants from the South contained a higher proportion of

less-educated individuals. Highly educated Southern black migrants were actually more likely to

choose a Southern destination city, controlling for other destination characteristics, in the postwar

era (Vigdor 2002). After 1970, the stock of Southern-born, Northern-residing blacks begins to

decline as a share of the population. At the same time, the share of Northern-born but Southern-

residing blacks increases, to the point where the sizes of the two cross-regional migrant groups are

nearly equal in 2000, as shown in Figure 2. If sufficently selective, these migrant flows are certainly

of a magnitude large enough to skew measures of inequality by region.

       There are two basic strategies for testing the selective migration. One has already been

employed in Table 1 – controlling for the factors on which selection is occurring. This is an

imperfect strategy for two reasons: first, it confounds changes in educational attainment attributable

to selective migration with pre-existing differences attributable to region-specific factors such as

variation in education quality.     Second, the educational attainment variables employed are


                                                 10
undoubtedly imperfect measures of skill.

        The second basic strategy, also admittedly imperfect, is to “undo” the net impacts of

migration by re-assigning individuals to their region of birth, rather than region of residence. This

would provide an accurate picture of inequality in each region if an individuals’ earnings were fully

independent of region of residence. Under the more economically reasonable hypothesis that

individuals choose the region where they expect the highest earnings, the picture may be inaccurate.

Suppose, for example, that the Southern wage gap reflects the decision of highly skilled blacks to

leave that region. Re-allocating the migrants to their origin region will have the effect of closing the

gap, but using their post-migration earnings as an estimate of what they would have earned in the

South leads to an overestimate of the change. Nonetheless, this procedure should provide some

insight into the relative importance of selection in driving variation in regional trends.


3.2 Labor Market Trends

        Previous literature has found evidence supporting the notion that black economic fortunes

experienced a discrete jump following the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 (Freeman 1973;

Donohue and Heckman 1991; Card and Krueger 1993). It is reasonable to expect that this legislation

would have had a disproportionate impact in the South, where racial discrimination was more firmly

ingrained in all aspects of society. Chay and Honore (1996) find evidence confirming a link between

the passage of Civil Rights laws and black-white convergence in the South. Consistent with this

view, the results presented above suggest that convergence between regions began in the 1960s and

accelerated in the 1970s.

        The timing of the great leap towards regional convergence also supports the hypothesis that



                                                  11
the decline of Northern manufacturing employment harmed the economic fortunes of blacks in that

region (Bound and Freeman, 1992). Census of Manufactures data suggest that the peak of

manufacturing employment in the United States was around 1967.

        These labor market-oriented hypotheses imply that the relative progress for Southern blacks

observed in Table 1 should primarily reflect a period, rather than cohort effect (Card and Krueger

1992). Cohort effects may ensue, however, to the extent that the reduction in discrimination impacts

the human capital accumulation decisions of younger cohorts. If the relative decline of Northern

black earnings reflects the concentration of those individuals in manufacturing or other layoff-prone

industries, then within-industry estimates should show less regional variation.


3.3 Disparities in Human Capital Investment

         The hypothesis that changes in black educational attainment and the relative quality of black

education explain the convergence of black earnings has been subjected to empirical test for at least

three decades (Welch, 1973; Link and Ratledge 1975; Akin and Garfinkel 1980; Juhn, Murphy and

Pierce 1991; Card and Krueger 1992; Boozer, Krueger and Wolkon, 1992; Grogger 1996;

Ashenfelter, Collins and Yoon 2005). These empirical tests do not arrive at any consensus,

particularly regarding the importance of education quality, which is by its nature a difficult variable

to measure.9 Betts (1995) and Grogger (1996), for example, find significant high school fixed effects

in earnings regressions controlling for a wide array of individual background characteristics,

suggesting that some factor common to all students attending the same school correlates strongly

with later earnings. These high school fixed effects are not highly correlated, however, with


        9
           The broader literature on the link between school resources and student or graduate outcomes has
generally found mixed results. See Hanushek (1997) for a recent review of this literature.

variables traditionally used as indicators of school quality, such as pupil/teacher ratios or the length

of the school year. Card and Krueger (1992), using data on older cohorts derived from Census

microdata, find significant relationships between exactly these variables and adult earnings.10

Ashenfelter, Collins and Yoon (2005) report significant differences in earnings for Southern-born

blacks who attended school before and after widespread desegregation took root in the late 1960s.

         While the empirical importance of school quality differentials, especially within recent age

cohorts, is a subject of some debate, an intriguing circumstantial case links changes in school quality

to the reversal of regional variation in the black-white earnings gap. Within a single generation, the

South transitioned from a regime of institutionalized school segregation to the region with the

nation’s most integrated schools (Orfield 1983; Clotfelter 2004). The relative success of school

integration in the South can be attributed at least in part to the region’s relatively low residential

segregation and its comparatively large school districts (Cutler, Glaeser and Vigdor 1999; Clotfelter,

Ladd and Vigdor 2003).

         Figure 3 presents basic evidence on the degree of school and neighborhood segregation in

the South and in other regions of the country. School segregation is measured as the fraction of

black public school students attending majority nonwhite schools.11 The transition from fully

segregated to reasonably integrated schools in the South occurred between 1960 and 1972. School

            Betts (199 6) discusses the method ological differ ences betw een studies tha t might explain th e disparate
results. In particular, evidence of links between school quality and earnings tend to use state-level average measures
of school quality, rather than school-level mea sures.

         11
            School segregation data are taken from Clotfelter (2004). Following the existing literature on school
segregation , regional divisio ns for these serie s deviate from standard C ensus Bur eau definition s. Clotfelter’s
definition of the Southern region excludes Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, West Virginia, and the District of
Columbia. Clotfelter’s definition of the Midwest region excludes Missouri. Midwestern school segregation figures
are plotted instead of national figures because they are the only data available prior to 1968.

                                                          13
segregation in the Midwest decreased somewhat over this time period, but the decrease is quite

insubstantial relative to that witnessed in the South. The South’s status as most integrated region

has been eroding over time; by 2000 overall measures of school segregation are quite comparable

in the two regions.12 Residential segregation, as measured by the black population-weighted mean

dissimilarity index (Cutler, Glaeser and Vigdor 1999), is consistently lower in the South relative to

other regions. In contrast to the school segregation measure, the regional disparity in residential

segregation has actually widened over the past two decades.

         Although school segregation need not imply the existence of racial disparities in school

resources, contemporary empirical evidence suggests that it does (Clotfelter, Ladd and Vigdor

forthcoming).13 Guryan (2004) finds significant reductions in black high school dropout rates

associated with desegregation plans, consistent with the notion that blacks enjoyed greater benefits

of staying in school post-desegregation. Card and Rothstein (2005) report that racial disparities in

standardized test scores are narrower in less segregated areas. Hanushek, Kain and Rivkin (2004)

find that black students, particularly higher-ability black students, perform more poorly in schools

where a higher share of their classmates are black. The modern trend towards greater racial equality

in the South might therefore be attributable to smaller school resource disparities in that region

associated with the rapid integration of Southern public schools in the 1960s and early 1970s. If so,



         12
           Some portion of the observed rise in school segregation in the South can be attributed to changing racial
composition in that region, primarily associated with Hispanic immigration. Segregation measures that emphasize
black exposure to blacks, or to whites, rather than nonwhites, show less of an increase in segregation (Clotfelter,
Ladd and Vigdor 200 5).

         13
           School segregation is not a necessary condition for disparities in school input quality because school
inputs such as teacher quality may vary in quality within a school (Clotfelter, Ladd and Vigdor 200 4). School and
neighbor hood seg regation are not sufficient con ditions for disp arities becau se it is at least theoretic ally possible to
have “separate but equ al” schools or neighbo rhoods.

                                                              14
the gradual erosion of integration in the South may imply stalled progress toward racial equality in

that region in future cohorts. Section 5 below returns to these specific conjectures regarding region,

segregation and school quality.

       The human capital investment hypothesis implies that the link between region, race and

earnings operates at least to some extent through the region in which individuals were educated. If

variation in school quality were the only factor influencing racial gaps across regions, then region

of residence should be an insignificant predictor of earnings after controlling for region of education.

This hypothesis also implies that cohorts educated before the effective integration of Southern

schools should not exhibit the same degree of convergence as younger cohorts.


4. Estimating the importance of selective migration

       To reiterate, the evidence presented in Table 1 above provided at least some evidence that

selective migration has played a role in the more rapid racial convergence in the South. Introducing

controls for educational attainment lessens the magnitude of estimated “excess convergence.” As

stated above, this pattern could reflect either the impact of selective migration or of changes in

educational attainment by region and race, as documented by Guryan (2004). Table 3 provides a

further look at the impact of selective migration, replicating the median regressions of Table 2 but

replacing region of residence, which is influenced by migration decisions, with region of residence

which is not.

        Sorting individuals into region of birth rather than residence drastically reduces the absolute

value of black-south interaction terms in 1960 and 1970, and reverses the sign of the estimated

coefficient in 1980 and 1990. Interestingly, there is no impact on the estimated coefficient in 2000.



                                                  15
Altogether, these coefficients suggest that the impact of selective migration was sizable in 1960; a

large number of high-earning Southern-born blacks had located in the North. By the end of this time

period, that selective migration had effectively undone itself, as the decision to sort individuals by

region of birth or residence no longer makes any difference in the estimates.

       These estimates imply that the excess convergence among Southerners, defined by region of

birth, is only 60% of the magnitude of the original estimate provided in Table 2. Moreover, the

estimated black-south interaction terms are now statistically indistinguishable in 1980 and 2000,

suggesting that all of the apparent excess convergence observed during this time period can be

attributed to selective migration. Racial inequality had become least severe among the Southern-

born by 1980, but trends in all regions have been roughly parallel to one another since that time.

       As discussed in the preceding section, under the assumption that individuals would have

earned the same amount in either region, these estimates imply that selective migration explains 40%

of the overall relative improvement in the Southern black-white gap, and all of the improvement

since 1980. This general conclusion is consistent with the general patterns of regional migration

illustrated in Figure 2. Between 1960 and 1980, interregional migrants formed a relatively steady

share of the black population. After 1980, the share of South-to-North migrants shrinks steadily,

while the share of North-to-South migrants grows.

       Under the more economically reasonable assumption that individuals’ potential earnings are

lower in the region where they choose not to live, this analysis will overstate the importance of

selective migration. The degree of overstatement may be somewhat minor, however, since the

estimates in Tables 2 and 3 are derived from median regressions. If, for example, all South-to-North

migrants with above-median income in their destination region would have had above-median


                                                 16
incomes in their origin region as well, the degree of overstatement will be minimal. While the exact

magnitude of the selective migration “effect” may be disputable, it is clear that the erosion of pre-

1940 selective migration patterns contributed to the observed excess convergence in the South.


5. Estimating the importance of broad changes in regional labor markets

         Selective migration may explain most or all of the excess Southern convergence since 1980,

but what about the earlier period, particularly the 1970s, when regional trends in inequality diverged

dramatically? Table 4 begins the process of evaluating the hypothesis that broad changes in the labor

market, whether introduced by anti-discrimination legislation or brought about by more general

economic forces, led to decline for Northern blacks but not their Southern counterparts. The

regression specifications reported in this table, based on the original OLS specifications reported in

Table 1, add a set of industry fixed effects to the model, to determine whether industrial segregation,

or more specifically the concentration of black workers in low-paying industries in certain regions,

can explain some portion of the patterns observed earlier.14 These specifications necessarily omit

those individuals who did not work in the preceding year; although some of these individuals report

an industry, the central assumption enabling the quantile regression specifications of Tables 2 and

3, namely that individuals with zero earnings would have earned below the median conditional on

all covariates, is inherently less tenable when industry fixed effects are included in the model.

         Comparison with the baseline estimates in Table 1 reveals an intriguing pattern. The main

black effects, which identify the black-white gap among Northern workers, are virtually unchanged.

Only in 2000 does the difference in coefficients appear higher than the third decimal place.


         14
         The indu stry fixed effects are based on consistent indu stry codes d erived from the 1950 Census.
Depending o n the year, there are between 12 0 and 147 se parate coded industries.

                                                         17
Industrial composition thus appears to have very little impact on estimated trends in black-white

inequality in the North.15 Coefficients on the South main effect, which identify the earnings gap

between Northern and Southern whites, are somewhat smaller than their Table 1 counterparts in

1960 and 1970, and nearly identical thereafter.

        By contrast, the coefficients on the black-south interaction terms are considerably smaller in

magnitude in the early years, fully converging to Table 1 levels only in 2000. Perhaps even more

notably, the estimated coefficient actually increases slightly between 1960 and 1970, whereas the

Table 1 analogue showed a significant decrease. The concentration of Southern blacks in low-paying

industries thus explains a large portion – roughly 40% – of the significant black-south interaction

term in 1960. The impact of this industrial segregation, measured by the difference between

interaction terms in Tables 4 and 1, declined significantly over the next twenty years. All of the

apparent relative progress of Southern blacks in the 1960s can be attributed to a decline in industrial

segregation: there is no decrease in within-industry earnings gaps in the South relative to the North.

Within-industry gaps fall in the South relative to the North in the 1970s, however. Comparison of

Tables 1 and 4 suggests that roughly 20% of the excess convergence during this period can be

attributed to declines in industrial segregation.

        To this point, then, simple investigations provide explanations for the excess convergence

witnessed prior to 1970 and after 1980. The period of greatest divergence in regional inequality

trends, the 1970s, remains largely unexplained. There are two candidate explanations yet to be


        15
            Vigdor (2006) shows that the absence of between-industry effects in OLS specifications between 1970
and 198 0, which sugg ests that the dec line of manufa cturing did no t impact the b lack-white earn ings gap, is
somewhat misleading. There are significant between-industry impacts on the black-white gap in weeks worked per
year, which suggest that manufacturing layoffs led many black employees to remain out of work for a calendar year
or more, which implies zero earnings and omission from the sample.

                                                       18
evaluated, within-industry reductions in labor market discrimination and improvements in the

educational attainment and education quality of Southern black workers. Tables 5 and 6 provide

evidence with the potential to distinguish between these two explanations. The first of these two

tables tracks a single cohort over time, while the second compares the experiences of successive

cohorts.

       The median regressions in Table 5 follow a synthetic cohort, the group of males born

between 1940 and 1949, from 1970 until 2000, as they progress from 21-30 years of age to 51-60

years of age. Presumably, this group had completed the vast majority of its formal education by

1970. Southern-born members of this age cohort would have also progressed through primary and

secondary school just before widespread integration occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This

cohort stands to benefit from overall improvements in labor market conditions during the 1970s, but

not from improvements in educational attainment or education quality.

       Comparison of the black-south interaction terms in Tables 3 and 5 reveals that the degree of

excess convergence experienced by the 1940s birth cohort is almost identical to the overall trend for

Southern-born workers. In 1970, Southern-born members of this cohort exhibited a significantly

larger black-white gap; by 1980 this pattern had actually reversed. It thus appears that general

improvments in labor market conditions, rather than across-cohort improvements in educational

attainment and quality, explain the dramatic relative narrowing of the black-white earnings gap in

the South during the 1970s.

       Interestingly, this birth cohort’s fate over the next twenty years diverges in some respects

from the overall patterns shown in Table 3. The black-white earnings gap for the Northern born

increases much faster over time; the gap between Northern- and Southern-born whites also increases.


                                                 19
The black-south interaction term becomes less positive between 1980 and 1990, a pattern exactly

opposite to that displayed in the overall sample. This interaction term reaches its highest point in

the 2000 specification. In a time period marked by a general worsening of labor market outcomes

for blacks and Southerners in this cohort, Southern-born blacks fared better than other groups.

       Table 6 presents results of median regression specifications that track the experiences of

successive cohorts of 25-35 year old males over time, beginning in 1960. Interestingly, the 1960

specification indicates that black-white gaps for young workers in the North and South were nearly

identical to those for the general population, shown in Table 3. As in the earlier table, the estimated

black-white gap in the South is roughly half again as large as that in the North.

       For the next cohort, which overlaps to some degree with the synthetic cohort followed in

Table 5, the estimated black-white gap among the Northern born is identical to that estimated for the

overall population. Among Southern born individuals, however, the black-white gap is slightly

smaller, by roughly 3%. This “excess improvement” of Southern-born young adult blacks between

1960 and 1970 may reflect improvements in the school quality (Card and Krueger 1992). Note that

members of this cohort, if educated in their state of birth, would have received education almost

exclusively in segregated schools.

       The next cohort of Southern-born black males, those between 25 and 35 years old in 1980,

fared much better than their predecessors. The degree of cross-cohort progress between 1970 and

1980, however, is only slightly greater than the degree of within-cohort progress, shown in Table 5.

Point estimates suggest that the younger cohort gained on the order of 1% relative to their older

counterparts. Many members of this cohort would have been educated in segregated schools, though

at least a few witnessed the true integration of Southern school districts beginning in the late 1960s


                                                  20
and early 1970s.

       Table 5 indicated that the 1940-1949 Southern-born cohort witnessed a widening of the

black-white earnings gap relative to their Northern counterparts between 1980 and 1990. Such a

trend is not visible in the across-cohort analysis in Table 6. In both years, the black-white gap among

Southern black males was roughly 10% lower among the Southern-born. The relative improvement

in the black-white gap among the Southern born evident in Table 3 thus masks two countervailing

trends. Aging cohorts of Southern-born blacks experienced something of a setback in the 1980s,

while their younger counterparts maintained the advantages held by their immediate predecessors.

A similar statement can be made on the basis of the 2000 results. Overall, these results suggest that

Southern-born cohorts educated either in the late stages of the segregation era or immediately after

its demise experienced modestly narrower black-white earnings gaps than members of earlier

cohorts.


6. Estimating the importance of changes in education quality.

       Evidence presented to this point admits at least some potential role for education quality in

closing the Southern black-white gap. Consistent with the notion that the quality of education

afforded to Southern blacks increased over time, cross-cohort relative gains for Southern-born blacks

are at least modestly greater than estimated within-cohort gains. Narrower differences in human

capital investments might also plausibly explain why the black-south interaction term switches sign,

instead of merely converging to zero. The education explanation is also supported by previous

research, which suggests that improvements in the quality of Southern black education mattered for

labor force outcomes (Card and Krueger 1992) and that Southern blacks responded to these quality



                                                  21
changes by increasing their investment in human capital (Guryan 2004). Of course, these findings

do not represent a consensus view (see, for example, Betts 1995).

         This section presents additional evidence based on analysis of the National Longitudinal

Surevy of Youth 1979 cohort (NLSY ‘79). The NLSY ‘79 offers several advantages over Census

microdata. It permits controls for a wider array of individual and family background characteristics.

It also allows observation of geographic location and labor market outcomes at multiple points in

time, enabling a study of the relative importance of region of birth, region of education, and region

of residence in racial earnings disparities.

         Table 7 presents the results of regression specifications that employ an unbalanced panel of

individual/year observations, with each individual’s earnings observed as many as 11 times, at

biannual intervals between 1980 and 2000.16 Each specification includes controls for age and

educational attainment, region of residence effects and year fixed effects.                             The first four

specifications control for additional variables not available in Census microdata: the educational

attainment of the respondent’s biological father and mother, and the respondent’s own Armed Forces

Qualifying Test (AFQT) score. The final specification controls for individual fixed effects. As in

earlier analysis, the sample here is restricted to males.17

         The first regression in Table 7 comes closest to matching the specifications presented in

Table 1. The results bear a strong resemblance to those derived from Census microdata. The black-

white gap in log earnings among individuals residing outside the South is estimated at -0.265. This


         16
           The dependent variable in this case is the logarithm of the sum of earnings, farm or self-employment

value is somewhat smaller than those reported in Table 1 for 1980, 1990 and 2000, which may

reflect the importance of covariates included in this analysis that are not available in Census

microdata. The main effect of residing in the South is negative and significant. The greater

magnitude may be explained in part by the inclusion of other region effects in this regression, which

reveal that earnings in the Midwest and West also tend to be significantly lower than in the omitted

Northeast region. The Black-South interaction term is positive and insignificant, suggesting that

racial disparities in wages are effectively independent of region of residence after controlling for

individual characteristics.

         The individual characteristics themselves are generally significant predictors of earnings.

The returns to age are stronger in this sample than in any Census microdata sample, likely because

they are identified in part from longitudinal rather than cross-sectional variation. Respondents with

more educated fathers earn more, as do those with higher AFQT scores. Educational attainment,

included as a set of categorical variables in the regression but excluded from the table, also

significantly predicts higher earnings.

         The link between region of residence and earnings appears even weaker after controlling for

region of birth. As the second regression in Table 7 indicates, the impact of Southern residence is

essentially transferred in its entirety to the control for region of birth.18 This specification identifies

the black-white earnings gap for individuals born in the South and elsewhere. In this respect, it is

more comparable to specifications reported in Table 3, although the method of estimation here is

OLS rather than median regression. Among Northern-born males, the earnings gap is comparable


         18
            The sample size is smaller in this specification because some respondents lack information on region of
birth. Similar m issing data issues e xplain variatio n in sample siz e in later regress ions. Restricting the sample to
those individuals with valid data on all variables used in the table does not seriously affect the results.

                                                           23
to that estimated for Northern residents in the preceding regression. The earnings gap among

Southern-born males is roughly one-quarter smaller according to the point estimate associated with

the Black-Born in South interaction; this interaction term is statistically significant. The point

estimate of 0.067 is also very similar to those found in the 1980, 1990 and 2000 specifications in

Table 3, in spite of the differences in age group examined and method of estimation. These results

confirm the finding that the black-white gap is now narrowest among the Southern-born, other things

equal.

         An even stronger association between region, race and earnings appears in the third

regression, which shifts attention to a respondent’s region of residence at age 14. The black-white

earnings gap among individuals who lived in the South at age 14 is estimated to be roughly one-third

smaller than the gap among those who lived elsewhere. The Black-lived in South at age 14

interaction is statistically significant. Similar to the previous specification, controlling for region of

residence at age 14 reduces the magnitude of the estimated difference in wages between individuals

living in the South and Northeast. Instead, there is a significant negative effect associated with living

in the South at age 14. Interestingly, point estimates suggest that whites living in the South at age

14 earn less than whites who lived in other regions, but the opposite pattern holds for blacks.

         The overall pattern revealed in the first three specifications points strongly towards education

quality as a key determinant of the narrower black-white earnings gap among the Southern born. The

narrowest gap is not necessarily among those born in the region, but among those who lived in the

region at the time they would have been attending school.19


         19
            The magnitude of the black-lived in South at age 14 interaction term is reduced upon introduction of
controls for two school quality measures available for a subset of respondents in the NLSY ‘79: the percent of
teachers in the respondent’s high school who had advanced degrees, and the logarithm of the starting teacher’s salary

                                                         24
         The fourth regression controls for region of birth, residence at age 14, and current residence

simultaneously, incorporating interactions with race for each variable. This regression confirms the

notion that it is region of residence at age 14, rather than region of birth, that most significantly

determines the magnitude of the black-white earnings gap. In fact, region of birth has no significant

impact on the black-white gap controlling for region at age 14 and region of residence. Both region

of residence and region at age 14 predict significant differences in the black-white earnings gap.

Together, the results imply that the greatest racial earnings disparity is between those individuals

who resided in the North at age 14 but subsequently moved to the South. The point estimate for the

earnings gap for these individuals, -0.433, is more than ten times the magnitude of the estimated gap

among blacks and whites who resided in the South at age 14 and subsequently moved to the North.

         The result that Southbound black migrants fare worse than their Northbound counterparts

seems at odds with earlier evidence, which indicated that much of the apparent progress towards

racial equality in the South can be attributed to selective migration of higher-earning blacks into that

region. Recall, however, that the NLSY ‘79 represents a relatively young age cohort, whereas the

seemingly contradictory evidence, shown in Tables 2 and 3, is drawn from the entire population.

The evidence in Table 7 is also based on OLS regressions which do not explicitly incorporate

individuals without labor market earnings. Finally, recall that the black-reside in South coefficient

is based almost entirely on within-individual variation in residence. Northern-born blacks who elect



in that high school. The point estimate is reduced by 0.012. Further addition of controls for whether the respondent
lived in a rural area, on a farm, or with both parents, plus indicators for whether the respondent’s household had
magazine subscriptions, newspaper subscriptions, or a library card at age 14, reduce the coefficient by an additional
0.03. T his suggests, albe it weakly, that scho ol quality is the ma in factor driving this result. The re sults of this
exercise ec ho those o f Betts (199 5), who finds that school q uality measure s observed in the NLS Y explain very little
of the across -school varia tion in earnings . Analyses using th is dataset are h ampered by the fact that scho ol quality
information is available only for a self-selected subsam ple of respondents.

                                                           25
to move South may be drawn from the high portion of the earnings distribution, but evidence

suggests that these individuals experience a setback upon migrating.

       As an additional check into this result pattern, the final regression specification in Table 7

adopts a more aggressive strategy for controlling for unobserved individual characteristics.

Individual fixed-effects absorb all time-invariant personal traits. This model by necessity omits

controls for region of birth and region of residence at age 14 since those are time-invariant

characteristics. This model will determine whether individuals who move from North to South or

vice-versa in their working years experience any significant change in their earnings, and whether

these changes vary significantly by race.

       The results confirm earlier findings that the black-white earnings gap for males in this age

cohort are effectively independent of region of residence. The point estimate suggests a slightly

larger black-white gap in the South, but is not statistically significant. Thus, controlling as

effectively as possible for permanent indicators of labor productivity, the anomaly of Northbound

black migrants faring well and Southbound migrants poorly proves to be a fragile result.


6. Conclusions

       Between 1960 and 2000, the American South underwent a remarkable transition from the

epicenter of racial inequality to the region with lowest earnings differentials. To the extent that any

net progress toward racial earnings equality has occurred during this time period, it has occurred in

the South. While previous research had hinted that this might be the case, this analysis, which

employs a simple correction for changes in labor force participation patterns and focuses on annual

rather than weekly earnings, demonstrates the trend definitively. The black-white gap amongst



                                                  26
Southern born males, incorporating labor force non-participants, became smaller than its Northern

counterpart sometime between 1970 and 1980 and has remained narrower ever since. The fact that

the time series cross, rather than converge, indicates that economic processes more complex than

mere regional convergence are at play.

          The analyses presented in this paper suggest that most of the relative progress witnessed in

the South prior to 1980 can be attributed to broad changes in the labor market, brought about at least

in part by Civil Rights-era legislation. Relative progress in the 1960s is associated with a decline

in industrial segregation; relative progress in the 1970s appears to be more of a period than a cohort

effect.

          Differences in inequality across regions after 1980 have been heavily influenced by a reversal

of historic selective migration patterns. The growth of North to South black migration since 1980

has had the effect of narrowing the black-white gap in the South and raising it in the North.

Reassigning individuals to their region of birth, rather than residence, makes trends in racial

inequality look parallel in the two regions over the past two decades.

          The compelling evidence in favor of these two explanations leaves relatively little to be

explained by other factors: selective migration can explain perhaps 40% of the “excess convergence”

in the South since 1960, period effects and industrial desegregation explain an additional 40% or

more. While this leaves only a minor portion of the total effect for alternative explanations,

including improvements in the relative education quality for blacks entering the labor market after

1960, there is clear evidence to support this explanation. Southern-born cohorts educated after the

de facto integration of public schools, including those surveyed in the NLSY ‘79, experience

significantly lower racial inequality relative to both their Northern-born counterparts and to earlier


                                                   27
cohorts measured at the same point in time. Evidence from the NLSY effect shows that it is more

strongly associated with living in the South during the school-age years, rather than being born there.

       In the end, the results in this paper paint a decidedly pessimistic picture of racial inequality

in the latter part of the twentieth century. Over the 40-year time period examined here, there has

been a substantial widening of the black-white male earnings gap outside the South, particularly

when the fortunes of labor market non-participants are factored into the analysis. While by some

measures there has been improvement in the South over this time period, much of this apparent

progress reflects changes in historical patterns of selective migration – reassignment of migrants to

their region of birth moderates trends in the North and worsens them in the South. Among the

Southern-born, there has been net progress since 1960, but all of this progress can be attributed to

the time period before 1970. The factors discussed in this paper have helped the South advance

relative to the North, but absolute trends in both regions underscore the erosion of the economic

well-being of African-American males in the post-Civil Rights era.
