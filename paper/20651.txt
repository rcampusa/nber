                                              ABSTRACT

According to the dynamic version of the Gordon growth model, the long-run expected return on stocks,
stock yield, is the sum of the dividend yield on stocks plus some weighted average of expected future
growth rates in dividends. We construct a measure of stock yield based on sell-side analysts' near-term
earnings forecasts that predicts US stock index returns well, with an out-of-sample R-squared that
is consistently above 2% at monthly frequency over our sample period. Stock yield also predicts future
stock index returns in the US and other G7 countries and returns of US stock portfolios formed by
sorting stocks based on firm characteristics, at various horizons. The findings are consistent with a
single dominant factor driving expected returns on stocks over different holding periods. That single
factor extracted from the cross section of stock yields using the Kelly and Pruitt (2013) partial regressions
method predicts stock index returns better. The performance of the Binsbergen and Koijen (2010)
latent factor model for forecasting stock returns improves significantly when stock yield is included
as an imperfect observation of expected return on stocks. Consistent with folk wisdom, stock returns
are more predictable coming out of a recession. Our measure performs as well in predicting stock returns
as the implied cost of capital, another common stock yield measure that uses additional information.

1       Introduction

The predictability of stock market returns is of wide interest to both investors and academics. The

common practice is to predict stock returns with various valuation ratios such as dividend to price

and earnings to price ratios. When all else remains the same, a higher valuation ratio indicates a

higher discount rate, that is, a higher expected return.1

    In general, all else does not remain the same. Economy-wide events that affect expected future

returns on stocks may also affect their expected future cash flows. To see this confounding effect,

consider the constant growth model in Gordon (1962): P = D/(R − G), where P is the current

price; D is the expected one-period-ahead dividend expected to grow at a constant rate of G; and R

is the stock yield, defined as the discount rate investors use to compute the present value of expected

future dividends, i.e., the long run expected return to buying and holding stocks. Rearranging the

equation gives R = D/P + G. When G changes across different economic regimes, D/P + G will be

a better predictor of R than just the dividend yield D/P . This intuition in a stationary economy is

made precise by Campbell and Shiller (1988) who derive a dynamic version of the Gordon growth

model. In the dynamic case, stock yield is an affine function of the dividend yield and a weighted

average of expected future growth rates in dividends.2 If the dynamics of the term structure of

expected stock returns can be explained to a large extent by a single dominant factor, stock yield

will help forecast future stock returns at all horizons.3

    While it is well recognized that combining dividend yield with a proxy of expected cash flow

growth will help in predicting stock returns, what that proxy should be has been the subject of

debate. Campbell and Shiller (1988), Bansal and Lundblad (2002), Bakshi and Chen (2005), Lettau

and Ludvigson (2005), Binsbergen and Koijen (2010), and Lacerda and Santa-Clara (2010) all use

time series models and historical dividend and earnings data to estimate expected future dividend

growth rates. More recently, Golez (2014) uses direct dividend growth rate proxies implied in the

derivative markets.

    In this paper we combine a time series model for earnings growth that uses analysts’ near-

term forecasts with the dynamic Gordon growth model in Campbell and Shiller (1988) to develop

a measure of stock yield. We focus on expected earnings growth rather than expected dividend

growth because earnings better reflect the cash flow prospects of a firm than short-term dividends,

which are subject to smoothing and other forms of corporate payout policies. In their seminal work,

Miller and Modigliani (1961) argue forcefully that dividend policy is irrelevant: stock prices should

be driven by “real” behavior – the earnings power of corporate assets and investment policy – and,

crucially, not by how the earnings power is distributed. Similarly, Campbell and Shiller (1988)

support the use of earnings “since earnings are constructed by accountants with the objective of

helping people to evaluate the fundamental worth of a company.” In addition, using direct analyst

earnings forecasts avoids several econometric issues associated with modeling dividend growth rates

that have become highly persistent since the World War II.

   Specifically, we compute the expected earnings growth rate as the ratio between analysts’ fore-

casted earnings in the coming calendar year and the realized earnings in the most recent fiscal year.

We focus on analysts’ short-term earnings forecasts since a large finance and accounting literature

has found equity analysts’ value to mostly come from their short-term earnings forecasts rather

than their long-term growth forecasts (see Chan, Karceski, and Lakonishok (2003) and Ivkovic and

Jegadeesh (2004) among many others). The stock yield, defined as an affine function of the current

log dividend-to-price ratio and our log expected earnings growth rate, does a very good job in

predicting future stock returns during our sample period 1977 – 2012 in the U.S., both in-sample

and out-of-sample, at both the market level and the portfolio level, and even internationally among

the other G7 countries.

   Our work is closely related to the literature on implied cost of equity capital (ICC), another

common measure of stock yield (see Claus and Thomas (2001), Pastor, Sinha, and Swaminathan

(2008), and Li, Ng, and Swaminathan (2013), among others). The ICC is computed as the discount

rate that equates the present value of future cash flows from holding a stock to the stock’s price.

The stream of future cash flows is forecasted using a combination of short-term analyst earnings

forecasts, long-term growth rate forecasts, and historical payout ratios, and other auxiliary assump-

tions. In contrast, we use only analysts’ forecasts of near-term earnings in conjunction with a time

series model for earnings. The ICC and our stock yield measure are imperfectly correlated with a

correlation coefficient of 0.70 at the monthly frequency.

                                                 3
    Empirically, our stock yield measure performs as well as the ICC in predicting future stock

market returns. This finding suggests that additional assumptions about long-run cash flows em-

bedded in the ICC appear not critical if the only objective is to forecast future stock returns

at the aggregate level. The relevant return-predicting signal in the ICC comes largely from the

current dividend-to-price ratio and the expected short-term earnings growth rate, information suc-

cinctly summarized in our stock yield measure. Conceptually, when there is more than one factor

driving the equity term structure 4 , both stock yield and the ICC can be viewed as a first-order

approximation of the much richer expected return dynamics.

    In our sample period 1977–2012, our stock yield predicts future stock market returns with an

adjusted R-squared of 13% at the one-year horizon and up to 54% at the four-year horizon. These

R2 s compare favorably with other common stock return predictors proposed in the literature.

    Welch and Goyal (2008) show that many popular return predictors in the literature do not

consistently outperform a simple historical average in predicting next-month market return out-

of-sample. They and Campbell and Thompson (2008) propose an out-of-sample R2 statistic to

gauge such relative out-of-sample performance. We consider a wide range of in-sample / out-of-

sample cutoff points, and find that stock yield produces an out-of-sample R2 consistently above

2.0% for monthly forecasts. According to the calculation in Campbell and Thompson (2008), an

out-of-sample R2 of 2% translates to return enhancement of 8% per year for a market timer with a

risk aversion of 3 who allocates her investment optimally between the stock market and a risk-free

asset. In contrast, the dividend-to-price ratio, by itself, has an out-of-sample R2 averaged below

1% and it often drops below zero. Stock yield also predicts one-year-ahead returns well, with an

out-of-sample R2 of almost 10%.

    Interestingly, we find that the forecasting ability of the stock yield is concentrated during bad

times when investors’ fears are high as measured by the Chicago Fed National Activity Index.

This is true both in-sample and out-of-sample, which explains the stock yield’s high R2 during

our out-of-sample period with two major recessions. This should not be surprising. When the

economy is not doing well, the risk premium tends to be high going forward. At the same time,

current dividends are depressed and imply higher future growth expectation. This higher growth

expectation shows up in our stock yield and enables it to capture the increased expected return.

We also find the stock yield to predict a downward-sloping equity term structure during bad times,

as documented by Binsbergen, Brandt, and Koijen (2012) and Binsbergen, Hueskes, Koijen, and

Vrugt (2013).

   Suppose that the temporal evolution of the term structure of expected returns on stocks is

determined to a large extent by a single unobserved dynamic factor. Then that unobserved single

factor can be extracted from the cross section of stock yields on a collection of stock portfolios

using sophisticated econometric techniques. We consider two such econometric techniques. The

first technique is the three-stage partial least squares regression approach developed by Kelly and

Pruitt (2013) in which the single market return predicting factor is extracted from the cross section

of portfolio-level valuation ratios. Extracting the forecasting factor from the cross section of stock

yields delivers even better performance. The out-of-sample R2 s are 2.71% and 19.49%, respectively,

for predicting monthly and annual returns by the forecasting factor extracted from the cross section

of stock yields on 25 size- and stock yield-sorted portfolios. These R2 s are better than those from

using just the market-level stock yield, confirming that the Kelly and Pruitt (2013) technique

is indeed valuable in extracting useful information from the cross-section. In contrast, when we

extract the return forecasting factor from the cross section of book-to-market ratios on 25 size- and

BM-sorted portfolios, we find it to predict stock market returns with a slightly lower out-of-sample

R2 of 1.47% when predicting next-month returns and 14.11% when predicting next-year returns.

   The second technique is the Binsbergen and Koijen (2010) Kalman filter approach in which

the expected return on stocks and the expected growth rates on dividends are modeled as latent

variables. When stock yield is used as an additional noisy observation of the conditional expected

return on stocks, the model’s ability to forecast future stock returns in real time improves sig-

nificantly. The out-of-sample R2 for predicting next-month return increases from 2.1% to 4.2%.

Similarly, the out-of-sample R2 for predicting next-year return increases from 19.50% to 25.66%.

   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we derive the expression for stock

yield using a dynamic version of the Gordon growth model. In section 3 we describe the data.

We compare the forecasting performance of the stock yield with other popular return predictors in

section 4, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Section 5 then applies the Kelly and Pruitt (2013)

three-stage regression approach to the cross section of stock yields, and section 6 adds the stock

                                                  5
yield to the present-value predictive regression model of Binsbergen and Koijen (2010). We conclude

in section 7.



2    Stock Yield

When both expected return and dividend growth rate are time-varying, the static Gordon growth

model no longer applies. According to the Campbell and Shiller (1988) return decomposition, a

dynamic version can be written as:

                                                ∞                       ∞
                                         κ    X                    X
                      dt − pt = −           −   ρj Et (∆dt+1+j ) +   ρj Et (rt+1+j ),                        (1)
                                        1−ρ
                                                j=0                    j=0


where ρ and κ are loglinear constants (ρ is often chosen to be 0.95 at annual horizon and κ =

−log(ρ) − (1 − ρ)log(1/ρ − 1) = 0.2).

    Rearrange the equation, take expectations, and define the expected stock yield (sy) as:

                             ∞
                             X                                                    ∞
                                                                                  X
                                    j
            syt = (1 − ρ)(         ρ Et (rt+1+j )) = κ + (1 − ρ)(dt − pt +              ρj Et (∆dt+1+j )).   (2)
                             j=0                                                  j=0


Equation (2) suggests that the current log dividend-to-price ratio, combined with expected divi-

dend growth forecasts, drives expected stock yield, which algebraically measures expected future

expected returns. Jagannathan, McGrattan, and Scherbina (2000) derive a similar equation with-

out loglinearization, and they also show that current dividend-to-price ratio plus weighted-average

future expected dividend growth rates measures future expected returns.

    In what follows, we focus on earnings growth rates:

                                                 ∞
                                                 X                          ∞
                                                                            X
                                                        j
                syt = κ + (1 − ρ)(dt − pt +            ρ Et (∆et+1+j )) +         ρj Et (∆det+1+j )),        (3)
                                                 j=0                        j=0


where de denotes log cash dividend payout ratio. Miller and Modigliani (1961, p.426) summarize

the benefit of using earnings as the meaningful measure of cash flows: “We can follow the standard

practice of the security analyst and think in terms of price per share, dividends per share, and the

rate of growth of dividends per share; or we can think in terms of the total value of the enterprise,

total earnings, and the rate of growth of total earnings. Our own preference happens to be for the


                                                            6
second approach primarily because certain additional variables of interest – such as dividend policy,

leverage, and size of firm – can be incorporated more easily and meaningfully into test equations

in which the growth term is the growth of total earnings.”

    Over the long run, dividend growth should carry similar information as earnings growth for

valuation since dividends have to be paid out from earnings eventually. In the short term, how-

ever,dividends can be delinked from earnings due to smoothing and other forms of corporate payout

policies. In that case, focusing on earnings growth could better capture long-term cash flow growth

prospects of a firm which are what matter for valuation. Algebraically, the difference between the

two growth rates reflects the discounted sum of future payout adjustments, or:

                                            ∞
                                            X
                                                  ρj Et (∆det+1+j ).                                        (4)
                                            j=0


Using data on the S&P500 index and assuming an AR(1) process on the payout rate (de), unre-

ported simulation evidence suggests that the discounted sum of future payout adjustments tends

to be stable and contributes little to the time-variation in sy.5 Not surprisingly, our subsequent

empirical results suggest that despite omitting this payout adjustment term, sy still does a good

job in predicting future stock returns.


2.1    Time-varying earnings growth

Equation (3) involves the discounted sum of expected future earnings growth rate. The expres-

sion for the discounted sum can be simplified under a reasonable assumption that the conditional

expected earnings growth, gt ≡ Et (∆et+1 ), follows a stationary AR(1) process with the AR(1)

coefficient β:



                          gt+1 = α + βgt + ut+1 , 0 < β < 1, ut+1 ∼ N (0, σu2 ).                            (5)

Similar assumptions are made by Pastor, Sinha, and Swaminathan (2008), Binsbergen and Koijen

(2010), Lacerda and Santa-Clara (2010), and Golez (2014), among others. Taking the expected

values of future earnings growth rates based on equation (5), and ignoring long-run payout adjust-
   5
     The discounted sum of future payout adjustments has a standard deviation of less than 0.05, much lower than
that of dp which is 0.34.



                                                        7
ments, the stock yield (sy) in equation (3) could be simplified as:


                                              αρ                     gt
                                syt = κ +          + (1 − ρ)(dpt +        ).                                   (6)
                                            1 − ρβ                 1 − ρβ

Equation (6) shows that conditional expected earnings growth (gt ) is a sufficient statistic for mea-

suring all future expected earnings growth rates.6 In addition, the dynamics in stock yield are

completely driven by the dividend-to-price ratio augmented by a scaled expected earnings growth
               gt
rate (dpt +   1−ρβ ).

    We compute gt as log[Et (Earnt+1 )/Earnt ], where Et (Earnt+1 ) is analysts’ forecasted earnings

for the next 12 months, and Earnt is the realized earnings in the most recent fiscal year.7 The

annual autocorrelation in gt , β, is about 0.3 over our sample period. With a ρ of 0.95, the augmented
                                gt
dividend-to-price ratio (dpt + 1−ρβ ) becomes dpt +1.4gt . Our predictive regression results are driven

by this augmented dividend-to-price ratio. While we estimate β using the full sample period, given

the short length of the period (1977 to 2012), the exact value of β is not crucial for our results.

When we repeat the analysis for a wide range of β from 0.1 to 0.7, we find very similar predictive

results. We confirm that g does a good job of predicting future earnings growth rates at both

short horizons (next one year) and long horizons (next five years). While it does not predict the

next-year dividend growth rate well, possibly due to dividend smoothing, it does predict long-run

dividend growth rates well.

    Figure 1 plots the log dividend-to-price ratio (dp) against this augmented dividend-to-price ratio

in our sample period 1977 – 2012. The difference between two series is due to the expected growth

rate (1.4gt ), which is considerable and varies a lot over time.

    We focus henceforth on the stock yield (syt ), defined as an affine transformation of the aug-

mented dividend-to-price ratio: sy = 0.29 + 0.05(dpt + 1.4gt ). The stock yield has the benefit that

it can be interpreted directly as a weighted average long-term expected return as in equation (6).

The loglinear constant κ is 0.2. In the calculation of α, we use the average realized earnings growth

rate to alleviate the optimism bias associated with analyst forecasts. Note that these constant
   6
      In the static case with constant payout ratio, dpt = d − p, gt = g, rt = r, and β = 1. Equation (6), with the
constant added back, reduces to dp + κ/(1 − ρ) + g/(1 − ρ) = r/(1 − ρ). After algebra manipulation and noting the
fact ρ = 1/(1 + D/P ), it is easy to show that log(1 + D/P ) + g = r, consistent with the Gordon Growth Model.
    7
      Implicitly, we are ignoring a convexity adjustment term since gt = Et [log(Earnt+1 /Earnt )] =
log[Et (Earnt+1 )/Earnt ] − 0.5V art [Earnt+1 /Earnt ]. Incorporating the convexity adjustment term by measuring
the variance in a rolling window hardly changes our results.


                                                        8
parameter choices do not affect our predictive regression results at all.

   Figure 2 plots the stock yield (sy) against the implied cost of capital (ICC) of Li, Ng, and

Swaminathan (2013). The ICC is computed as the discount rate that , when plugged into a

present-value model, equates the present value of a stock to its current price. The present value

model considers the firm’s expected future cash flows from next year up to infinity, and these

expected cash flows are in turn estimated using a combination of analysts’ short-term earnings

forecasts, long-term growth rate forecasts, and historical payout ratios, under various assumptions.

While the details will be provided later, the ICC can be viewed as a more sophisticated version of

the stock yield that incorporates more inputs in the present value model. The figure shows that

sy and the ICC are indeed highly correlated (with a correlation coefficient of 0.70). sy, however,

seems more volatile, especially following the two recent recessions. The high correlation with the

ICC is comforting as Chen, Da, and Zhao (2013) show that the ICC measures long-run discount

rates and drives almost 65% of return variation at an annual horizon.


2.2   Equity term structure

Our stock yield (sy) and the implied cost of capital (ICC) are similar to the yield on a bond with

an infinite maturity. They are conceptually different from the expected next-period return. In

our empirical analysis, however, we will use sy to predict stock return in the next one year, two

years, and so on. In Appendix A, we work out the algebra for the equity term structure assuming

that the next-period expected return follows a stationary AR(1) process (see Pastor, Sinha, and

Swaminathan (2008)). In this simple case, the equity term structure is driven by a single factor

(the next-period expected return), and the stock yield is sufficient for predicting all finite-period

expected returns.

   More generally, the equity term structure can be driven by multiple factors as discussed in

Binsbergen, Hueskes, Koijen, and Vrugt (2013) and Kim (2013). Stock yield should still be infor-

mative about future finite-period expected returns as it can be viewed as a weighted average of

these finite-period expected returns.

3       Data and Variable Descriptions

We obtain stock market data such as share price, share outstanding, and return data from the

Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP), accounting data such as common dividends, net

income, and book value for common equity from COMPUSTAT, and analysts’ earnings forecasts

from Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System (I/B/E/S).

    We measure aggregate market returns by CRSP NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ value-weighted re-

turns including dividends (V W RET D). Our inferences regarding forecasting performance remain

unchanged if we use returns on the S&P 500 index as an alternative market return measure. To

compare the forecasting performance of our proposed stock yield measure (sy), we also consider

various market return predictors proposed in the literature. We first consider the two compo-

nent variables in the construction of sy, dividend-to-price ratio (dp) and expected earnings growth

(g). We then include other traditional valuation ratios, including book-to-market ratio (BM ),

earnings-to-price ratio (EP ), and Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAP E), and

commonly used business cycle variables, including term spread (T erm), default spread (Def ault),

Treasury bill rate (T − bill), and Treasury bond yield (T − bond). Finally, we also compare the

predictive performance of sy with another closely related predictor, implied cost of capital (ICC)

in Li, Ng, and Swaminathan (2013).


3.1     Stock yield, valuation ratios, and business cycle variables

Dividend-to-price ratio (DP ) is the value-weighted average of firm-level DP s of all firms in the

CRSP-COMPUSTAT combined sample. We calculate a firm’s DP at the end of month t by

dividing the total common dividends (DV C, data item 21) in the most recent fiscal year (ending at

least three months prior) by market capitalization at month-end. We take the natural log of DP

to get dp.8

    Earnings-to-price ratio (EP ) is the value-weighted average of firm-level EP s of all firms in the

CRSP-COMPUSTAT combined sample. We calculate a firm’s EP at the end of month t as dividing
    8
     An alternative way of computing annual dividends is to use the difference between cum-dividend return (ret) and
ex-dividend return (retx) from CRSP. We have confirmed that the dividend series computed from the two methods
are highly correlated with a correlation of 0.985. We follow Li, Ng, and Swaminathan (2013) and use dividends
from CRSP-COMPUSTAT combined sample as they align with the fiscal year and therefore earnings. In subsequent
section where monthly dividends are needed, we use the difference between ret and retx.



                                                        10
the income before extraordinary items (adjusted for common stock equivalents, IBADJ, data item

20) in the most recent fiscal year (ending at least three months prior) by market capitalization at

month-end. Following da Silva and Jagannathan (2001) and Abarbanell and Lehavy (2007), we do

not use the actual earnings from I/B/E/S. According to da Silva and Jagannathan (2001), “the

definition of these actual earnings is not uniform across firms or even across time and the coverage

of actual earnings is not so wide.” We take the natural log of EP .

    Forecasted earnings growth (g) is estimated using the forecasted earnings-to-price ratio (F EP )

and the most recent realized earnings-to-price ratio (EP ) of the aggregate market portfolio. To

measure a firm’s F EP at the end of month t, we divide the IBES consensus earnings-per-share

(EP S) forecast for the next 12-month period by the share price at month-end.9 We then measure

the F EP of the aggregate market portfolio as the value-weighted average of firm-level F EP s.10 g

is calculated as the natural log of the ratio of F EP to EP . Stock yield (sy), as defined previously,

is calculated as dp plus 1.4 times g.

    Book-to-market ratio (BM ) is the value-weighted average of firm-level BM s of all firms in

the CRSP-COMPUSTAT combined sample. We calculate a firm’s BM at the end of month t by

dividing the book equity value, calculated following Daniel and Titman (2006), at the end of the

most recent fiscal year (ending at least three months prior) by market capitalization at month-end.

We take the natural log of BM .

    Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAP E) is defined as price divided by the

average of ten years of earnings, adjusted for inflation, and is obtained from Robert Shiller’s web-

site.11

    Term spread (T erm) is the AAA-rated corporate bond yield minus the one-month T-bill yield,

and default spread (Def ault) is the difference between BAA- and AAA-rated corporate bond

yields. The one-month T-bill yield is the average yield on the one-month Treasury bill obtained

from WRDS, and the yields of both AAA-rated and BAA-rated corporate bonds are obtained from

Amit Goyal’s website.12
   9
     We follow Li, Ng, and Swaminathan (2013) to forecast EP S for the next 12-month period, from month t+1 to
t+12, as the weighted average of IBES consensus EP S forecasts for the next two fiscal years ending after month t,
where the weight of each fiscal year is its fraction in this 12-month period.
  10
     We do not use the stock recommendation data from IBES which are subject to forward-looking bias as docu-
mented in Ljungqvist, Malloy, and Marston (2009).

And the treasury bond yield (T −bond) is the yield on 30-year Treasury bond obtained from WRDS.


3.2     Stock yield for U.S. portfolios and other G7 countries

Besides the aggregate portfolio of U.S. stocks, we also check the predictive power of our stock yield

measure for returns of other portfolios.

    In our first set of additional portfolio analyses, we consider portfolios of U.S. stocks formed

on firm characteristics such as book-to-market ratio (BM ), firm size, and industry affiliation.

Similar to Li, Ng, and Swaminathan (2013), each month we classify stocks into three BM groups

according to NYSE percentile values of individual stocks’ BM . The growth portfolio contains

stocks with BM below the 30 percentile value, the value portfolio contains stocks with BM above

the 70 percentile value, and the remaining stocks are grouped into the middle portfolio. Three

size portfolios (small, medium, and large) are formed similarly each month according to individual

stocks’ market capitalization at the end of month and corresponding NYSE percentile values.

    We further consider industry portfolios formed according to four-digit SIC codes and the five-

industry classification scheme in Fama and French (1997).14 After classifying stocks into various

groups, value-weighted portfolios are formed and rebalanced every month. For a portfolio i at the

end month t, we calculate stock yield from its dividend-to-price-ratio and forecasted earnings growth

rate, following the exact approach for the market portfolio. We then run a predictive regression

linking the portfolio’s stock yield to its average continuously compounded monthly returns in the

future which are calculated from the time series of portfolio returns, as in the case of the market

portfolio.15

    In our second set of additional portfolio analyses, we extend the in-sample analysis at the

aggregate level to the other G7 countries, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United

Kingdom. Following the exact approach in our U.S. aggregate market level analysis, we construct
   13
       http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data library.html.
   14
        Following their approach, we use Compustat SIC codes (for the most recent fiscal year ending at least three
months ago) whenever available, and CRSP SIC codes as of month-end otherwise. We thank Kenneth French for
providing industry classification codes online.
    15
       We also consider an alternative approach to calculate a portfolio’s future returns by value-weighting the buy-
and-hold returns of individual stocks in the portfolio. If a stock was delisted in the return measurement period, we
assume the reinvestment of delisting proceeds in the surviving stocks of the portfolio to calculate its return over the
full return measurement period. The results are qualitatively similar and available upon request.

monthly stock yield for the value-weighted portfolio of all stocks in each country, and check its

predictive power for future returns of the portfolio. For a stock to be included in the sample of a

country, it must satisfy the following conditions: 1) being a common stock; b) listed on the major

exchange(s) of the country; 3) indicated as the primary listing of the company; and 4) quoted in the

official currency of the listed country.     16   For all sample stocks, we obtain accounting data, such as

annual earnings, dividends and book equity values, from the annual fundamental file in Compustat

North America (for Canadian stocks) and Compustat Global (for stocks listed in other countries)

respectively. We obtain data on monthly stock returns, share prices, and shares outstanding from

the monthly security file in the Compustat North America database for Canadian stocks, and

construct the corresponding data from the daily security file in the Compustat Global database for

other countries.17 Finally, we obtain analyst earnings forecasts from IBES. All values are converted

into USD.

    To calculate valuation ratios such as dividend-to-price ratio, we require accounting information

to precede the price data by at least six months to ensure the availability of accounting information.

To reduce errors in prices for international stocks, we follow the screening procedure for monthly

returns as suggested by Ince and Porter (2003) and Hou, Karolyi, and Kho (2011). First, any return

above 300% and reversed within one month is set to missing. Specifically, if Rt or Rt−1 is greater

than 300%, and (1 + Rt )(1 + Rt−1 ) ≤ 50%, then both Rt and Rt−1 are set to missing. Second, in

order to exclude remaining return outliers that are likely due to data error, we further set monthly

returns to missing if they fall in the most extreme 0.1 percentile in either tail in each country.

    Similar to our analysis of U.S. aggregate stock portfolio, we calculate the monthly stock yield

of the aggregate stock portfolio for each country from the dividend-to-price ratio and the expected

earnings growth rate of the value-weighted portfolio of all sample stocks in the country. Every

month we also calculate future returns over horizons ranging from one year to four years based on

the time series of monthly returns of the aggregate portfolio of each country. To ensure meaningful

measurements of stock yield and returns of the aggregate stock portfolios, we require a minimum

      The major exchanges are: Toronto Stock Exchange and TSX Ventures Exchange for Canada, Euronext Paris for
France, Deutsche Borse (Frankfurt Stock Exchange) for Germany, Borsa Italiana (Italian Stock Exchange) for Italy,
Osaka Stock Exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange, and JASDAQ for Japan, and London Stock Exchange for the United
Kingdom.
   17
      Monthly issue-level shares outstanding data are available for Canadian stocks only since April 1998. For periods
before then, we obtain shares outstanding data from the annual fundamental file in the Compustat North America
database, using the number from the most recent fiscal year ending in past 12-month period.

differently across countries, but all end in December 2012.


3.3   Implied cost of capital in Li, Ng, and Swaminathan (2013)

Li, Ng, and Swaminathan (2013) (LNS hereafter) first estimate firm-level ICCs by solving the

following finite-horizon dividend discount model:

                            T
                           X     F E t+k × (1 − bt+k )       F E t+T +1
                      Pt =     (                       +                  ).                     (7)
                           k=1
                                     (1 + ICC)  k
                                                         ICC × (1 + ICC)T

where Pt is the stock price at the end of month t, F Et+k and bt+k are the forecasts of earnings per

share and plowback rate for the year t+k, and F Et+k × (1 − bt+k ) is the free cash flow in year t+k.

Equation (7) equates the stock price to the present value of future free cash flows up to a terminal

period t+T as captured by the first item on the right-hand side of the equation plus the present

value of free cash flows beyond the terminal period as measured by the second item. LNS assume

a 15-year terminal horizon (T = 15) to estimate equation (7).

   To forecast future earnings, LNS first forecast earnings in year t+1 (F E1 ) and earnings growth

rate in year t+2 (g2 ) based on consensus analyst earnings forecasts for the next two fiscal years

in I/B/E/S. They then extrapolate earnings growth rates from year t+3 to t+T+1 by assuming

that earnings growth rate mean-reverts exponentially from g2 in year t+2 to a steady growth rate

in year t+T+2 which is assumed as the average value of annual nominal GDP growth rate in the

rolling window since 1930. Finally, they forecast earnings from year t+2 to t+T+1 on the basis of

the earnings in year t+1 and forecasted earnings growth rates. To forecast future plowback rates,

LNS first explicitly forecast the plowback rate for year t+1 as one minus the dividend payout ratio

in the most recent fiscal year, and then extrapolate plowback rates from year t+2 to t+T+1 by

assuming that plowback rate reverts linearly from year t+1 to a steady value in year t+T+1. The

plowback rate in the steady stage since year t+T+1 is computed as the ratio of the steady earnings

growth rate to the ICC, which is implied by the sustainable growth rate formula.

   Firm-level ICCs could be estimated from stock prices and forecasts of future earnings and

plowback rates by solving equation (7). The ICC for the aggregate market portfolio in a month is




                                                 14
calculated as the value-weighted average of firm-level ICCs in that month.18


3.4    Summary statistics

Table 1 provides the summary statistics of for our main predictive variables. Panel A reports the

means, standard deviations, and autocorrelations from one-year to four-year horizons. Panel B

reports correlations among the variables.

    The expected next-year earnings growth based on analysts’ earnings forecasts (g) has a mean

of 24%, which is clearly higher than the actual average earnings growth rate, confirming the well-

known optimism bias in analyst forecasts. In other words, the analyst-based growth forecast is likely

a biased estimator of the true expected cash flow growth rate. However, such a bias is unlikely

to predict future market returns. g varies a lot from one month to another, with a standard

deviation of 24%, which could indicate useful information for predicting future stock returns. The

autocorrelation in g is about 0.3 at an annual frequency, resulting in a scaling factor of 1.4 in the

definition of the augmented dividend-to-price ratio. The autocorrelations become negative beyond

one year, consistent with mean-reversion.

    The stock yield variable, sy, has a mean of 12.85% and a standard deviation of 2.35%. As g is

not persistent, neither is sy. Indeed, the autocorrelation in sy is 0.55 at the one-year horizon, and

drops to below 0.20 beyond one year.

    The correlation between g and the log dividend-to-price ratio (dp) is low (-0.045). As a result,

the stock yield, is not perfectly correlated with dp (correlation = 0.693). Among other predictive

variables, sy is also highly correlated with the ICC (correlation = 0.704) and BM (correlation =

0.678).
   18
      See Li, Ng, and Swaminathan (2013) for more details on forecasting future earnings and plowback rates and
estimating ICCs at firm-level. LNS measure monthly ICCs of the aggregate market portfolio based on S&P 500
firms, and indicate that the aggregate ICCs based on all firms in the CRSP-COMPUSTAT-IBES combined sample
are very similar. Though we use the aggregate ICCs provided by LNS, we also estimate monthly aggregate ICCs
by an alternative approach, first forecasting future earnings and plowback rates for the aggregate portfolio of all
firms, and then solving equation (7) by equating the aggregate market capitalization to the present value of the
aggregate future free cash flows. Over our sample period, the correlation coefficient between the LNS measure and
this alternative ICC measure is 0.97 if constructed from S&P 500 firms and 0.95 if constructed from the all-firm
sample.




                                                        15
3.5   Cash-flow predictive power of g

The validity of our stock yield measures relies on the analyst-forecast-implied growth rate g being

a good proxy for future cash-flow growth expectations. We examine the cash-flow predictive power

of g directly in Table 2. When we use g to predict future earnings growth rates, we find strong

predictive power at all horizons. While g does not predict next-year dividend growth rate well,

possibly due to dividend smoothing, it does predict long-run dividend growth rates well.



4     Return Predictive Power of Stock Yield

We first examine the return predictive power of the stock yield in itself, both in-sample and out-

of-sample. We also conduct extensive robustness checks to make sure that the predictive power of

sy is robust and extends to both U.S. stock portfolios formed on firm characteristics and aggregate

stock portfolios in other G7 countries.


4.1   In-sample tests

Following Fama and French (1988) and Li, Ng, and Swaminathan (2013), we run multiperiod

predictive regressions of the following form:



                                 K
                                 X rt+k
                                           = a + b × Xt + ut+K,t ,                                 (8)
                                       K
                                 k=1


where rt+k is the continuously compounded monthly return. K is the forecasting horizon which we

choose at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. In other words, we run monthly predictive regressions for

average monthly stock returns for the next 1 year, 2 years, and up to 4 years. Xt is a vector of

predictive variables, and u is the error term.

    Given the overlapping nature of the above regression, we first report Newey-West (1987) cor-

rected t-values where the number of lags is equal to K − 1. Most predictive variables in X are

persistent, which, combined with a small sample, can potentially lead to overestimated t-values. To

address all three statistical issues (persistent regressors, small sample, and overlapping regressions)

simultaneously, we follow Li, Ng, and Swaminathan (2013) closely and also report p-values from


                                                   16
simulation exercises. Appendix B describes the simulation exercises. The adjusted R2 s are from

the OLS regressions.

   We first consider univariate regressions with one predictor at a time, and report the results in

Table 3. Consistent with findings in earlier literature, the dividend-to-price ratio does a reasonable

job of forecasting future returns in our sample period. The adjusted R-squared ranges from 11.1%

at the one-year horizon to 39% at the four-year horizon. The regression coefficients are also highly

significant according to the Newey-West corrected t-values. Once its persistence in a small sample

is accounted for, however, dp ceases to be significant, according to our p-values that all 0.16 and

higher.

   The analyst-based expected earnings growth g, in itself, is not a strong return predictor, judging

from the adjusted R2 s. Even at the four-year horizon, it is only 14.3%. Its return predictive power,

while moderate, does seem to be statistically significant at the 10% confidence level beyond two

years, according to the simulated p-values.

   While neither dp nor g is a strong and significant return predictor, sy, a simple linear combina-

tion of the two, does a striking job in forecasting stock market returns. The adjusted R2 is as high

as 13.0% at the one-year horizon, and increases to 53.5% at the four-year horizon. The regression

coefficients are highly significant at all horizons according to either Newey-West corrected t-values

or simulated p-values. Interestingly, the p-value declines with the forecasting horizon, suggesting

that sy is a stronger predictor of long-horizon returns as in equation (2)

   We consider three other valuation ratios: BM , EP , and CAP E. EP is the weakest return

predictor of the three, with low adjusted R2 s below 10% and insignificant regression coefficients

at all horizons. CAP E is associated with high adjusted R2 s from 9.3% at the one-year horizon

to 46.2% at the four-year horizon. As it is highly persistent, its regression coefficients are not

significant, judging from the simulated p-values. Finally, BM is probably the best of the three,

with reasonable adjusted R2 s from 10.5% at the one-year horizon to 37.2% at the four-year horizon.

Its regression coefficients are marginally significant, according to the simulated p-values. Overall,

stock yield outperforms all the valuation ratios by a clear margin.

   We also consider four macroeconomic variables: term spread, default spread, the T-bill rate,

and the T-bond rate. In general, they perform poorly in predicting future stock market returns,

consistent with the findings in the literature. Their R2 s are low. Their regression coefficients are

                                                 17
not significant, with the exception of the T-bond rate whose coefficients are marginally significant

for horizons beyond one year.

    Finally, we consider a closely related return predictor, the implied cost of capital (ICC) of Li,

Ng, and Swaminathan (2013). As we have shown in sections 3.1, ICC can be viewed as a more

sophisticated version of stock yield that incorporates more inputs in the present value model.

    Empirically, however, ICC does a slightly weaker job in predicting future stock market returns

than our stock yield measure. While ICC has reasonably high adjusted R2 s from 6.9% at one-year

horizon to 40.8% at four-year horizon, its regression coefficients are insignificant or only marginally

significant. We should note that Li, Ng, and Swaminathan (2013) consider a slightly different

predictive regression specification that forecasts future market excess returns (over the risk-free

rate) using excess ICC (over yields of T-bills or T-bonds). We reproduce their results that excess

ICC significantly predicts future excess market returns. We do not consider excess expected stock

yield for the benchmark case because sy needs to be scaled properly before the T-bill or T-bond

yield can be subtracted, but untabulated results confirm that sy does a comparable job predicting

returns in-sample relative to ICC even if excess returns are used everywhere.           19


    Figure 3 provides a visual representation of the results, plotting both ICC and sy against

average annual realized stock market returns in the next four years. It seems that stock yield does

a better job than ICC in predicting the high stock returns following the two recent recessions.

    The finding that sy can outperform a more complicated ICC is consistent with a large finance

and accounting literature documenting that the value of equity analysts’ forecasts comes mostly

from their short-term earnings forecasts rather than their long-term growth forecasts. Further-

more, the steady-state cash flow growth rate tends to be very slow-moving. Indeed, Li, Ng, and

Swaminathan (2013) proxy it with the average historical GDP growth rate. The information signal

in the time-varying ICC from month to month largely comes from the current dividend-to-price

ratio and the expected short-term earnings growth rate, information succinctly summarized in our

stock yield.

    Given the strong correlation between sy and other return predictors, it is informative to examine

the incremental predictive power of sy. We do this by conducting bivariate regressions with both sy
  19
     The in-sample adjusted R2 s of excess sy are 7.7%, 15.6%, 21.5%, and 20.1% for one- to four-year horizons
respectively, while the corresponding numbers are 6.1%, 17.5%, 28.6%, and 29.0% for excess ICC. And both excess
sy and excess ICC outperform other predictors.


                                                      18
and another predictor simultaneously in equation (8). Overall, we find sy continues to be significant

even with the presence of any other return predictor. The p-value of the average slope coefficient

on sy is almost always below 10%. It is only slightly above 10% when EP or CAP E is included.

Other predictors are never significant alongside sy. These results are not tabulated to save space,

but available upon requests.


4.1.1   Robustness checks

In Table 4, we demonstrate the robustness of our stock yield, sy. From now on, we report only

the simulated p-values associated with the slope coefficients to save space. Panel A reports results

from in-sample predictive regressions under various alternative definitions of sy.

   So far we have defined sy as 0.29 + 0.05(dp + 1.4g), with the scaling factor 1.4 determined by

the empirical autocorrelation in g in the full sample, so we are subject to a criticism of potential

forward-looking bias. To ensure that our results are not driven by this particular choice of the

scaling factor, we also consider defining sy as 0.29 + 0.05(dp + 1.1g) or 0.29 + 0.05(dp + 3.0g),

corresponding to an autocorrelation in g of 0.1 or 0.7, respectively. We find these two alternative

sys to produce very similar results. The adjusted R2 s are high and the regression coefficients are

always highly significant, according to the simulated p-values. In fact, there seems to be a trade-off

– while the lower scaling factor of 1.1 results in higher adjusted R2 s, the higher scaling factor of

3.0 actually produces more significant regression coefficients.

   In the benchmark definition of sy, we use earnings forecasts on all stocks covered by analysts

in IBES, so the resulting expected earnings growth forecast better proxies the cash flow growth

prospects of the overall stock market whose returns we are predicting. One potential concern is

that analysts’ forecasts on small stocks could be highly biased, and thus contaminate the overall

g measure. As one alternative definition, we also consider calculating sy using dp and g of the

S&P500 stocks only. This alternative stock yield measure, sysp , indeed produces slightly better

forecasting results. For instance, the adjusted R2 is 58.4% at the four-year horizon.

   Another potential concern about our calculation of g is that we are matching actual GAAP

realized earnings (before extraordinary items) with IBES forecasted earnings, while the accounting

definitions of these two earnings are slightly different. IBES compiles forecasted and reported

earnings using its proprietary procedures and definitions, with the aim to exclude from the GAAP-

                                                 19
based reported earnings certain nonrecurring items (such as one-time charges or gains associated

with acquisitions), other special items, and nonoperating items.20

    To address this concern of a mismatch between expected future earnings and realized past

earnings, we consider an alternative definition of sy that uses g computed based on realized and

forecasted earnings, both obtained from IBES. This alternative sy, labeled as syibes , produces qual-

itatively similar results as our benchmark one, although both the adjusted R2 s and the significance

levels associated with the regression coefficients are lower.

    One important concern with using analyst forecasts is that they are likely to be biased on

average. While it is generally believed that the biases associated with short-term earnings forecasts

are small, they may still affect our analysis. It is important to note, however, that since we are

running predictive regressions, the level of the bias is less relevant. These biases, as long as they

persist from one month to another, should not have a strong impact on our monthly predictive

regressions. To confirm this, we define two alternative sys in which we compute g not using the

consensus earnings forecasts but rather the lowest or the highest forecasts across different analysts.

We label them as sylow and syhigh , respectively. If analyst bias has any significant impact on our

analysis, we would expect sylow and syhigh to produce very different results. We actually find the

opposite – the results of regression using sylow and syhigh are very similar, and are in fact also

similar to those using our benchmark sy.

    We also consider two alternative ways to define g using analyst forecasts. First, we compute the

expected earnings growth rate as the one implied by analysts’ forecasts of earnings for the two fiscal

years ending in the next two years. We call the resulting growth rate g2 . Second, we simply use

analysts’ median long-term growth (LT G) forecasts (available from 1982). Of the two alternative

definitions, g2 still produces significant forecasting results, but LT G does not. We find that sy

defined using these two alternative definitions of g performs more poorly than our benchmark sy

defined using g, consistent with the notion that equity analysts are best at forecasting near-term

earnings.

    Finally, recall that gt is computed as log[Et (Earnt+1 )/Earnt ], where Et (Earnt+1 ) is analyst-
  20
     There are many studies in the accounting literature examining the difference between GAAP-based earnings
and “street” earnings produced by commercial forecast data providers and the consequent implications for earnings-
related analyses. See Bradshaw and Sloan (2002) and Abarbanell and Lehavy (2007), among others, for related
discussions.



                                                       20
forecasted earnings for the next 12 months, and Earnt is realized earnings for the most recent

fiscal year. One might be concerned that it is the backward-looking realized earnings (Earnt ) that

drive the return predictive power in gt . We argue that this is unlikely for two reasons. First, g2

computed using only forward-looking forecasts still produces significant forecasting results. Sec-

ond, we decompose g = log[Et (Earnt+1 )/Earnt ] into two parts: g = log[Et (Earnt+1 )/Earn10
                                                                                          t ]+

log[Et (Earn10                     10
            t )/Earnt ], where Earnt measures average earnings in the past 10 years. Untabu-

lated results confirm that the predictive power in g is due mostly to the variation in forecasted

earnings in the first term, rather than that in realized earnings in the second term.

   One may question whether the expected cash flow growth rate g is correlated with the aggregate

uncertainty in the economy. If that is the case, the incremental predictive power in sy may reflect

the variance risk premium (vrp) as documented in Bollerslev, Tauchen, and Zhou (2009) and

Drechsler and Yaron (2011). More recently, Andersen, Fusari, and Todorov (2013) find a tail factor

extracted from equity index option prices to have strong predictive power for market excess returns

up to a year.

   In Panel B of Table 4, we compare sy to vrp, where vrp is computed as the difference between

the VIX and realized volatility (Details about vrp construction can be found in Bollerslev, Tauchen,

and Zhou (2009)). Since vrp starts in 1990, the analysis in this panel covers a shorter sample period,

from 1990 to 2012. We first find that sy performs as well in this shorter sample period as in our

full sample. vrp is also highly significant in predicting future returns for the next one year and two

years, but it does not predict future returns over horizons beyond two years. When put together

in bivariate regressions, vrp clearly does not take away the explanatory power of sy. Furthermore,

when comparing the adjusted R2 s from bivariate regressions to those from univariate regressions

with only sy, we do not see major improvements.


4.1.2   Portfolio results

Panel A of Table 5 reports results from in-sample predictive regressions using stock yield, sy, for

various portfolios. We consider three book-to-market-sorted portfolios,three size-sorted portfolios,

and five industry portfolios formed according to Fama and French (1997) industry classification

scheme: consumer products, manufacturing, high-tech, health care, and others.

   Stock yield, sy, is computed for each portfolio. To deal with negative earnings and earnings

                                                 21
forecasts at the portfolio level, we first calculate the raw expected earnings growth rate Gt as

[Et (Earnt+1 ) − Earnt ]/abs(Earnt ) and winsorize it at −50% and 200% to alleviate the impact of

outliers. We then define gt as log(1 + Gt ). Finally, as before, we compute sy as 0.29 + 0.05(dt −

pt + 1.4gt ). In untabulated analysis, we also let the scaling factor on gt vary according to the actual

AR(1) coefficient on gt s of individual portfolios. The resulting scaling factors range from 1 and 2

across the 11 portfolios and produce very similar results as those reported.

    The results in Panel A of Table 5 show that sy perform very well at the portfolio level. The

p-values are uniformly significant across all 11 portfolios and at all horizons. sy does particularly

well for growth and large stocks and in the consumer products and health care industries. It

performs worst for small stocks, possibly due to the frequent occurrence of negative earnings. In

addition, when we compute the average forecast dispersion at the portfolio level, we find the forecast

dispersion to be lower in growth stocks than in value stocks (0.063 vs. 0.190), in large stocks than

in small stocks (0.079 vs. 0.261), and lower in consumer products and health care industries.21 In

other words, the portfolio-level results confirm the notion that sy has stronger predictive power,

precisely among stocks with less uncertain earnings expectations.


4.1.3    International results

We also extend the in-sample regression analysis to other G7 countries: Canada, France, Germany,

Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Panel B of Table 5 reports these results. As before, we

compute sy as 0.29 + 0.05(dt − pt + 1.4gt ).

    Because of the narrower IBES coverage of international stocks, the sample is much shorter for

the other G7 countries. It starts in 1985 for Canada, in 1988 for France, Germany, and Japan,

and in 1990 for Italy and UK. As a result, sy tends to have weaker predictive power than in

the U.S. Nevertheless, sy does a reasonably good job in predicting future stock market returns

even outside the U.S. Across all six countries, the predictive regression coefficient on sy is always

significant (at the 10% confidence level) at the four-year horizon according to our simulations. The

average coefficient (from one-year to four-year horizons) is significant at the 5% level for the UK
  21
     Forecast dispersion for each stock is computed as the ratio between the standard deviation in the earning
forecasts across analysts and the absolute value of their consensus forecast, following Diether, Malloy, and Scherbina
(2002). The dispersion measures are then value-weighted across stocks at the portfolio level. Equal-weighing gives
very similar results.



                                                         22
and Germany, at the 10% level for Canada, and just marginally insignificant for France, Italy, and

Japan with simulated p-values of 11%, 12%, and 11% respectively.


4.2   Out-of-sample tests

Often the predictability of stock returns is taken out-of-sample. Welch and Goyal (2008) show in an

out-of-sample experiment that many well-known predicting variables do not consistently outperform

the historical mean. We generate our out-of-sample forecast with a sequence of expanding samples.

Specifically, we use information up to month m and estimate the following equation:


                                   rt = α + βxt−1 + ut , ∀t <= m                                      (9)


where rt is continuously compounded return in month t, xt−1 is a predictive variable at month

t − 1, ut is the residual, and α and β are coefficients. The coefficients, combined with xm , are then

used to estimate the expected return in month-m + 1.

   We follow this process, adding to the sample by one month each time, thereby generating a

series of out-of-sample next-month expected return forecasts, r̂m+1 , r̂m+2 , ..., r̂T . The out-of-sample

R2 then compares the mean-squared errors for a specific predicting variable to those when using

historical means:

                                            PT −1
                                                  (ri+1 − r̂i+1 )2
                             OOS − R2 = 1 − PTi=m
                                               −1
                                                                    ,                                (10)
                                                  (r     − r̄    )2
                                             i=m     i+1     i+1


where r̄i+1 is the historical mean of returns up to time i. Month m + 1 is the starting month of the

out-of-sample period, and OOS-R2 therefore measures the performance of a particular predictor

relative to the historical mean during that out-of-sample period.

   A positive OOS-R2 means that this predictor outperforms historical mean. In that case, a

market timer optimally allocating her assets between the stock market and a risk-free asset can

enhance returns by using this predictor (rather than the historical average) to forecast next-month

expected stock return. Campbell and Thompson (2008) show that this return enhancement is

approximately OOS-R2 /γ where γ measures relative risk aversion. In other words, if an investor’s

relative risk aversion coefficient is 3, then the return to her market timing portfolio can be improved



                                                   23
by OOS-R2 per quarter. Of course, such a return improvement can come from taking more risk, so

we also compute the implied utility gain for a mean-variance investor with a relative risk aversion

coefficient of 3.

    Equation (2) suggests that stock yield, sy, is a predictor of long-horizon future returns, and

in-sample prediction results also indicate a higher predictive power of sy for longer-horizon returns.

Hence it is helpful to include predictors from the past, or sy at different lags, to predict the next

month’s return. Appendix C details the out-of-sample R2 s of sy at different lags. We follow Li,

Ng, and Swaminathan (2013) to use a two-year backward moving average of sy and ICC, which

indeed helps improve predictive power. Consistent with their results, applying such an average to

other predictors does not help improve predictive power much.22

    For the benchmark case, we choose January 1999 as the start of the out-of-sample period. This

allows a minimum of 20 years in the in-sample period.                23   Welch and Goyal (2008) show that

well-known return predictors perform poorly starting in the late 1990s, so an out-of-sample period

starting in 1999 is of particular relevance to examine.

    The results are presented in Panel A of Table 6. Consistent with the prior literature, many

predictors such as EP and macroeconomic variables have negative out-of-sample R2 s, thus un-

derperforming the simple average historical return. dp, sy, CAP E, and ICC are the only four

predictors with significant positive out-of-sample R2 s. Among these four predictors, sy has the

highest R2 of 2.1%. sy is also associated with the highest utility gain among all the predictors,

8.38%, indicating that a risk-averse investor is willing to pay more than 8% in fees per year for

access to the information embedded in sy.

    We also consider a wide range of alternative starting dates for the out-of-sample period from

1999 to 2007. Figure 4 plots the out-of-sample R2 for sy and dp. It is clear from the plot that the

high out-of-sample R2 for sy is not particular to the 1999 starting point in the benchmark case. In

fact, the R2 for sy is almost always higher than 2% and can be as high as 3.3%. As a comparison,

the R2 for dp is consistently lower and becomes negative for out-of-sample periods starting after

2002. It is interesting that while neither dp nor g does a great job in forecasting next-month stock

market returns, when properly combined into sy, they become very informative about expected
  22
      For this reason, the backward moving average calculation is only applied to sy and ICC, and only for predicting
next-month returns out-of-sample.
   23
      Because of the moving average, the in-sample period for sy and ICC is 1979 – 1998.


                                                         24
future stock market returns.

   To gauge whether sy has incremental predictive power that is not present in other predictors,

we conduct Harvey, Leybourne, and Newbold (1998) forecast encompassing test. A forecast encom-

passing test of predictor i against predictor j tests the null hypothesis that the forecast based on

predictor i encompasses the forecast based on predictor j, against the one-sided alternative that the

forecast based on predictor i does not encompass the forecast based on predictor j. Untabulated

results show that, in the tests of sy against other predictors, the p-values are always higher than

0.3, so we cannot reject the null that sy encompasses other predictors. On the other hand, in the

tests of other predictors against sy, the p-values are always lower than 0.1, so we can reject the null

that sy is encompassed by other predictors. Overall the results suggest that sy is more informative

than other predictors in predicting future stock returns.

   We also run similar out-of-sample tests to predict next one-year return. Panel B of Table 6

reports the out-of-sample R2 and associated p-values computed using Newey-West (1985) correction

with the number of lags of 11 (the number of overlapping observations in this exercise). We find

that stock yield continues to do a good job. Its out-of-sample R2 is 9.83% with a p-value of 0.02,

compared to 5.17% for the ICC with a p-value of 0.06.

   Finally, we also check the out-of-sample predictive power of sy and other predictors for market

excess returns (in excess of risk-free rates). For consistency, we subtract the yield on T-bills from

sy and ICC for this exercise. Confirming the results in Li, Ng, and Swaminathan (2013), ICC

does the best job when predicting next one-month excess market returns with a OOS-R2 of 1.43%.

sy comes in second with a OOS-R2 of 1.17%. All other predictors have either negative OOS-R2 s

or small positive OOS-R2 s that are insignificant. When predicting next one-year excess returns, sy

has the highest OOS-R2 of 8.96%, followed by ICC with an OOS-R2 of 6.87%.

   To conclude, when the forecasting power is tested out-of-sample, only sy and ICC have consis-

tently positive and significant OOS-R2 s in various specifications.


4.3   Understanding the return predictability of stock yield

What is the source of the return predictability in stock yield? A quick look at Figure 3 seems to

suggest that stock yield does a particularly good job in predicting the high stock returns following

recessions.

                                                  25
    We confirm this observation more formally by conducting our main analysis separately for

“good times” and “bad times” categorized according to the Chicago Fed National Activity Index

(CFNAI), which measures overall economic activity.We assign all calendar months in our sample

period into one of two groups based on the CFNAI in that month: “good times” are those with

above-median CFNAIs, and “bad times” are those with below-median CFNAIs.24

    Figure 5 shows the results from in-sample tests that use stock yield to predict next-year stock

returns in good times and bad times separately. We plot realized stock returns against the predicted

stock returns for the two groups. It is clear that the predictive power of stock yield is concentrated

during bad times when investors’ fears are high as measured by a low CFNAI index. During bad

times, stock yield has an in-sample R2 of 26%, much higher than during good times.

    This is true for out-of-sample predictions as well. During bad times, the out-of-sample R2

associated with stock yield is 3.52%, much higher than during good times. This is not surprising,

as our out-of-sample period 1999 – 2012 includes two major recessions. Intuitively, when the

economy is not doing well, the risk premium tends to be high looking ahead. At the same time,

current dividends are depressed and imply higher future growth expectations. Such higher growth

expectations show up in our stock yield and enables it to capture the increased expected returns.

In addition, while analysts’ earnings forecasts tend to be optimistic on average, the optimism bias

is alleviated during bad times, making the forecasted growth more accurate.25

    Our finding is also consistent with the intuition in Boyd, Hu, and Jagannathan (2005), who

argue that information about future corporate dividends dominates during contraction, and such

information needs to be accounted for when predicting future stock returns. The fact that stock

yield has stronger predictive power in bad times is also consistent with the recent finding in Kacper-

czyk, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Veldkamp (2014) that skillful mutual fund managers are able to time

the market during recessions.

    Predicting stock market returns at different future horizons using stock yield in “good” and

“bad” times separately also reveals interesting features about the term structure of expected equity

returns. When we use stock yield to predict the average monthly returns in the next one year,
   24
      We obtain similar results when we use the real-time recession probability as developed by Guan and Parker
(2014) to classify “good” and “bad” times.
   25
      The correlation between the absolute forecast error in g and CFNAI is 0.28, suggesting forecasted growth is
more accurate in bad times.



                                                       26
two years, and up to four years in “good” times, we find increasing coefficients from 1.24 to 2.97.

In sharp contrast, in “bad” times these coefficients decline with the forecasting horizons — from

4.40 at the one-year horizon to 1.69 at the four-year horizon, consistent with a downward-sloping

term structure of equity returns as documented by Binsbergen, Brandt, and Koijen (2012) and

Binsbergen, Hueskes, Koijen, and Vrugt (2013).

    To conclude this section, we find that the stock yield measure does a good job predicting stock

returns by itself. Its out-of-sample R2 s are consistently above 2% when predicting monthly returns

over various out-of-sample periods. It also predicts next one-year market returns, both raw and

excess ones, very well out of sample. In-sample, stock yield predicts future stock market returns

with an adjusted R2 of 13% at the one-year horizon, up to 54% at the four-year horizon in the U.S.

It also performs well in predicting the returns on aggregate stock markets in other G7 countries

and portfolios of U.S. stocks formed on firm characteristics such as book-to-market ratio, size, and

industry. Overall, the performance of stock yield is comparable, if not slightly better than some of

the best return predictive variables documented so far in the literature.

    In the next two sections, we further show that the stock yield can be easily combined with

sophisticated econometric techniques recently developed by Kelly and Pruitt (2013) and Binsbergen

and Koijen (2010) to achieve even better return predictive power. For these analyses, we focus on

the out-of-sample prediction.



5    Extracting Factor from the Cross-Section of Stock Yields

Kelly and Pruitt (2013) propose a three-stage regression approach to extract a single market return

predictor from the cross-section of portfolio-level predictive variables, such as the book-to-market

ratios of 25 Fama-French portfolios. Denoting rt,h the h-period market return after period t and

xj,t the predictive variable at period t for the portfolio j, the first step runs a time-series regression

of the predictive variable, xj,t on the future market return to forecast, rt,h , for each portfolio j

separately:



                                       xj,t = φ̂j,0 + φ̂j rt,h + ej,t .                              (11)

    The second step runs a cross-sectional regression of all portfolios’ predictive variables on their

                                                     27
loadings on the market return estimated in the first-stage regression, for each period t:



                                            xj,t = ĉt + F̂t φ̂j + uj,t .                                    (12)

The regression coefficient, F̂t , is the predictive factor for the future market return at period t. To

generate predicted future market returns, the third step regresses future market returns on the

lagged predictive factor estimated in the second-stage regression:



                                             rt,h = β̂0 + β̂ F̂t + εt .                                      (13)

to generate predicted future market returns. Specifically, to generate the out-of-sample prediction

for rt,h , the h-period market return over the period t+1 to t+h, we first run the regression in

equation (13) with data up to period t, i.e., the last h-period market return entering the regression

ends in period t, and the corresponding predictor is in period t − h, F̂t−h . Then the out-of-sample

predicted market return is the product of the regression coefficient, β̂, and the predictor in period

t, F̂t .

     We adopt this three-stage regression approach to extract a single market return predictor from

the cross-section of portfolio-level stock yields, sy. To ensure sufficient variation in sy, we form

size-sy portfolios based on a two-way conditional sort of stocks, first by market capitalization and

then by sy. More specifically, to form 6 (25) size-sy portfolios, in each month t we first sort stocks

into 2 (5) equally sized groups based on market capitalization at the end of month t, and within

each market capitalization group, we further sort stocks into 3 (5) equally sized groups based on

sy. We use only stocks with non missing market capitalization and sy. We then calculate the

portfolio-level sy and run the three-stage regressions above to generate market return predictor

(KP -sy).   26


     For comparison, we apply a similar procedure to form size-DP portfolios based on the two-way

conditional sort on market capitalization and log dividend-to-price ratio, DP , and extract a single

market return predictor (KP -DP ) from the DP s of these portfolios. We also replicate the original

Kelly and Pruitt (2013) prediction, which uses log book-to-market ratios of Fama-French portfolios
   26
     For one-month market return predictions, as in the univariate prediction, we use a two-year backward moving
average of sy to form portfolios and calculate portfolio-level sy as the value-weighted average of stock-level sy.

since 1930 to extract a single return predictor (KP -BM ).         27


     The out-of-sample forecasting performance of these cross-sectionally extracted factors is pre-

sented in Table 7. We find that the factor extracted from the cross-section of sy (KP -sy) performs

better than the market-level sy. For example, when predicting the next-one-month stock return, the

out-of-sample R2 is 2.70% for KP -sy extracted from 6 portfolios and 2.71% for KP -sy extracted

from 25 portfolios. Both R2 s are higher than the 2.10% from using market-level sy (reproduced

from Panel A of Table 6). Similarly, when predicting the next-one-year stock return, KP -sy ex-

tracted from 6 portfolios has an out-of-sample R2 of 11.66%, higher than the 9.83% from using

market-level sy. Performance improves even further with 25 portfolios in the cross-section. KP -sy

now has an out-of-sample R2 of 19.49%. Likewise, we find KP -DP and KP -BM extracted from

the cross-section to outperform the market-level DP and BM , respectively. These results confirm

the intuition in Kelly and Pruitt (2013) that information from the cross-section can enhance return

predictability.

     We also find KP -sy does better than KP -DP . When predicting the next-one-month stock

return, KP -DP has an out-of-sample R2 of 1.41% using 6 portfolios and 1.47% using 25 portfolios.

The corresponding numbers increase to 5.06% and 9.57% when predicting the next-one-year stock

return. These R2 s are all lower than their counterparts from using KP -sy.

     Finally, we show that KP -sy compares favorably against KP -BM . For example, extracted

from 25 portfolios, KP -BM has an out-of-sample R2 of 1.47% when predicting next-one-month

return and an out-of-sample R2 of 14.11% when predicting next-one-year return.

     Overall, these results suggest that the three-stage regression approach developed by Kelly and

Pruitt (2013) can be applied to the cross-section of stock yields to produce an even stronger stock

return predictor.



6        Extending the Present Value Approach with Stock Yield

Binsbergen and Koijen (2010) consider a time-series model that satisfies the present value relation

in which conditional expected returns and expected dividend growth rates are modeled as latent
    27
     We also try to use log book-to-market ratios of Fama-French portfolios from 1977, the starting point of our
sample period, to extract a single return predictor. The predictive performance is actually worse. To maintain
consistency with the original KP prediction, we use the data from 1930 for this prediction.



                                                      29
variables. They show that this approach significantly improves the predictability of both future

return and dividend growth. Specifically, they assume AR(1) processes for the two latent state

variables: the expected return (µ) and the expected dividend growth (g):


                               µt+1 = δ0 + δ1 (µt − δ0 ) + µt+1

                                gt+1 = γ0 + γ1 (gt − γ0 ) + gt+1 .                         (14)


The de-meaned state variables are:


                                           µ̂t = µt − δ0

                                           ĝt = gt − γ0 .


Using the parameters in the above AR(1) processes, equation (1) can be written as:

                                      κ    γ 0 − δ0   µ t − δ0   gt − γ0
                        dpt = −          −          +          −
                                     1−ρ    1−ρ       1 − ρδ1 1 − ργ1
                              = A + B1 · µ̂t − B2 · ĝt                                     (15)


   The baseline state-space representation, used by Binsbergen and Koijen (2010), is defined by

two measurement equations:

                                     dpt = A + B1 · µ̂t − B2 · ĝt ,

                                      ∆dt+1 = γ0 + ĝt + dt+1 .

The two transition equations are:

                                        µ̂t+1 = δ1 · µ̂t + µt+1 ,

                                        ĝt+1 = γ1 · ĝt + gt+1 .

We have shown the stock yield (sy) to be a good measure of expected stock return, which allows

us to add another measurement equation:


                                           syt = a + b · µ̂t .



                                                   30
    We then evaluate the out-of-sample performance of the original Binsbergen and Koijen (2010)

model (original BK) and its extension that includes sy (extended BK) using monthly data.

    We use non-overlapping monthly return, dividend growth and dividend-to-price ratio. Monthly

dividends are computed from CRSP returns using the difference between the total monthly return

and the monthly return without dividends. The dividend-to-price ratio for month t is computed as

the ratio between the dividend in that month and the price at the end of the month. We do not

apply seasonal adjustment to the monthly dividend data so the present value relation holds every

month. sy is computed as the two-year backward moving average as before. To be consistent with

our earlier out-of-sample analysis, we start our out-of-sample period in January 1999. Specifically,

we use data before 1999 to estimate both models, and compute expected returns for January 1999.

Next, we re-estimate both models using data up to January 1999 and compute expected returns for

February 1999. We then repeat this process going forward. This procedure allows us to generate a

time series of monthly expected returns under both models from January 1999 through December

2012. We compare them to the realized returns and compute the out-of-sample R2 as before.

Parallel to Figure 4, we also consider a wide range of starting dates for the out-of-sample period

from 1999 through 2007, and plot the out-of-sample R2 s for both models in Figure 6.

    The original BK model generates an out-of-sample R2 of 2.71% when we start the out-of-sample

period in 1999, even better than the performance of sy as reported in Panel A of Table 6 (2.10%).

More interestingly, incorporating stock yield (sy) in the extended BK model improves the out-of-

sample R2 further to 4.22%! Indeed, the extend BK model outperforms the original BK model for

a wide range of out-of-sample cutoff points.

    Similarly, when predicting next-one year returns, the original BK model generates an out-of-

sample R2 of 19.50% for the out-of-sample period starting in 1999. Incorporating stock yield (sy)

in the extended BK model improves the out-of-sample R2 further to 25.66%!28
  28
     To predict next-one year returns, we continue to use non-overlapping monthly return, dividend growth and
dividend-to-price ratio so the present value relation holds. We use the raw monthly sy here rather than its two-year
backward moving average. The resulting next-one-month return forecasts, after simple annualization, become our
next-one-year return forecasts.

7    Conclusion

According to the Gordon growth model, the long horizon expected return on stock (stock yield)

is the sum of the dividend yield and some weighted average of expected future growth rates in

dividends. We show how to construct a measure of the weighted average of expected future growth

rate in dividends based on sell side analysts’ near term earnings forecasts. During 1977-2012,

the stock yield measure constructed in this manner predicts future stock returns as well as other

variables that have been proposed in the literature for predicting stock returns. The forecasts

perform better during times when investors’ recession fears are high.

    Our work links the insights from earlier literature (Campbell and Shiller (1988), among others)

with more recent studies that examine the implied cost of equity capital, ICC (e.g., Li, Ng, and

Swaminathan (2013)). Confirming the insight in Campbell and Shiller (1988), we find augment-

ing the valuation ratio with a measure of growth expectation significantly improves stock return

predictability. Consistent with the literature on the ICC, we find that forward-looking growth ex-

pectations embedded in analysts’ forecasts, especially their near-term earnings forecasts, are useful

in predicting stock returns. The additional assumptions in the ICC models, such as those regarding

payout ratios, the time for the growth rate to reach a steady-state one, and the way the growth

rate fades, appear not critical if the objective is to forecast future stock returns.

    Finally, when combined with recently developed econometric techniques, stock yield improves

their performance in predicting future stock returns. We give two examples in the paper: (1) the

three-stage regression approach of Kelly and Pruitt (2013), and (2) the present-value model of

Binsbergen and Koijen (2010).

                       Appendix A: Term structure of equity returns

   Following Pastor, Sinha, and Swaminathan (2008), we assume that the conditional expected

return, µt ≡ Et (rt+1 ), follows a stationary AR(1) process:



                        µt+1 = a + bµt + ut+1 , 0 < b < 1, ut+1 ∼ N (0, σu2 ).

From equation (2), it is easy to show that:

                                                              
                                          a                 a     1
                              syt =                + µt −              .
                                    (1 − b)(1 − ρ)        1 − b 1 − ρb

In other words, sy is an affine transformation of the next-period expected return, µt . µ turns out

to be the one factor that drives the entire equity term structure in this simple case. For example,

the next-two-period expected return per period is:



                                                 Et (rt+1 + rt+2 )
                                        er2 =
                                                         2
                                                 µt + Et (µt+1 )
                                             =
                                                        2
                                                 a + (1 + b)µt
                                             =                 .
                                                        2

   In general, the n-period expected return per period is:


                                            1 1 − bn
                                                                       
                                        a                          a
                                 ern =    +                  µt −           .
                                       1−b n 1−b                  1−b
                       a
When n → ∞, ern →     1−b ,   or the unconditional expected return. Importantly, these future expected

returns are all functions of µ and can therefore be predicted by sy.


                                 Appendix B: Simulated p-values

   We illustrate our simulation procedure using a bivariate regression where the predictive variables

are sy and BM .

   Define a 3 × 1 column vector Zt = [rt , syt , BMt ]0 . We first estimate a first-order VAR: Zt+1 =

A0 + A1 Zt + ut+1 . We impose the null hypothesis of no return predictability by setting the slope

                                                   37
coefficients of the rt equation to zero and the intercept of the equation to the empirical mean of rt .

The fitted VAR is then used to generate T observations of the simulated variables [rt , syt , BMt ]0 .

The initial observations are drawn from a multivariate normal distribution of the three variables

with mean and covariance matrix set to their empirical counterparts. Once the initial observations

are chosen, the subsequent T-1 simulated observations are generated from the fitted VAR with

the shocks bootstrapped from the actual VAR residuals (sampling without replacement). These

simulated data are then used to run a bivariate return predictive regression to produce regression

coefficients.

    We repeat the process 50,000 times to obtain the empirical distribution of the regression coeffi-

cients (under the null of no predictability), which in turn produce the p-values associated with our

actual estimated coefficients.


          Appendix C: Return predictability of stock yield (sy) at different lags

    We investigate the out-of-sample return predictability of sy at different lags. Specifically, we

report below the OOS-R2 associated with predicting the next-one-month stock market return using

sy lagged by 1 month, 2 months, ..., and up to 24 months. The out-of-sample period ranges from

1999 through 2012. *, **, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.


                Lag   OOS-R2      Lag    OOS-R2         Lag   OOS-R2    Lag   OOS-R2
                 1      -0.10      7      2.24**        13    4.01***   19     -0.59
                 2       0.44      8     2.92***        14    2.78**    20     -0.70
                 3      -0.13      9     2.76***        15    2.48**    21     -0.40
                 4       0.48      10    3.22***        16    2.36**    22     -1.52
                 5      0.91*      11    3.90***        17     1.35*    23     -1.59
                 6      1.13*      12    4.45***        18     0.57     24     -2.02

     We see a hump-shaped relation between the out-of-sample R2 and the number of lags in sy.

Initially, the OOS-R2 s is low and negative until lag 5 when it becomes positive and significant

(0.91%). It is positive and significant for all lags between 5 and 17. Interestingly, it peaks at a lag

equal to exactly one year with a value as high as 4.45%! After lag 18, OOS-R2 becomes negative

again. Overall, sy does the best job when predicting future monthly stock returns centering around

one year.

                                                   38
   It is not too surprising that sy does not the beat historical average in predicting stock returns

far into the future (beyond 18 months). It is somewhat puzzling that sy also underperforms in

predicting returns in the near future. Such an underperformance could arise from the strong short-

term momentum in the market return. After a recent rise in the stock market, valuation ratios

including sy would go down. Short-term momentum, however, would predict a higher return in the

near future, offsetting the usual positive relation between the current valuation ratio and future

stock returns, and reducing the return predictive power.

   Rather than arbitrarily choosing a particular lag in sy for the out-of-sample test, we follow Li,

Ng, and Swaminathan (2013) and use a two-year backward moving average of sy. The results in

this appendix suggest that as long as the length of the rolling window covers at least one year, the

resulting moving average sy should do a good job in the out-of-sample tests.

The figure plots realized one-year returns against predicted one-year returns by stock yield for “good times” and “bad
times” separately. “Good times” and “bad times” are categorized according to the Chicago Fed National Activity
Index (CFNAI), which measures overall economic activity. Each calendar month in the sample period is placed in
one of two groups based on the CFNAI in that month: “good times” are those with above-median CFNAIs, and “bad
times” are those with below-median CFNAIs.

The figure plots the out-of-sample R2 s of predicting monthly market returns according to the original Binsbergen and
Koijen (2010) model (Original BK) and its extension with stock yield (Extended BK). We vary the starting points
(month t) of the out-of-sample period from January 1999 to December 2007, using the period January 1977 to month
t-1 as the in-sample period and the period month t to December 2012 as the out-of-sample period.

                    Table 1: Summary Statistics for Market Return Predictors

This table reports summary statistics of the main predictive variables used in this paper. dp is the log value of the
dividend-to-price ratio; g is the log value of forecasted earnings growth rate; sy is the stock yield measure, calculated
as 0.29+0.05(dp+1.4g); BM is the log value of the book-to-market ratio; EP is the log value of the earnings-to-
price ratio; CAP E is Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio; T erm is the term spread, calculated as
the difference between the AAA-rated corporate bond yield and the one-month T-bill yield; Def ault is the default
spread, calculated as the difference between yields of BAA-rated and AAA-rated corporate bonds; T -Bill is the
continuously compounded one-month Treasury bill rate; T -Bond is the continuously compounded yield on 30-year
Treasury bonds; ICC is the continuously compounded implied cost of capital of the value-weighted market portfolio.
All return, spread, and yield variables are expressed in annualized percentages. The sample period is January 1977
– December 2012. We report mean, standard deviation, and autocorrelations of predictive variables in Panel A, and

  Table 2: Cash Flow Predictive Power of Analyst-Forecast-Implied Growth Rate (g)

This table examines the predictive power of the analyst-forecast-implied growth rate, g, for log annual earnings
growth rates and log dividend growth rates over the next one-, three-, and five-year horizons. The sample period is
January 1977 – December 2012. All regressions use overlapping monthly observations. For each regression, we report
the slope coefficient, p-value, and adjusted R2 . The p-values of individual regression coefficients and the average
coefficient are obtained by comparing the test statistics with their empirical distribution generated under the null of
no predictability from five 5,000 trials of a Monte Carlo simulation as described in the Appendix.

                           Table 3: In-Sample Regression of Market Returns on Stock Yield and Other Predictors

     This table reports results of in-sample univariate regressions of market returns on stock yield and other predictive variables. The dependent variable is the
     average continuously compounded market return in the future, ranging from one-year to four-year horizons. dp is the log value of the dividend-to-price ratio; g
     is the log value of forecasted earnings growth rate; sy is the stock yield measure, calculated as 0.29+0.05(dp+1.4g); BM is the log value of the book-to-market
     ratio; EP is the log value of the earnings-to-price ratio; CAP E is Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio; T erm is the term spread, calculated as the




48
     difference between the AAA-rated corporate bond yield and the one-month T-bill yield; Def ault is the default spread, calculated as the difference between yields
     of BAA-rated and AAA-rated corporate bonds; T -Bill is the continuously compounded one-month Treasury bill rate; T -Bond is the continuously compounded
     yield on 30-year Treasury bonds; ICC is the continuously compounded implied cost of capital of the value-weighted market portfolio. All return, spread, and yield
     variables are expressed in annualized percentages. The sample period is January 1977 – December 2012. All regressions use overlapping monthly observations.
     For each regression, we report the slope coefficient, Newey-West HAC t-value, p-value, and adjusted R2 . We also report the average value of regression coefficients
     across four horizons and its p-value. The p-values of individual regression coefficients and the average coefficient are obtained by comparing the test statistics
     with their empirical distribution generated under the null of no predictability from five thousand trials of a Monte Carlo simulation as described in the Appendix.

Table 4: In-Sample Regression of Market Returns on Stock Yield: Robustness Checks

This table reports results of robustness checks of in-sample regressions of market returns on stock yield and other
predictive variables. The dependent variable is the average continuously compounded market return in the future,
ranging from one-year to four-year horizons. The stock yield measure, sy, is calculated as 0.29+0.05(dp + beta × g),
where dp is the log value of the dividend-to-price ratio, g is the log value of forecasted earnings growth rate and
beta is a constant. In the baseline measurement of sy, we take the beta value of 1.4, measure dp and g from the
value-weighted all-firm portfolio, and calculate g based on IBES median forecasts for the next one-year period and
most recent realized EPS from Compustat. In Panel A, we define sy in various alternative ways by: 1) changing
the value of beta; 2) measuring dp and g from the S&P500 portfolio; 3) using the most recent realized EPS from
IBES to calculate g; 4) using IBES highest or lowest EPS forecasts to calculate g; 5) using earnings forecasts for
the current fiscal year and next fiscal year to compute g, labeled as g2 ; 6) using analysts’ median long-term growth
(LTG) forecasts (available since 1982) for g. In Panel B, we compare the performances of sy and variance risk
premium measure in Bollerslev, Tauchen, and Zhou (2009) in predicting market returns in-sample, in both univariate
and bivariate regressions. The sample period is January 1977 – December 2012. All regressions use overlapping
monthly observations. For each regression, we report the slope coefficients, p-values and the adjusted R2 . We also
report the average regression coefficients across four horizons and their p-values. The p-values of individual regression
coefficients and the average coefficients are obtained by comparing the test statistics with their empirical distribution
generated under the null of no predictability from five thousand trials of a Monte Carlo simulation as described in
the Appendix.

Table 5: In-Sample Regression of Market Returns on Stock Yield: U.S. Portfolio-Level
and International Results
Panel A reports results of in-sample univariate regressions of portfolio return on stock yield for various portfolios
of U.S. stocks formed on book-to-market ratio, size, and industry basis. We form three book-to-market ratio (size)
portfolios based on NYSE 30 and 70 percentile values of book-to-market ratio (market capitalization). We form five
industry portfolios following the industry classification scheme in Fama and French (1997). The dependent variable
is the average continuously compounded portfolio return in the future, ranging from one-year to four-year horizons.
The stock yield measure, sy, is calculated as 0.29+0.05(dp+1.4g), where dp and g are the log values of the dividend-
to-price ratio and forecasted earnings growth rate, respectively, for the corresponding portfolio. The sample period
is January 1977 – December 2012. All regressions use overlapping monthly observations. For each regression, we
report the slope coefficient, p-value, and the adjusted R2 . We also report the average regression coefficient across
four horizons and its p-values.
Panel B reports results of in-sample univariate regressions of aggregate stock portfolio return on stock yield for the six
other G7 countries. The dependent variable is the average continuously compounded monthly return in the future,
ranging from one-year to four-year horizons, for the aggregate stock market of a country. The stock yield measure, sy,
is calculated as 0.29+0.05(dp+1.4g), where dp and g are the log values of the dividend-to-price ratio and forecasted
earnings growth rate respectively for the corresponding country aggregate stock portfolio. To ensure meaningful
measurements, we require a minimum of 50 stocks included in the calculation of every variable for aggregate stock
portfolio. The sample period starts in January 1985 for Canada, January 1988 for France and Germany, July 1990
for Italy, September 1988 for Japan, and June 1990 for the United Kingdom, and ends in December 2012 for all
countries. All regressions use overlapping monthly observations. For each regression, we report the slope coefficient,
p-value, and the adjusted R2 . We also report the average regression coefficient across four horizons and its p-values.
The p-values of individual regression coefficients and the average coefficient are obtained by comparing the test
statistics with their empirical distribution generated under the null of no predictability from 5,000 trials of a Monte
Carlo simulation as described in the Appendix.

                   Table 6: Out-of-Sample Prediction of Market Returns based on Stock Yield and Other Predictors

     This table reports results of out-of-sample prediction of market returns based on stock yield and other predictive variables. In Panel A, the market return to
     predict is next one-month continuously compounded return. The predictive variables include: stock yield (sy), the log value of the dividend-to-price ratio (dp),
     the log value of forecasted earnings growth rate (g), the log value of the book-to-market ratio (BM ), the log value of the earnings-to-price ratio (EP ), Shiller’s
     cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAP E), the term spread (T erm), the default spread (Def ault), the continuously compounded one-month T-bill rate
     (T -Bill), the continuously compounded yield on 30-year Treasury bonds (T -Bond), the continuously compounded aggregate implied cost of capital (ICC). sy
     and ICC are calculated as their 24-month moving average. All return, spread and yield variables are expressed in annualized percentages. For each predictor,
     we report out-of-sample R2 and related statistics. We calculate the p-value of OOS R2 from the adjusted-MSPE statistic of Clark and West (2007). Following
     Campbell and Thompson (2008), the utility gain (Ugain) is the additional utility to an investor with mean-variance preferences and a risk aversion coefficient of
     three by forecasting returns using a particular predictive variable rather than the historical average benchmark. The weight on stocks in the investor’s portfolio
     is constrained to lie between zero and 1.5 (inclusive). In Panel B, the market return to predict is next one-year continuously compounded return. All predictive
     variables are defined in the same way as in Panel A, except for sy and ICC which take the original value rather than the 24-month moving average. The p-value
     is corrected for the serial correlation using the Newey-West formula with a lag of 11 (the number of overlapping observations). In each panel, we also report
     the results of predicting market excess return, which is continuously compounded market return minus the continuously compounded one-month T-bill rate. For
     consistency, we also subtract the yield of one-month T-bill from sy and ICC. The out-of-sample period is January 1999 – December 2012, and the training period




55
     is January 1977 – December 1998.

     Table 7: Out-of-Sample Regressions: Factors Extracted from the Cross-Section

This table reports results of out-of-sample prediction of market returns based on a single forecasting factor extracted
from the cross-section of stock yield and other predictive variables. For example, to extract a market return predictor
from sy, we first form size-sy portfolios based on a two-way conditional sort on market capitalization and sy, then
calculate the portfolio-level sy, and finally run the three-stage regressions in Kelly and Pruitt (2013) to generate
the out-of-sample predictor of market return (KP -sy). Similarly, we generate the out-of-sample predictor of market
return (KP -DP ) from the log dividend-to-price ratios (DP ) of portfolios formed based on a two-way conditional
sort on market capitalization and DP . We use the data since January 1977 to generate both KP -sy and KP -DP .
For comparison, we also follow Kelly and Pruitt (2013) exactly to extract a return predictor (KP -BM ) from the
log book-to-market ratios BM of Fama-French portfolios, using the data since January 1930. Finally, for ease of
comparison, we reproduce the results from Table 6 using the market-level sy, DP , and BM . For each generated OOS
predictor, we calculate the out-of-sample R2 of predicting market returns and its p-value. The out-of-sample period
is January 1999 – December 2012. We calculate the p-value of OOS R2 from the adjusted-MSPE statistic of Clark
and West (2007), and correct it for the serial correlation using the Newey-West formula with a lag of 11 (the number
of overlapping observations) when predicting next one-year returns.
