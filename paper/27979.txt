                                         ABSTRACT

We quantify the value of social status using market prices for Delaware license plates. Delaware
plates are numbered sequentially, are private property, and can be legally bequeathed or traded in
a secondary market. License plates offer no direct economic benefit other than authorizing the
operation of a motor vehicle. But they appear to be a source of social status. Not only do market
prices suggest a preference for lower plate numbers, but there exist extreme price jumps that
indicate that exclusive clubs exist whereby the number of digits on the plate convey implicit
membership. The aggregate value of this market indicates that people purchase status as a
significant portion of their consumption bundle. Finally, social status as an asset appears to be
uncorrelated with aggregate economic and market conditions.

      We quantify the value of social status using market prices for Delaware license

      plates. Delaware plates are numbered sequentially, are private property, and

      can be legally bequeathed or traded in a secondary market. License plates of-

      fer no direct economic benefit other than authorizing the operation of a motor

      vehicle. But they appear to be a source of social status. Not only do market

      prices suggest a preference for lower plate numbers, but there exist extreme

      price jumps that indicate that exclusive clubs exist whereby the number of

      digits on the plate convey implicit membership. The aggregate value of this

      market indicates that people purchase status as a significant portion of their
      consumption bundle. Finally, social status as an asset appears to be uncorre-

      lated with aggregate economic and market conditions.




Introduction

How much are people willing to pay for higher social status? Although social scientists have

considered this question for centuries, status and its value are notoriously difficult to observe

                                                    1
directly and evaluate in isolation (1­4). Researchers in economics, psychology, and sociology
have identified cases of social signaling through ownership of items like diamonds, jewelry,

or fine art (5­9). But, all of these goods are also sources of significant economic utility and
consumption value, thereby confounding the ability to isolate the value of pure status by itself.
   The perception of social status that arises from conspicuous consumption reflects a good's

scarcity, exclusivity, and external observability (10). Expensive cars, handbags, jewelry, and
club memberships can connote higher status in society. But, all of these assets are subject to

personal tastes and practical uses. A Ferrari might be more fun to drive. The stitching on

a designer handbag could reflect craftsmanship with aesthetic value. Diamonds are a part of

cultural traditions that date back centuries. The utility for these scarce and conspicuous goods

makes it difficult to disentangle their functional value from the pure value of the status they

convey.

   License plates issued by the state of Delaware offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the

price that people are willing to pay for status. In Delaware, license plates are the property of

the registrant, and are not permanently linked to any one particular vehicle. Plate owners have

exclusive rights in perpetuity, even if they change cars. The plates are legally transferable: they

have been bequeathed in wills and there is an active secondary market to trade license plates as

assets.
   A low number on an old-style tag signals that its owner is either wealthy, politically well-
connected, or has old family ties in Delaware. And low-numbered tags are astonishingly valu-

able: in 2008, tag number 6 sold for $675,000 at auction. Especially, for low-numbered tags,
the license plate on a car is typically more valuable than the car itself. Figure 1 shows license
plate 10 on the back of a late-model Ford Explorer.

   Using prices from this market, we can calibrate the economic value of status because the
license plates have no other inherent value. A plate number of 7, 93, or 87000 conveys a


                                                2
motorist the same right to drive a car legally. The aesthetic value or manufacture of different
license plates is virtually the same. The only difference between plates is the relative, linear

order of one number compared to another.


Data

The State of Delaware began issuing license plates to motorists in 1909, and currently holds the
distinction of having the longest-running plate design in the United States. Until 1941, motorists

received new versions annually, with varying color schemes each year. However, in 1941,

Delaware started issuing permanent, black and white tags made of porcelain and embossed with

the letters DEL. They produced tags consecutively, starting with the number 1. Between 1941-

1947, roughly 87,000 license plates were issued. In 1947, Delaware switched from porcelain to

steel with DELAWARE embossed on the top and steel numbers spot-riveted on the plate. From

1947-1958, numbers 87,000 to 200,000 were issued. Then, in 1958 a blue and gold tag became

standard-issue.

       We collect a sample of secondary market transaction prices for Delaware license plates

from three sources. The first is from major dealers who intermediate trade. We collected data

from transaction records between 2014-2019 and supplemented this with "ask" prices that were

posted for sale and time on the market. The second source was records from a historian who
keeps track of sales of low digit plates (1 to 3,000) that occurred between 1998-2019.1 The
third was from manual searches to identify other sales and auctions that were reported in print

media. The second and third sources include transaction prices and dates of sale.
       Because we analyze the performance of Delaware license plates as an asset class, we also

collect a time series of GDP and consumption for the U.S. and Delaware from the Bureau

of Economic Analysis (BEA). Finally, we collect U.S. stock return data from the Center for

Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) database.
    Our dataset includes information regarding 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-digit tags and covers three

classifications of tags. The first are tags with no prefix (the original tags for non-commercial
automobiles). The others are tags with the "PC" prefix (for station wagons and SUVs) and
those with the "C" prefix (for commercial vehicles). The latter are valuable as well: Figure 2

shows an example of a funeral home company that advertises a low commercial tag number on
its hearse, so that loved ones can go out in style.

    There are 831 license plate transactions in our data. Details of the sample are presented

in Table 1. Of the 831 transactions, 549 involve plates for standard personal automobiles (no

prefix), 171 are for "C" tags, and 111 are for"PC" tags. There are thirty-six 2-digit and one

hundred and forty 3-digit transactions. The most common transactions in our data are for 4-digit

plates, of which we have 532 transactions. There are 123 transactions for the least-desirable 5-

digit plates.

    Table 1 presents summary statistics by number of digits and prefix type. We present in-

formation on the distribution of tag numbers for each group as well as information about the

sales and ask prices. It is immediately clear that, across digit groups, lower digit tags sell for

higher prices. The average price for 2-digit no-prefix tag is over $180,000, while a 5-digit no-

prefix tag sells for less than $1,000 on average. We also observe that "C" and "PC" tags sell for
substantially lower prices.


Results

Figure 3 plots the log sales price by the log tag number. The pattern that emerges is consis-
tent with the presence of exclusive clubs where membership is restricted (e.g., two-digit club).

Prices of the license plates are largely driven by the number of digits on the plate, not the num-
ber itself. There are discontinuous jumps in price at each threshold, but the slope within digit

                                                 4
bins is very small. The difference between the price of plate number 98 and 101 dwarfs the
difference between 101 and 990. This is consistent with a strong status effect, where social

rank is determined by how scarce the number of available plates are within each bin.
       Table 2 presents results from a multivariate analysis that estimates the jumps across bins and
the slope within, controlling for each type of prefix. Confirming the intuition from Figure 3,

prices of Delaware license plates in the secondary market are largely driven by the number of
digits on the plate. Based on the specification in column 1, a no-prefix 5-digit plate sells for, on

average, $870, all else equal. For these plates, we see discrete jumps in values as the number of

digits on the plate drops. A 4-digit plate sells for almost $11,000 more than a 5-digit plate, while

a 2-digit plate sells on average for $212,000. Single-digit tags are sufficiently valuable that they

tend to sell at auction and we do not have enough data to reliably to estimate the marginal

increase in value for this set. Anecdotal evidence suggests that these sell for significantly more

than even the 2-digit plates.2 .

       In column 2 of Table 2, we conduct the same analysis on the larger set of ask price data. The

point estimates remain consistent. The estimate ask price of 2-digit tags is slightly lower than

the transaction price, but slightly higher for the other categories. The general pricing behavior

over this large set of posted prices is quite similar to that of actual transactions.

       In column 3 (column 4), we estimate the marginal effect the tag number on sales price (ask
price) within each digit group. As noted above, if there were something inherently valuable
about lower numbers, the tag number should co-vary with price within digit bins. This is not

what we find. There is very little relation between price and the numerical value of the tag
within each digit bin. For example, each higher number tag within the set of 2-digit tags is
estimated to sell for $100 less. Based on the average selling price of over $200,000, this estimate

is economically insignificant and is also statistically indistinguishable from zero. This is the

strongest evidence of social status through clubs. If there were any utility associated with lower
numbers, we should see this reflected both across digit bins, but also within.

       Within the subset of our data where we observe both ask price and transactions, we calculate
the difference in these values. We then regress this difference on the digit categories and tag
number. Not surprisingly, sales occur at lower values than posted ask prices. However, the

magnitudes are economically meaningful. For example, 2-digit plates sell for $62K less than
the posted ask price.

       Finally, one might wonder how the value of a status good like the Delaware plate changes

in different economic settings. Using stock returns over the last fifteen years, we find very little

correlation between changes in the prices of Delaware license plates and changes in stock prices

in the market. Additionally, during the financial crisis of 2008, transaction prices of Delaware

plates changed very little. We also see little evidence of a relation to changes in U.S. economic

output per capita. These results are characterized in Figure 4. As such, the demand for social

status appears to be persistent and uncorrelated with economic conditions.


Discussion

The aggregate value of the Delaware plates market is large. Using our estimates from column 1

of Table 2, we can compute that the total value of all no-prefix plates in our sample (from 10 to
99,999) is roughly $227 million.3 This amount is arguably very large for some pieces of metal
with a series of numbers on them. To put this magnitude in perspective, the state of Delaware's

2016 total expenditures by the government were just over ten billion dollars.
   3
     Our analysis in conducted in nominal dollars. We do not observe the precise transaction or listing dates
needed for deflating prices for 194 of our 831 transactions. Therefore any analysis based on real dollars results in
a substantial drop in sample size. Given the relatively short time-series of the data and the generally low inflation
over that time period, one would not expect a deflated analysis to yield meaningfully different results. Using real
dollars for the sub-sample with transaction dates results in the same overall inference with slightly larger magnitude
coefficients for each of the digit indicators.

   The exclusivity of having high social status is large. The price of obtaining a two-digit
tag is ten times (100 times) higher than a three-digit (four-digit) tag. Again, there is no other

associated utility that comes from owning a different plate, besides being able to demonstrate
conspicuous consumption and show other members of society that the owner is wealthy or
well-connected.

   But, the figure of $227 million greatly understates the value of status to people in Delaware,
or for U.S. citizens for that matter. As a fraction of Delaware GDP, the license plate market only

represents 0.4%. However, as we alluded to above, there are a multitude of ways to demonstrate

higher social status: club memberships, luxury purchases, and large-scale philanthropy. As

such, we expect that in aggregate, Americans purchase status as a significant portion of their

personal consumption bundle. The Delaware market simply allows us to document and calibrate

cleanly how much people value their relative position in society.

Table 2: Sale and Ask Price as Function of Tag Number
Sale Price is the reported transaction price. Ask Price is the posted asking price for a given plate. 2-,3-,4-Digits
are indicator variables equal to 1 if the plate has the corresponding number of digits, and 0 otherwise. The base
level is 5-Digit plates. C and PC are indicator variables for commercial plates and station wagon/SUV prefix
plates, respectively. The base level is no-prefix plates. Standard errors are clustered by tag number and reported in
parenthesis.
