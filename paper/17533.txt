                                             ABSTRACT

This paper examines the effect of early childhood investments on college enrollment and degree completion.
We use the random assignment in the Project STAR experiment to estimate the effect of smaller classes
in primary school on college entry, college choice, and degree completion. We improve on existing
work in this area with unusually detailed data on college enrollment spells and the previously unexplored
outcome of college degree completion. We find that assignment to a small class increases the probability
of attending college by 2.7 percentage points, with effects more than twice as large among blacks.
Among students enrolled in the poorest third of schools, the effect is 7.3 percentage points. Smaller
classes increase the likelihood of earning a college degree by 1.6 percentage points and shift students
towards high-earning fields such as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), business
and economics. We find that test score effects at the time of the experiment are an excellent predictor
of long-term improvements in postsecondary outcomes.

Education is intended to pay oﬀ over a lifetime. Economists conceive of education as a
form of “human capital,” requiring costly investments in the present but promising a
stream of returns in the future. Looking backward at a number of education
interventions (e.g., Head Start, compulsory schooling), researchers have identified
causal links between these policies and long-term outcomes such as adult educational
attainment, employment, earnings, health and civic engagement (Ludwig & Miller, 2007;
Deming, 2009; Angrist & Krueger, 1991; Dee, 2004; Lleras-Muney, 2005). But decision-
makers attempting to gauge the eﬀectiveness of current education inputs, policies and
practices in the present cannot wait decades for these long-term eﬀects to emerge.
They therefore rely upon short-term outcomes – primarily standardized test scores – as
their yardstick of success.
         A critical question is the extent to which short-term improvements in test scores
translate into long-term improvements in well-being. Puzzling results from several
evaluations make this a salient question. Three small-scale, intensive preschool
experiments produced large eﬀects on contemporaneous test scores that quickly faded
(Schweinhart, et al., 2005; Anderson, 2008). Quasi-experimental evaluations of Head
Start, a preschool program for poor children, reveal a similar pattern, with test score
eﬀects gone by middle school. In each of these studies, treatment eﬀects have re-
emerged in adulthood as increased educational attainment, enhanced labor market
attachment, and reduced crime (Deming, 2009; Garces, Thomas, & Currie, 2002; Ludwig
& Miller, 2007). Further, several recent papers have shown large impacts of charter
schools on test scores of disadvantaged children (Abdulkadiroglu, et al., 2011; Angrist, et
al., 2012; Dobbie & Fryer, 2011). A critical question is whether these eﬀects on test
scores will persist in the form of long-term enhancements to human capital and well-
being.
         We examine the eﬀect of smaller classes on educational attainment in
adulthood, including college attendance, degree completion and field of study. We
exploit random variation in class size in the early grades of elementary school created by
the Tennessee Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) Experiment. Participants in
the STAR experiment are now in their thirties, an age at which it is plausible to measure




                                             1
completed education. Our postsecondary outcome data is obtained from the National
Student Clearinghouse (NSC), a national database that covers approximately 90 percent
of students enrolled in colleges in the U.S.
       We find that being assigned to a small class increases the rate of postsecondary
attendance by 2.7 percentage points. The eﬀects are considerably higher among
populations with traditionally low rates of postsecondary attainment. For Black students
and students eligible for free lunch the eﬀects are 5.8 and 4.4 percentage points,
respectively. At elementary schools with the greatest concentration of poverty,
measured using the fraction of students receiving a subsidized lunch, smaller classes
increase the rate of postsecondary attendance by 7.3 percentage points. We further
find that being assigned to a small class increases the probability of earning a college
degree by 1.6 percentage points. Smaller classes shift students toward earning degrees
in high-earning fields such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM),
business and economics.
       Our results shed light on the relationship between the short-and long-term
eﬀects of educational interventions. The short-term eﬀect of small classes on test
scores, it turns out, is an excellent predictor of its long-term eﬀect on adult outcomes.
We show this by adding K-3 test scores to our identifying equation; the coeﬃcient on
the class size dummy drops to zero. The coeﬃcient on the interaction of class size and
test scores is also zero, indicating that the scores of children in small classes are no less
(or more) predictive of adult educational attainment than those of children in the
regular classes.
       Our analysis identifies the eﬀect of manipulating a single policy-relevant
educational input on adult educational attainment. By contrast, the early-childhood
interventions for which researchers have identified lifetime eﬀects (e.g., Head Start,
Abecederian) are multi-pronged, including home visits, parental coaching and
vaccinations in addition to time in a preschool classroom. We cannot distinguish which
dimensions of these treatments generate short-term eﬀects on test scores, and whether
they diﬀer from the dimensions that generate long-term eﬀects on adult well-being. The
eﬀective dimensions of the treatment are also ambiguous in the recent literature on




                                               2
classroom and teacher eﬀects. For example, Chetty et al. (2011) show very large eﬀects
of kindergarten classroom assignment on adult well-being. In those estimates, the
variation in classroom quality that produces significant variation in adult outcomes
excludes class size but includes anything else that varies at the classroom level, including
teacher quality and peer quality, both of which are extremely diﬃcult to manipulate
with policy. By contrast, the eﬀects we measure in this paper, both short-term and long-
term, can be attributed to a well-defined and replicable intervention: reduced class size.


THE TENNESSEE STAR EXPERIMENT
The Tennessee Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) Experiment randomly
assigned class sizes to children in kindergarten through third grade. The experiment was
initiated in the 1985-86 school year, when participants were in kindergarten. A total of
79 schools in 42 school districts participated, with over-sampling of urban schools. An
eventual 11,571 students were involved in the experiment. The sample is 60 percent
white and the balance African American. About 60 percent of students were eligible for
subsidized lunch during the experiment. The experiment is described in greater detail
elsewhere (Word, et al., 1990; Folger & Breda, 1989; Finn & Achilles, 1990; Krueger,
1999; and Achilles, 1999.)
       Children in the STAR experiment were assigned to either a small class (target size
of 13 to 17 students) or regular class (22 to 25 students). 1 Students who entered a
participating school after kindergarten were randomly assigned during those entry
waves to a regular or small class. Teachers were also randomly assigned to small or
regular classes. All randomization occurred within schools.
       Documentation of initial random assignment in STAR is incomplete (Krueger,
1999). Krueger (1999) examines records from 18 STAR schools for which assignment
records are available. He finds that, as of entry into STAR, 99.7 percent of students were

1
  A third arm of the experiment assigned a full-time teacher’s aide to regular classes.
Previous research has shown no diﬀerence in outcomes between the regular-sized
classes with and without an aide. We follow the previous literature in pooling students
from both types of regular classes into a single control group. The results are
substantively unchanged if we include an indicator variable for the presence of a full-
time teacher’s aide.


                                             3
enrolled in the experimental arm to which they were initially assigned. Krueger’s
approach, and that of the subsequent literature, is to assume that the class type in
which a student is first enrolled is the class type to which she was assigned. We follow
that convention in our analysis.
       Numerous papers have tested, and generally validated, the randomization in
STAR (Krueger, 1999). There are no baseline outcome data (e.g., a pre-test) available for
the STAR sample. On the handful of covariates available in the STAR data (free lunch
eligibility, race, sex), the arms of the experiment appear balanced at baseline (see Table
1 for a replication of these results). Recent work by Chetty et al. (2011) shows that the
STAR entry waves were balanced at baseline on a detailed set of characteristics (e.g.,
family income, home ownership) contained in the income tax returns of the STAR
subjects’ parents.


PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF SMALL CLASSES
A substantial body of research has examined the eﬀect of Project STAR on short-and
medium-run outcomes. We do not comprehensively discuss this literature but instead
summarize the pattern of findings. These papers show that students assigned to a
small class experience contemporaneous test score gains of about a fifth of a standard
deviation. These test score results diminish after the experiment ends in third grade.2
There is evidence of lasting eﬀects on other dimensions. Krueger and Whitmore
(2001) show that students assigned to small classes are more likely to take the ACT
and SAT, required for admission to most four-year colleges. Schanzenbach (2006)
reports that smaller classes reduce the rate of teen pregnancy among female
participants by about a third. In addition, Fredriksson, Ockert, and Oosterbeek (2013)
find positive long-term impacts of reduced class size in grades 4-6 in Sweden on
educational attainment and wages.
       The paper most closely related to our own examined the impact of Project


2
  Cascio and Staiger (2012) show that fade-out of test-score eﬀects is, at least in some
settings, a statistical artifact of methods used by analysts to normalize scores within and
across grades. However, they specifically note that the sharp drop in estimated eﬀects
that occurs after the end of the STAR experiment cannot be explained in this way.


                                            4
STAR on adult outcomes using the income tax records of STAR participants and their
parents (Chetty et al., 2011). That paper emphasizes the diﬀerential long-term
impacts of being randomly assigned to classrooms of diﬀerent “quality” levels
stemming from higher-quality teachers and/or classmates, after accounting for class
size. Chetty et al. (2011) document the sizeable long-term payoﬀ to having a high
quality classroom, though recognize that this cannot be directly manipulated by public
policy. By contrast, we focus on the long-term impacts of randomly assigned class size,
which is an easily measured input that can be manipulated by policy.


EMPIRICAL STRATEGY
The experimental nature of Project STAR motivates the use of a straightforward
empirical specification. We compare outcomes of students randomly assigned to small
and regular classes by estimating the following equation using Ordinary Least Squares:
                     yisg = β0 + β1SMALLis + β2Xis + βsg + εisg ,                   (1)
where yisg represents a postsecondary schooling outcome of student i, who entered the
STAR experiment in school s and in grade g. X is a vector of covariates including sex, race
and free lunch status (an indicator for whether the student ever received free or
reduced price lunch during the experiment), included to increase precision. βsg is a set of
school-by-entry-grade fixed eﬀects. We include these because students who entered
STAR schools after kindergarten were randomly assigned at that time to small or regular
classes. The variable of interest is SMALLis, an indicator set to one if student i was
assigned to a small class upon entering the experiment. The omitted group to which
small classes are compared is regular classes (with or without a teacher’s aide). We
cluster standard errors by school, the most conservative approach. Standard errors are
about ten percent smaller if we cluster at the level of school-by-wave.


DATA
We use the original data from the STAR experiment, which includes information on the
type of class in which a student is enrolled, basic demographics (race, poverty status,
sex), school identifiers, and standardized test scores. These data also include the name




                                               5
and date of birth of the student, which we use to match to data on postsecondary
attainment and completion.
       Data on postsecondary outcomes for the STAR sample come from the National
Student Clearinghouse (NSC). NSC is a non-profit organization that was founded to assist
student loan companies in validating students’ college enrollment. Borrowers can defer
payments on most student loans while in college, which makes lenders quite interested
in tracking enrollment. Colleges submit enrollment data to NSC several times each
academic year, reporting whether a student is enrolled, at what school, and at what
intensity (e.g., part-time or full-time). NSC also records degree completion and the field
in which the degree is earned. States and school districts use NSC data to track the
educational attainment of their high school graduates (Roderick, Nagaoka, &
Allensworth, 2006). Recent academic papers making use of NSC data include Deming et
al. (2011) and Bettinger et al. (2012).
       With the permission of the Project STAR researchers and the state of Tennessee,
we submitted the STAR sample to the NSC in 2006 and again in 2010.3 The STAR sample
was scheduled to graduate high school in 1998. We therefore capture college
enrollment and degree completion for twelve years after on-time high-school
graduation, when the STAR sample is about 30 years old.
       The NSC matches individuals to its data using name and date of birth. If birth
date is missing, the NSC attempts to match on name alone. Some students in the STAR
sample are missing identifying information used in the NSC match: 12 percent have
incomplete name or birthdate. In our data, a student that attends college but fails to
produce a match in the NSC database is indistinguishable from a student who did not
attend college. If the absence of these identifiers is correlated with the treatment, then
our estimates may be biased. To determine whether identifiers are missing at a
diﬀerential rate across treatment groups, we estimate equation (1) replacing yisg with an
indicator variable equaling one if a student has a missing name or date of birth. We find
a precisely estimated zero for β1 (=-0.008, SE=0.008) indicating that the probability of
missing identifying information is uncorrelated with initial assignment. In the concluding
3
 In 2006, the NSC used social security number as well as name and date of birth in its
matches. As of 2010, NSC had ceased to use social security number for its matches.


                                            6
section of the paper, we present the results of a second test exploring the possible bias
in our main result associated with missing identifiers.
       Not all schools participate in NSC; the company estimates they currently capture
about 93 percent of undergraduate enrollment nationwide. During the late 1990s, when
the STAR subjects would have been graduating from high school, the NSC included
colleges enrolling about 80% of undergraduates in Tennessee (Dynarski, Hemelt, &
Hyman, 2012).4 Since we miss about 20% of undergraduate enrollment using the NSC
data, we expect that we will underestimate the college attendance rate of the STAR
sample by about a fifth. The NSC data indicate that 39.4 percent of the STAR sample had
attended college by age 30. Among those born in Tennessee in the same years as the
STAR sample, the attendance rate is 52.8 percent in the 2005 American Community
Survey (Ruggles, et al., 2010).5 Our NSC estimate of college attendance is therefore, as
expected, about four-fifths of the magnitude of the ACS estimate.
       In the NSC, we find that 15.1 percent of the STAR sample has earned a college
degree. This is substantially lower than the corresponding rate we calculate from the
2005 American Community Survey (29.3 percent). Not all of the colleges that report
enrollment to the NSC report degree receipt, and this explains at least part of the
discrepancy.6
       The exclusion of some colleges from NSC will induce measurement error in the
dependent variable. If this error is not correlated with treatment (i.e., classical
measurement error) then the true eﬀect of class size on college enrollment will be


4
  Dynarski et al. (2012) calculate this rate by dividing undergraduate enrollment at
Tennessee colleges included in NSC as of 1998 by enrollment at all Tennessee colleges in
1998. The list of colleges participating in the NSC and the year that they joined is
accessible on the NSC website. Enrollment data are from the Integrated Postsecondary
Education Data System (IPEDS), a federally-generated database that lists every college,
university and technical or vocational school that participates in the federal financial aid
programs (about 6,700 institutions nationwide) (National Center For Education
Statistics, 2010).
5
  We re-weight the Tennessee-born in the ACS data to match the racial composition of
the STAR sample, which was disproportionately black.
6
  Using IPEDS, we calculate that 70% of undergraduate degrees are conferred by
institutions that, according to the NSC website, report degrees to NSC. Dynarski et al.
(2012) also find lower degree coverage in the NSC relative to enrollment coverage.


                                             7
larger than our observed eﬀect by the proportion of enrollment that is missed
(approximately 20 percent).7 This is because the true treatment eﬀect is the sum of the
observed treatment eﬀect and the treatment eﬀect of the unobserved college attenders
(Bound, Brown, & Mathiowetz, 2001). However, if the measurement error in college
attendance is correlated with assignment to treatment then our eﬀect could be either
downward or upward biased. This would be the case, for example, if colleges attended
by marginal students are disproportionately undercounted by NSC.
     To determine whether the NSC systematically misses certain types of schools, we
compare the schools that participate in NSC with those in IPEDS. Along all measures we
examined (i.e., sector, racial composition, selectivity), the NSC colleges are similar to the
universe of IPEDS colleges, with a single exception: NSC tends to exclude for-profit
institutions.8 These are primarily trade schools such as automotive, technology,
business, nursing, culinary arts and beauty schools. If small classes tend to induce into
such schools those students who would not otherwise attend college, we will
underestimate the eﬀect of small classes on college attendance. If on the other hand
small classes induce students out of such schools into colleges that we tend to observe,
such as community colleges, then our estimates will be upward biased. In the
concluding section of our paper, we conduct a back-of-the-envelope exercise to bound
the possible upward bias that could be due to this phenomenon.


RESULTS
In this section, we examine the eﬀect of assignment to a small class on a set of
postsecondary outcomes: college entry, the timing of college entry, college choice,
degree receipt and field of degree.


College Entry
In Table 2, we estimate the eﬀect of assignment to a small class on the probability of


7
  This is true in terms of percentage points. The percent increase in college attendance
would remain unchanged.
8
  The conclusion is the same when we weight coverage by the number of degrees
conferred rather than by undergraduate enrollment.


                                             8
college entry by age 30. The eﬀect is close to three percentage points (Column 1, 2.8
percentage points), which is an impact of approximately 7 percent relative to the
control mean of 38.5 percent (control means are italicized in the tables). This estimate is
statistically significant, with a standard error of about one percentage point. Including
covariates does not alter the estimate, as is expected with random assignment. For the
balance of the paper we report results that include covariates, since they are slightly
more precise.
       Splitting the sample by race reveals that the eﬀects are concentrated among
Blacks (5.8 points relative to a mean of 30.8 percent) and those eligible for free or
reduced-price lunch (4.4 points relative to a mean of 27.2 percent). The eﬀects are twice
as large for boys (3.2 points relative to a mean of 32.4 percent) than girls (1.6 points
relative to a mean of 45.5 percent). Breaking the eﬀects down yet more finely shows
that the eﬀects are largest for Black females (7.2 points, standard error of 3.5), with no
eﬀect on white females (1.3 points, standard error of 2.3). The eﬀects for Black and
white males are indistinguishable (3.1 and 4.4 points, respectively; standard error of 1.8
and 2.4 points).
       One caveat to consider when examining results by race and gender is that the
probability of enrolling in a college not in the NSC could be correlated with race-gender,
which could cause bias in the estimates. Dynarski et al. (2012) show that NSC coverage
is similar by sex, but is lower for Black students than white students. To examine this
issue for a population similar to the STAR sample of students, we examine the share of
first-time college students in Tennessee in 1998 in IPEDS by race and sex attending for-
profits (which tend not to appear in NSC) and attending any type of college. We find
that black and female students tend to enroll in higher proportions in for-profit colleges.
This suggests that part of the large treatment eﬀect for black females could be due to
these students being induced from non-NSC colleges to those that participate in NSC.
       Our results by student demographics indicate that there is substantial
heterogeneity by race and income in the eﬀect of class size. However, policy decisions
regarding staﬃng levels and class size tend to be set at the school level rather than the
student level. School-level characteristics, rather than student-level characteristics, may




                                            9
therefore be the more policy-relevant dimension along which to measure heterogeneity
in eﬀects. In order to capture this policy-relevant variation in eﬀects, we divide the STAR
schools into three groups: those with low, medium and high levels of poverty, which we
proxy with the share of children eligible for a subsidized lunch. We sort students by this
share, and construct the groups such that the number of students in each group is
nearly identical (see Appendix Table 1). Note that the STAR sample was
disproportionately poor and urban, so even the schools with the lowest levels of poverty
are relatively disadvantaged.
       When we estimate Equation (1) separately for these three groups of schools, we
find that the treatment eﬀect is concentrated in the poorest schools. At schools with
low to medium concentrations of poverty, the estimated eﬀect of class size on
postsecondary attainment is indistinguishable from zero (Table 2, Columns 7 and 8). But
the estimated eﬀect is 7.3 percentage points in the poorest schools. This is a 28 percent
increase relative to the control mean in these schools. A test of the equality of the
coeﬃcients for the poorest schools versus the combined bottom two terciles is strongly
rejected (p-value of 0.008, Column 11).
       Inequality in postsecondary education has increased in recent decades, with the
gap in attendance between those born into lower-income and higher-income families
expanding (Belley & Lochner, 2007; Bailey & Dynarski, 2011). The pattern of eﬀects
described above will tend to decrease gaps in postsecondary attainment. Figure I shows
this graphically. On the top is depicted the gap in college attendance between blacks
and whites in regular classes (left) and in small classes (right). The black-white gap is
about half as large in small classes (7.7 percentage points) as it is in regular classes (12.4
percentage points). The drastic reduction in the race gap in college attendance is driven
by females, for whom the race gap virtually disappears in small classes (results not
shown).
       In the control group, students who were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch
are 29.1 percentage points less likely to attend college than their higher-income
classmates. The gap is slightly smaller in the treatment group (25.7 percentage points).
Finally, we compare the eﬀect of small classes on the gap in postsecondary outcomes




                                             10
between schools with high and moderate levels of poverty. Among students in regular-
sized classes, the gap in postsecondary attendance is 18.1 percentage points. Among
students in small classes, the gap is nearly halved, to 9.8 percentage points.
         Class size could plausibly aﬀect the intensity with which a student enrolls in
college, in addition to the decision to enroll at all. The overall impact on the intensity of
enrollment is theoretically ambiguous: students induced into college by smaller classes
may be more likely to enroll part-time than other students, while treatment could
induce those who would have otherwise enrolled part-time to instead enroll full-time. In
the control group, about three-quarters of college entrants (ever) attend college full-
time, while a quarter never do (Table 2, second row). When we re-estimate Equation (1)
with these two variables as dependent variables, we find that the eﬀect on entry is
evenly divided between part-time and full-time enrollment. While the standard errors
preclude any firm conclusions, these results suggest that the marginal college student is
more likely than the inframarginal student to attend college exclusively on a part-time
basis.


Timing of College Attendance
Class size could plausibly aﬀect the timing of postsecondary attendance. The net eﬀect
is theoretically ambiguous. Smaller classes may lead students who would otherwise
have attended college to advance through high school more rapidly, enter college
sooner after graduation, and move through college more quickly. On the other hand,
students induced into college by smaller classes may enter and move through college at
a slower pace than their inframarginal peers.
         We first estimate the eﬀect of class size upon “on-time enrollment,” which we
define as entering college by fall of 1999, or about 18 months after the STAR cohort is
scheduled to have graduated high school. This variable captures the pace at which
students complete high school, how quickly they enter college, and whether they attend
college at all. By this measure, 27.4 percent of the control group has enrolled on-time,
or about three-quarters of the 38.5 percent who ever attend college (Table 2).
Assignment to a small class increases the likelihood of entering college on time by 2.4




                                             11
percentage points. Among those students enrolled in the poorest third of schools, the
eﬀect is 4.7 points, a 29 percent increase relative to this group’s control mean of 16
percent. These results suggest that students in smaller classes are no less likely to start
college on time than control students: 72 percent of the treatment-group students who
attend college do so on time, while among the control group the share of attendance
that is on-time is 71 percent.
       We next look at the year-by-year evolution of the eﬀect of class size on
postsecondary attainment. For each year, we plot the share of students who have ever
attended college, separately for the treatment and control group (Figure II, top panel).
We also plot the treatment-control diﬀerence, along with its 95% confidence interval
(Figure II, bottom panel). The fraction of the sample that has ever attended college rises
from under 5 percent in 1997 to over 20 percent in 1998 (when students are 18). The
rate rises slowly through age 30, when the share of the sample with any college
experience reaches nearly 40 percent. The diﬀerence between the two groups reaches
about three points by age 19 and remains at that level through age 30. 9 When we
examine the shares of students who are currently enrolled in college (Figure III) we see
that the treatment group is more likely to be enrolled in college at every point in time,
peaking at around 25 percent in 1999. Plausibly, smaller classes could have sped up
college enrollment and completion, and the control group could eventually have caught
up with the treatment group in its rate of college attendance. This is not what we see,
however. The eﬀect is always positive, and is largest right after high school, when the
sample is 18 to 19 years old.10


College Choice

   To obtain the figures, we replace the small-class indicator variable in our identifying
equation with a full set of its interactions with year fixed effects. The coefficients on
these interactions and their confidence intervals are plotted in the bottom panel. In the
top panel, we add these interactions to the year-specific control means.
10
    This pattern of findings sheds light on the diﬀerence between our findings and those
of Chetty et al. (2011). We can reconcile our findings with Chetty et al. (2011) if we
censor the NSC data so that they exclude the same enrollment spells that are
unobserved in their data, see Appendix Table 2.


                                            12
students to alter their college choices. For example, those who would have otherwise
attended a two-year community college may instead choose to attend a four-year
institution. Bowen, Chingos, and McPherson (2009) suggest that attending higher
quality colleges (which provide more inputs, including better peers) is a mechanism
through which students could increase their rate of degree completion.
       In Table 3, we examine the eﬀect of class size on college choice. Across the
entire sample, we find little evidence that exposure to smaller classes shifts students
toward higher-quality schools. The treatment eﬀect is concentrated on attendance at
two-year institutions. While 22 percent of the control group starts college at a two-year
school, the rate is 2.5 percentage points higher in the treatment group (with a standard
error of 0.9 percentage points). The eﬀect is 6.3 percentage points among students in
the poorest third of schools. We find positive but imprecise eﬀects on the probability of
ever attending a four-year college, attending college outside Tennessee, or attending a
selective college.11


Persistence and Degree Completion
While college entry has been on the rise in recent decades, the share of college entrants
completing a degree is flat or declining (Bound, Lovenheim, & Turner, 2010). About half
of college entrants never earn a degree. A key concern is that marginal students
attending college may drop out quickly, in which case the attendance eﬀects discussed
above would overestimate the eﬀect of class size on social welfare.
       We explore this issue by examining the eﬀect of small classes on the number of
semesters that students attend college, as well as on the probability that they complete
a college degree. Overall, the number of semesters attempted (including zeroes) is quite
low: the control group attempts an average of three semesters by age 30. Among those
in the control group with any college experience, the average number of semesters
attempted is eight.
       The treatment group spends 0.22 more semesters in college than the control

11
  We measure selectivity using Barron’s quality categories. Using an index that includes
multiple proxies for quality such as the acceptance rate, tuition, and the average
ACT/SAT score of entering students provides similar results.


                                           13
group (Figure IV, top; Table 4). The eﬀects are somewhat larger among students in the
poorest schools (coeﬃcient of 0.32), though the eﬀect is imprecisely estimated and the
diﬀerence across terciles is less stark than with the college entry eﬀects. The size of
these eﬀects is comparable to treatment eﬀects found in the Opening Doors
demonstration, which gave short-term rewards to community college students for
achieving certain enrollment and grade thresholds (Barrow, et al., 2009).
       Assignment to a small class increases the likelihood of completing a college
degree by 1.6 percentage points (Table 4); the result is statistically significant at the 10
percent level. When we examine eﬀects separately by highest degree earned, we find
that the 1.6 percentage point eﬀect is driven evenly by increases in 2-year (associates)
and 4-year (bachelors) degree receipt (0.7 and 0.9 percentage points, respectively).
When we turn to the timing of degree completion, we see that there is a positive
treatment eﬀect at every age. The diﬀerence is largest between age 22 and 23 (Figure
IV, Panel C). Students assigned to small classes during childhood continue to outpace
their peers in their rate of degree completion well into their late twenties. This may
explain why Chetty et al. (2011) do not find an eﬀect of small classes on earnings, which
they observe at age 27. Members of the treatment group are still attending and
completing college at this age, and so have likely not yet spent enough time in the labor
market for their increased education to oﬀset experience forgone while in college.


Field of Degree
The earnings of college graduates vary considerably by field. In particular, those who
study science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), as well as business and
economics, enjoy higher returns than other college graduates (Arcidiacono, 2004;
Hamermesh & Donald, 2008). In this section we examine whether class size aﬀects the
field in which a student completes a degree.12
       We divide degrees into three categories: 1) STEM fields; business and economics
concentrations; and all others.13 Students can earn more than one degree (e.g., an AA

12
   Field of study is available only for students who complete a degree; we are therefore
unable to examine the field of study for non-completers.
13
   We follow a degree-coding scheme defined by the National Science Foundation


                                            14
and a BA); we code them as having a STEM degree if any degree falls in this category,
and as having a business or economics degree if any degree falls in this category and
they have not earned a STEM degree. In practice, very few students earn both a STEM
and business or economics degree.
          Assignment to a small class shifts the composition of degrees toward STEM,
business and economics. While 1.9 (2.6) percent of the control group earns a degree in a
STEM (business or economics) field, the rate is 2.4 (3.3) in the treatment group (Table
4). However, these estimates are imprecisely estimated. In order to increase precision
and to group fields by whether or not they are high-paying, we combine the STEM,
business and economics fields into one category. Assignment to a small class increases
degree receipt in these high-paying fields by 1.3 percentage points. This diﬀerence is
statistically significant at the 5 percent level, with a standard error of 0.6 percentage
points. There is no diﬀerence in the rate at which students receive degrees in other
fields.
          These results are consistent with two scenarios: (1) those induced into
completing a degree tend to concentrate in STEM, business and economics or (2)
inframarginal degree completers are shifted toward STEM, business and economics.
While we cannot conclusively identify those who are and are not on the margin of
completing a degree, our analysis by school-level poverty tercile (Table 4, Columns 2
and 3) suggests that the second scenario is at work. The eﬀect of small classes on
graduating in a STEM, business or economics degree is 1.9 percentage points (standard
error of 0.8 points) among the less poor schools where students are more likely to be
inframarginal degree completers. The eﬀect is zero among the poorest third of schools,
where students are more likely to be induced into completing a degree. These eﬀects
are statistically diﬀerent from one another at the 10 percent level.


Testing for Sources of Heterogeneity in Effects


(National Science Foundation, 2011). We apply this scheme to two text fields included in
NSC: degree title (e.g., “associates” or “bachelor of science”) and college major (e.g.,
“biology”). A small number of students who receive a degree are missing both degree
title and college major, and are excluded from this analysis.


                                            15
One interpretation of these results is that the groups with the lowest control means are
most sensitive to class size. An alternative interpretation, however, is that the groups
that display the largest response are actually exposed to a more intense dosage of the
treatment. All of our estimates so far have been of the eﬀect of the intention to treat
(ITT), which is attenuated toward zero when there is crossover and noncompliance. The
groups that show the largest ITT eﬀects may have received larger dosages of the
treatment, in the form of particularly small classes or more years spent in a small class.
Krueger and Whitmore (2002) show that disadvantaged students in the treatment group
are not systematically assigned to the smallest of the small classes. Here we examine
whether they are exposed to more years in a small class.
       We generate subgroup estimates of the eﬀect of assignment to a small class on
years spent in a small class. To do so, we instrument for years actually spent in a small
class with years potentially spent in a small class. Potential years in a small class is the
product of assignment to a small class and the number of years the student could be
enrolled in a small class, based on year of entry into STAR. For example, a student who
entered STAR in kindergarten could spend as many as four years in a small class, while a
child who entered in third grade could spend only one.14
       We estimate the following equations:
                      YEARSis = δ0 + δ1Zis + δsg + ψisg                             (2)
                       COLLisg = α0 + α1YEARSis + αsg + εisg ,                      (3)
where COLLisg is an indicator variable for whether student i, who entered the STAR
experiment in school s and in grade g, ever enrolls in college. YEARS is the number of
years the student spends in a small class. Z is the potential number of years a student
could attend a small class multiplied by an indicator for whether the student was
assigned to a small class. School-by-entry-grade fixed eﬀects are included in each
equation. We estimate these equations separately by subgroup.
       Table 5 reports the estimates of the first stage equation, the reduced-form


14
  Abdulkadiroglu et al. (2011) and Hoxby and Murarka (2009) use a similar approach
when they instrument for years spent in a charter school with potential years spent in a
charter school, where potential years is a function of winning a charter lottery and the
grade of application.


                                              16
intention-to-treat model (ITT) and the two-stage least squares model (2SLS). The first-
stage results in column (1) measures compliance, reporting the number of years actually
spent in a small class for each year assigned to a small class. Overall, for each year of
potential small-class attendance, students on average attend 0.64 years in a small class.
The compliance rate is consistently smaller for the groups for whom we have estimated
the largest eﬀects of ITT. This is likely driven by higher mobility among black and poor
students. The 2SLS estimates (Column 3) indicate that each year spent in a small class
increases college attendance rates by one percentage point for the entire sample, but
by 2.8 points for students attending the poorest schools, 2.4 points for black students,
and 1.6 points for poor students. These results indicate that students who are black,
poor, or attend high-poverty schools benefit more from a year spent in a small class
than do their peers.


Do Short-Term Eﬀects Predict Long-Term Eﬀects?
We have shown that random assignment to small classes increases college entry and
degree completion and shifts students toward high-paying majors. Could these eﬀects
have been predicted by the short-term eﬀects of STAR on test scores? That is, are the
eﬀects measured at the time of the experiment predictive of the program’s long-term
eﬀects?
       A back-of-the-envelope prediction would combine the experiment’s eﬀect on
scores with information from some other data source on the relationship between
scores and postsecondary attainment. We now make such an informed guess about the
long-term eﬀects of STAR, then compare our guess with the paper’s findings.
       The guess requires information about the relationship between standardized
scores in childhood and adult educational attainment, ideally for a cohort born around
the same time as the STAR subjects. The NLSY79 Mother-Child Supplement contains
longitudinal data on the children of the women of the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth. These children were born at roughly the same time as the STAR cohort. The
children of the NLSY (CNLSY) were tested every other year, including between the ages
of six and nine (the ages of the STAR subjects while the experiment was underway).




                                           17
Postsecondary attainment is also recorded in CNLSY.
       In CNLSY a standard deviation increase in childhood test scores is associated with
a 16 percentage-point increase in the probability of attending college.15 Assignment to a
small class in STAR increases the average of K-3 scores by 0.17 standard deviations.
Under the assumption that the relationship between scores and attainment is the same
for the STAR and NLSY79 children, a reasonable prediction of the eﬀect of STAR on the
probability of college attendance is 2.72 percentage points (=0.17*16). This back-of-the-
envelope calculation is nearly identical to the 2.7 point estimate we obtained in our
regression analysis, indicating that the contemporaneous eﬀect of STAR on scores is an
excellent predictor of its eﬀect on adult educational attainment.
       Another way to approach this question is to examine whether the estimated
eﬀect of small classes on postsecondary attainment disappears when we control for K-3
test scores. This is an informal test of whether class size aﬀects postsecondary
attainment through any channel other than test scores. This sort of informal test is often
used when checking whether an instrument (e.g., assigned class size) aﬀects the
outcome of interest (e.g., postsecondary attainment) through any channel other than
the endogenous regressor (e.g., test scores). We first re-estimate Equation (1) and
report the main result in column 1 of Table 6. We then add to this regression a student’s
test scores and the interaction of the test scores and assignment to a small class. The
interaction allows the relationship between test scores and postsecondary attainment
to diﬀer between small and regular classes:
       Collisg = β0 + β1SMALLis + β2TESTis + β3SMALLis‫כ‬TESTis + β4Xis + βsg + εisg   (4)
Here, Collisg is a dummy that equals one if student i who entered the STAR experiment in
school s and grade g ever attended college. TESTis is the average of student i’s non-
missing kindergarten through third grade math and reading test scores, normalized to
mean zero and standard deviation of one. Results are in Table 6 (Column 2).
       First looking to the coeﬃcient on test scores, in STAR a one-standard deviation


15
  We regress an indicator for college attendance against the average scores in multiple
standardized tests administered when the subjects were between ages six and nine.
Scores are normalized (within age) to mean zero and standard deviation one. We
measure college attendance by 2006, when the children were 25 to 29 years old.


                                              18
increase in K-3 scores is associated with a 17 percentage-point increase in the
probability of attending college.16 This is very similar to the relationship estimated
among the children of the NLSY. The estimated coeﬃcient on the interaction term
between small class assignment and average test score is zero, indicating that scores
have no differential predictive power for postsecondary attendance across students in
small and regular classes. Similarly, the estimated coeﬃcient on the small class indicator
variable is also zero, suggesting that there is no additional boost to the likelihood a
student attends postsecondary school from small class assignment after accounting for
contemporaneous test scores (which are boosted by smaller classes). The pattern is
similar if we replace college attendance with degree receipt (Columns 3-4). These
findings indicate that short-term gains in cognitive test scores are indeed predictive of
long-term benefits.
       By contrast, we find that scores from tests administered after children left STAR
are not nearly so predictive of its long-term eﬀect. We estimate the equation just
described, replacing contemporaneous scores with those obtained from tests
administered in grades six through eight, three to five years after the experiment had
ended. Now we see that, even after controlling for test scores, small-class assignment
raises the likelihood of attending college by a statistically significant 2 percentage
points. Further, the negative coeﬃcient on the interaction term indicates that these
subsequent test scores have less predictive power in small than regular classes. We
conclude that scores recorded several years after the experiment do a significantly
poorer job than contemporaneous scores in predicting the eﬀect of the experiment on
adult outcomes. One caveat to this analysis is that there could be omitted variables that
are correlated both with assignment to a small class, test scores, and college
attendance. If this were the case, then it might not be the contemporaneous test scores
that are mediating the eﬀect of small class assignment, but rather the omitted variables.


CONCLUSION
We estimate the eﬀect of class size in early elementary school on postsecondary
16
  Results are unchanged if we exclude the school-by-wave fixed eﬀects and
demographics.

attainment. Assignment to a small class increases college attendance by 2.7 percentage
points. Enrollment eﬀects are largest among black students, students from low-income
families, and high-poverty schools, indicating that class-size reductions during early
childhood can help to close income and racial gaps in postsecondary attainment.
Assignment to a small class also increases degree completion by 1.6 percentage points,
with the eﬀects concentrated in high-earning fields such as business, economics, and
STEM.
        As a final check on the sensitivity of our main result to possible sources of bias,
we conduct two exercises. First, we examine the extent that students missing name and
date of birth could influence the results, given that the NSC uses these identifiers to
match students to college enrollment data. We assign all students with a missing name
or date of birth first as having enrolled in college and then as having not enrolled in
college regardless of their observed enrollment status. After each of these imputations
we re-estimate Equation (1). Imputing students with missing identifiers as enrolled (not
enrolled) yields a point estimate of 0.017 (0.025) and standard error of 0.009 (0.011).
These coeﬃcients are somewhat attenuated relative to our main result of 0.027
(SE=0.011). However, this check shows that even if we impute the most extreme cases
of possible bias due to missing identifiers, our result remains positive, statistically
significant, and similar in magnitude to our main result.
        Our final check is a back-of-the-envelope exercise to bound the possible upward
bias that could be due to small class assignment inducing students out of colleges not
participating in the NSC (e.g., for-profits) and into colleges that do participate (e.g.,
community colleges). Using the NSC participant list and IPEDS enrollment data, we
calculate that 8.7 percent of first-time enrollment in Tennessee during 1998 is in for-
profit colleges. If small classes induce all of these students out of for-profit institutions
and into colleges that we observed in the NSC (an extreme assumption), then our
estimated eﬀect on college enrollment would be biased upward by 3.7 percentage
points.17 This upper bound on the upwards bias is larger than our observed treatment

17
   In other words, if we assume that none of the treatment group attends for-profit
colleges but 8.7 percent of the control group does, the implied total college enrollment
rate among the control group would be 0.422. This rate is 3.7 percentage points higher


                                             20
eﬀect. However, a somewhat more realistic estimate based on past studies of STAR
would be to assume that the treatment induces 10 percent of students out of for-profit
institutions and into colleges that we observe (Krueger and Whitmore, 2001). This
would cause our estimates to be biased upwards by 0.4 percentage points. This excludes
any possible attenuation bias due to classical measurement error in the unobserved
nonprofit college attendance, and any possible downward bias due to small classes
inducing non-college attenders into for-profit institutions. This is thus a source of
potential upward bias that under a somewhat plausible worst case scenario would
explain only a small fraction of our treatment eﬀect.
       Is the nearly three percentage-point increase due to reduced class size that we
estimate a large eﬀect? To put this eﬀect in context, we compare the estimate to those
of other interventions that boost postsecondary attainment. We focus on the results of
randomized trials when possible, turning to plausibly-identified quasi-experiments
where no controlled experiment has been conducted. Deming and Dynarski (2010)
provide a review of this literature, from which much of this information is drawn. We
focus on evaluations of discrete, replicable interventions. We deliberately ignore several
excellent papers that demonstrate that schools or teachers “matter” for postsecondary
attainment, since they do not identify the eﬀect of a manipulable parameter of the
education production function (e.g., Deming et al., 2011, Chetty et al., 2011).
       Two small experiments have tested the eﬀect of intensive preschool on long-
term outcomes. Abecedarian produced a 22 percentage-point increase in the share of
children who eventually attended college. The Perry Preschool Program had no
statistically significant eﬀect on postsecondary outcomes (Anderson, 2008). The subjects
in these experiments were almost exclusively poor and black. Head Start, a less
intensive preschool program, increases college attendance by 6 percentage points
(Deming, 2009), with larger eﬀects for blacks and females (14 and 9 percentage points,
respectively). Upward Bound provides at-risk high-school students with increased
instruction, tutoring and counseling. The program had no detectable eﬀect on the full


than the observed attendance rate among the control group (excluding for-profit
colleges) of 0.385.




                                            21
sample of treated students, but it did increase college attendance among students with
low educational aspirations by 6 percentage points (Seftor, Mamun, & Schirm, 2009).
       There are no experimental estimates of the eﬀect of financial aid on college
entry. However, there are several well identified quasi-experimental studies showing
that student aid can boost postsecondary enrollment by several percentage points
depending on how much aid is provided (Deming & Dynarski, 2010). Another way of
increasing college enrollment is by assisting students with the administrative
requirements of enrolling in college. Bettinger et al. (2012) randomly assign families to a
low-cost treatment that consists of helping them to complete the FAFSA, the lengthy
and complicated form required to obtain financial aid for college. Their intervention
increases enrollment by eight percentage points.
       The costs of the above interventions vary dramatically. We create an index of
cost eﬀectiveness for increasing college enrollment by dividing each program’s costs by
the proportion of treated students it induces into college. 18 Head Start costs $8,000 per
child. Given the 6 percentage-point eﬀect noted above, the amount spent by Head Start
to induce a single child into college is therefore $133,333 (=$8,000/0.06). For
Abecedarian, the figure is $410,000 (=$90,000/0.22). The cost of reduced class size is
$12,000 per student, larger than that of Head Start but considerably smaller than that of
Abcedarian. The amount spent in STAR to induce a single child into college is $400,000
(=$12,000/0.03). If the program could be focused on students in the poorest third of
schools (the subpopulation that most closely matches that of the preschool
interventions) then the cost drops to $171,000 per student induced into college.
       Upward Bound costs $5,620 per student. If the program could be targeted to
students with low educational aspirations, the implied cost of inducing a single student
into college is $93,667 (=$5,620/0.06). Dynarski (2003) examines the eﬀect of the
elimination of the Social Security Student Benefit Program, which paid college
scholarships to the dependents of deceased, disabled and retired Social Security


18
  All costs in this section are in 2007 dollars and come from Deming and Dynarski (2010)
unless otherwise indicated. The costs for the early childhood programs and STAR have
been discounted back to age zero using a 3 percent discount rate. Costs of the high
school and college interventions have not been discounted.


                                            22
beneficiaries. Eligible students were disproportionately black and low-income. The
estimates from that paper indicate that about two-thirds of the treated students who
attended college were inframarginal, while the other third was induced into the college
by the $7,000 scholarship. These estimates imply that three students are paid a
scholarship in order to induce one into college. The cost per student induced into
college is therefore $21,000. Finally, the cost per treated subject in the FAFSA
experiment (Bettinger et al., 2012) was $88 for an implied cost per student induced into
college of $1,100 (=$88/0.08).
       A fair conclusion from this analysis is that the eﬀects we find in this paper of
class size on college enrollment alone are not particularly large given the costs of the
program. If focused on students in the poorest third of schools, then the cost-
eﬀectiveness of class size reduction is within the range of other interventions. There is
no systematic evidence that early interventions pay oﬀ more than later ones when the
outcome is limited to increased college attendance.
       In addition to estimating the eﬀects of reduced class size during childhood on
educational attainment, the results in our paper shed light on the relationship between
the short-and long-term eﬀects of an educational intervention. We find that the short-
term eﬀect of small class assignment on test scores is an excellent predictor of its eﬀect
on adult educational attainment. In fact, under the assumption that there are no
omitted variables correlated with small class assignment, test scores, and college
enrollment, the eﬀect of small classes on college attendance is completely “explained”
by their positive eﬀect on contemporaneous test scores. Further, the relationship
between scores and postsecondary attainment is the same in small and regular classes;
that is, the scores of children in the small classes are no less (or more) predictive of
adult educational attainment than those of children in the regular classes. This is an
important and policy-relevant finding, given the necessity to evaluate educational
interventions based on contemporaneous outcomes.
       A further contribution of this paper is to identify the eﬀect of manipulating a
single educational input on adult educational attainment. The early-childhood
interventions for which researchers have identified lifetime eﬀects (e.g., Head Start,

Abecederian) are intensive and multi-pronged, including home visits, parental coaching
and vaccinations. We cannot distinguish which dimensions of these treatments generate
short-term eﬀects on test scores, and whether they diﬀer from the dimensions that

this paper, both short-term and long-term, can be attributed to a well-defined and
replicable intervention: reduced class size.
