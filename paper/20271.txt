Educational Assortative Mating and Household Income Inequality

                                          ABSTRACT

We document the degree of educational assortative mating, how it evolves over time, and the
extent to which it differs between countries. Our analysis focuses on the U.S. but also uses data
from Denmark, Germany, the U.K., and Norway. We find evidence of positive assortative mating
at all levels of education in each country. However, the time trends vary by the level of education:
Among college graduates, assortative mating has been declining over time, whereas the low-
educated are increasingly sorting into internally homogeneous marriages. These findings motivate
and guide a decomposition analysis where we quantify the contribution of various factors to the
distribution of household income. We find that educational assortative mating accounts for a non-
negligible part of the cross-sectional inequality in household income in each country. However,
changes in assortative mating over time barely move the time trends in household income
inequality. This is because the inequality contribution from the increase in assortative mating
among the low educated is offset by the equalizing effect from the decline in assortative mating
among the highly educated. By comparison, increases over time in the returns to education
generate a considerable rise in household income inequality, but these price effects are partly
mitigated by increases in college attendance and completion rates among women.

1       Introduction

It is often argued that individuals are increasingly sorting into internally homogeneous
marriages, and that this assortative mating has led to a rise in household income inequality.
This widespread view stems from two empirical facts. The proportion of couples who share
the same level of education (i.e., educational homogamy) has been growing over the past few
decades (see e.g. Pencavel, 1998; Schwartz and Mare, 2005). Accompanying this increase
in educational homogamy, there has been a rise in household income inequality (see e.g.
Western et al., 2008). In the U.S., for example, the share of couples in which both spouses
have a college degree increased by 22 percentage points between 1962 and 2013, while the
Gini coefficient in household income among married couples increased from 33.9 to 43.2 over
this period.
    Measuring educational assortative mating and its impact on household income inequality
has proven difficult for several reasons.1 One challenge is to determine whether the increase
in educational homogamy arises due to secular changes in educational attainment of men and
women, or because of shifts in educational assortative mating. For example, the closing of the
gender gap in higher education may increase the probability that a college graduate is married
to someone with a college degree, even if there were no changes in the assortativeness of
marriage (see Liu and Lu, 2006). Another challenge is that the economic returns to education
have increased considerably over the past few decades (see e.g. Autor et al., 2008). As a
result, educational assortative mating may become increasingly important for the distribution
of household income, even if there were no changes in the mating pattern.
    This paper tries to address these challenges, making two main contributions. The first
is to examine the degree of educational assortative mating, how it evolves over time, and
the extent to which it differs between countries. The coverage and detailed nature of the
data we are using allows us to bring new evidence on the assortativeness of marriage over
time and between countries. This evidence motivates and guides our second contribution: a
quantification of the explanatory power of various factors to household income inequality. In
particular, we employ the semiparametric decomposition method proposed by DiNardo et al.
(1996) to quantify the relative importance of changes in educational composition, returns to
education, and educational assortative mating for the rise in household income inequality.
    While our study is centered on the U.S., we also provide evidence from Denmark, Germany,
the U.K., and Norway. The data available in each of these countries allow us to study
    1
     The term ’assortative mating’ is used in different ways by different authors. Commonly, positive (negative)
educational assortative mating is defined as men and women with the same level of education marrying more
(less) frequently than what would be expected under a marriage pattern that is random in terms of education.
We follow this definition of educational assortative mating.



                                                       1
educational assortative mating and household income inequality over several decades. The
U.S. data are available for the longest time period, going back to 1940. By comparing the
results across countries, we shed light on whether our findings are specific to the U.S. or
common across several western economies that differ considerably in the incentives to choose
spouses by their education levels.2
    Our paper offers three sets of results. First, we present new evidence on the long-run
evolution of educational assortative mating in the U.S. We show that ever since 1940 (our
first year of data), Americans with the same level of education marry much more frequently
than what would be expected under a marriage pattern that is random in terms of education.
This positive assortative mating occurs at all levels of education throughout the entire sample
period. However, the time trends are heterogeneous and vary depending on where in the
educational distribution one looks. On the one hand, assortative mating among the highly
educated has been steadily declining over time. In the early 1960s, for example, Americans
with a college degree were five times as likely to be married to a spouse with a college degree,
compared to the counterfactual situation where spouses were randomly matched with respect
to education; in 1980 and 2013, they were only three and two times as likely, respectively.
On the other hand, assortative mating has gradually increased among the low educated.
In the early 1960s, Americans without a high school degree were 1.6 times as likely to be
married to one another as compared to the probability with random mating; in 1980 and
2013, they were 2.6 and 7.2 times as likely. Aggregating the measures of assortative mating
across education levels, we obtain a measure of the overall educational assortative mating.
This measure suggests that, on average, the degree of assortative mating increased gradually
from 1940 to the 1980s, after which it has changed relatively little. This conclusion is robust
to employing alternative measures of assortative mating as well as to accounting for sorting
by age and changes in the probability of marriage by education level.
    Our second set of results comes from the decomposition method used to quantify the
contribution of various factors to the distribution of household income in the U.S. We find
that educational assortative mating accounts for a non-negligible part of the cross-sectional
inequality in household income. For example, our results suggest the Gini coefficient in 2013
is almost 5 % higher compared to the counterfactual situation where spouses were randomly
matched. However, the changes in assortative mating over time barely move the time trends
in household income inequality. This is because the inequality contribution from the increase
in assortative mating among the low educated is offset by the equalizing effect from the
   2
     For example, Landersø and Heckman (2017) show that the relationships linking education and income
differ greatly between Denmark and the U.S. In particular, the economic returns to education are relatively
low in Denmark, in part due to the compressed wage distribution (possibly due to unions and minimum wage
standards) but also because of the progressivity of the tax-transfer system.


                                                    2
decline in assortative mating among the highly educated. By comparison, increases in the
returns to education generate a considerable rise in household income inequality, but these
price effects are partly mitigated by increases in college attendance and completion rates
among women. For example, our estimates suggest the Gini coefficient in 2013 would have
been around 25% lower if returns to education had remained at the levels we observe in the
early 1960s. By way of comparison, the Gini coefficient would have been nearly 12% higher
had the educational composition in 2013 been like that in the 1960s.
    Our third set of results shows that the main findings about educational assortative mating
and household income inequality are not specific to the U.S., but generalize to the other
developed countries for which we have data. In each country, we find evidence of positive
assortative mating at all levels of education. In addition, the time trends are qualitatively
similar across countries: Among college graduates, assortative mating has been declining over
time, whereas low educated are increasingly sorting into internally homogeneous marriages.
On top of this, the conclusions about household income inequality are broadly consistent
across countries. Educational assortative mating is important for the cross-sectional inequality
in household income, whereas changes in assortative mating over time matter little for the time
trends in household income inequality. By comparison, changes in the returns to education
over time are a key factor behind the evolution of household income inequality.
    In interpreting these three sets of results, it is important to keep in mind the descriptive
nature of our analysis. While our study offers new facts about educational assortative
mating over time and across countries, it is silent on the causes of sorting in marriage.
For example, sorting along educational attainment might reflect a preference for a spouse
with a certain education level or that people could be more likely to meet someone with a
similar level of education in school, college, or at work. Our decomposition method is also
best understood as a descriptive approach or accounting exercise, abstracting from several
potentially important partial equilibrium considerations (e.g. self-selection into education by
comparative advantage) and general equilibrium conditions (e.g. simultaneous determination
of education choices, returns to education, and marriage decisions).3
    Our study is primarily related to an empirical literature on educational assortative mating
(see e.g. Mare 1991; Pencavel 1998; Fernandez and Rogerson 2001; Breen and Salazar 2011;
Greenwood et al. 2014, 2016). Our paper expands and clarifies this prior research in several
important ways. First, our analysis of the U.S. considers the trends over a longer time
period, showing that the degree of assortative mating increased gradually from 1940 to the
1980s, after which it has changed relatively little. Second, we study educational assortative
   3
    See Fortin et al. (2011) for a review of decomposition methods in economics and a discussion of these
considerations.

mating for a broad range of countries, revealing a common pattern in educational assortative
mating over time. Third, we study educational assortative mating in the U.S. by race, finding
qualitatively similar results for blacks and whites. Fourth, we provide a detailed analysis of
educational assortative mating among the college educated. This analysis shows a stronger
decline in assortative mating among American couples with graduate degrees as compared to
those with only undergraduate degrees. Using the rich Norwegian data, we also demonstrate
that assortative mating is even stronger by post-secondary field of study (college major) than
by education level, suggesting that the choice of field of study could be an important but
neglected pathway through which individuals sort into homogeneous marriages. And lastly,
our analysis highlights the importance of using measures of educational assortative mating
that try to distinguish changes in educational assortative mating from shifts in the marginal
distributions of education. As discussed in detail later, this issue is important to understand
why Greenwood et al. (2014, 2016) conclude that educational assortative mating increased
after 1980, whereas our study suggests it changed little or declined modestly over the past
three decades.
    Our paper also contributes to a literature trying to explain or account for the rise in
economic inequality observed in many developed countries since the early 1980s. Most of
the evidence is on the factors behind the increase in earnings inequality among males. A
smaller body of work has examined the trends in household income inequality. Some studies
decompose the inequality in household income by income sources and subgroups (see e.g.
Karoly and Burtless, 1995; Cancian and Reed, 1998; Aslaksen et al., 2005; Western et al.,
2008; Breen and Salazar, 2011). Other studies use shift-share approaches to examine the
change in income inequality accounted for by changes in male and female labor earnings
distributions and changing household characteristics (see e.g. Burtless, 1999; Daly and
Valletta, 2006; Greenwood et al., 2014; Larrimore, 2014). Our study complements this
body of work by quantifying the relative importance of changes in educational composition,
returns to education, and educational assortative mating to household income inequality
over time for a broad set of developed countries. From this analysis, two new conclusions
emerge: Educational assortative mating accounts for a modest but non-negligible part of the
cross-sectional inequality in household income, and changes in assortative mating over time
barely move the time trends in household income inequality.4
   4
    These conclusions differ from those drawn in Greenwood et al. (2014). Using U.S. data, they conclude
that moving from the observed pattern of assortative mating to a random pattern has little discernable
impact on income inequality in 1960, whereas repeating this experiment for 2005 has a marked impact on
the income distribution. Additionally, they argue, that forcing men and women to sort into marriages in
2005 as they did in 1960 would generate a large drop in income inequality in 2005. Both these conclusions
are wrong. In a corrigendum titled “Corrigendum to Marry Your Like: Assortative Mating and Income
Inequality”, Greenwood et al. point out these errors. This corrigendum is dated June 2015, a year after our

   The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes our data and reports
descriptive statistics. Section 3 presents our findings on educational assortative mating.
Section 4 describes the decomposition method before using it to explore factors behind the
evolution of household income inequality. The final section offers some concluding remarks.

2     Data and Descriptive Statistics

Below we describe the data, select the estimation samples, and present descriptive statistics.
Details about data sources, sample restrictions and each of the variables are given in Appendix
B.

2.1    Data for the U.S.

Our analysis of the U.S. relies on two data sources. For the period 1962-2013, we use the
public-use March Current Population Survey (CPS). In every year, the survey covers a
nationally representative sample of households. The variables captured in the survey include
individual demographic information (such as gender, date of birth, and marital status) and
socioeconomic data (including educational attainment and income). The data contains unique
family identifiers that allow us to match spouses.
    Using the CPS data, we describe educational assortative mating and examine its impact
on household income inequality over the period 1962-2013. To study assortative mating
over an even longer period of time, we take advantage of the public-use samples from the
U.S. decennial censuses. The primary advantage of the census data is that it allows us to
describe educational assortative mating in 1940. However, spouses cannot be linked in the
1950 census, preventing us from analyzing that year. Additionally, the 1940 census does not
offer a comprehensive measure of income. For these reasons, the analysis of household income
inequality only uses the CPS data.


2.2    Data for other countries

Our analysis also uses data from Denmark, Germany, the U.K., and Norway. In each country,
we have individual demographic information (gender, date of birth, and marital status),
socio-economic data (including educational attainment and income), and family identifiers
to match spouses. For Denmark and Norway, we access administrative data containing
records for every individual and household. The Norwegian data allows us to go back to 1967,
whereas the Danish data we have access to only begins in 1980. For Germany and the U.K.,
NBER working paper was posted. While the corrigendum does not explain what caused the errors, it reports
results that are consistent with our conclusions.

                                                   5
we have to rely on survey data. The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) is an annual
longitudinal survey that covers the period from 1984 to 2013. The U.K. Labour Force Survey
(LFS) collects data biannually from 1979 to 1983, and then annually from 1984 until 2013.
However, the LFS does not ask questions about income before 1993.


2.3    Sample selection and variable definitions

Our main analysis uses information on the educational attainment and income of married
couples. In every year, the sample is restricted to married couples where at least one of
the spouses is between 26 and 60 years old.5 In our main analysis, these individuals are
assigned to one of four mutually exclusive groups according to the highest level of education
completed: high school dropouts (< 12 years of schooling); high school graduates (12 years
of schooling); individuals with some college (13-15 years of schooling); college graduates (>
15 years of schooling). Our measure of individual income consists of wages and income from
self-employment.6 In each year, we exclude individuals with missing information on income,
and set negative income to zero.7 We measure household income by pooling the individual
income of the spouses.
    In Table 1, we document key characteristics of the samples of husbands and wives in
the U.S. As expected, female labor force participation has grown over time. As a result,
the incomes of females have increased, both in absolute levels and as shares of household
income. At the same time, we can see a convergence in educational attainment of men and
women. The characteristics (and trends over time) for the full sample that also includes
singles, shown in Appendix Table A1, are qualitatively similar. Appendix Table A2 reports
the same characteristics for the samples of husbands and wives in Denmark, Germany, the
U.K. and Norway. These countries have also experienced a closing in the gender gap in higher
education and an increase in the incomes and labor force participation of women.
   5
     In a robustness check, we examine how the inclusion of singles or cohabitants affects the conclusions
about assortative mating. We also check the sensitivity of the results to restricting the sample to younger
couples where at least one of the spouses is between 26 and 30 years old in a given year.
   6
     In the U.K., however, the survey does not ask about income from self-employment (but records if people
are self-employed). We therefore exclude self-employed (and their spouses) from the U.K. sample when
analyzing household income inequality (Section 4).
   7
     Less than 1 percent of the observations in the CPS have negative income in a given year. Dropping these
observations does not affect our results.

2.4   Descriptive statistics

Before turning to the examination of educational assortative mating, we describe a few
important features of our data.
    We begin by displaying the education distributions of husbands and wives over time.
Figure 1 presents the U.S. time trends. The proportion of husbands with a college degree
starts out at around 13 percent in 1962 and increases to about 37 percent in 2013. By
comparison, only 7 percent of the wives had a college degree in 1962. Over time, however,
the educational attainment of women caught up with that of men, and the wives in 2013 are
actually more likely to have a college degree. The increase in college education is accompanied
by a substantial decline in the proportion of the population without a high school diploma.
As evident from Appendix Figure A1, broadly similar patterns are observed in Denmark,
Germany, the U.K., and Norway.
    Figure 2 shows how the closing of the gender gap in higher education is accompanied by
an increase in homogamy among the college educated. In the U.S., the share of couples in
which both spouses have a college degree increased by 22 percentage points between 1962
and 2013. This figure reveals a similar pattern for the other countries we consider, where the
proportion of couples in which both spouses are college educated has increased substantially
over time.
    Alongside the changes in the education composition of husbands, wives, and couples, a
large body of work documents significant changes in the labor market returns to education
(see e.g. Autor et al., 2008; Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). Appendix Table A3 confirms
this pattern in our data, reporting income differentials of husbands and wives from OLS
regressions of annual income on education levels (conditional on potential experience). We
see sizable income premiums for high school and college degrees in each country. Looking at
changes over time in Appendix Table A3, it is evident that the positive association between

                                                     7
income and education has been increasing in the US, especially since the 1980s.

3     Educational Assortative Mating

3.1    Baseline Estimates for the U.S.

Assortative mating is typically defined as a mating pattern in which individuals with similar
traits mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random mating
pattern. This definition suggests that educational assortative mating can be quantified
by comparing the contingency table for the wife’s and husband’s educational levels to a
contingency table generated by random matching for husbands and wives. Based on these
contingency tables, it is possible to measure marital sorting between education levels ef and
em as the observed probability that a husband with education level em is married to a wife
with education level ef , relative to the probability under random matching with respect to
education:

                                                                    P (Ef = ef , Em = em )
                                                  s (ef , em ) =                             ,             (1)
                                                                   P (Ef = ef )P r(Em = em )

                                                                         9
where Ef (Em ) denotes the education level of the wife (husband). Thus, the magnitude of
s (ef , em ) can be interpreted as the likelihood of a particular match as compared to what the
probability of the match would be with random matching. Positive (negative) assortative
mating means that men and women with education levels em and ef marry more (less)
frequently than what would be expected under a marriage pattern that is random in terms of
education: that is, the marital sorting parameter s (ef , em ) is larger (smaller) than 1 when
ef is equal to em . The joint education distribution of the spouses is fully described by the
marital sorting parameters and the marginal education distributions of wives and husbands.
    In each year, we use CPS data to estimate the sorting parameters s (ef , em ) for every
combination of education of the husbands and wives. Appendix Table A4 reports the full set
of estimates of s (ef , em ) for the U.S. in the years 1962, 1980 and 2013. Figure 3 complements
this table by displaying the time trend in the sorting parameters on the diagonal (where
husbands and wives have the same education level, ef = em ). This figure shows there is
evidence of positive assortative mating at all levels of education during the entire period
1962-2013. The time trends, however, are heterogeneous and vary depending on where in
the educational distribution one looks. We can see that assortative mating has declined
among the highly educated. In 1962, for example, Americans with a college degree were
nearly five times as likely to be married to a spouse with a college degree, compared to the
counterfactual situation where spouses were randomly matched with respect to education;
in 1980 and 2013, they were only three times and twice as likely, respectively. Conversely,
assortative mating has increased among the low educated. In 1962, Americans without a
high school degree were 1.6 times as likely to be married to one another as compared to the
probability with random mating; in 1980 and 2013, they were 2.6 and 7.2 times as likely,
respectively.
    To obtain a measure of the overall educational assortative mating, we compute the
weighted average of the marital sorting parameters along the diagonal. Figure 4 shows how
this measure of aggregate assortative mating changes over time. The results suggests that, on
average, the degree of educational assortative mating increased steadily from 1962 to the mid
1980s, after which it has changed relatively little. In both 1980 and 2013, Americans with
the same level of education were about 1.9 times more likely to be married to one another as
compared to the probability with random mating. By way of comparison, Americans in 1962
were only 1.7 times as likely to be married to someone with the same level of education as
compared to the probability with random mating.

3.2   Robustness checks

This section shows that our results are robust to employing alternative measures of assortative
mating as well as to accounting for sorting by age and changes in the probability of marriage
by education level.

Alternative measures. For continuous multivariate distributions, the univariate marginals
and the dependence structure can be completely separated and the latter may be represented
by a copula. When the marginals are continuous, any question about the dependence structure
can be answered with knowledge of the copula alone. For discrete multivariate distributions,
there exists no unique copula that summarizes all information about dependence, and many
common measures of dependence cannot be represented by a copula. Thus, it is natural to
ask how sensitive the results are to using measures of educational assortative mating other
than s (ef , em ).



                                                                                                              12
   One possibility is to use Altham’s index, which is based solely on the odds ratios.8
Applied to educational assortative mating, this index summarizes the distance between the
row-column associations in the contingency table for wife’s and husband’s educational level
and the row-column associations in a contingency table generated by random matching of
husbands and wives. Using our notation and the four categories of education, Altham’s index
can be written as:
                                                                                             1/2

                                        P (Ef = i, Em = j)P (Ef = k, Em = l)
                                                                                            |2 

where the index takes a smaller value the closer the row-column association is to what we
would observe under independence, and it is equal to zero if matches are random. It is difficult,
however, to give the Altham index a cardinal interpretation. It is also worth noticing that the
Altham index assigns the same weight to all cells in the contingency table. In comparison, the
measure of aggregate assortative mating based on s(ef , em ) focuses attention on the diagonal
where husbands and wives have the same education level. Despite these differences, the two
measures offer a similar picture of the trends in assortative mating over time. Panel (b) in
Figure 5 reports estimates of the Altham index for the U.S. during the period 1962-2013. For
comparison, Panel (a) repeats our baseline measure of aggregate sorting over the same time
period. Both measures suggest that, on average, the degree of educational assortative mating
increased steadily from 1962 to the mid 1980s, while it has changed little if anything over the
past two decades.
    Both Altham’s index and the marital sorting parameters s (ef , em ) do not impose any
ordering of the different education groups.9 There are, however, several commonly used
measures of dependence for ordered contingency tables, including Spearman’s rank-order
correlation coefficient, Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient, and Kendall’s tau
(see e.g. Nelsen, 2006; Agresti, 2010). The Spearman correlation between the education
levels of husbands and wives is simply the Pearson correlation between the rank values of
those two variables. Kendall’s tau is an alternative measure of rank correlation, given by the
difference between the number of concordant and discordant pairs (of couples) relative to the
total number of pairs (of couples).10 As a result, the Kendall correlation ranges from -1 to
   8
      Altham’s index was proposed by Altham (1970) to measure association or dependence in contingency
tables, and it is frequently used in studies of mobility with unordered variables such as occupations (see e.g.
Long and Ferrie (2013)).
    9
      Arguably, there is no uniform ordering of education levels across individuals. For example, Carneiro et al.
(2011) estimate that returns to college differ across individuals in magnitude and even sign, and that people
select into education based in part on their idiosyncratic returns.
  10
      In our setting, a pair of couples is said to be concordant if both the wife and husband in one couple have
higher education than the wife and husband in the other couple. The pair of couples is discordant, on the


                                                       13
1, and it will be closer to 1 the more similar the ranks of the spouses are in the marginal
distribution of education of husbands and wives.
    Panels (c) and (d) in Figure 5 show that both the Spearman and the Pearson correlation
coefficients suggest that educational assortative mating increased from 1962 to the 1980s. In
the 1990s, the coefficients fell somewhat, but they remained considerably larger in 2013 as
compared to 1962. Similarly, the estimates of Kendall’s tau presented in panels (e) and (f)
suggest that educational assortative mating increased until the 1980s, after which it declined
modestly. This conclusion holds true both if we consider τA , which ignores ties (i.e., pairs of
couples for which husbands or wives have the same level of education), or make adjustment
for ties, as in τB .11
other hand, if one couple has a wife with lower education and a husband with higher education as compared
to the other couple.

     See Agresti (2010) for a discussion of how to adjust for ties in computing Kendall’s tau.

Age and marriage adjustments. The baseline results in Figure 4 capture a variety of marriage
patterns, including first-time marriages among young individuals as well as divorces and
remarriages later in the life-cycle. Given that we only have repeated cross-sectional data, we
cannot investigate the dynamics of marriage and divorce. Instead, we perform a robustness
check comparing estimates of educational assortative mating in the U.S. for the full sample
(age range 26-60 in a given year) to the subsample where at least one of the spouses is between
26 and 30 years old in a given year. Appendix Figure A2 presents the results. We find
evidence of positive assortative mating at all levels of education in both samples. Moreover,


                                                                                                                                                                     15
the time trends are qualitatively the same and quantitatively quite similar across the two
samples. Among college graduates, assortative mating has been declining over time, whereas
low-educated are increasingly sorting into internally homogeneous marriages.
    Another way to take the ages of spouses into account in constructing the measure of
assortative mating is to adjust the sorting parameter in Equation (1). Let the probability
that we observe a household where the wife has education ef and age af and the husband
has education em and age am be denoted P (Ef = ef , Af = af , Em = em , Am = am ), where
Ef (Em ) and Af (Am ) denote education and age group for wives (husbands), respectively.
As before, we measure marital sorting by the ratio between the probability of observing such
a household and the probability of observing a similar household if matching is random with
respect to education, except that it is now conditional on the spouses’ ages. The martial
sorting parameter is then:

                                     P (Ef = ef , Af = af , Em = em , Am = am )
 s (ef , af , em , am ) =                                                                      ,
                       P (Ef = ef | Af = af ) P (Em = em | Am = am ) P (Af = af , Am = am )
                                                                                              (3)
where the denominator is the probability of observing this couple if matching is random with
respect to education. The expression in the denominator is derived from the fact that, under
random matching with respect to education, the wife’s education ef is not directly dependent
on the husband’s education em and age am , and the husband’s education em is not directly
dependent on the wife’s education ef and age af .
    To construct age-adjusted marital sorting parameters, we divide the sample into 144
groups. Specifically, for each gender we use three age groups in addition to the four educational
levels. The first group consists of individuals aged 37 years or younger, the second group
includes individuals between the ages of 37 and 48, and the last group consists of individuals
older than 48 years. We then estimate a full set of marital sorting parameters for all possible
combinations of age and education. In order to develop an age-adjusted measure of marital
sorting for a given combination of husband’s and wife’s education, we aggregate the age and
education specific measures across ages. Details on the age adjustment and aggregation are
presented in Appendix C. Figure 4 shows the weighted average of the age-adjusted marital
sorting parameters along the diagonal (that is, for groups where the husbands and wives
have similar education). Adjusting for age does not materially change the trends in marital
sorting.
    As a final robustness check, we modify the sorting parameter to account for changes
in the probability of marrying (conditional on age and education). For this purpose, we
now also include single men and women aged 26-60 in the sample, add separate education
and age categories corresponding to single women (no husband) and single men (no wife),

                                               16
and re-estimate the marital sorting parameters. The denominator in Equation (3) now
corresponds to the marriage patterns if both the probability of marrying and who marries
whom are independent of education. Figure 4 shows the weighted average of the marital
sorting parameter (adjusted by age and marriage propensity) along the diagonal (that is,
for groups where the husbands and wives have similar education). Adjusting for age and
marriage propensity does not materially change the trends in marital sorting.

Incorporate Cohabiting Couples The increasing tendency for couples to cohabit (instead of
marrying) could potentially affect the trends in educational assortative mating. To examine,
we perform two checks. We first exploit that cohabitation is recorded in the CPS for the years
2007-2013. This allows us to add cohabiting couples (aged 26-60) to the sample of married
couples for these years. During this period, 6.5 percent of all men and women aged 26-60 are
recorded as cohabitants. Appendix Figure A3 shows that classifying these cohabiting couples
as married does not materially change the estimates of the marital sorting parameters. The
second check we perform uses the Norwegian register data, where we have information about
cohabitation for the years 1988-2013. Appendix Figure A4 shows that the trends in the
sorting parameters over this period barely move when cohabiting couples are classified as
married.

3.3    Additional analysis

Comparison with existing research. All the measures in Figure 5 try to distinguish changes
in educational assortative mating from shifts in the educational attainment of husbands and
wives. In comparison, some studies construct measures of educational assortative mating
from regressions of the wife’s years of education (Y eduf ) on the husband’s years of education
(Y edum ):

                                       Y eduf = α + γY edum + u.                                            (4)

After estimating this regression model separately for different years, these studies interpret
the (change over time in the) coefficient on husband’s education as a measure of the (change
over time in) educational assortative mating. For example, Greenwood et al. (2014) and
Greenwood et al. (2016) use estimates of γ to study educational assortative mating in the
U.S. over the period 1960-2005.12
  12
     Greenwood et al. (2014) report three different measures of educational assortative mating for the period
1960-2005: the regression coefficient for husband’s education (γ), Kendall’s tau (τA ), and a weighted average
of the marital sorting parameters (s (ef , em )) along the diagonal. All these measures suggest that educational
assortative mating increased from 1960 to 1980. In contrast, only γ – which is confounded by changes in the


                                                      17
   For comparison, we use our data for the period 1962-2013 to estimate (4) separately for
each year. Figure 6 presents the yearly estimates of γ. In line with Greenwood et al. (2014,
2016), we find that this coefficient increases steadily over time, also after 1980. However, the
evolution of this coefficient over time does not accurately measure the changes in educational
assortative mating, as it confounds changes in the assortativeness of marriage with shifts in
the marginal distributions of education.13
   To illustrate this point, we switch the regressand and the regressor in (4), running
regressions of husband’s years of education on an intercept and wife’s years of education.
Figure 6 shows the results. While the coefficient on wife’s education declines over the time,
the coefficient on husband’s education increases over same period. The reason is that the
variance in years of education among husbands falls substantially over this time period
(compared to the variance in years of education among wives). Comparing the results in
Figure 6 to those in Figure 5 show how changes in the marginal distributions of education, if
ignored, may lead to unwarranted conclusions about the evolution of educational assortative
mating.
marginal distributions of education – suggests assortative mating continued to increase after 1980. Indeed,
their estimate of τA actually declines somewhat from 1980 to 2005, whereas the estimated s (ef , em ) barely
moves from 1980 to 2000, after which it increases a little.
  13
     In an attempt “to control for the secular rise in the educational levels for the married population” (p.
348, 2014), Greenwood et al. allow the intercept to change from year to year (as we do by estimating eq. (1)
separately for different years). While this accounts for shifts in the means, it does not account for changes
in the variances of education – which is what confounds the interpretation of γ as measuring educational
assortative mating.

Longer time trend in educational assortative mating. While the CPS data begin in 1962,
the decennial censuses allow us to go back to 1940. In Figure 7, we compare estimates of
the overall educational assortative mating based on the censuses and the CPS. Both sets of
estimates suggest that, on average, the degree of educational assortative mating increased
steadily from the 1960s to the mid 1980s, after which it changed relatively little. What the
1940 census reveals, however, is that educational assortative mating increased considerably
prior to the 1960s. In 1940, we estimate that Americans with the same level of education
were about 1.3 times more likely to be married to one another as compared to the probability
with random mating. By way of comparison, Americans in the 1960s were 1.7 times as likely
to be married to someone with the same level of education as compared to the probability
with random mating.

Educational assortative mating by race and cohabitation status. Figure 8 presents estimates
of educational assortative mating by race. In this figure, the estimation sample is restricted
to same-race couples. Separately for white and black couples, we estimate a full set of the
sorting parameters s (ef , em ) for each year in the period 1962–2013. To obtain a measure of
the overall educational assortative mating by race, we compute the weighted average of the
race-specific marital sorting parameters along the diagonal. The patterns are qualitatively
similar for blacks and whites: Assortative mating increased gradually from 1962 to the 1980s,
after which it has changed relatively little. Among blacks, however, educational assortative
mating was relatively low in 1962, but this group experienced a relatively large increase in
the assortativeness of marriages until the mid 1980s. In Appendix Figure A5, we explore
the differences by race further, presenting race-specific sorting parameters by educational
level. The time trends are qualitatively similar by the level of education: For both groups,
assortative mating has been declining over time among college educated, whereas low-educated
are increasingly sorting into internally homogeneous marriages.

    In Appendix Figures A3, we report estimates of educational assortative mating for married
and cohabitants. We only perform this analysis for the years 2007-2013, since this is the
period in which we observe cohabitation in our data. Overall, educational assortative mating
is relatively similar for cohabitants as compared to married couples. A notable exception is
the sorting among the low educated which is less pronounced for cohabitants as compared to
married couples. In Appendix Figure A6, we disaggregate educational assortative mating
by race and cohabitational status. The prevalence of cohabitation is much higher among
blacks (12.9 percent of all black couples) as compared to whites (8.1 percent of all whites
couples). However, the differences in educational assortative mating between married and
cohabitants do not vary significantly by race. Thus, the relatively high cohabitation rate
among blacks contributes to lower assortative mating among low educated blacks as compared
to low educated whites.

Educational assortative mating across countries. A natural question is whether our findings
about educational assortative mating are specific to the U.S. or if they generalize to other
developed countries. To investigate this question, we examine assortative mating in Denmark,


                                                                                                             21
Germany, the U.K., and Norway. The data available in each of these countries allow us to
study educational assortative mating over several decades.
    For each country and every year, we estimate the sorting parameters s (ef , em ) for all
possible combinations of education of the husbands and wives. Figure 9 displays the time
trends in the sorting parameters on the diagonal (where husbands and wives have the same
education level). The estimates correspond to those in Figure 3, except we are now using
data for countries other than the U.S. In each country, we find evidence of positive assortative
mating at all levels of education. In addition, the time trends are qualitatively similar across
countries: Among college graduates, assortative mating has been declining over time, whereas
low educated are increasingly sorting into internally homogeneous marriages. Comparing
across countries, the increase in assortative mating among low educated is strongest in the
U.S. By comparison, assortative mating among college graduates has declined more in the
U.K. and Norway as compared to the U.S.

Educational assortative mating among the college educated. So far, we have focused ex-
clusively on assortative mating by education levels. However, the type of education that
people acquire is potentially as important as their level of education. For example, the
earnings differences observed across college majors rival the earnings gap between individuals
with and without a college degree (see e.g. Altonji et al., 2012; Kirkeboen et al., 2016).
While neither the CPS data nor the censuses offer information about college major, they do
make a distinction between undergraduate and graduate degrees. This allows us to split the
college graduates category into two subcategories according to whether college graduates
have undergraduate or graduate degrees. Using this new classification with five education
groups of the husbands and wives, we estimate a full set of sorting parameters s (ef , em ) for
all combinations of ef and em .
    Appendix Figure A7 displays the time trends in the sorting parameters for couples with
undergraduate degrees and couples with graduate degrees. We can see that assortative
mating declined for both types of college educated. In 1962, for example, Americans with
an undergraduate college degree were 4.2 times as likely to be married to a spouse with an
undergraduate college degree, compared to the counterfactual situation where spouses were
randomly matched with respect to education; in 1980 and 2013, they were only 3.0 and 1.9
times as likely, respectively. The decline in assortative mating has been even more pronounced
among couples with graduate degrees. In 1962, Americans with a graduate degree were 8.4
times more likely to be married to one another as compared to the probability with random
mating; in 1980 and 2013, they were about 5.2 and 3.1 times more likely, respectively.
    While the U.S. data do not allow us to look more closely at educational assortative mating

Figure 9. Trends in Assortative Mating by Educational Level and Country
Notes: This figure displays the time trends in the marital sorting parameters s(ef , em ) for which the husbands
and wives have the same education level, by country. Source: Danish registry data (1980-2013); SOEP
(Germany, 1984-2013); LFS (U.K., 1979-2013); Norwegian registry data (1967-2013). Sample: Married couples
aged 26-60.

among the college educated, the rich Norwegian data record post-secondary field of study.
This allows us to split the college category into nine mutually exclusive sub-categories by
post-secondary field of study. In line with previous evidence, Appendix Table A5 shows that
medicine, law, engineering, science and business command high income premiums, whereas
individuals with humanities, nursing and education degrees tend to have relatively low income.
It is also notable that these income differentials have become more pronounced over time.
Figure 10 displays the sorting parameters for couples with the same field of study. This figure
reveals that assortative mating is much stronger by field of study than by education level.
The assortativeness is strongest for law and medicine, the fields with the highest economic
returns. In 1967, for example, a graduate in law was 73 times as likely to be married to a
college graduate with a law degree, compared to the counterfactual situation where spouses
were randomly matched. By comparison, college graduates as a whole were only 6.5 times
as likely to be married to one another as compared to the probability with random mating.
The assortative mating by field of study declines over time but remains sizable. In 2013,
graduates in law were still 26 times as likely to be married to one another, relative to the
probability under random matching. Taken together, the findings from Norway suggest that
the choice of post-secondary field of study could be an important but neglected pathway
through which individuals sort into internally homogeneous marriages.

4     Determinants of household income inequality

4.1    Decomposition method

To quantify the contribution to household income inequality of changes in returns to education,
educational composition and educational assortative mating, we adopt the decomposition
method proposed by DiNardo et al. (1996). This approach produces income distributions
under counterfactual scenarios where the distribution of one factor is fixed at a base year,
while the other factors vary over time.
   The joint distribution of household income and couples’ education in year t is FY,X (y, x|t),
where y denotes household income and x denotes the couples’ educational attainments Ef ,
Em . The distribution of income in year t is given by:
                                                  Z
                                FY (y|t) =            FY |X (y|x, t) dFX (x|t) ,                     (5)

where FY |X (y|x, t) is the conditional distribution of income for couples with characteristics
x in year t (i.e. the returns to education) and FX (x|t) is the joint distribution of spouses’
education in year t.
    To define the counterfactual scenarios, let ty denote the year in which the economic returns
are measured, tx denotes the year in which the couples’ educational attainments are measured
and ts denotes the year the marital sorting parameters are measured. Depending on when
we measure these three factors, we obtain different counterfactual scenarios. In general, the
income distribution under a counterfactual scenario is given by:
                                           Z
                 F̃Y (y|ty , tx , ts ) =       FY |X (y|x, ty ) Ψx (x|ty , tx , ts ) dFX (x|ty ) ,   (6)

where Ψx is a re-weighting function defined as,

                                                               dFeX (x|tx , ts )
                                   Ψx (x|ty , tx , ts ) =                        ,                   (7)
                                                                dFX (x|ty )

where dFeX (x|tx , ts ) denotes the joint distribution of spouses’ education that would have
occurred if the couples’ educational attainments are measured in tx and the marital sorting
parameters are measured in ts .
   In the empirical analysis, we hold the distribution of one variable fixed at base year t0 ,
while we let the distributions of the other factors to vary over time. This informs us about
how household income inequality is affected by changes in that variable over time. In the case
of marital sorting, we construct the counterfactual income distribution if couples matched


                                                          25
according to the sorting parameter in base year t0 . For example, F̃Y (y|ty = t, tx = t, ts = t0 )
represents the income distribution in a scenario where the returns to education and the
educational composition are measured in year t, whereas the marital sorting parameters are
measured in year t0 . By comparing this counterfactual income distribution to the actual
income distribution in year t, we are able to assess how household income inequality is affected
by changes in educational assortative mating between year t0 and t.
    To obtain the counterfactual income distribution, we estimate the re-weighting function
as:
                                                         P̃ (x|tx , ts )
                                 Ψ̃x (x|ty , tx , ts ) =                 ,                   (8)
                                                           P (x|ty )
where P (x|ty ) denotes the proportion of couples with educational attainments x = {ef , em }
in year ty , and the counterfactual P̃ (x|tx , ts ) is the proportion of couples who would have
had characteristics x if the marginal distributions of education of husbands and wives were
as in year tx and couples matched according to the marital sorting parameter of year ts . The
stochastic matching procedure used to estimate the counterfactual proportion is described in
Appendix D.
    We construct income distributions under alternative counterfactual scenarios, including
keeping the marital sorting parameter used to match couples, the education distribution of
men and women, or the economic returns to education, fixed at base year t0 .



4.2   Assortative mating and household income inequality in the U.S.

Figure 11 graphs household income inequality over time in the U.S. This figure measures
inequality according to the much used Gini coefficient. The solid line shows the growth in
household income inequality, while the dashed line give the time trends in household income
inequality for a counterfactual scenario in which all the marital sorting parameters s (ef , em )
are set equal to one; this means that men and women with the same level of education marry
as frequently as what would be expected under a marriage pattern that is random in terms
of education.
    As expected, assortative mating leads to an increase in household income inequality.
For example, educational assortative matching increased the Gini coefficient in 2013 by 5
percent, from 0.412 to 0.432. How large is such an increase in inequality? Abstracting from
behavioral responses, a 5 percent increase in the Gini coefficient corresponds to introducing
an equal-sized lump sum tax of 5 percent of the mean household income and redistributing
the derived tax as proportional transfers where each household receives 5 percent of its income
(Aaberge, 1997). Interpreted in this way, a key insight from Figure 11 is that educational


                                               26
assortative mating has a non-negligible impact on the distribution of household income in
the U.S.

different parts of the distribution of household income. The 90/10 ratio measures the income
at the 90th percentile of the household income distribution relative to that of the 10th
percentile, while the 90/50 and 50/10 ratios illustrate whether an increase in the 90/10 ratio
is due to the rich getting richer or the poor getting poorer. We compare the percentile
ratios in the actual distribution of household income to those that would have occurred if
husbands and wives are randomly matched with respect to education. The results suggest that
assortative mating matters most for inequality in the lower part of distribution, particularly
at the beginning of the period we investigate.

4.3   Evolution in household income inequality in the U.S.

We now examine the importance of various factors for the time trend in household income
inequality in the U.S., including changes in educational assortative mating (Figure 12),

                                                                   27
returns to education (Figure 13), and educational composition (Figure 14). Each figure
compares the actual evolution of household income inequality to the counterfactual levels of
inequality, where we hold the distribution of one factor fixed at its level in 1962 while we let
the distributions of the other factors vary over time. Appendix Figure A8 shows that the
conclusions from the decomposition analysis are relatively robust to whether we use 1962,
1984 or 2013 as the base year.
    Figure 12 suggests that changes in assortative mating over time matter little for the time
trends in household income inequality. This finding refutes the widespread view that changes
in assortative mating have led to a rise in household income inequality. The Gini coefficients
in the actual and the counterfactual distribution of household income barely differ.

   Figure 13 shows that increases in the returns to education seem to be a key driver behind
the rise in household income inequality. Indeed, the decomposition analysis suggests that
the Gini coefficient in household income would have been steadily declining if the returns to
education had remained at their levels in 1962. In 2013, for example, the Gini coefficient is
predicted to be 25 percent lower in the absence of changes to the returns to education. This

                                                                 28
reduction in the Gini coefficient corresponds to introducing a 25 percent proportional tax
on income and then redistributing the derived tax revenue as equal sized amounts to the
households (Aaberge, 1997). This finding suggests that changes in the returns to education
are not only important in explaining the growth in income inequality among males (see e.g.
Autor et al., 2008; Acemoglu and Autor, 2011), but also a key factor behind the rise in
household income inequality over the past few decades. Appendix Table A7 demonstrates
that the lower part of the household income distribution has been most influenced by changes
in education returns. For example, if the returns to education remained at their levels in
1962, we estimate that the 50/10 ratio would have been 47 percent lower in 2013 (a reduction
from 4.17 to 2.23), whereas the 90/50 ratio would have been 15 percent lower (a reduction
from 2.27 to 1.92).

   Figure 14 suggests that changes in the educational composition offset some of the increase
in household income inequality. The decomposition results suggests that over the period
1962-2013, Americans would have experienced a 55 percent larger increase in inequality if the
education distributions of husbands and wives were as in 1962. In 2013, for instance, we find

                                                                  29
that the Gini coefficient would have been 12 percent higher in the absence of the changes
in educational composition. These compositional effects are distinct from the standard
price effects that are often invoked to explain changes in inequality (see e.g. Juhn et al.,
1993; Lemieux, 2006). Holding returns to education constant, changes in composition can
mechanically raise or lower income inequality by changing the population shares of different
education groups. Appendix Table A8 shows that it is primarily the lower end of the household
income distribution that has benefited from the changes in the educational composition.

4.4   Robustness checks

We performed several specification checks to examine the robustness of the decomposition
results.

Adjusting for age. We perform two checks to examine the sensitivity of the results to
accounting for age in the measurement of marital sorting. The first restrict the sample to
couples where at least one of the spouses is between 26 and 30 years old in a given year.

                                                                 30
Appendix Figure A2 shows that the estimates of educational assortative mating are quite
similar for this subgroup as compared to the full sample. Appendix Figure A9 shows that
also the decomposition results are quite robust to restricting the sample to young couples in
a given year.
    As a second robustness check, we use the full sample but assign individuals to groups by
the combination of their gender, education, and age. For each gender, we use the three age
categories in addition to the four educational levels, dividing the sample into 144 mutually
exclusive groups. By comparison, the baseline specification – where we abstracted from age
– gives 16 mutually exclusive groups. Except for the additional groups, we use the same
decomposition method as outlined above. Appendix Figure A10 shows that the decomposition
results barely move when we account for age in the measurement of marital sorting.

Adjusting for changes in marriage propensity. We also check if our results are robust to
accounting for changes over time in the likelihood of getting married according to the age
and education of males and females. For this purpose, we also include single men and
women aged 26-60 in the sample. This allows us to characterize each individual by their
age, educational level, gender and marital status. The inclusion of singles adds another
gender-specific sorting parameter for each age and educational group, which represents not
being married. Individuals in groups in which this parameter is larger than one are more
likely to be single than an average individual.
    In a counterfactual joint distribution of the household’s characteristics, we now let the
marginal distribution of education and age as well as the gender-specific probability of
being married vary over time. However, couples are matched according to marital sorting
parameters of year ts , which take into account both the relative probability for being married
at all (based on gender, age and education) and who an individual is likely to be married to.
    To directly compare the robustness check to the main results, we exclude singles from the
actual and counterfactual income distributions. The results from this analysis are presented
in Appendix Figure A11. It is reassuring to find that accounting for changes in the probability
of being married by education level do not affect our conclusion: Changes in assortative
mating over time continue to barely move the time trends in household income inequality.
    We further report results for the entire sample of married and single households.14 The
results from this analysis are presented in Appendix Figure A12. Panel (e) displays trends in
household income inequality when keeping the probability of being married at a given age
fixed as in a base year. This counterfactual allows us to investigate how the rise in singlehood
  14
     To adjust for differences in household size, household income is equivalized using the EU scale. The EU
scale divides total household income by the sum of 1 for the first adult; 0.5 for each other adult; and 0.3 for
each child under the age of 14.


                                                      31
and delay in timing of marriage may have affected household income inequality. Results
suggest that the Gini coefficient in 2013 would have been about 7 percent lower if people
married at the same rate and at the same age as in 1962.

Robustness to categorization of education. Appendix Figure A13 examines the impact of
making a distinction between undergraduate and graduate degrees. We split the college
graduates category into two subcategories according to whether college graduates have
undergraduate or graduate degrees. Except for the additional groups, we use the same
decomposition method as outlined above. We find that the conclusions about household
income inequality are not materially affected by whether or not we make a distinction between
undergraduate and graduate degrees.
    Appendix Figure A14 uses the rich Norwegian dataset to assess how accounting for
heterogeneity by post-secondary field of study affects the evidence on the determinants of
household income inequality. This figure shows that the conclusions about the evolution
of household income inequality in Norway hold: Changes in educational composition and
returns to education remain the key factors, while educational assortative mating continues
to play a minor role. This finding is reassuring given that one cannot link spouses in the U.S.
data with information on post-secondary fields of study.

4.5     Evidence from countries other than the U.S.

Section 3.3 showed a common pattern in educational assortative mating across the countries
for which we have data. This section shows that the same holds true for the conclusions
about household income inequality. For each country, we use the same decomposition method
as outlined in Section 4.1. To easily compare the results across countries, we choose common
base years, 1984 and 2013. The reason we select these base years is that they are the first
and last time period for which we have data for nearly all countries.15
    Figure 15 graphs the time trends in household income inequality as measured by the Gini
coefficient. The solid lines show the growth in household income inequality, while the dashed
lines give the time trends in household income inequality for a counterfactual scenario in
which all the marital sorting parameters s (ef , em ) are set equal to one; this means that men
and women with the same level of education marry as frequently as what would be expected
under a marriage pattern that is random in terms of education. As expected, assortative
mating leads to an increase in household income inequality in all countries.
    Next, we examine the importance of various factors for the time trends in household
income inequality, including changes in educational assortative mating (Appendix Figure
  15
       The only exception is the U.K. for which we lack income data prior to 1993.

A15), returns to education (Appendix Figure A16), and educational composition (Appendix
Figure A17). Each figure compares the actual evolution of household income inequality to the
counterfactual levels of inequality in a country, where we hold the distribution of one factor
fixed at its level in 1984 or in 2013, while we let the distributions of the other factors to vary
over time. Consistent across countries, we find that changes in assortative mating over time
matter little for the time trends in household income inequality. By comparison, changes in
the returns to education over time are a key factor behind the evolution of household income
inequality.


5   Summary and discussion of results

This paper documented the degree of educational assortative mating, how it evolves over time,
and the extent to which it differs between countries. Our analysis focused on the U.S. but also
used data from Denmark, Germany, the U.K., and Norway. We found evidence of positive
assortative mating at all levels of education in each country. However, the time trends vary by
the level of education: Among college graduates, assortative mating has been declining over
time, whereas low educated are increasingly sorting into internally homogeneous marriages.
    These findings motivated and guided a decomposition analysis, where we quantified
the contribution of various factors to the distribution of household income. We found
that educational assortative mating accounts for a non-negligible part of the cross-sectional
inequality in household income in each country. However, changes in assortative mating
over time barely move the time trends in household income inequality. This is because the
inequality contribution from the increase in assortative mating among the low educated is
offset by the equalizing effect from the decline in assortative mating among the highly educated.
By comparison, increases over time in the returns to education generate a considerable rise
in household income inequality, but these price effects are partly mitigated by increases in
college attendance and completion rates among women.
    In interpreting these results, it is important to keep in mind the descriptive nature of
our analysis. While our study carefully describes educational assortative mating over time
and across countries, it is silent on the causes of sorting in marriage. The observed sorting
patterns can arise due to several distinct reasons. First, sorting can arise due to search
frictions, independent of preferences. For example, sorting along educational attainment
might not reflect a preference for a spouse with a certain education level, but rather that
people could be more likely to meet someone with a similar level of education in school,
college, or at work. Alternatively, sorting can arise in the absence of any search frictions as




                                               34
an equilibrium outcome of preferences and the market mechanism.16
    Quantifying the importance of the many possible causes of assortative mating is difficult
given our data, and it is, therefore, beyond the scope of the paper. Chiappori and Salanié
(2016) review the literature on assortative mating, concluding that given only data about
matching patterns, it is hardly possible to distinguish between models with frictions and
models with unobserved heterogeneity. Given this identification challenge, empirical models
of assortative mating typically considers a frictionless environment (see e.g. Choo and Siow,
2006). For example, recent work by Chiappori et al. (2017) interpret changes in educational
assortative mating over time through the lens of a frictionless matching framework with
transferable utility. The paper attributes changes in matching patterns to changes in the
additional surplus generated by assortativeness, which in turn are driven by increasing returns
to human capital.
    In reality, the observed sorting patterns could reflect both search frictions and spouse
preferences. Hitsch et al. (2010) try to side-step this identification challenge by examining
sorting in the setting of online dating. The authors argue that this setting provides a unique
opportunity to study the causes of assortative mating, in part due to search frictions being
minimal but also because researchers observe both the choice sets faced by the users and
the decisions they make from these choice sets. Hitsch et al. (2010) begin by estimating the
extent to which the actual matches achieved at an online dating site can be explained by
preferences alone. Their estimates suggest that preferences are a key cause of sorting. Next,
the authors use these estimates to form predictions for offline matches, i.e., marriages. The
predicted sorting patterns are qualitatively, and for some attributes also quantitatively, quite
similar to the actual sorting patterns in marriages. The authors argue the degree to which
they underpredict sorting along some attributes—education in particular—is consistent with
search frictions. Another possible explanation for the prediction errors is that the preferences
expressed in the setting of online dating may not be generalizable to the marriage context of
the whole population.
    Our decomposition method is also best understood as a descriptive approach, where
observed outcomes for one group are used to construct counterfactual scenarios for another
group. In constructing these scenarios, we follow the literature on decomposition methods
in abstracting from potentially important partial equilibrium considerations (e.g. self-
selection into education by comparative advantage) and general equilibrium conditions (e.g.
  16
    For example, people may prefer a spouse with the same education, in which case sorting is due to
“horizontal” spouse preferences. Alternatively, preferences might be purely “vertical,” in the sense that
everyone ranks all potential spouses in the same way. In the equilibrium of a frictionless market, the ranks of
the matched men and women will then be perfectly correlated. If the ranks are monotonically related to the
spouse’s education level, there will also be sorting by education.

simultaneous determination of education distributions and returns). As a result, we are
reluctant to give the decomposition a strict causal interpretation or explore mechanisms that
may lead to the patterns we find. We rather think of our analysis as an accounting exercise
of the contribution of different factors to inequality. Interpreted in this way, an insight from
our analysis is that changes in assortative mating may account for relatively little of the
rise in household income inequality. An important question for future research is how the
conclusions about educational assortative mating and household income inequality might
change if one tries to model the joint determination of pre-marital schooling, female labor
force participation and marriage patterns of men and women while accounting for search
frictions. Greenwood et al. (2016) and Chiappori et al. (2017) make important progress on
this question, assuming a frictionless marriage market. However, unless search frictions or
other limitations on choice sets are carefully considered, interpretation of preferences based
on actual matching patterns could be misleading.

Figure A15. Household Income Inequality and Changes in Educational Assorta-
tive Mating - Denmark, Germany, the U.K., and Norway
Notes: This figure displays actual and counterfactual time trends in household income inequality, by country.
The solid lines show the Gini coefficient in the actual distribution of household income. The dotted (dashed)
lines show the Gini coefficient in a counterfactual scenario where spouses are matched with respect to the
1984 (2013) marital sorting parameters, while we let the distributions of the other factors vary over time.

Figure A16. Household Income Inequality and Changes in Returns to Education
- Denmark, Germany, the U.K., and Norway
Notes: This figure displays actual and counterfactual time trends in household income inequality, by country.
The solid lines show the Gini coefficient in the actual distribution of household income. The dotted (dashed)
lines show the Gini coefficient in a counterfactual scenario where the returns to education are kept fixed at
their levels in 1984 (2013), while we let the distributions of the other factors vary over time.Source: Danish

Notes: This figure displays actual and counterfactual time trends in household income inequality, by country.
The solid lines show the Gini coefficient in the actual distribution of household income. The dotted (dashed)
lines show the Gini coefficient in a counterfactual scenario where the education distributions of husbands and
wives are kept fixed at their levels in 1984 (2013), while we let the distributions of the other factors vary
over time. Source: Danish registry data (1980-2013); SOEP (Germany, 1984-2013); LFS (U.K., 1979-2013);

Table A3. Income Differentials by Education Level
Notes: This table reports OLS estimates of annual income on education level and potential experience
(linearly and squared), with standard errors in parentheses. Sample consists of married individuals with
positive income aged 26-60 (individuals with zero income are included in the Danish sample). Each column is
a separate regression. Potential experience is defined as age - years of education - 6. Excluded education level
is no high school degree. Dependent variable is the annual income expressed in 2014 USD. College premium
is the percent increase in average predicted earnings for 40 year olds with college degree as compared to 40
year olds with high school degree or some college. Source: CPS (U.S., 1967-2013); Danish registry data (1984,

position
Notes: This table displays measures of household income inequality, both for the observed income distribution
and for income distributions when education distributions of husbands and wives are kept fixed at their levels
in 1962, 1984 or 2013. Standard errors (in parentheses) are based on bootstrapping with 100 replications.

B     Data

B.1   Denmark

Our results for Denmark are based on registry data from 1980 to 2013. The mapping of
years of education to educational categories is similar as the one used for the U.S., with
two exceptions. Due to the system for vocational education at the upper secondary level,
individuals with 12 to 13.5 years of schooling are classified as having a “High school degree”.
Individuals with 15 years of education are classified as having a “college degree” as this
corresponds to a Bachelor’s degree in Denmark. Household income is the sum of wages and
income from self-employment for the husband and the wife.

B.2   Germany

We use the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for each year 1984 to 2013. The SOEP is
a longitudinal panel where the same households are followed year after year. The sample is
weighted to be representative of the West-German population until the reunification in 1990,
and for reunified Germany afterwards. Household income is the sum of wages and income
from self-employment for the husband and the wife.
    The mapping of years of education to educational categories is similar as the one used
for the U.S. We separate between less than high school, high school and more than high
school. The latter is classified as a college degree for individuals that have completed at least
15 years of education. Note that the educational system in Germany is characterized by a
relatively high fraction of individuals with vocational degrees at the upper secondary level
and a relatively low fraction of individuals with tertiary education.

B.3   The U.K.

The Labour Force Survey (LFS) was carried out in 1979, 1981 and each year starting
in 1983. The last year we have data from is 2013. The sample is representative of the
U.K. population and is restricted to individuals aged 26-60 years and their spouses. We
drop individuals if the information about education or spousal identifier is missing. The
resulting sample, the education sample, is used to calculate marginal and joint distributions of
education. In addition, since the survey started collecting information about income in 1993,
we are constrained to using data from that year onward in the decomposition analysis. The
household’s income is the sum of the husband’s and the wife’s gross weekly pay in the main
job and gross weekly pay in the second job. Income from self-employment is not reported
in the LFS. Households with missing information on income are excluded when analyzing
household income inequality (Section 4).
    Classification of education in the U.K. data is based on various qualifications which are not
directly translated into years of education. Individuals with no qualifications are categorized
as having “No high school degree”. “High school degree” includes “GCSE A-C or equivalent”
and “CSE below Grade 1 or Equivalent”. “Some college” includes “A-level or Equivalent”.
“College degree” includes “Bachelor’s Degree or Equivalent” and “Above Bachelor’s Degree”.
Individuals with unknown or uncategorized qualifications are assigned a level depending on
the age when education was completed.

B.4   Norway

Our analysis employs several registry databases from 1967 to 2013, that are maintained by
Statistics Norway. The data contains unique family identifiers that allow us to link spouses.
To enhance comparability with the other countries, we construct a measure of individual
income which consists of wages and income from self-employment. In each year we exclude
individuals with missing information on income, and set negative incomes to zero. Household
income is measured by pooling the individual income of the spouses.
    Educational attainment is reported by the educational establishment directly to Statistics
Norway, thereby minimizing any measurement error due to misreporting. We have information
not only about years of schooling and highest completed degree, but also field of study or
academic major in post-secondary education. To enhance comparability between the education
systems in the U.S. and Norway, we make two adjustments to the definition of education
levels based on years of schooling. In Norway, certain types of high school degrees require only
10 or 11 years of schooling; we count individuals with these degrees as high school graduates.
Several bachelor degrees in Norway only take three years of post-secondary study; we record
all individuals with a three year or more post-secondary credential as college graduates.
C    Adjusted Measures of Educational Assortative Mating

We begin by showing how we refine the measures of marital sorting to take spouses’ age into
account. The martial sorting parameter in Equation (3) is the ratio of the probability of
observing a couple where the wife has education ef and age af and the husband has education
em and age am , relative to the probability of observing this couple if matching is random with
respect to education. Let the probability that a household has characteristics ef , af , em , am
be denoted P (ef , af , em , am ), which can be rewritten as P (ef , em | af , am ) P (af , am ). If: (1)
the wife’s and husband’s educations ef and em are conditionally independent given ages af
and am , and (2) ef (em ) is independent of am (af ), then the denominator in Equation (3) is:

                  Pe random (ef , af , em , am ) = P (ef | af ) P (em | am ) P (af , am ) .              (C1)

     In our analysis, we construct an education-specific measure of sorting as the weighted
average of the education- and age- specific measures. For educations ef , em , the age group
af , am is weighted by:

                                                                                P (af , am )
                    w (af , am |ef , em ) = P (af | ef ) P (am | em )                          .         (C2)
                                                                               P (af ) P (am )

The first two terms on the right hand side give us the expected share of couples with ages
af , am among those with educations ef , em , if individuals matched randomly with respect
to age. This share is multiplied with the “assortative mating parameter” of the age group
af , am . This product is approximately the share of couples with ages af , am , among those
with educations ef , em , if sorting on age is as in the overall sample. The sorting parameter
for education levels ef and em is then:

                                   XX               w (af , am |ef , em )
                 s̃ (ef , em ) =                                              s (ef , af , em , am ) .   (C3)
                                                     am w (af , am |ef , em )
                                           P        P
                                   af am       af


Positive (negative) assortative mating would mean that men and women with the same level
of education match more (less) frequently than what would be expected under a matching
pattern that is random in terms of education: that is, the marital sorting parameter s̃ (ef , em )
is larger (smaller) than one when ef is equal to em . Our main analysis reports an overall
measure of sorting as the average parameter for all groups where the husbands and wives
have similar education. That is simply given by:

                                     X     P (Ef = e) P (Em = e)
                              ŝ =         P                       s̃ (e, e) .                           (C4)
                                     e     e P (Ef = e) P (Em = e)
    In the same way, we refine the measures of marital sorting to take changes in the probability
of marriage into account. We now also include single men and women aged 26-60 in the sample,
add separate education and age categories corresponding to single women (no husband) and
single men (no wife), and re-estimate the marital sorting parameters. The denominator in
Equation (3) now corresponds to the marriage pattern if both who marries whom and who
is married at all are independent of education. That is, the parameter takes into account
both the probability of a match conditional on being married, and the probability of being
married at all.
D    Stochastic Matching Procedure

This appendix describes the stochastic matching procedure we use to estimate P̃ (x|te , ta , ts ),
which is the proportion of couples who would have had educational attainments ef , em and
ages af , am , if the distributions of education are measured in year te , the joint distribution of
age is measured in year ta , and couples are formed according to the marital sorting parameters
of year ts . This is a generalized version of the stochastic matching procedure used for our
benchmark results.
    Consider a finite number of households, N , which initially are matched according to the
distribution when assortative mating is random with respect to education. Given the fact
that matching is independent of education, the number of households with characteristics ef ,
em , af , am is:

               N 0 (ef , em , af , am ) = N · P (ef |af , te ) P (em |am , te ) P (af , am |ta ) .   (D1)

Recall that s (ef , af , em , am |ts ) is defined as the actual probability of the match relative to
the probability under random matching with respect to education. The stochastic matching
procedure re-matches the women and men in the distribution corresponding to equation (D1)
using the marital sorting parameter s (ef , af , em , am |ts ). The procedure takes two steps:
    Step 1: We draw a man and a woman from the distribution corresponding to
    Equation (D1).
    Step 2: With probability proportional to s (ef , af , em , am |ts ), the pair is matched
    and forms a household. With the inverse probability, they remain unmatched.

We repeat these steps until all men and women have achieved a match. Whenever a household
is formed we adjust the probabilities used in Step 1 as the composition of remaining men
and women changes.
    When producing the counterfactual where the probability of being married is kept fixed as
in a base year, we keep the fractions of households headed by single men, single women and
married couples fixed, while the marginal distributions of women’s and men’s education and
age are as in year t. Women and men are assigned to households using the same approach as
the one above.
