       This paper examines the strategic trade policy incentives for investment policies towards

quality improvements in a vertically differentiated exporting industry. Firms first compete in

qualities and then export to a third country market based on Bertrand or Cournot competition.

Optimal policies are asymmetric across the two producing countries. Under Bertrand competition,

the low-quality country subsidizes investment to raise export quality, while the high-quality country

imposes a tax so as to reduce the quality of its already high quality exports. Under Cournot

competition, the results are reversed with a tax in the low-quality country and a subsidy in the high-

quality country.

     Strategic Trade Policy with Endogenous Choice of Quality and Asymmetric Costs



1. Introduction

        The availability of a greater variety of products with increasing levels of world trade has

emphasised the importance of non-price competition for success in exporting. At one extreme, there

is Japan with its demanding consumers and quality oriented production culture and, at the other,

there is the emergence of lower quality, but cost competitive producers among the newly

industrialized countries (NICs). Thus success for a company can often involve the careful positioning

of products in the quality spectrum taking into account the qualities chosen by foreign rivals. The

importance of this strategy is particularly evident in the rapidly expanding, knowledge intensive

industries, such as pharmaceuticals and computer software. First, these industries often exhibit high

up-front costs of product development with subsequent low variable costs of production. Also, firms

tend to be oligopolistic because of limitations on entry due to this cost structure and an ability to

patent. In such an environment, the particular features that differentiate products are the main

determinants of success1 and a major focus of competition is at the product development stage.

        There are a number of possible motives for government policy targeted at product quality.

In particular, regulations affecting quality, such as minimum quality standards, may simply be a

response to the need for consumer protection due to asymmetric information about product quality.

Such policies may also be a means to protect domestic industry from import competition2. Other

motives, however, are needed to explain the existence of policies targeted at the quality of exports3.


1
 These features can be broadly interpreted as any attributes, including attributes of the production process
(e.g. impacts of production on the environment) that consumers care about (see Inglehart 1990).
2
 For example, the U.S. has long complained that Japanese regulations specifying detailed characteristics that
particular products must satisfy is discriminatory against imports.
3
 Quality upgrading of exports could be an indirect consequence of growth policies that generally target
investment and R&D. Our concern is with policies that specifically target the quality of exports.
Taiwan, for example, has a long standing policy to influence the quality of exports through

compulsory inspection of certain export items and the subsidization of quality control associations

in some sectors [e.g., machine tools, heavy electrical machinery, umbrellas and toys] (Wade

1990:144]). Korea has also encouraged product quality improvement in some sectors, while, as part

of the so called “Northern strategy”, it has also subsidized the marketing of certain low quality

products, thus eliminating incentives to improve product quality (Ursacki and Vertinsky 1994). In

Finland, the government subsidized product oriented R&D in paper production, offering incentives

for climbing the product quality scale in an industry which was already a world leader in the

production of high quality papers (Wilson et al. 1998). Subsidies for product quality improvement

in the newsprint industry have also been recommended in Canada, despite Canadian leadership in

quality (see Binkley 1993).

       There are various arguments as to why governments might want to raise the quality of exports

when quality levels are low. For example, Taiwan may have imposed quality controls to avoid

damage to the reputation of all its exports from the export of shoddy goods. There may also be a

motive to improve the quality of exports so as to satisfy minimum quality standards in importing

countries. However, these arguments do not explain why governments would subsidize quality

improvements for firms that are already industry leaders in quality or even discourage the

development of quality for their low quality exporters.

       This paper explores the implications of a “strategic-trade policy” or “rent-shifting” motive4

for subsidy or tax policy applied to investments in quality improvements for exported products.

There are two countries, a developed country and an LDC (lesser developed country), each with one

firm producing a quality differentiated good. To focus on strategic trade policy effects, we assume


4
 For the original work, see Spencer and Brander (1983) and Brander and Spencer (1985). Eaton and
Grossman (1986) show the importance of Bertrand versus Cournot competition.

                                                 2
that the entire production is exported to a third country market on the basis of either Bertrand or

Cournot competition. A feature of the model is asymmetry of investment costs. Thus to reflect the

disparity in investment opportunities between the LDC and developed country, we assume the LDC

faces an equal or lower productivity of investment in quality than the developed country5. If this cost

difference is sufficiently large, we are able to show that there exists a unique pure strategy

equilibrium in which the LDC exports the low quality product and the developed country the high

quality product. However, even if countries are identical as to investment costs, the two countries

will produce different qualities of products and have an incentive to pursue asymmetric policies

towards the quality of their exports. As we show, under Bertrand price competition, the low quality

producer has an incentive to subsidize investment in quality, whereas optimal policy by the high-

quality producer involves an investment tax. These policies are reversed under Cournot competition

with optimal policy involving a tax by the low quality producer and a subsidy by the high-quality

producer. Thus strategic-trade policy can explain why a country might intervene to raise the quality

of low quality exports, but it also shows that there are circumstances in which there is a motive for

less obvious policies, such as a subsidy to a high-quality producer or a tax on quality development

by a low-quality producer.

           The model structure follows Spencer and Brander (1983), except that government policy

affects positioning in product space, rather than levels of cost-reducing investment (in R&D) for

products that are fixed in nature6. Thus there is a three stage (full information) game in which

governments act first to maximize domestic welfare by committing to their subsidy or tax policy. If

both countries intervene, there is a Nash equilibrium in subsidy and tax levels. Firms then commit


5
    For the effects of asymmetric production costs see De Meza (1986) and Neary (1994).
6
Policy is very different since, for the basic model, it involves an R&D subsidy under both Bertrand and
Cournot competition (see Bagwell and Staiger 1994).

                                                     3
to their levels of investment in quality and subsequently compete (in quantities or prices). As in

Spencer and Brander (1983), the advantages of unilateral tax or subsidy policy to the domestic

country accrue from their ability to move the outcome from the Nash equilibrium in quality space

to what would have been the Stackelberg equilibrium with the domestic firm as leader and foreign

rival as the follower. Thus the policy works by influencing those actions of the rival firm that are

taken as given by the domestic firm at the Nash equilibrium.

        We also explore the implications of coordinated policy choices by the two producing nations

so as to maximize their joint welfare. With the elimination of the motive for rent-extraction from the

rival firm, this focuses policy towards exploiting consumers in the third country market.

Nevertheless, the implications of this for policies towards quality are not immediately obvious. For

Bertrand competition, a move from the Nash policies to the jointly optimal policies causes a switch

in policies for both countries, namely the LDC should tax rather than subsidize quality and the

developed country should subsidize rather than tax quality. Under Cournot competition, the jointly

optimal policy is a tax on investment in quality by both countries.

        Our assumption that the costs of quality development are sunk before the market

determination of prices and output is well established in the literature (see for example, Gabszewicz

and Thisse 1979, Shaked and Sutton 1982, 1983, Ronen 1991 and Motta 1993). However,

international trade theory has mostly concentrated on an alternative model, in which quality is chosen

simultaneously with price or output7 (see, for example, Krishna (1987) and Das and Donnenfield

(1987, 1989), Ries (993) but Herguera, Kujal and Petrakis (1999) is an exception). Also, the focus

of this international literature (including the above papers) differs from ours because of its main



7
 Since quality affects marginal production costs, this simultaneous choice model is sometimes referred to
as a “variable cost of quality model”. Similarly, since the cost of quality is fixed when prices and output are
determined, the sunk cost model has been referred to as a “fixed cost of quality model”.

                                                      4
concern with the effects of domestic import restrictions, particularly the implications with respect

to quality upgrading or downgrading8.

           In addition to the strategic trade policy results, the paper also contributes to the technical

development of the quality differentiation model. First, as previously mentioned, we introduce

asymmetric costs of development of quality and show existence and uniqueness of equilibrium for

a sufficiently large cost difference under both Bertrand and Cournot competition. We also provide

analytical proofs of concavity of profit and welfare functions with respect to quality, both for

asymmetric costs of investment and for a wider class of investment cost functions than has

previously been considered in the literature. Particularly for the Cournot case, numerical equilibrium

values have previously been used to help establish concavity (see Motta (1993) and Herguera, Kujal

and Petrakis (1999)).

           The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 sets out the structure of the game and the basic

consumer preferences and costs underlying the model of quality choice. Section 3 investigates

investment policy and quality choice under Bertrand competition whereas Section 4 develops and

contrasts the results for Cournot competition. Finally, section 5 contains concluding remarks.

2. The basic model: consumer demand and costs

           There are two firms, firm 1 located in an LDC (lesser developed country) and firm 2, in a

developed country. Each firm produces a quality differentiated product, all of which is exported to

a third country market. The game between firms involves a sub-game perfect equilibrium with two

stages of decision. In stage 1, the quality of each product is determined at a Nash equilibrium in

which each firm chooses its investment in quality so as to maximize profit taking the quality of the

other firm as given. In stage 2, the products are sold on the basis of a Bertrand-Nash equilibrium if



8
    Feenstra (1988) discusses these two approaches and provides evidence on quality upgrading.

                                                      5
price is the decision variable or a Cournot-Nash equilibrium if quantity is the decision variable. This

two-stage structure reflects the idea that price (or quantity) can be changed more easily than product

quality, which is a longer term decision. For simplicity we assume that marginal production costs

are constant and, without loss of generality, we let these costs be zero. Governments commit to

policy towards investment at stage 0, prior to the game played by firms.

        The asymmetry in investment costs across countries is reflected by the assumption that firm

2 in the developed country requires an investment F(q) to produce a product with quality q, whereas

firm 1, in the LDC requires an investment of F(q) where                 1. Otherwise, the two firms are
identical for any given value of q. Following Ronnen (1991), we assume F(q) satisfies

                          F(0) = F(0) = 0; F(q) > 0, F (q) > 0 for q > 0 and

                                  lim q →∞ F(q) = ; FK(q)  0.                                           (1)


Thus the investment cost, F(q), and marginal investment cost F(q) are strictly increasing in quality

for all q    (0, ]. Since F (q) > 0 and FK(q)  0, F(q) is strictly convex and F(q) is linear or

convex. The assumptions F(0) and F(0) help ensure that both firms enter. Two classes of functions

satisfying these restrictions9 are F(q) = aqn for n  2 and F(q) = q(eaq - 1) where a > 0.

        We use a standard model of quality differentiation (see, for example, Gabszewicz and Thisse

1979, Bond 1988, Das and Donnenfeld 1987, 1989, Tirole 1988 and Motta 1993) in which

consumers purchase at most one unit of the differentiated product. Other things being equal, all

consumers prefer a higher quality product. Letting  represent a taste parameter for quality, there is

a continuum of consumers indexed by , which is uniformly distributed on [0,1]. Consumers obtain




9
 If F(q) = aqn for n  2, then F(q) = naqn-1 > 0 and F (q) = n(n-1)aqn-2 > 0 for q > 0 and FK(q)  0. If F(q)
= q(eaq - 1), then F(q) = (1+aq)eaq - 1> 0, F (q) = a(2+aq)eaq > 0 and FK(q) = (a)2(3+aq)eaq > 0 for q > 0. In
both cases, F(0) = 0 and F(0) = 0.

                                                      6
a (linear) utility10, q, from consumption of a good with quality q and price P. Letting p         P/q for

q > 0, we also adjust the price P to reflect differences in quality. This implies a consumer surplus for

taste  given by:

                             Cs = Cs(q,p;) = q - P = q( - p) for q > 0.                             (2)

Assuming a reservation surplus of zero, consumers purchase the product only if Cs > 0, which

requires q > 0. Also since   [0,1], for any p > 0, there is a range of consumers who choose not to

buy the good.

        The two firms are free to produce the same or different qualities. Referring to the low and

high quality firms as firms L and H respectively, although we will subsequently identify firm L as

located in the LDC and firm H as in the developed country (see Proposition 1 for the Bertrand case

and Proposition 9 for the Cournot case), for the moment we do not specify which of the firms, L or

H, is firm 1 or 2. Using the superscripts L and H to indicate variables associated with firms L and

H respectively, then the quality-adjusted price is given by pL = PL/qL for the low quality product and

pH = PH/qH for the high quality product where qL  qH. We also define r        qH/qL  1 to represent the

ratio of high to low quality.

        If qL = qH, then both firms can remain in the market only if pL = pH. Since consumers would

buy the product for     (p, 1], letting xL and xH represent the quantities purchased of qualities qL and

qH respectively, this implies an inverse demand,

                             Pi = (1 - (xL + xH))qi for qL = qH and i = L,H.                           (3)

However, similar to Motta (1993), we will show that in equilibrium, qualities differ across firms for

Cournot as well as Bertrand competition. For qL < qH , let  = θ~ represent the value of the taste



10
  The results can be generalized to any concave utility function u(q), where u(q) > 0, u(q)  0. There are
no income effects since, implicitly, utility is assumed to be separable in a second homogeneous good. This
homogeneous good also acts behind the scenes to achieve trade balance.

parameter at which a consumer would purchase the differentiated good but is indifferent between

the high and low quality. Then, setting Cs(qL,pL; θ~ ) = Cs(qH,pH; θ~ ) from (2), it follows using r > 1,

that:
                               ~
                               θ   = (PH - PL)/(qH - qL) = (rpH - pL)/(r - 1).                        (4)

                                                                                                ~
The requirement Cs(qH,pH; θ~ ) > 0 implies θ~ > pH , and hence consumers with taste   ( θ ,1] buy

quality qH. Also, since Cs(qL,pL;) = qL( - pL) > 0 for  > pL and since θ~ > pH implies θ~ > pH > pL

(from (4)), there exists a range of taste parameters       (pL, θ~ ] for which consumers will buy quality

qL. Consumers for whom            [0, pL] do not purchase the quality differentiated good. Since each

consumer buys one or no units of the good, the respective demand functions for the low and high

quality products are given by

        xL = θ~ - pL = r(pH - pL)/(r - 1) and xH = 1 - θ~ = 1 - (rpH - pL)/(r - 1).                   (5)

3. Investment policy and quality choice under Bertrand competition

        Assuming Bertrand price competition at the second stage, the two-stage model of firm

behavior involving choice of quality and then sale of the good is developed in subsection 3.1.

Policies towards investment in quality are then investigated in 3.2 and 3.3 for the LDC and

developed country respectively.

3.1. The two-stage model of firm behavior: Bertrand competition.

        As is standard in these models, we start by examining price determination at the second stage

Bertrand equilibrium before considering the first stage choice of quality. Since marginal production

cost is assumed to be zero, firms L and H earn profits from production equal to their respective

revenues, given by RL = PLxL and RH = PHxH. Thus at stage 2, each firm sets its price to maximize

its revenue, taking the price of the other firm as given. Since the qualities qL and qH are committed

at the first stage, this is equivalent to choosing quality-adjusted prices, pL = PL/qL for firm L and pH


                                                      8
= PH/qH for firm H. Expressing RL = qLpL( θ~ - pL) and RH = qHpH(1- θ~ ) (from (4) and (5)) and using

 θ~ /pL = -1/(r-1) and  θ~ /pH = r/(r-1), it follows that pL and pH satisfy the first order conditions:

            RL/pL = qH(pH - 2pL)/(r - 1) = 0; RH/pH = qH[1 - (2rpH - pL)/(r - 1)] = 0,              (6)

where the second order and stability conditions are also satisfied11. As is typical for Bertrand

competition, since Ri/pi is increasing in pj for i,j = L,H and j C i, the products are strategic

complements in price space.

        Solving the conditions (6), it follows, using (4), that in equilibrium, prices are given by:

                           pL = (r-1)/(4r-1), pH = 2pL and θ~ = (2r-1)/(4r-1).                          (7)

It is notable that firm H enjoys a demand (as well as a quality-adjusted price) that is twice that of

firm L: i.e. from (5) using 1- θ~ = 2( θ~ - pL) = 2r/(4r-1) from (4) and (7),

                            xL = θ~ - pL = r/(4r-1) and xH = 1- θ~ = 2xL.                               (8)

Letting 1(r) = pLxL = pHxH /4, we can express the Bertrand equilibrium revenues of the two firms as

RL(qL,qH) = 1(r)qL and RH(qL,qH) = 41(r)qH where from (7) and (8), 1(r) = r(r-1)/(4r-1)2 and hence

                    1(r) = (2r+1)/(4r-1)3 > 0 and 1 (r) = - 2(8r+7)/(4r-1)4 < 0.                       (9)

It follows that higher quality products tend to command higher revenues, but also (as shown by 1(r)

> 0) each firm’s revenue is increased by a greater separation of products. Since in response to an

increase in r, quality adjusted prices rise and outputs fall for both firms, this latter increase in revenue

can be explained by a reduction in price competition: i.e. from (7) and (8),

             dpH/dr = 2(dpL/dr) = 6/(4r-1)2 > 0 and dxH/dr = 2(dxL/dr) = -2/(4r-1)2 < 0.               (10)

Using subscripts L and H to represent partial derivatives with respect to qL and qH respectively, since

r is increasing in qH and decreasing in qL, this implies:



 We have 2RL/(pL)2 = -2qH/(r-1) < 0, 2RH/(pH)2 = -2rqH/(r-1) < 0 and using 2Ri/(pL)(pH) = qH/(r-1) >
11

0 for i = L,H, we obtain 6 (2RL/(pL)2)(2RH/(pH)2) - (2Ri/(pL)(pH))2 = (qH)2(4r-1)/(r-1)2 > 0.

                                                     9
                             RLH = 1(r) > 0 and RHL = - 4(r)21(r) < 0.                          (11)

        Turning to the stage 1 determination of quality, we continue to keep the analysis general by

letting LF(qL) and HF(qH) represent the cost of investment in quality faced by firm L and firm H

respectively. In addition to the cost disadvantage, , in the LDC, the parameters, L > 0 and H >

0 will subsequently be interpreted as including the effects of subsidies and taxes arising from

investment policies in the two countries. Thus, the respective profits of firms L and H are given by:

               %L(qL,qH) = RL(qL,qH) - LF(qL) and %H(qL,qH) = RH(qL,qH) - HF(qH),               (12)

where RL(qL,qH) = 1(r)qL and RH(qL,qH ) = 41(r)qH. Setting qL to maximize %L taking qH as given

and setting qH to maximize %H taking qL as given, it follows from (12) that, at the Nash equilibrium

in quality, qL and qH satisfy the first order conditions:

                       %LL = RLL- LF(qL) = 0 and %HH = RHH - HF(qH ) = 0,                     (13)

where, using (9), we obtain:

                RLL = 1(r) - r1(r) = (r)2(4r-7)/(4r-1)3 > 0 for r > 7/4 and

                RHH = 4(1(r) + r1(r)) = 4r(4(r)2 -3r + 2)/(4r-1)3 > 0.                           (14)

The second order conditions are satisfied since, from (13), (14), (9) and F (q) > 0, we have

                   %LLL = RLLL - LF (qL) < 0 and %HHH = RHHH - HF (qH ) < 0,                    (15)

where RLLL = (r)21 (r)/qL < 0 and RHHH = 4(21(r)+r1 (r))/qL = - 8(5r+1)/qL(4r-1)4 < 0. Since RLLH

= -r1 (r)/qL = - RLLL/r > 0 and RHHL = - rRHHH > 0, we also obtain RLLLRHHH - RLLHRHHL = 0 and hence

                  D    %LLL%HHH - %LLH%HHL = - HF (qH)RLLL - LF (qL)%HHH > 0.                   (16)

It follows from (15) and (16) that conditional on a particular country producing the high or low

quality, the equilibrium is unique and stable.

        In deciding on quality, the firms face two basic considerations. The first is the profitability

of the location in quality space based on revenues and the cost of investment in quality for a given

distance from the rival’s quality as measured by the quality ratio, r. The second is the effect of

                                                   10
induced changes in the quality ratio, which determines the degree of price competition. For firm L,

since an increase in qL serves to reduce r (holding qH fixed), the associated increase in price

competition, tends to reduce firm L’s marginal revenue, RLL, from quality (i.e. the term r1(r) enters

negatively). Indeed, as shown by (14), RLL is positive only if the products are sufficiently

differentiated to make r  7/4. Nevertheless, for any qH, firm L has an incentive to set qL > 0, because

its marginal profit from a very low quality is always strictly positive12. Since there is no cost of

investment at qL = 0 (i.e. F(0) = 0 from (1)), this ensures that entry as a low quality producer is

always profitable and hence that both firms enter. For firm H, the prospect of reduced price

competition as r is increased, taking qL as fixed, gives an incentive to increase quality. The tradeoff

is that an increase in qH becomes increasingly costly because of the rising marginal cost of

investment in quality.

        As illustrated in Figure 1, the reaction functions, denoted qH = 'H(qL) and qL = 'L(qH ) for

firms H and L respectively, have positive slopes, making the products strategic complements in

quality space: i.e. from (14) and (15),

         dqH/dqL    - RHHL/%HHH = rRHHH/%HHH > 0; dqL/dqH       - RLLH /%LLL = RLLL/r%LLL > 0.      (17)

Thus in response to the greater price competition arising from an increase in qL, firm H eases this

competition by also increasing qH. Correspondingly, the reduced competition associated with an

increase in qH allows firm L to better position its product by raising qL. The second order and stability

conditions (15) and (16) ensure that firm L’s reaction function is steeper than for firm H and hence

that the curves cross at a unique point (shown as N). Since r = qH/qL > 1, the reaction functions both

lie above the (dotted) 45° line.



12
  Adapting Ronen (1991) for  1, since r > 7/4 as qL Ú 0 and F(0) = 0 (see (1)), it follows, using (14),
that lim L
        q →0
             %LL = lim q L →0 RLL - F(0) > 0 for any qH.

                                                   11
                          Figure 1 Quality reaction functions: Bertrand
                          competition



          Turning to the question as to which country produces which quality, for Bertrand

competition, Ronnen (1991) has shown that if the firms are identical (L = H in our setting) then

there exists a global equilibrium in which the unique qualities (qL,qH) can be produced by either firm.

Thus there are two pure-strategy equilibria depending on which firm produces which product. For

asymmetric firms, we show in Proposition 1 that the second, “switched” equilibrium, in which firm

1 in the LDC produces qH and firm 2, in the developed country, produces qL can be ruled out by

setting    sufficiently large. For this result, it is important that investment costs increase sufficiently

fast with quality (due to F (q) > 0 and FK(q)  0) that the LDC firm does not leapfrog its quality

above the high quality produced by firm H.

Proposition 1. Assume Bertrand price competition. Under conditions (1), if              1 is sufficiently
large, there exists a unique pure strategy equilibrium in which the low quality product is produced

in the LDC and the high quality product is produced in the developed country.

Proof: See Appendix A

For the subsequent analysis, we assume that         is sufficiently large for Proposition 1 to apply and

                                                    12
hence that firm L (or firm 1) produces the low-quality product in the LDC and firm H (or firm 2)

produces the high-quality product in the developed country, country H.

3.2 LDC investment policy towards the low-quality product

        Now considering government policy committed at stage 0, this section concerns the effects

of an LDC subsidy (or tax) applied to investment in quality by firm L. We also adjust firm H’s cost

so as to include any subsidy (or tax) imposed by country H. Effects on quality levels and profits are

first developed before examining the policy that maximizes LDC welfare taking the policy of country

H as given.

        Letting sL and sH represent the proportion of the cost of investment in quality covered by the

governments in the LDC and developed countries respectively, we assume13 sL < 1and sH < 1, with

sL < 0 or sH < 0, corresponding to a tax. Thus the cost of investment for firm L is LF(qL) where L

= (1-sL) > 0 and the cost of investment for firm H is HF(qH) where H = 1-sH > 0. Letting qL =

qL(L,H) and qH = qH(L,H) represent the relationships between quality and costs, L and H, as

defined by (13), it follows that sL and sH have an indirect effect on prices through quality changes.

However, since investment costs are sunk at stage 2, there is no change in the second-stage price

equilibrium for given levels of quality.

        As shown in Proposition 2(a), an investment subsidy by the LDC increases both qL and qH,

enhancing the quality levels chosen by both firms, but since the quality ratio r          qH/qL falls, overall

the products become more similar. This follows since in response to an increase in qL (due to the

subsidy), firm H eases price competition by also increasing its quality (qL and qH are strategic

complements), but, the increase in qH is not sufficient to prevent a fall in r. From (10), quality-

adjusted prices, pL and pH then fall and outputs, xL and xH rise. Not surprisingly, as shown in


13
  Countries have no incentive to set sL  1 or sH  1, since then quality would be increased indefinitely (this
violates the first order conditions (13)).

                                                      13
2(b),firm L enjoys higher profits, but the profits of firm H are reduced.

Proposition 2. Under Bertrand competition, an increase in the investment subsidy, s L, by the LDC:

(a) raises both q L and q H, but r = q H/q L falls, increasing price competition between the firms.

(b) increases profit, % L, in the LDC and reduces % H.

Proof: (a) Since L = (1-sL ) , from (A.1) in Appendix A, we obtain

                 dqL/dsL = - F(qL)%HHH/D > 0 and dqH/dsL = F(qL)RHHL/D > 0,                      (18)

where D > 0 from (16). From dr/dqL = [(dqH/dqL) - r)]/qL and dqH/dqL = rRHHH/%HHH from (17), we

also obtain dr/dqL = rHF (qH)/%HHHqL and hence, using (18), it follows that

                      dr/dsL = (dr/dqL)(dqL/dsL) = -r H F (qH)F(qL )/D < 0.                      (19)

(b) From (12), using %LL = 0, %HH = 0, L = (1-sL), RLH > 0, RHL < 0 (see (11)) and (18), we obtain

               d%L/dsL = RLH(dqH/dsL) + F(qL) > 0 and d%H/dsL = RHL(dqL/dsL) < 0.                  (20)

                                                                                                      
        Next considering LDC welfare, since all of the good is exported, welfare in the LDC, given

by WL    %L(qL,qH;L) - sL F(qL) for L = (1-sL) , is simply the profit from these exports less the cost
of the subsidy, sL, to taxpayers. At the Nash quality equilibrium, letting sL* maximize WL taking sH

as given, we show in Proposition 3 that sL* > 0. Thus, taking account of effects on the subsequent

game played by firms, a subsidy to investment in qL raises LDC profits by more than the cost to

taxpayers.

Proposition 3. Under Bertrand competition, the LDC gains from a subsidy to investment in qL.

Proof. Using (20) and qH = 'H(qL;H) where H = 1- sH is taken as given, it follows that dWL/dsL =

[RLH(dqH/dqL) - sL F(qL)](dqL/dsL) and hence using (11) and (17)) that sL* = RLH(dqH/dqL)/ F(qL)

> 0. As shown in Proposition 4(ii) below, we have d2WL/(dsL)2 < 0 at sL = sL*.                        
        To explain this result, we first consider the choice of quality supposing that the low quality

firm is a Stackelberg leader in quality space, but there is no subsidy. Proposition 4 then shows that

                                                  14
the subsidy, sL*, maximizes the LDC’s rents from exports by shifting the equilibrium to what would

have been the Stackelberg leader-follower point in quality space14. This result follows essentially

because for any quality qL, LDC welfare is simply the profit of firm L at sL = 0: i.e. expanding WL

using (12), we have

                          WL = %L(qL,qH , ) = RL(qL,qH) - F(qL) for qH = 'H(qL).                         (21)

We assume that is sufficiently large that, as shown in Proposition 4, the LDC firm as a Stackelberg

leader would not choose to leapfrog so as to become the high-quality producer15. Proposition 4 also

demonstrates the concavity of the leader’s profit in qL and hence the local concavity of LDC welfare

at sL*.

Proposition 4. Assume Bertrand competition. (i) The subsidy, sL*, maximizes the LDC’s rents from

exports by shifting the equilibrium to what would have been the Stackelberg leader-follower point

in quality space with the low quality firm as the leader and no subsidy. For           sufficiently large, the

LDC firm does not choose to become the high quality producer. (ii) Under conditions (1), profit

%L(qL,'H(qL),L) of the leader firm is (strictly) globally concave in qL and LDC welfare, WL, is locally
concave at sL = sL*.

Proof. See Appendix A.

            Since the quality qH is increasing in qL (firm H's reaction function has a positive slope) and

since, for any qL, firm L benefits from an increase in qH (i.e. RLH > 0 from (11)), firm L as a

Stackelberg leader would increase quality qL above the Nash equilibrium level16. Consequently, in

a situation of Nash behavior by firms in quality space, the optimal policy in the LDC involves a



14
     The general principle is the same as in Spencer and Brander (1993, Proposition 3).
15
     This follows because the rate of increase in investment costs is magnified as   increases.
16
     More formally, d%L/dqL = %LL + RLH(dqH/dqL) > 0 at %LL = 0.

                                                       15
subsidy to investment in quality. Since r = qH/qL falls (see Proposition 2(a)), qualities actually

become more similar, which increases price competition, but by increasing its quality, firm L

nevertheless gains from a better positioning of its product in quality space. Fundamentally, the

subsidy corrects for the fact that, by taking qH as given, firm L sets qL too low due to its overestimate

of the increase in price competition from an increase in qL. As for the role of government, this arises

because firms are constrained by the Nash assumption that they take the rival’s quality as given. The

underlying insight of strategic trade policy is that government subsidy and tax policy can change the

incentives faced by firms at the start of the competition and hence shift the outcome to a more

favorable equilibrium from the viewpoint of the government concerned.




               Figure 2 The LDC’s optimal subsidy: Bertrand competition

        These results are illustrated in Figure 2. Starting from the Nash equilibrium at point N, the

subsidy, sL*, shifts firm L's quality reaction function to the right (shown as the dashed line), resulting

in a new Nash equilibrium at point S. This causes a net increase in LDC profit at the expense of firm

H and, as a result, the LDC moves to a higher iso-welfare contour (from L1 to L2) while country H,

                                                   16
moves to a lower iso-welfare contour (from H1 to H2). Since the contour L2, based on firm L’s

profits less the cost of the subsidy, is tangent to firm H's reaction function at S, point S also

represents the outcome if firm L were a Stackelberg leader in quality space in the absence of a

subsidy.

3.3. Developed country policy towards the high-quality product

        The effects of an investment subsidy, sH, set by the developed country, country H, are set out

in Proposition 5. As shown in 5(a), as was the case for sL , an increase in sH causes the quality of

both products to rise. However, in contrast to the effect of sL, the quality ratio r      qH/qL increases,

making the products more differentiated. This difference arises because sH works through raising qH

which directly raises r and sL works through raising qL which directly lowers r. Although the rival

firm also raises quality in each case (since qL and qH are strategic complements), the initial effect

dominates. Since r is increased, the reduced price competition results in higher quality-adjusted

prices and lower outputs for both products(see (10)).

        As shown in 5(b), the differing effects of the two policies, sL and sH, on the degree of product

differentiation also translates into differing effects on profits. Whereas an increase in sL decreases

the profit of firm H, the lessening of competition due to an increase in sH serves to boost the profits

of the rival low-quality firm. Interestingly, it is not obvious that an increase in sH raises the profit of

firm H. The problem arises because the increase in qL due to sH > 0 causes a reduction in firm H’s

revenue, which tends to offset the direct effect of the subsidy in lowering firm H’s costs. However,

using the assumptions F (q) > 0 and FK(q)  0 (from (1)), we are able to show (see Lemma 1,

Appendix A) that firm H’s profit will indeed rise. The basic intuition is that if investment costs

increase sharply with quality, this limits the extent to which both qH and qL rise, and hence causes

the direct reduction in costs from the subsidy to dominate.

Proposition 5. Under Bertrand competition, an increase in the investment subsidy, sH, to firm H:

                                                    17
(a) raises both qH and qL, but r = qH/qL increases, reducing price competition between the firms.

(b) increases the profits, %L and %H, of both firms.

Proof.(a). Since H = 1-sH , from (A.1) in Appendix A, we obtain dqH/dsH = -F(qH)%LLL/D > 0 and

dqL/dsH = F(qH)RLLH/D > 0. Then, using dqL/dqH = RLLL/r%LLL from (17), we obtain dr/dqH = -

L F (qL)/%LLLqL > 0 and dr/dsH = (dr/dqH)(dqH/dsH) > 0. (b). From (12) using %LL = %HH = 0 and
d%H/dH < 0 from Lemma 1 in Appendix A, we obtain: d%L/dsH = RLH(dqH/dsH) > 0 and d%H/dsH

= RHL(dqL/dsL) + F(qH) > 0.                                                                           
           Next, letting WH      %H(qL,qH ;1-sH) - sHF(qH) denote welfare in country H, as shown in
Proposition 6, for any given value of sL, country H has an incentive to tax the investment of its firm.

Although the tax reduces the profits of firm H, this is more than offset by the additional tax revenue.

Letting sH* < 0 represent the optimal tax, the proof assumes local concavity of WH at sH = sH*. In

Lemma 2 (see Appendix A), this condition is shown to hold for the class of investment cost

functions, F(q) = a(q)n for n  2.

Proposition 6. Under Bertrand competition, country H has an incentive to tax investment in qH

Proof. Assume d2WH/(dsH)2 < 0 at sH*. Using d%H/dsH = RHL(dqL/dsL) + F(qH), we obtain dWH/dsH =

[RHL(dqL/dqH) - sHF(qH)](dqH/dsH) and hence sH* = RHL(dqL/dqH)/F(qH ) < 0 from (17) and (11). 

           Just as in Proposition 4 concerning policy by the LDC, the tax, sH*, maximizes the rents that

country H earns from exports by shifting the equilibrium to what would have been the Stackelberg

leader-follower point in quality space with firm H as the leader and no tax17. Since the quality, qL,

set by the LDC firm is increasing in qH (firm L’s reaction function has a positive slope) and since,

for any given qH , the revenues of firm H are reduced by an increase in qL (i.e. RHL < 0 from (11)),




17
     The general point is well understood and we omit the proof.

                                                      18
the Stackelberg leader would reduce qH below the level implied by the Nash equilibrium18.

Consequently, if firms follow Nash behavior in quality space, then the optimal policy for country H

is an investment tax so as to reduce the quality, qH, produced by firm H. From Proposition 5(a), the

actual effect of the tax is to reduce the separation between qualities, which increases price

competition. Nevertheless, firm H gains from a reduction in the quality of its product.

Fundamentally, the tax corrects for the fact that, by taking qL as given, firm H sets qH too high due

to its over estimate of the effect of an increase in qH in reducing price competition.




                  Figure 3 The developed country’s optimal tax: Bertrand competition



These results are illustrated in Figure 3. Starting from the Nash equilibrium at point N, the tax, sH*,

shifts down the reaction function of firm H (shown as the dashed line), resulting in a new Nash

equilibrium at point S. As a result, the developed country moves to a higher iso-welfare contour



18
     More formally, d%H/dqH = %HH + RHL(dqL/dqH) < 0 at %HH = 0.

                                                    19
(from H1 to H3) while the LDC moves to a lower iso-welfare contour (from L1 to L3). Since H3 is

tangent to the reaction function of the LDC firm, point S also represents the outcome if firm H were

a Stackelberg leader and sH = 0.

        To explain why the policy is a tax in country H and a subsidy in the LDC, recall that firm H

gains from a reduction in the quality, qL, of its rival, whereas firm L gains from an increase in

quality, qH. Since in both cases, quality reaction functions are positively sloped, by reducing qH, the

tax in country H serves to reduce qL and conversely, by raising qL, the subsidy in the LDC serves to

raise qH. However, since the LDC would like to increase qH but country H taxes qH and since country

H would like to reduce qL but the LDC subsidizes qL, when both countries intervene, these unilateral

incentives for policy tend to undermine the goal of raising profits from exports.

        As shown in Proposition 7, the aggregate or joint welfare of the two producing countries can

be increased if LDC policy is switched to a tax on investment in qL and developed country policy is

switched to a subsidy. These joint policies raise producer welfare by taking into account the effects

of each firm’s choice of quality on its rival’s profit. Thus firm H gains from the reduction in qL due

to the LDC tax and firm L gains from the increase in qH due to the LDC subsidy. Overall, the two

policies increase the separation between the products so as to reduce price competition and better

exploit third country consumers19.

Proposition 7. Under Bertrand competition, the jointly optimal policies (sLJ ,sHJ) involve an

investment tax in the LDC and an investment subsidy in country H: i.e. sLJ = RHL/ F(qL) < 0 and

sHJ = RLH/F(qH) > 0.

Proof. See Appendix A.




19
 Since sLJ < 0 lowers qL, this may seem to suggest a broadening in market sales, but since pL rises, the range
of consumers  [ pL, 1] who purchase either variety of the good is actually reduced.

                                                     20
4. Investment policy and quality choice under Cournot competition

        We now turn to the case of Cournot competition in which firms choose quantities rather than

prices at stage 2 after committing to quality levels at stage 1. The game played by firms is set out

in 4.1 and the respective effects of LDC and developed country policies towards quality are explored

in 4.2 and 4.3.

4.1 The two-stage model of firm behavior: Cournot competition.

        Examining the second-stage first, we solve for pL = PL/qL and pH = PH/qH from the demand

functions (5), so as to obtain the inverse demand functions:

                           PL = [1 - (xL + xH)]qL and PH = [1 - xL/r - xH]qH.                         (22)

This includes the possibility that both firms set the same qualities (i.e. qL = qH), since, setting r = 1

in (22), we obtain, Pi = (1- (xL + xH ))qi for i = L,H, as in (3). Recalling that productions are zero, for

any given qualities, qL and qH , committed at stage 1, firm L sets xL to maximize its revenue, RL =

PLxL, taking xH as given and firm H sets xH to maximize its revenue, RH = PHxH , taking xL as given.

Thus from (22), xL and xH satisfy the first order conditions: RL/xL = [1- (2xL+xH)]qL = 0 and

RH/xH = [1 - (xL/r + 2xH )]qH = 0, where the second order and stability conditions are also
satisfied20. Also, since Ri/xi is decreasing in xj for i,j = L,H and i C j, the outputs are strategic

substitutes as is typical for Cournot competition.

        From the first order conditions, we obtain output levels and then quality-adjusted prices

(from (22) and (4)) at the Cournot equilibrium as follows:

            pL = xL = r/(4r-1), pH = xH = (2r-1)/(4r-1) and θ~ = (rpH-pL)/(r-1) = 2r/(4r-1).          (23)

From (23), it is notable that the quality-adjusted price equals the quantity sold of each product. Also,

since pL and xL both fall and pH and xH both rise, greater separation in quality, as shown by an


 We have 2RL/(xL)2 = -2qL < 0 and 2RH/(xH)2 = -2qH < 0 and, using 2Ri/(xL)(xH) = - qH/r = - qL <
20

0 for i = L, H, we obtain 6c (2RL/(xL )2 )(2RH/(xH)2) - (2Ri/(xL)(xH))2 = qL(4qH - qL) > 0.

                                                    21
increase in r now has mixed effects on prices and output and hence the degree of competition: i.e.

from (23),

                dpL/dr = dxL/dr = - 1/(4r-1)2 < 0 and dpH/dr = dxH/dr = 2/(4r-1)2 > 0.             (24)

Using a superscript c to distinguish functions at the Cournot equilibrium, we express the revenues

of firms L and H as RcL(qL,qH) = 7(r)qL and RcH(qL,qH) = 5(r)qH respectively, where 7(r)       (r)2/(4r-

1)2 and 5(r) = (2r-1)2/(4r-1)2 from (23) and

                       7(r) = -2r/(4r-1)3 < 0 and 5(r) = 4(2r-1)/(4r-1)3 > 0.                    (25)

Thus, holding own qualities fixed, the revenues of the two firms respond in opposite directions with

respect to an increase in r = qH/qL, with firm L’s revenue falling and firm H’s revenue rising. This

implies that revenues for firm L as well as for firm H are decreased by an increase in the rivals

quality: i.e.

           RcLH = 7(r) = -2r/(4r-1)3 < 0 and RcHL = -(r)25(r) = - 4(r)2(2r-1)/(4r-1)3 < 0.       (26)

        In contrast with the Bertrand case, firm L now gains as the products become more similar,

but, as before, firm H gains from a greater separation of qualities. To understand these results, first

note that, for both models, an increase in r, holding xL and xH fixed, shifts up the demand curve for

good H, raising the willingness of consumers to pay for the high-quality good (i.e. pH/r = xL/(r)2

> 0 from (22)), but the willingness to pay for the low-quality good is unchanged (i.e. pL/r = 0 from

(22)). Under Cournot competition, firm H responds to this higher demand due to greater separation

of products by expanding output and firm L then reacts by cutting output (xL and xH are strategic

substitutes). Since quality-adjusted price and output both fall for firm L and both rise for firm H (see

(24)), firm L’s revenue falls (holding qL fixed) and firm H’s revenue increases (holding qH fixed).

Instead, under Bertrand competition, firm H raises price in response to an increase in r and, since pL

and pH are strategic complements, firm L also raises price (see (10)) causing the revenues of both

firms to increase.

                                                  22
        Incorporating the cost of investment for general cost parameters L and H, the respective

profits of the low and high quality firms are given by:

              $L(qL ,qH) = RcL(qL,qH) - LF(qL) and $H(qL,qH) = RcH(qL,qH) - HF(qH),               (27)

where RcL(qL,qH) = 7(r)qL and RcH(qL,qH) = 5(r)qH. Thus, the Nash equilibrium qualities, denoted

qcL and qcH, respectively satisfy the first order conditions:

                      $LL = RcLL- LF(qL) = 0 and $HH = RcHH - HF(qH) = 0.                       (28)

In this Cournot case, marginal revenue with respect to own quality is always positive: i.e. from (25)

                RcLL = 7(r) - r7(r) = (4r+1)(r)2/(4r-1)3 > 0;

                RcHH = 5(r) + r5(r) = (16(r)3 - 12(r)2 +4r-1)/(4r-1)3 > 0.                         (29)

        In considering the choice of qualities, there is again a tradeoff between competition affects

arising from the extent of differentiation from the rival’s product and the profitability of a particular

location in quality space based on revenues and investment costs for a given quality ratio, r. Since

firm L gains from a narrowing of the quality gap, this gives firm L an incentive to increase qL, which

reduces r, holding qH fixed (the term -r7(r) in (29) is positive). For firm H, analogously to Bertrand

competition, a greater separation of products raises revenue leading it to also want to raise qH.

However, for both firm L and firm H, the profitability of an increase in quality is limited by the

rising marginal cost of investment in quality.

        Although positive profits can be made at the second-stage Cournot equilibrium when qL =

qH , Lemma 3 shows (see Appendix B for the proof) that even if both firms face identical costs (i.e.

if L = H), the first order conditions (28) imply that the quality game is asymmetric with qL < qH.

and hence r > 1.

Lemma 3. Assuming Cournot competition, if L  H, then q L < q H.

Letting Dc    $ LLL$ HHH - $ LLH $ HHL, we require the second order and uniqueness conditions:
              $LLL = RcLLL - LF (qL) < 0, $HHH = RcHHH - HF (qH) < 0 and Dc > 0.                  (30)

                                                   23
For firm H, we have RcHHH < 0 for r > 1. However, satisfaction of $LLL < 0 is made difficult by the

fact that marginal revenue, RcLL, increases as the products become more similar and hence RcLLL >

0: i.e. using 7 (r) = 2(8r +1)/(4r-1)4 > 0 and RcHHH = (25(r) + r5 (r))/qL for 5 (r) = - 8(8r-5)/(4r-

1)4 < 0, we obtain:

                          RcLLL = (r)27 (r)/qL > 0; RcHHH = -8(r-1)/(4r-1)4qL < 0.                    (31)

        Lemma 4 (proved in Appendix B) concerns conditions under which (30) holds locally. For

the case, F(q) = q2/2, commonly used in the literature21, we have FK(q) = 0 and Lemma 4(i) applies

for L/H  1. Letting E       qF (q)/F(q) represent the responsiveness (or elasticity) of the marginal

cost F(q) of investment with respect to quality, since F(0) = 0, the assumption FK(q)  0 (see (1))

ensures F (q)  F(q)/q and hence E  1. If E = 1 then FK(q) = 0 and Lemma 4(i) applies. However,

to allow for more general investment cost functions and for any value of L/H, Lemma 4(ii)

requires that firm L’s marginal cost of investment increases more steeply: i.e. for qL satisfying $LL

= 0, that EL     qLF (qL)/F(qL)  2. For the example22, F(q) = aqn, E = n-1 is a constant and Lemma

4(ii) applies if n  3.

Lemma 4. Assume Cournot competition and conditions (1). Then $ LLL < 0, $ HHH < 0 and D c

$LLL$HHH - $LLH $ HHL > 0 are satisfied at $ LL = 0 : (i) if $ HH = 0 , FK (q) = 0 and  L/ H  1 or
(ii) if EL 2.

        Firm H continues to view qL as a strategic complement to qH , but since RcLL is increased by

a greater similarity of products, it follows that RcLLH < 0 and hence that firm L views qH as a strategic

substitute to qL: i.e. from (29) and (31),



21
  See Motta (1993) and Herguera, Kujal and Petrakis (1999). The proof of Lemma 4 has the advantage that
it does not require a numerical solution for r = qH/qL.

 For F(q) = q(eaq - 1), using eaq > 1 and RcLL = LF(qL) > 5/27 at r = 1, we obtain EL > aqL[1+ 10L/27] >

Thus, as shown in Figure 4, firm L’s reaction function, qL = 'cL(qH), is negatively sloped in the

neighborhood of equilibrium23, whereas qH = 'cH(qL) has a positive slope; i.e. from (28), (32) and

Lemma 4,

                    dqL/dqH = - RcLLH/$LLL < 0 and dqH/dqL = - RcHHL/$HHH > 0.                           (33)




                         Figure 4 Quality reaction functions: Cournot competition


        Analogously to Proposition 1 for Bertrand competition, for a sufficiently large cost

disadvantage in the LDC, we are able to prove existence and uniqueness of the pure strategy

equilibrium (see Appendix B for the proof) in which the LDC firm produces qL and the developed

country firm produces qH. For the remainder of the paper we assume that Proposition 9 applies and

hence L = (1-sL) and H = 1-sH where sL and sH represent the investment subsidy policies by LDC

and developed countries respectively.

is produced in the LDC and the high quality product in the developed country.

4.2 LDC investment policy towards the low-quality product.

           For the Cournot setting, the effects of an investment subsidy, sL, applied to firm L by the

LDC on quality levels and profits are presented in Proposition 10.

Proposition 10. Under Cournot competition, an increase in the investment subsidy, s L, by the LDC:

(a) raises both q L and q H, but r = q H/q L falls, making the products closer substitutes.

(b) increases profit $ L of firm L and reduces profit $ H.

Proof. (a) From (B.5) in Appendix B and L = (1-sL), we obtain dqL/dsL = - F(qL)$HHH/Dc > 0,

dqH/dsL = F(qL)RcHHL/Dc > 0 and, analogously to (19), dr/dsL = -r H F(qL)F (qH)/DcqL < 0. (b)

From (27), using $HH = 0, L = (1-sL) and RcHL < 0, we obtain d$H/dsL = RcHL(dqL/dsL) < 0. Since

d$L/dL < 0 from Lemma 5 (see Appendix B) and L =                       (1-sL), we also obtain d$L/dsL =

RcLH(dqH/dsL) + F(qL) > 0.                                                                                 
           Interestingly, comparing Proposition 10 with Proposition 2 for Bertrand competition, the

direction of effects is the same. However, there are some critical differences behind the scenes, since,

as shown in Proposition 11, the LDC has a unilateral incentive to tax the investment of its firm under

Cournot competition, whereas a subsidy raises LDC welfare in the Bertrand case. For Proposition

11, we assume that LDC welfare, denoted WcL                $L(qL,qH,L) - sL F(qL), is locally concave at the
optimal policy, scL*. As shown in Lemma 6 of Appendix B, this holds for24:

                      EL    qLF (qL)/F(qL)  2 and )(q)        (F (q))2 - F(q)FK(q)  0.              (34)

Proposition 11. Under Cournot competition, the LDC has an incentive to tax investment in qL.

Proof. Assume d2WcL/(dsL)2 < 0 at sL*. Using d$L/dsL = RcLH(dqH/dsL) + F(qL), we obtain dWcL/dsL

= [RcLH(dqH/dqL) - sL F(qL)](dqL/dsL) and hence scL* = RcLH(dqH/dqL)/ F(qL) < 0 from (33) and (26).



24
     We have )(q) > 0 if F(q) = aqn for n  2 or if F(q) = q(eaq - 1).

                                                         26
                                                                                                     
       This tax policy may initially seem hard to understand, since, as can be seen from Proposition

10, the LDC tax lowers the profit of firm L and at the same time, since firm H benefits from a

reduction in qL, raises the profit of firm H and hence welfare in the developed country. However,

LDC welfare rises because the tax revenue more than offsets the loss in firm L’s profit. Also, the fact

that firm H’s profits are increased simply means that the rent-shifting aspect of the policy is entirely

at the expense of consumers in the third country market. As illustrated in Figure 5, the LDC tax shifts

the quality reaction function of firm L in towards the origin (shown by the dashed line) and both

countries move to higher iso-welfare contours.




              Figure 5 The LDC’s optimal tax: Cournot competition

       To understand why a switch from Bertrand to Cournot competition causes LDC policy to

switch from an investment subsidy to an investment tax, we again appeal to the correspondence of

the model with a Stackelberg leader-follower model in which firm L is the leader and there is no

government intervention. Since firm H raises qH in response to an increase in qL under both Bertrand

                                                  27
and Cournot competition, the fact that the revenues of firm L are increased by an increase in qH under

Bertrand competition (i.e. RLH > 0) and are reduced by an increase in qH under Cournot competition

(i.e. RcLH < 0), means that a Stackelberg leader would increase qL above its Nash equilibrium value

in the Bertrand case and reduce qL in the Cournot case25. If both firms play Nash in quality, the same

outcome is achieved by an investment subsidy in the LDC under Bertrand competition and an

investment tax under Cournot competition.

           Fundamentally, by taking qH as given at the Nash quality equilibrium, firm L overestimates

the effect of an increase in qL in making the products more similar under both forms of competition.

However, since firm L gains from a greater separation of products in the Bertrand case and from a

greater similarity of products in the Cournot case, it sets qL too low in the Bertrand case and too high

in the Cournot case for maximum profit. To correct for this, the LDC policy moves firm L (and

hence firm H) up the quality ladder under Bertrand competition and down the quality ladder under

Cournot competition.

4.3 Developed country policy towards the high-quality product

           For the Cournot setting, Proposition 12 concerns the effects of an investment subsidy, sH,

applied to firm H by the developed country. An increase in sH increases quality qH, but in contrast

to the Bertrand setting, firm L’s reaction function has a negative slope and qL falls. As might be

expected, Firm H enjoys higher profits, but firm L’s profits are reduced.

Proposition 12. Under Cournot competition, an increase in the investment subsidy, s H, to firm H:

(a) raises q H but reduces q L, causing r = q H/q L to rise. (b) increases profit % H, but reduces % L.

Proof. (a). From (B.5) in Appendix B and H = 1-sH, we obtain dqH/dsH = -F(qH)$LLL/Dc > 0 and

dqL/dsH = F(qH)RcLLH/Dc < 0. Using dr/dqH = -L F (qL)/$LLL > 0, we then obtain dr/dsH > 0. (b).



25
     More formally, for Cournot competition, d$L/dqL = $LL + RcLH(dqH/dqL) < 0 at $LL = 0.

                                                     28
From (27) using $LL = $HH = 0, H = 1-sH, RcLH< 0, RcHL < 0 and part(a), we obtain d$H/dsH =

RcHL(dqL/dsH) + F(qH) > 0 and d$L/dsH = RcLH(dqH/dsH) < 0.                                            




              Figure 6. The developed country’s optimal subsidy: Cournot competition


        Next, Proposition 13 shows that a shift form Bertrand to Cournot competition gives country

H an incentive to subsidize rather than tax the investment of its firm. As illustrated in Figure 6, under

Cournot competition, the subsidy shifts up the quality reaction function of firm H (shown as the

dashed line), moving the equilibrium from point Nc to point Sc, which, as before, corresponds to the

Stackelberg leader-follower point with firm H as the leader and scH = 0. Since firm H gains from a

reduction in qL under both forms of competition (i.e. RcHL < 0 and RcHL < 0), in each case the policy

is aimed at reducing qL. For Cournot competition, it follows from the negative slope of firm L’s

reaction function that a subsidy will raise qH and hence lower qL. By contrast, in the Bertrand case,

since firm L raises qL in response to an increase in qH, the relevant policy is an investment tax. For

Proposition 13, we assume that the welfare function, WcH , for country H is locally concave at the

optimum subsidy, scH*. From Lemma 7 (see Appendix B for the proof), this holds under the same

                                                   29
conditions, EL  2 and )(q)  0, used to ensure local concavity of LDC welfare.

Lemma 7: Assume Cournot competition and conditions (1). Sufficient conditions to ensure local

concavity of firm H’s profit as a Stackelberg leader in quality space or equivalently, local concavity

of WcH with respect to sH are E L   q LF (q L)/F(q L)  2 and ) (F (q))2 - F(q)FK(q)  0.

Proposition 13. Under Cournot competition, country H gains from a subsidy to investment in qH.

Proof: Similar to Proposition 6, using (26) and (33), we obtain scH* = RcHL(dqL/dqH)/F(qH) > 0. 

       Finally, as in the Bertrand case, the jointly optimal investment policy corrects for the cross

effects of the quality chosen by each firm on its rival’s profit. Since Firm H gains from the widening

of the quality gap due to a reduction in qL and firm L gains from the narrowing of the quality gap due

to a reduction in qH, joint profit maximization involves a move by both firms down the quality

ladder. Consequently, as shown in Proposition 14, the policy requires that each country tax

investment, with the tax given by sLJ = RcHL/ F(qL) < 0 in the LDC and sHJ = RcLH/F(qH) < 0 in

country H. Relative to the Nash policy equilibrium, the joint choice of policies increases the

investment tax in the LDC and results in a switch from a subsidy to a tax in the developed country.

Since an increase in product differentiation has mixed effects on price competition (pH rises and pL

falls), in contrast to the Bertrand case, there is no clear relationship between the size of the quality

gap and the ability to raise prices at the expense of third country consumers. Rather the jointly

optimal policy is directed at finding the optimal location in quality space taking into account

revenues and the increasingly high investment costs as quality is increased.

Proposition 14. Under Cournot competition, the joint welfare of the two producing countries is

maximized by an investment tax in both countries with s cL J < scL* < 0 and scHJ < 0 < scH*.

5. Conclusion

       This paper develops the implications of strategic trade theory for policies targeted at the

quality of exports. The model involves a three-stage game in which an LDC and a developed country

                                                  30
attempt to reposition their firms in product quality space through taxes and subsidies on investment.

The two firms (one in each country) first make an investment determining the quality of their product

and then compete on the basis of either Bertrand or Cournot competition in a third country export

market. An important innovation is our consideration of asymmetric costs of investment in quality

with the LDC firm potentially facing substantially higher costs. If this cost difference is sufficiently

large, we show that there exists a unique pure strategy equilibrium in which the LDC firm (firm L)

produces the low-quality product and the developed country firm (firm H) produces the high-quality

product. The paper also makes a technical contribution by providing analytical proofs of concavity

for the profit and welfare functions under specified conditions.

        There are two basic considerations in determining the profitability of a particular location on

the quality ladder. First, for a given difference between own quality and the quality of the rival firm,

there is the profitability of the location based on revenue and the investment costs required to reach

that quality. Higher quality products tend to command higher revenues, but this tends to be offset

by the fact that the cost of investment in quality is increasing at an increasing rate. The second

consideration is the extent of the gap between own quality and the quality of the rival firm, but the

role played by this gap differs depending on the nature of product market competition. Under

Bertrand competition, an increase in the quality gap or extent of differentiation of the products

relaxes price competition, raising the profits of both firms, whereas under Cournot competition, the

effect on profits depends on whether the firm is above or below its rival on the quality ladder. Under

Cournot competition, firm H’s profit is increased by a reduction in the quality of firm L as before,

but firm H responds to an increase in its own quality by sufficiently increasing output so as to cause

firm L’s profits to fall. This difference in responses is at the heart of the explanation for the opposing

policy prescriptions arising under the two market structures.

        For the LDC, strategic trade policy involves a subsidy to investment in quality under Bertrand

                                                   31
competition and a tax under Cournot competition. At the Nash equilibrium in qualities, each firm

takes its rival’s quality as fixed, but under both Bertrand and Cournot competition, firm H responds

to an increase in LDC quality by also increasing quality so as to partially offset the narrowing of the

quality gap. As a result, firm L in the LDC overestimates the extent to which the quality gap will

narrow as it raises its quality. In the Bertrand case, since LDC profits are increasing in the quality

gap, this causes firm L to position its product too low on the quality ladder. By contrast, in the

Cournot case, firm L is better off as the quality gap narrows and it sets too high a quality. As is

typical in strategic trade policy models, the government can increase domestic welfare by committing

to its policy so as to shift the equilibrium to what would have been the outcome if the domestic firm

could act as a Stackelberg leader in the absence of policy. Taking into account the reaction of the

high quality firm, optimal LDC policy then involves an investment subsidy so as to move firm L (and

hence firm H) up the quality ladder in the Bertrand case and an investment tax so as to move firm

L (and firm H) down the quality ladder in the Cournot case. Under Bertrand competition, the subsidy

actually causes a narrowing of the quality gap, which hurts the profits of both firms by sharpening

price competition. However, the increased LDC revenue from the improvement in quality more than

offsets this. Similarly, the LDC gain from a move down the quality ladder under Cournot

competition more than offsets the loss from the widening in the quality gap due to the tax policy.

       Similar reasoning applies with respect to developed country policy, except that now the

direction of incentives under the two forms of competition is changed. Thus the developed country

has an incentive to tax investment in quality under Bertrand competition and to subsidize investment

in quality under Cournot competition. One factor explaining this switch in policy is that the direction

of the LDC firm’s response to an increase firm H’s quality depends on the nature of competition.

Thus the LDC firm responds by increasing its quality under Bertrand competition, but by reducing

its quality under Cournot competition. It follows that at the Nash equilibrium in qualities, firm H in

                                                  32
the developed country overestimates the extent to which the quality gap will widen as it raises its

quality in the Bertrand case, but underestimates the widening of the gap in the Cournot case. Since

firm H gains from a widening of the quality gap under both forms of competition, it sets too high a

quality in the Bertrand case (explaining the investment tax) and too low a quality (explaining the

investment subsidy) in the Cournot case.

        We also consider the possibility that both producing countries coordinate their policies so

as to maximize joint profits at the expense of consumers in the third country. These joint policies

correct for the fact that the Nash equilibrium qualities do not take into account effects on the rival’s

profit. A coordinated strategy under Bertrand competition involves an increase in differentiation as

a means of reducing price competition. Thus the LDC would tax its firm while the developed country

would subsidize its firm. Under Cournot competition, since each firm gains from a move of its rival

down the quality ladder (narrowing the quality gap for firm L and widening it for firm H), both

governments tax quality.

        This paper has focused on strategic trade theory as a motive for policies aimed at the quality

of exports. It is not hard to find alternative motives for policies directed at improving the quality of

low quality exports, such as an effort by a government to reduce externalities that may damage its

“country of origin” brand reputation, or as a means of allowing “infant industries” to catch up with

world market standards. However, in addition to providing a further explanation for such policies,

strategic trade theory can also help explain less intuitively obvious policies, such as attempts by

governments to subsidize quality improvement in industries which are already global leaders in

quality (e.g. Finland in paper and Canada in newsprint). Strategic trade policy also suggests

circumstances in which governments with low quality sectors might want to encourage producers

to remain in that niche of production rather than improve their quality (as was the case with Korea’s

“Northern Strategy”).

        Letting qL = qL(L, H) and qH = qH(L, H) denote the Nash quality levels, totally differentiating the

first order conditions %LL = 0 and %HH = 0 (from (13)) and applying Cramer’s rule, we obtain:

        dqL/dL = F(qL)%HHH /D < 0, dqH/dL = - F(qL)RHHL/D < 0;

        dqH/dH = F(qH)%LLL/D < 0, dqL/dH = - F(qH)RLLH/D < 0,                                                  (A.1)

where D     %LLL%HHH - %LLH%HHL > 0 from (16). If firms 1 and 2 produce the low and high quality products
respectively (as we show in Proposition 1), this implies L = (1-sL) and H = 1-sH where sL is the subsidy

set by the LDC and sH is the subsidy set by the developed country

        Lemma 1 is used for the proofs of both Propositions 1 and 5.

Lemma 1. Under conditions (1), d% H/dH < 0.

Proof: Since d%H/dH = RHL(dqL/dH) - F(qH) (from (12) using %HH = 0)), using dqL/dH = RLLLF(qH)/rD

< 0 (from (A.1) and RLLH = - RLLL/r), we obtain d%H/dH = [RHLRLLLF(qH) - rDF(qH)]/rD. Using D as in (16)

and letting Z    RHLF(qH) + rHF (qH)F(qH), this implies:

                                   d%H/dH = RLLLZ/rD + LF (qL)F(qH)%HHH/D.

Since %HHH < 0 and RLLL < 0 from (15), it remains to show that Z > 0. For this, we use RHH = 4(1(r) + r1(r))

= 4RLL + 8r1(r)) from (14) and RHL = - 4(r)21(r) from (11) to obtain RHL = 2rRLL - rRHH /2. Using the first

order conditions (13), this implies RHL = 2rLF(qL) - rHF(qH)/2 and hence

                    Z = rHT(qH)/2 + 2rLF(qL)F(qH) for T(q)              2F (q)F(q) - (F(q))2.                 (A.2)

Using FK(q)  0, we obtain T(q) = 2F(q)FK(q)  0 and since T(0) = 0, we have T(q)  0 and Z > 0.                     
Proposition 1. Assume Bertrand price competition. Under conditions (1), if                1 is sufficiently large, there
exists a unique pure strategy equilibrium in which the low quality product is produced in the LDC and the

high quality product is produced in the developed country.
                                                                      i
Proof. Suppose firm i for i = 1,2 faces an investment cost             . For any quality qj set by firm j, the profits of

firm i for i C j and i,j = 1,2 are given by %iL if it is the low quality producer and %iH if it is the high quality

producer. Since L =     i
                             if qi = qiL and H =   i
                                                        if qi = qiH, from (12), we obtain:


                                                              34
                     %iL = %L(qiL,qj; i) = RiL - iF(qiL) for RiL = 1(riL)qiL and riL                               qj/qiL ;

                     %iH = %H(qj,qiH; i) = RiH - iF(qiH) for RiH = 41(riH)qiH and riH                                   qiH/qj.                      (A.3)

We assume that qiL < qj and qiH > qj are at their profit maximizing levels for any given value of qj and hence

satisfy the reaction functions, qiL = 'L(qj , i) and qiH = 'H(qj, i), defined respectively by

                     %iLL = RiLL - iF(qiL) = 0 and %iHH = RiHH - iF(qiH) = 0,                                                                      (A.4)

where RiLL = 1(riL) - riL1(riL) and RiHH = 4[1(riH) + riH1(riH)]. Since (15) and (16) are satisfied, there are

only two potential Nash equilibria, (q1L,q2H), and the “switched” allocation (q2L,q1H).

        We first show that both firms earn strictly positive profits at (q1L,q2H). From (A.3), using F(q) <

F(q)q (from F(0) = 0, F(q) > 0 and F (q) > 0) and (A.4), it follows that, for any qj and                                             i
                                                                                                                                       , if firm i is firm

L, producing qiL = 'L(qj , i), then %iL = 1(riL)qiL -                F(qiL) > (1(riL) -
                                                                     i
                                                                                                          F(qiL))qiL = riL1(riL)qiL > 0. If firm
                                                                                                          i



i is firm H, from (A.3), using 1(r) = r(r-1)/(4r-1)2, we obtain RiH - RjL = qiH(r-1)/(4r-1) for r = qiH/qjL. Since
 i
  (F(qiH) - F(qjL)) <         F(qiH)(qiH - qjL) = RiHHqiH(r-1)/r from F (q) > 0 and (A.4) and since [r/(4r-1) - RiHH]/r
                              i



= (4r-7)/(4r-1)3 > 0 from r > 7/4 for RiLL > 0, it follows that

                     %iH - %jL > qiH(r-1)[r/(4r-1) - RiHH]/r + ( j - i)F(qjL) > 0 for                               j
                                                                                                                        -   i
                                                                                                                                 0.                 (A.5)

        For (q1L, q2H) to be globally stable, we also require that firm 1, taking q2 = q2H = 'H(q1L, 2) as given,

would set q1L = 'L(q2H , 1) = qL( 1, 2), rather than attempting to become firm H by setting q1 = 'H(q2H, 2)

> q2H. Similarly, we require that firm 2, taking q1 = q1L = 'L(q2H, 1) as given, would prefer q2H = 'H(q1L, 2)

= qH ( 1, 2) rather than q2 = 'L(q1L, 2) < q1L. Thus, letting                        i
                                                                                             =       (qj , i)     %iL('L(qj, i), qj, i) - %iH(qj,
'H(qj, i), i) represent the difference in profit earned by firm i from production of qiL rather than qiH for any
given quality qj set by the other firm, we require               1
                                                                     = (q2H , 1) > 0 for q2H = 'H(q1L, 2) and                              2
                                                                                                                                               = (q1L , 2)

< 0 for q1L = 'L(q2H,         1
                                  ). Conversely, the switched allocation (q2L,q1H) is not globally stable if                               1
                                                                                                                                               = (q2L, 1)

< 0 for q2L = 'L(q1H, 2) or if             2
                                               =   (q1H, 2) > 0 for q1H = 'H(q2L,                1
                                                                                                     ).
                                                                                         i
        To obtain these results, we first use (A.3) to express                               in the form:
                      i
                          =        (qj , i) = 1(riL)qiL - 41(riH)qiH +        i
                                                                              [F(qiH) - F(qiL)].

From (A.4), allowing riL              qj/qiL for qiL = 'L(qj , i) and riH         qiH/qj for qiH = 'H(qj, i) to vary, we then obtain:

         i/    i
                     = F(qiH) - F(qiL) > 0 for any qj and  i/qj = 1(riL) +4(riH)21(riH) > 0.                                                     (A.6)


                                                                         35
With respect to firm 1, from (A.3) and (A.4), we obtain:

                                    %1H = -4r1H1(r1H)q1H +                        1
                                                                                       [q1HF(q1H) - F(q1H)].                                            (A.7)

Since q1HF(q1H) - F(q1H) > 0 from (1), this implies %1H = 0 for                                    1
                                                                                                        =   1H
                                                                                                                 (q2) = 4r1H1(r1H)q1H/[q1HF(q1H) -

F(q1H)] > 0. Then, since d%1H/d           1
                                              < 0 from Lemma 1, setting q2 = q2L = qL( 2, 1), it follows that %1H < 0 and

hence (using %iL > 0) that           1
                                         (q2L, 1) > 0 for            1
                                                                         >        1H
                                                                                       (q2L). Thus firm 1 will set q1 < q2L, breaking the

switched equilibrium (q2L,q1H) for              1
                                                    >   1H

        1
and d       /dq2 > 0 from (A.6), it follows that for             1
                                                                     >       1H
                                                                                  (q2L), we have            1
                                                                                                                (q2H, 1) > 0 and hence that (q1L,q2H)
                                                                         1               2                                    2
is globally stable for firm 1. For firm 2, if                                    =           , then we have                       =       (q1L, 2) < 0, since

%2L('L(q1L, 2),q1L, 2) < %2L('L(q1H, 2),q1H, 2) < %2H(q1L,'H(q2L, 2), 2) where the first inequality follows
from d%2L/dq1 > 0 and the second from (A.5). Since dq1L/d                                    1

it then follows that      2

Proposition 4. Assume Bertrand competition. (i) The subsidy, sL*, maximizes the LDC’s rents from exports

by shifting the equilibrium to what would have been the Stackelberg leader-follower point in quality space

with the low quality firm as the leader and no subsidy. For sufficiently large, the LDC firm does not choose

to become the high quality producer. (ii) Under conditions (1), profit %L(qL,'H(qL),L) of the leader firm is

(strictly) globally concave in qL and LDC welfare, WL, is locally concave at sL = sL*.

Proof. (i) Since dWL/dsL = (d%L(qL,'H(qL), )/dqL)(dqL/dsL) from (21), it follows that at sL = sL*, qL satisfies

d%L(qL,'H(qL), )/dqL = RLL + RLH(dqH/dqL) - F(qL) = 0, which is the value of qL that would be chosen by

firm L as a Stackelberg leader at sL = 0. Since %L > 0 at the Nash equilibrium (from Proposition 1), we have

%L(qL,'H(qL), ) > 0. To show that the leader firm would not set q1 = q1H , letting                                                   qH(dr/dqH)/r represent

the elasticity of r with respect to qH , from dr/dqH = (1- r(dqL/dqH))/qL and dqL/dqH = RLLL/r%LLL, we obtain

                        = - LF (qL)/%LLL > 0, dr/dqH = /qL > 0 and 1-  = RLLL/%LLL > 0.                                                              (A.8)

It then follows from (A.3) that d%1H/dqH = 4(1(r) + r1(r)) - HF(qH) = 0 and since qF(q) - F(q) > 0 from

(1) and d%1H/d = -F(q1H ) < 0, it can be shown that %1H = -4r1H1(r1H)q1H + [q1HF(q1H) - F(q1H)] < 0 for

r1H = q1H/'L(q1H) and         sufficiently large. (ii) From (21), we have dWL/dsL = (d%L/dqL)(dqL/dsL) for %L =

%L(qL,'H(qL), ) and hence d2WL/(dsL)2 = (d2%L/(dqL)2)(dqL/dsL)2 + (d%L/dqL)(d2qL/(dsL)2). Since dWL/dsL =

                                                                             36
d%L/dqL = 0 at sL*, it follows that d2%L/(dqL)2 < 0 implies d2WL/(dsL)2 < 0 at sL*.

        To show d2%L/(dqL)2 < 0 for qH = 'H(qL) and general investment cost, LF(qL), letting              -

qL(dr/dqL)/r, it follows, using dr/dqL = -(r - dqH/dqL)/qL, dqH/dqL = rRHHH/%HHH and %HHH = RHHH - HF (qH)

from (17) and (15), that  = - HF (qH)/%HHH > 0 and that

                      dr/dqL = -r/qL < 0, dqH/dqL = r(1-) and 1-  = RHHH/%HHH > 0.                  (A.9)

From %L = 1(r)qL - LF(qL) and (A.9), we then obtain d%L/dqL = 1(r) - r1(r) - LF(qL) and hence

        d2%L/(dqL)2 = - LF (qL) + r[r1 (r) - (1-)1(r)]/qL - r1(r)(d/dqL).                      (A.10)

Using dqH/dqL = r(1- ), we have d/dqL = - H[FK(qH)r(1-)/%HHH - F (qH)(d%HHH/dqL)/(%HHH)2]. Since

d%HHH/dqL = dRHHH/dqL - HFK(qH)r(1-), letting !      - HFK(qH)/%HHH  0 from FK(q)  0, this implies

                                  d/dqL = r(1-)2! - (dRHHH/dqL)/%HHH.                              (A.11)

Letting P    RHHH[1(r) - r1 (r)]/qL%HHH - 1(r)(dRHHH/dqL)/%HHH, it then follows from (A.10), using

r1 (r) - (1-)1(r) = (1-)(r1 (r) - 1(r)) + r()21 (r), 1-  = RHHH/%HHH and (A.11), that

                  d2%L/(dqL)2 = - LF (qL) + (r)2()31 (r)/qL - (r)2(1- )21(r)! - rP.

Since 1(r) > 0, 1 (r ) < 0,  > 0 and !  0, it remains to show that P  0. From RHHH = -8(5r+1)/(4r-1)4qL

and (A.9), we obtain dRHHH/dqL = RHHHL + rRHHHH(1-) where RHHHL = - RHHH/qL - rRHHHH and hence

                dRHHH/dqL = - RHHH/qL - rRHHHH for RHHHH = 24(20r+7)/(4r-1)5(qL)2 > 0.               (A.12)

Using (A.12), this implies P= [2qLRHHH1(r) + r-]/%HHH(qL)2 for - - [qLRHHH1 (r) - 1(r)(qL)2RHHHH].

Using 1(r) = (2r+1)/(4r-1)3 and 1 (r) = -2(8r+7)/(4r-1)4, we have r- = 8(40(r)3+16(r)2+7r)/(4r-1)8 > 0 and

2qLRHHH1(r) = - 16[40(r)3+18(r)2-3r-1]/(4r-1)8. Hence, it follows using 1-  > 0 and r  1 that:

                     P= -[r-(1-) + 8(40(r)3 + 20(r)2 - 13r - 2)]/(4r-1)8(qL)2%HHH > 0.                   
Lemma 2: Assume Bertrand competition and conditions (1). If E = qF (q)/F(q) is constant (which applies

for F(q) = a(q)n) this ensures local concavity of firm H’s profit as a Stackelberg leader in quality space or

equivalently, local concavity of welfare, WH with respect to sH.

Proof: Recalling H = 1at sH = 0, it follows (analogous to (21)) that WH = %H(qL,qH,1) where %H(qL,qH,1) =

RH(qL,qH) - F(qH) and hence d2WH/(dsH)2 = (d2%H/(dqH)2)(dqH/dsH)2 + (d%H/dqH)(d2qH/(dsH)2) for qL = 'L(qH).

Since dWH/dsH = d%H/dqH = 0 at sH*, it follows that d2%H/(dqH)2 < 0 implies d2WH/(dsH)2 < 0 at sH*.


                                                     37
         To show d2%H/(dqH)2 < 0, it follows from %H = 41(r)qH - HF(qH) and dr/dqL = /qL for 

qL(dr/dqL)/r that d%H/dqH = 4(1(r) + r1(r)) - HF(qH) and hence that

               d2%H/(dqH)2 = - HF (qH) + 4[1(r)(1+) +r1 (r)](/qL) + 4r1(r)(d/dqH).                     (A.13)

Next, letting !L       - L FK(qL)/%LLL and using  = - LF (qL )/%LLL from (A.8), we obtain d/dqH = ( -

1)2!L/r - (dRLLL/dqH)/%LLL. From RLLL = -2(r)2(8r+7)/(4r-1)4qL and dqL/dqH = (1-)/r, we also have dRLLL/dqH

= RLLLH + RLLLL(1-)/r where RLLLL = - (RLLL/qL + rRLLLH). Hence dRLLL/dqH = - RLLL(1-)/qH + RLLLH and

using RLLL/%LLL = 1-  from (A.8), we obtain

                                   d/dqH = (1-)2(qL!L + )/qH - ()2RLLLH/%LLL                              (A.14)

for RLLLH = 4r(16(r)2 +40r+7)/(4r-1)5(qL)2. Since dE/dq = F (q)/F(q) - q(F (q))2 -F(q)FK(q))/(F(q))2 = 0

(from E constant), we obtain qFK(q) - F (q)(E - 1) = 0, which implies qL!L - (E-1) = 0 and hence, from

(A.14), that d/dqH = (1-)2E/qH - ()2RLLLH/%LLL. Also, from HF (qH) = EHF(qH)/qH and d%H/dqH = 0,

we obtain HF (qH) = 4E[1(r)/qH +1(r)/qL], which, using 1(r) > r1(r) from %LL = 0, implies HF (qH)

> 4E(1+)1(r)/qL. Letting k(r)          -1 (r)/qL + 1(r)RLLLH/%LLL, it then follows from (A.13), using 1 +  -

(1+) = (1-)(1+) and 1+ - (1-) = 1 + ()2 that
               d2%H/(dqH)2 < -41(r)[(E-1)(1+ - (1-)2) + (1-)(1+ ()2)]/qL - 4r()2k(r),

which, using  > 0, 1- > 0 and E  1 (from FK(q)  0), implies d2%H/(dqH)2 < 0 if k(r)  0. Since %LLL =

RLLL - LF (qL) < RLLL and RLLL = (r)21 (r)/qL < - 8(r)21(r)/(4r-1)qL from (9), we obtain k(r) >

1(r)[(8(r)21 (r))/(4r-1) + (qL)2RLLLH]/(qL)2%LLL and hence, using 1 (r) = - 2(8r+7)/(4r-1)4 and r  7/4, it
follows that k(r) > -4r1(r)[16r(r-1)+4r-7]/(qL)2%LLL(4r-1)5 > 0.                                                  
Proposition 7. Under Bertrand competition, the jointly optimal policies (sLJ ,sHJ) involve an investment tax

in the LDC and an investment subsidy in country H: i.e. sLJ = RHL/ F(qL) < 0 and sHJ = RLH/F(qH) > 0.

Proof. Let J = J(sL,sH) = WL(sL,sH) + WH(sL,sH) represent joint welfare, where Wi(sL,sH) = %i(qL,qH,i) -

si iF(qi) = Ri -   i
                   F(qi) for   L
                                   = ,   H
                                             = 1 and i = L, H. Using %ii = 0 from (13), it then follows that dWi/dsi

= Rij(dqj/dsi) - si iF(qi)(dqi/dsi) and dWj/dsi = Rji(dqi/dsi) - sj jF(qj)(dqj/dsi) for i C j, i, j = L,H. Hence the

policies (sJL ,sHL) satisfy the first order conditions:

         dJ/dsL = (RHL - sL F(qL))(dqL/dsL) + (RLH - sHF(qH))(dqH/dsL) = 0


                                                           38
        dJ/dsH = (RHL - sL F(qL))(dqL/dsH) + (RLH - sHF(qH))(dqH/dsH) = 0.                             (A.15)

It then follows from (A.15), using RHL < 0 and RLH > 0 from (11), that

                         sLJ = RHL/ F(qL) < 0 and sHJ = RLH/F(qH) > 0.                                 (A.16)

                                                                                                              


                                     Appendix B: Cournot Competition



Lemma 3. Assuming Cournot competition, if L  H, then q L < q H.

Proof. Since 5(r) = 47(r) - 1/(4r-1) and 5(r) = - 47(r) - 4/(4r-1) from (25), using RcLL = 7(r) - r7(r) and

RcHH = 5(r) + r5(r) from (29), we obtain

                             RcHH = 4RcLL + 1/(4r-1)2 > RcLL for all qH  qL > 0.                         (B.1)

At the Nash equilibrium qL > 0 satisfies the first order condition $LL = RcLL- LF(qL) = 0. If L  H and

qH = qL , then using (B.1), we obtain $HH = RcHH - HF(qH ) > $LL = 0, proving that qH > qL.                 
Lemma 4. Assume Cournot competition and conditions (1). Then $ LLL < 0, $ HHH < 0 and D c            $ LLL$HHH
- $ LLH $ HHL > 0 are satisfied at $ LL = 0 : (i) if $ HH = 0, FK (q) = 0 and  L/ H  1 or (ii) if EL 2.

Proof: We first prove $LLL < 0 for both cases (i) and (ii). Using (30), (31) and E     qF (q)/F(q), we obtain

                           $LLL = RcLLL - LF (qL) = [(r)2 7 (r) - LF(qL)EL]/qL.                        (B.2)

(i) If FK(q) = 0, then F (q) is a constant and since F(0) = 0 from (1), we have E = qF (q)/F(q) = 1 and

F(qH) - F(qL) = F (qH)(qH - qL) = EF(qH)(1- 1/r), which implies F(qL)/F(qH) = 1/r. Using RcLL/RcHH =

LF(qL)/HF(qH) from $LL = $HH = 0, we then obtain LF(qL) = RcLL = (RcHH/r)(L/H)  RcHH/r for L/H
 1. Hence it follows from (B.2), that $LLL < 0 if (r)27 (r) - RcHH/r < 0. Using 7 (r) = 2(8r+1)/(4r-1)4 and
RcHH = (16(r)3 - 12(r)2 +4r-1)/(4r-1)3 we can then show

              (r)27 (r) - RcHH/r = -[(r)2(r-1)(48r-18) + 10(r)2- 8r+1]/r(4r-1)4 < 0 for all r  1.

(ii) From (29), (31) and r  1, a useful expression is:

                              /(r)   27(r) - (r)27 (r) = 32(r)3(r-1)/(4r-1)4  0.                         (B.3)

Since LF(qL) = 7(r) - r7(r) from $LL = 0, from (B.2), using EL  2, (B.3) and 7(r) < 0, we obtain $LLL


                                                      39
= - [/(r) + 7(r)(E-2) - r7(r)E]/qL < 0. Next for both cases (i) and (ii) using $HHH = RcHHH - HF (qH), RcHHH

 0, F (q) > 0 and RcLLLRcHHH - RcLLHRcHHL = 0 from (32), we obtain:
                       $LLL < 0, $HHH < 0, Dc = - HF (qH)$LLL - LF (qL)RcHHH > 0.                                   (B.4)

Effects of L and H on quality levels: Letting qL = qcL(L, H) and qH = qcH(L, H) denote the Nash-

quality levels, from (28) using (B.4) and (32) to sign expressions, we obtain:

        dqL/dL = F(qL)$HHH /Dc < 0, dqH/dL = - F(qL)RcHHL/Dc < 0;

        dqH/dH = F(qH)$LLL/Dc < 0, dqL/dH = - F(qH)RcLLH/Dc > 0,                                                  (B.5)

where Dc     $LLL $HHH - $LLH $HHL > 0 from (B.4).
        We next show in Lemma 5 that the profits of firm L fall in response to an increase in own cost L.

Lemma 5. Assuming conditions (1) and $ LLL < 0, then d$ L/d L < 0.

Proof. Since d$L/dL = RcLH(dqH/dL) - F(qcL) (from (27) and (28)), using dqH/dL = rRcHHHF(qL)/Dc < 0

(from (B.5) and (32)) we obtain d$L/dL = [RcHHH rRcLHF(qL) - DcF(qL)]/Dc. From Dc as in (B.4), $LLL < 0

(see Lemma 4) and RcHHH < 0 (see (31)), it follows letting Zc               rRcLHF(qL) + LF (qL)F(qL) that

                        d$L/dL = [RcHHHZc + HF (qH)F(qL)$LLL]/Dc < 0 if Zc  0.

Since from (26), (29) and (28), RcLL = -2RcLH (r)2 + (r)2/(4r-1)3 = LF(qcL), we obtain RcLH = - LF(qL)/2(r)2

+ 1/2(4r-1)3. Using T(q)       2F (q)F(q) - (F(q))2 > 0 from FK(q)  0 (see (A.2)), we obtain Zc = LT(qL)/2

+ (r-1)L(F(qL))2/2r + rF(qL)/2(4r-1)3 > 0.                                                                            
Proposition 9. Assume Cournot output competition. Under conditions (1), if                   1 is sufficiently large, there
exists a unique pure strategy equilibrium in which the low quality is produced in the LDC and the high

quality is produced in the developed country.
                                                                      i
Proof. Suppose firm i for i = 1,2 faces an investment cost                . For any quality qj set by firm j, the profits of

firm i for i C j and i,j = 1,2 are given by $iL if it is the low quality producer and $iH if it is the high quality

producer. Since L =     i
                             if qi = qiL and H =   i
                                                        if qi = qiH, from (27), we obtain:

                  $iL = $L(qiL,qj; i) = RciL - iF(qiL) for RciL = 7(riL)qiL and riL            qj/qiL ;

                  $iH = $H(qj,qiH; i) = RciH - iF(qiH) for RciH = 5(riH )qiH and riH             qiH/qj.              (B.6)

We assume that qiL < qj and qiH > qj are at their profit maximizing levels for a given qj and hence satisfy the

                                                              40
reaction functions qiL = 'cL(qj , i) and qiH = 'cH(qj, i) defined respectively by:

                                         $iLL = RciLL - iF(qiL) = 0 and $iH H = RciHH - iF(qiH) = 0,                                                                            (B.7)

where RciLL = 7(riL) - riL7(riL) and RciHH = 5(riH) + riH 5(riH). From Lemma 4, there are only two potential

equilibria, (q1L,q2H) and the “switched” equilibrium, (q2L,q1H).

        Since RciLL > 0 for qiL > 0 (see (29)), using F(0) = 0 from (1) and $iLL = RciLL -                                                                              F(qiL), we
                                                                                                                                                                         i



obtain lim
             q L →0
                           $iLL > 0, which implies that, for any qj and i, $iL > 0 if qiL is sufficiently small. Thus, if


firm i is firm L, then $iL > 0 if qiL is chosen optimally at qiL = 'cL(qj, i). Alternatively, if firm i is firm H,

from (B.6), using 7(r) = (r)2 /(4r-1)2 and 5(r) = (2r-1)2/(4r-1)2, we obtain RciH - RcjL = qiH(r-1)( 4r-1) for r =

        To obtain these results, we first use (B.6) to express                                                    ci

Lemma 6: Assume Cournot competition and conditions (1). Sufficient conditions to ensure local concavity

of firm L’s profit as a Stackelberg leader in quality space or equivalently, local concavity of LDC welfare,

WcL with respect to sL are EL      qLF (qL)/F(qL)  2 and )(q) (F (q))2 - F(q)FK(q)  0 .

Proof: Since, analogous to (21), WcL = $L(qL,qH, ) for qH = 'cH(qL) where $L(qL,qH, ) = RL(qL,qH) - F(qL)

is firm L’s profit at sL = 0, as in the proof of Proposition 4, we obtain d2WcL/(dsL)2 = (d2$L/(dqL)2)(dqL/dsL)2

at d$L/dqL = 0 and hence d2$L/(dqL)2 < 0 at d$L/dqL = 0 ensures d2WcL/(dsL)2 < 0 at dWcL/dsL = 0.

        To show d2$L/(dqL)2 < 0, let c             - qL(dr/dqL)/r (analogous to  for the Bertrand model), then c =

- HF (qH)/$HHH and, as in (A.9), dr/dqL = -rc/qL < 0, dqcH/dqL = r(1-c) and 1- c = RHHH/$HHH. From $L

= 7(r)qL - LF(qL), we obtain d$L/dqL = 7(r) - rc7(r) - LF(qL), and, as in (A.10), it follows that

        d2$L/(dqL)2 = - LF (qL) + rc[rc7 (r) - (1-c)7(r)]/qL - r7(r)(dc/dqL).                                                                     (B.11)

Rearranging (B.11), using /(r)        27(r) - (r)27 (r) and LF (qL) = LF(qL)EL/qL = [7(r) - rc7(r)]EL/qL

at d$L/dqL = 0, we then obtain:

        d2$L/(dqL)2 = -[(c)2/(r) + 7(r)(EL - 2(c)2) - r7(r)[c(EL - (1-c)) - qL(dc/dqL)]]/qL.                                                       (B.12)

Letting A0   (c)2/(r) + (7(r)+r7(r))(EL - 2(c)2), it follows using EL  2, c < 1, /(r)  0 from (B.3) and

7(r) + r7(r) = (r)2(4r-3)/(4r-1)3 > 0 for r  1 that A0 > 0. From (B.12) using EL - 2(c)2 + c(EL - (1-c)) =
EL + c(EL-2) + c(1-c) and 7(r) < 0, this implies d2$L/(dqL)2 = - A0/qL + r7(r)A1/qL < 0 if

                                 A1       EL + c(EL-2) + c(1-c) - qL(dc/dqL)  0.                                                                    (B.13)


                                                                   42
Letting !c      - HFK(qH)/$HHH, it follows as in (A.11) that dc/dqL = r(1-c)2!c - c(dRcHHH/dqL)/$HHH. From

RcHHH = -8(r-1)/(4r-1)4qL, we obtain dRcHHH/dqL = RHHHL + rRHHHH(1-) where RHHHL = - RHHH/qL - rRHHHH and

hence dRcHHH/dqL = - RcHHH/qL - rcRcHHHH. Using RcHHH/$HHH. = 1 - c, this implies dc/dqL = [c(1-c) +(1-

c)2qH!c + qH(c)2RcHHHH/$HHH]/qL and, from (B.13), that
                              A1 = EL + c(EL-2) - (1-c)2qH!c - qH(c)2RcHHHH/$HHH.                         (B.14)

From RcHHHH = 24(4r-5)/(qL)2(4r-1)5 using 24(4r-5) = 96(r-1) - 24, RcHH = (2(r-1)+1)(8(r)2-2r+1)/(4r-1)3 and

8(r)2-2r+1 > 1 from r  1, we obtain RcHHHH > 3(RcHHH)2/RcHH - 24/(qL)2(4r-1)5. Using (RcHHH)2/($HHH)2 = (1-

c)2, RcHH = HF(qH) (from $HH = 0) and EH = qHF (qH)/F(qH), this implies -qH(c)2RcHHHH/$HHH > 3(1-
c)2cEH + 24(r)2(c)2/qH(4r-1)5$HHH. Hence, letting McH          cEH - qH!c = - HqH)(qH)/F(qH)$HHH  0 and
h(r)   2 + 24(r)2/qH(4r-1)5$HHH, we obtain

                       A1 > c(EL-2) + (1-c)2McH + 2(1-c)2cEH + EL - 2(c)2 + (c)2h(r).                  (B.15)

Since EL > 2(c)2 (recall c < 1), this implies A1 > 0 if h(r)  0. Using RcHH = HF(qH), we have qHHF (qH)

= RcHHEH and since $HHH = RcHHH - HF (qH) < 0 and EH  1 (from FK(q)  0), it follows that

                        h(r) = 2[qHRcHHH - RcHH(EH-1)]/qH$HHH - g(r)/(4r-1)5qH$HHH  0

for g(r)     2RcHH (4r-1)5 - 24(r)2  0. Using (4r-1)2 = (4(r-1) +3)2 = 8(r-1)(2r+1) + 9 and RcHH = (16(r)3 - 12(r)2

+ 4r -1)/(4r-1)3 as in (29), it then follows that

                    g(r) = 16(r-1)(2r+1)RcHH(4r-1)3 + 6(48(r)3 - 40(r)2 +12r - 3) > 0 for r  1.                  
Lemma 7: Assume Cournot competition and conditions (1). Sufficient conditions to ensure local concavity

of firm H’s profit as a Stackelberg leader in quality space or equivalently, local concavity of WcH with respect

to sH are E L     q LF (q L)/F(q L)  2 and ) (F (q))2 - F(q)FK(q)  0.

Proof: Since WcH = $H(qL,qH )           RcH(qL ,qH) - F(qH) for qL = 'cL(qH), it follows as in Lemma 2 that if

d2$H/(dqH)2 < 0 at d$H/dqH = 0, then d2WcH/(dsH)2 < 0 at dWcH/dsH = 0. Letting c           qH(dr/dqH)/r and using

dr/dqH = (1- r(dqL/dqH))/qL and dqcL/dqcH = RcLLL/r$LLL, we obtain c = - LF (qL)/$LLL. Since $LL = 0 at the

Stackelberg equilibrium and EL  2, this implies $LLL < 0 from Lemma 4(ii) and hence c > 0, dr/dqH = c/qL

> 0 and dqcL/dqcH = - (c-1)/r = RcLLL/r$LLL < 0. It then follows from $H = 5(r)qH - HF(qH) that d$H/dqH =

5(r) + cr5(r) - HF(qH) and hence

                                                         43
              d2$H/(dqH)2 = - HF (qH) + [(5(r)+ r5 (r))c + 5(r)](c/qL) + r 5(r)(dc/dqH).              (B.16)

Since (5(r)+ r5 (r))c + 5(r) = qLRcHHHc - 5(r)(c-1) < 0 (from RcHHH < 0 and c > 1) and 5(r) > 0,

it remains to show that dc/dqH  0. Letting !cL            - LFK(qL)/$LLL, we obtain dc/dqH = (c-1)2!cL/r -

c(dRcLLL/dqH)/$LLL. Using RcLLL = 2(r)2(8r+1)/(4r-1)4qL and dqcL/dqcH = - (c-1)/r, we also have dRcLLL/dqH
= RcLLLH - RcLLLL(c-1)/r where RcLLLL = - (RcLLL/qL + rRcLLLH) and hence dRcLLL/dqH = RcLLL(c-1)/qH + cRcLLLH

for RcLLLH = - 4r(16r(r+1)+1)/(qL)2(4r-1)5. Using RcLLL/$LLL = -(c-1), this implies:

                    dc/dqH = - (c)2RcLLLH /$LLL + (c -1)2(qL!cL+ c)/qH.                                  (B.17)

Using RcLL = (r)2(4r+1)/(4r-1)3, we obtain RcLLLH = -[4(r)4(8r+1)2(r+1) + 12(r)5]/(qL)2(4r-1)8rRcLL and hence

                                RcLLLH = -(RcLLL)2(r+1)/rRcLL - 12(r)4/(qL)2(4r-1)8RcLL.                     (B.18)

Since c = - ELRCLL/$LLqL (from RcLL = LF(qL) at $LL = 0 and EL = qLF (qL)/F(qL)) using RcLLL/$LLL = -

(c-1) and (B.18), we obtain (c)2RcLLLH/$LLL = (c-1)2cEL(r+1)/qH - 12(r)4(c)2/(qL)2(4r-1)8$LLLRcLL.

Letting McL cEL - qL!cL = - LqL)(qL)/F(qL)$LLL  0, it then follows from (B.17), EL  1 and r  1 that

              dc/dqH = -(c-1)2[McL + c(ELr -1)]/qH + 12(r)4(c)2/(qL)2(4r-1)8$LLLRcLL < 0.                     
Proposition 14. Under Cournot competition, the joint welfare of the two producing countries is maximized

by an investment tax in both countries with s cL J < scL* < 0 and scHJ < 0 < scH*.

Proof. Joint welfare is given by Jc         WcL + WcH. where Wci       Wci(sL,sH)    $i(qL,qH,i) - si iF(qi) = Rci -
 i
  F(qL) for    L
                   = ,   H
                             = 1 and i = L,H. Using $ii = 0 from (28) and Rcij < 0 from (26), we obtain dWci/dsj =

Rcij(dqj/dsj) - sj iF(qi)(dqi/dsj) < 0 for i C j. At the policies (sL*, sH*), since dWL/dsL = dWH/dsH = 0 it follows

that dJc/dsL = dWcH/dsL < 0 and dJc/dsH = dWcL/dsH < 0 and hence sLJ < sL* and sHJ < sH*. Following the same

steps as in the proof of Proposition 7 and recalling Rcij < 0 for i C j, we also obtain sLJ = RcHL/ F(qL) < 0

and sHJ = RcLH/F(qH) < 0.                                                                                        
