                                          ABSTRACT

This paper uses a variety of individual-level survey data from several countries to test for
interactions between subjective well-being at different ages and variables measuring the nature
and quality of the social context at work, at home, and in the community. While earlier studies
have found important age patterns (often U-shaped) and social context effects, these two sets of
variables have generally been treated as mutually independent. We test for and find several large
and highly significant interactions. Results are presented for life evaluations and (in some
surveys) for happiness yesterday, in models with and without other control variables. The U-
shape in age is found to be significantly flatter, and well-being in the middle of the age range
higher, for those who are in workplaces with partner-like superiors, for those living as couples,
and for those who have lived for longer in their communities. A strong sense of community
belonging is associated with greater life satisfaction at all ages, but especially so at ages 60 and
above, in some samples deepening the U-shape in age by increasing the size of the life
satisfaction gains following the mid-life low.

Introduction
A variety of research has shown that life satisfaction in many countries shows a U-shape
over the life course, with a low point about the age of 50. 1 But there is a lot a variability
too, with some countries showing little or no tendency to rise after middle age, 2 while
elsewhere there is evidence of an S-shape, with the growing life evaluations after middle
age declining again in the late 70s. 3 The existence and size of these trends depend on
whether they are measured with or without excluding the effects of physical health,
which by both clinical and subjective measures 4 declines steadily over the life course.
Rises in average life evaluations after middle age are seen in some countries even without
excluding the increasing negative effects due to health status, which gradually worsens
with age. Because the U-shape in age is quite prevalent, some researchers have thought
that it might represent something beyond the scope of human life experiences, since it has
been found in a similar form among great apes. 5 Studies using longitudinal panels have
sometimes failed to produce significant U-shapes. 6


This paper builds upon two of Richard Easterlin’s important contributions: his early
emphasis on the social determinants of happiness, and his later analysis of well-being
over the life course. In his life-course analysis he made two primary contributions. 7 First,
he broke new ground in using synthetic panels constructed from repeated cross-sections
to separate life-course and cohort effects. 8 He was able to show, as recently confirmed by
Clark (2018) using panel data with individual fixed effects, that the age pattern of life
satisfaction is not primarily due to cohort effects. Second, he compared life-course
patterns for several different measures of domain satisfaction, and found different shapes
for each. He then concluded that the time-shape of life satisfaction was likely to represent
the net impact of what was going on in different aspects of peoples’ lives.


Easterlin found, using data from the US General Social Survey, that life satisfaction had a
hump shape in age, with a peak where many other studies have found a trough.
Subsequent research has shown his GSS data and results to differ from most other
surveys for the United States and for most industrial countries, as surveyed and extended


                                               1
most recently by Blanchflower and Oswald (2018), almost all of which show U-shapes in
age with or without adjusting for a variety of control variables. While we also find, using
several different data sources, a U-shape in life satisfaction in many but not all countries,
we agree with and implement Easterlin’s suggestion that the U-shape, or any other given
shape, is not inevitable, but instead reflects the evolution of important aspects of each
person’s life. 9


We pay special attention in this paper to social conditions in the workplace, the home,
and the community. In all three cases, we expect to find that life satisfaction is higher in
those age ranges where the relevant social context is more important and/or more
supportive. Although our analysis is mainly across individuals living in the same country,
we would expect to find that cross-national differences in the quality of the institutions
providing social support might also help determine cross-national differences in the U-
shape in age. That must remain a topic for future research.


Our particular hypothesis is that various aspects of each individual’s social context help
to explain their life satisfaction at different ages. We initially test this by simply
comparing average happiness values at different ages for respondents in different
subgroups where we expect to see possible differences. There are two reasons for starting
with this simple approach. First, it avoids debates 10 about whether the specific choice of
control variables affects the conclusions about the U-shape without explaining why.
Second, Blanchflower and Oswald (2018) and Stone et al (2010) show that the usual sets
of control variables neither create nor eliminate the prevalence of a U-shape in their data
samples. However, to increase the robustness of our findings, and because our social
variables are likely to be correlated with some of the standard control variables, we
undertake the main body of our analysis using otherwise comparable econometric
specifications with and without control variables. Our methods are exactly the same as
those of Blanchflower and Oswald (2018) and Stone et al (2010) with one critical
difference. Their analysis treats each of the variables as independent, while we
hypothesize that some key social relationships might in fact interact with age.




                                               2
If we are right to suppose that the age patterns found for subjective well-being are often
reflections of a changing pattern of social relationships, then they are likely to appear in
some places and not in others, and for some people but not others, depending on the
social circumstances in which they live. As the empirical science of well-being has
developed, and as the available data become richer, it is becoming natural to consider not
just the possible separate effects of, e.g., age, marriage, employment, income, and the
social context, but also to consider the nature of their interactions. The primary
contribution of this paper is to test for interactions that are usually left untested. Most
previous analyses of these data have presumed linear independence, with the exceptions
of a log-linear form for income and a non-linear form for age itself. Age is sometimes
modeled by age groups but more usually by a quadratic form including both age and age-
squared, with an expected negative sign on age and a positive sign on age-squared, as
would be implied by a U-shape in age. We prefer the greater generality provided by the
use of population age groups, thus permitting us to see at which particular ages the social
context effects are most evident. In the following sections we consider interactions
between age and specific measures of the social context on the job, at home, and in the
community, in all cases using measures of the social context that have been found
previously to have positive effects on life evaluations. By including interaction terms, we
extend these previous results to show that these effects vary by age group, with the better
social context having its largest effects in the middle age groups, thereby lessening the U-
shape in age. We also do parallel analysis using an affective measure relating to each
respondent’s feelings of happiness on the previous day in those cases where our data
sources permit it.


Assessing the U-shape consequences of the workplace social context


Our general hypothesis is that the social context is a first-order determinant of subjective
well-being to an extent that varies with the age of the respondent. For instance, in this
section, we hypothesize that workplace social quality is more important for subjective
well-being in mid-life than elsewhere, since mid-life years are for many people a time of
stress created by competing demands from their work and family lives, and since these


                                               3
pressures are more easily reconciled when the workplace environment is more congenial
and supportive. 11 Our primary data for testing this hypothesis come from large samples of
employed respondents to the Gallup-Healthways Daily Poll, comparing those who regard
their immediate work superior as a partner with those who instead think of their
supervisor as a boss. Figure 1 shows the average ladder scores for the two groups of
respondents. Those who regard their supervisor as a partner have at all ages life
evaluations that are significantly higher than for those with boss-like superiors. The
vertical lines show the 95% confidence intervals for the estimates of the subgroup means.
The tightness of these intervals reflects the fact that the samples are very large in both
cases, while the big vertical distance between the two lines shows dramatically different
life evaluations for the two groups of US workers. In the middle of the age range, from
ages 43-47, the difference favours those with partner-like supervisors by just over 0.4
points on the 0 to 10 scale used for the Cantril ladder. This is a very large difference,
equivalent in life satisfaction terms to more than a doubling of household income. The
fact that the confidence regions are larger for those who select the ‘boss’ alternative
shows that in the large US samples there are more partners than bosses in US workplaces,
by about a two to one margin.


The most important feature of Figure 1, for our current purposes, is that those with
partner-like bosses show no significant drop in life evaluations between the late 20s and
the early 50s, while for those with boss-like supervisors there is a large drop, about 0.2
points on the 0 to 10 scale. Both groups of workers show similarly large gains in life
evaluations from mid-50s to age 70. Thus there is a significant U-shape for those with
bosses, while for those in partner-like settings there is no mid-life dip.

Figure 2 shows parallel results from a question asking workers about their happiness
yesterday, a measure of positive affect answered in this case on a binary scale. The figure
shows the proportion of the sampled populations who described themselves as being
frequently happy on the previous day. In proportionate terms, the differences between the
boss and partner groups are roughly of the same size for positive affect as for life
evaluations, but the time pattern is different in two important ways. 12 First, it can be seen
by comparing Figures 1 and 2 that the happiness drops for those with boss-like
supervisors are larger and longer lasting than they are for life evaluations. There is
essentially no fall in happiness for those with partner-like supervisors. For those with
boss-like supervisors, however, the proportion reporting happiness yesterday drops from
0.90 at age 27 to just over 0.84 in the 53-57 age range. 13

The second difference relates to weekend effects. We can separate the responses to the
life evaluations and positive affect questions according to the day the survey was taken.
We divide the responses into two groups, split according to whether or not the preceding
day was a regular workday or not. 14 We do not know the work schedules for individual
respondents, so our sample split is instead based on the fact that Mondays to Fridays are
more frequent workdays than are Saturdays and Sundays. Figure 3 shows that there are
no weekend effects for life evaluations. Regardless of the day on which the question is
asked, respondents with boss-like supervisors have lower life evaluations than
respondents those with partner-like supervisors, while within each respondent group, no
significant change occurs between weekdays and weekends. This lack of change is
reassuring evidence of the validity of life evaluations, which are intended to relate to life
as a whole, and not to a particular day. But our data also provide assurance against
another possible source of skepticism: that happier people will think better of everyone,
so that their partner/boss responses reflect their personalities rather than their workplaces.
The answers for the question about happiness yesterday eliminate the grounds for such a
possibility, because they show, as can be seen in Figure 4, very pronounced weekend
effects that are much larger for those with boss-like supervisors. If the workplace


                                              6
environment, rather than personality differences, is the underlying cause of the different
answers, then we should expect to see the relief at being off work being much greater for
those in less congenial workplaces. And that is indeed what we find.

If the U-shape in age is largely a consequence of the social contexts of different aspects
and times of life, then we might also expect to find differences across nations and


                                             7
cultures, and possibly over time as well. That is indeed the case, as shown by Figure 5
showing population-weighted U-shapes for each of nine major global regions. While
every region shows at least some drop from the young to middle ages, only two regions
have well defined recoveries after middle age, and there are also considerable differences
in the steepness of the drop from youth to middle age. Finding a role for the workplace
social context in explaining these differences is complicated by the fact that the boss-
partner question has only been asked in some countries of the Gallup World Poll, and the
samples are in any event far smaller than available from the Gallup-Healthways Daily
Poll. If we combine the responses from employed workers in those countries in which the
boss-partner question has been asked more than 100 and up to about 1,000 times, we get
a sample of 38,000 from 114 countries including some representation in all regions. 15

Figure 6 divides the employed respondents by boss vs partner and into younger (<45),
middle-aged (45 to 55) and older (>55) workers. Everywhere and at all ages, respondents
with partner-type bosses have systematically higher life evaluations. Although there is no
universal evidence of a U-shape linking the different age groups, the central element of
our buffering hypothesis is supported by these international data – where midlife
evaluations are compared to those of younger workers in similar job situation, the midlife
evaluations fall less for those in partner-type job environments.

The results above are obtained simply by dividing the data samples for each age group
according to whether they have partner-like or boss-like supervisors. We now need to
ensure that our results still hold when due account is taken of all of the other variables
often used to explain individual-level subjective well-being. This is advisable because
many of these other variables may be correlated with answers to the partner/boss question,
with estimates of the latter effect being falsely high or low, depending on the nature of
the correlations. Our econometric analysis is conducted by estimating two different
models in the US Gallup-Healthways Daily Poll, which has a much bigger usable sample
than the international Gallup World Poll. The first model explains well-being using age
categories, a dummy variable for a partner-like supervisor, a full set of interaction terms
between the partner variable and the age groups, plus dummy variables to capture state
and year fixed effects. The second model adds a number of individual-level control
variables.

More specifically, the base model for the working environment, estimated using data for
employees only, is:

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜷𝜷𝟏𝟏 + 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜷𝜷𝟐𝟐 + 𝛾𝛾1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 + 𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,


where 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 indicates a subjective well-being measure of individual i in state j in year
of survey t, 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of age groups (omitting the 18-22 base age group),
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a dummy variable for supervisor being more like a partner than a boss, 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 is
a year fixed effect, 𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗 a state fixed effect, and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the error term.


The corresponding model with controls added is:

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜷𝜷𝟏𝟏 + 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜷𝜷𝟐𝟐 + 𝛾𝛾1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜃𝜃 + 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 + 𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗 +
𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .


where 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of individual and household covariates, including gender, marital
status, number of children, four levels of education (vs less than high-school completion),




                                                                      10
log of household income (with a dummy variable for those with income not reported),
and full-time employment status (vs part-time).

The full results of the estimation are available in the statistical appendix, along with more
detailed descriptions of the variables. The key results for this section of the paper relate to
the coefficients for having a work supervisor regarded by the respondent as a partner
rather than a boss. This is the case for about two-thirds of the employed US respondents
to the Gallup-Healthways daily poll. In the base group, aged 18-22, having a partner-like
supervisor is associated with a Cantril ladder score that is 0.166 points (t=11.1) higher on
the 0 to 10 scale. As shown in Figure 7a, this difference grows until middle age, and then
declines, delivering a U-shape in age that is more pronounced for those with less
congenial working environments. The red line in Figure 7a shows the sum of the
estimated 𝜷𝜷𝟏𝟏 and 𝜷𝜷𝟐𝟐 for each of the age group other than the omitted group (age 18-22).
The blue line shows the estimated 𝜷𝜷𝟏𝟏 . Thus the vertical gap between the two lines
illustrates the magnitude of the estimated 𝜷𝜷𝟐𝟐 for each of the age groups. A wider gap
indicates a greater positive impact on well-being of having a partner-like superior. We
use an identical or similar thematic design for all of our subsequent figures.

How well do these results hold up when we include the usual set of individual-level
control variables? Our second model is essentially a conventional estimation for an
individual-level subjective well-being equation, except that we add interaction terms for
age and job quality. In most happiness equations, such interactions are assumed to be
zero. Our alternative hypothesis is that the coefficients on the interaction variables will be
significantly positive, with the departures from linearity being greatest in middle age.
Figures 7b plots the U-shape results with control variables. For the youngest age group,
the effect of having a partner-like supervisor is essentially unchanged, 0.162 (t=10.8). For
higher age groups, at least up to middle age, the effects are significantly greater, but by a
smaller multiple than in the simpler model. Thus for those in the 43-47 age group the
effects of having a partner-like supervisor are 0.143 points (t=7.1) greater than for the
youngest age group. Both the size and significance of the U-shape remains very large,
even if smaller in magnitude than that in the simpler model. In the simple model, the
effects of having a partner-like supervisor are 140% larger for the typical respondent in


                                              11
the 43-47 year category than for those aged 18-22. In the model with controls, the
partner-like supervisor is associated with a life evaluation premium that is 88% larger for
the 43-47 age group than for those aged 18-22. Hence we reject the null hypothesis that
that partner premium does not vary with age.

This analysis is repeated for happiness yesterday in Figures 8a and 8b. With or without
the inclusion of control variables, the maximum positive interaction effects appear at a
later age, 53-57 for happiness yesterday compared to 43-47 for the Cantril ladder. The
happiness-yesterday effect of a partner-like supervisor is 0.023 in the simple model and
0.057 with controls (t=10 in both cases). In proportionate terms, this is larger than for the
life evaluations, although such comparisons are difficult to make, since the individual
answers to the life evaluation question are on a 11-point response scale running from 0 to
10, while the happiness yesterday question offer only a binary yes/no response possibility.
The age-group interaction effects are proportionately roughly the same for happiness as
for life evaluations, except for the different age pattern already noted.

The U-shape is flatter for those who are married


                                                 14
We turn now to consider the U-shape effects of marriage, both with and without control
variables. We hypothesize the U-shape in age is significantly less for those who are
married than those who are not 16. This supposes that together spouses can better shoulder
the extra demands that may exist in mid-life when career and other demands coincide.
This was found in earlier studies of adaptation to marriage, which showed that although it
was true in longitudinal data sets from several countries 17 that those who married often
return to their baseline life evaluations after a few years, they were nonetheless
significantly happier than their unmarried matched counterparts, whose happiness was
following a steady decline. Thus marriage provides a buffer against what otherwise
would have been a U-shaped decline into middle age.


So we can conclude that, at least in some countries, a happy home life can flatten the U-
shape, just as we have shown for happy workplaces. We do our main marriage analysis
using US data for approximately 240,000 respondents to the Gallup-Healthways Daily
Poll, more than twice the previous sample, which was restricted to paid employees.

The base model for marital status is:

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜷𝜷𝟏𝟏 + 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝜷𝜷𝟐𝟐 + 𝛾𝛾1 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 + 𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,


where 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 indicates subjective well-being measure, 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of age groups
(omitting the base age group), 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a dummy variable for marriage or common law,
𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 is year fixed effect, 𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗 is state fixed effect, and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the error term.


The model for marital status with controls:

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜷𝜷𝟏𝟏 + 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜷𝜷𝟐𝟐 + 𝛾𝛾1 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜃𝜃 + 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 + 𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,


where 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of individual and household covariates including employment
status, gender, log of household income, level of education, and number of children.

The two parts of Figure 9 compare the life evaluation U-shapes for married and
unmarried respondents. Whether or not control variables are included, the life evaluations


                                                                     15
for the 18-22 age group are the same whether the respondents are married or not.
Thereafter the coefficients on the interactive age variables (i.e. the vertical difference
between the line for the married and the unmarried in Figure 9) show an increasing
pattern, with a peak in the 53-57 age category, of 0.78 (t=31) in the simple model and
0.52 (t=23) in the model with controls. With or without controls, the U-shape is much
shallower for the married than the unmarried, to an extent that is quantitatively large and
statistically very significant.

The two parts of Figure 10 show the corresponding results for answers to the happiness
yesterday question. The reduction in the depth of the U-shape is very large and
significant in both cases. The coefficients on the age-marriage interaction terms in the 53-
57 age group are +0.110 (t=28) without controls and +0.085 (t=28) with controls.

Previous research using UK longitudinal data has shown marriage to be associated with
substantially higher life evaluations even when pre-marriage life satisfaction is taken into
account (Grover and Helliwell 2017). Additionally, large samples of cross-sectional data
from the UK’s Annual Population Survey (APS) showed the U-shape in age to be much
flatter for the married, even when the comparison is done between the ever-married and
the never-married to remove the selection out of marriage by separation and divorce
(Grover and Helliwell 2017, Figure 3). Because the UK APS asks about life satisfaction
and about happiness yesterday, using identical 0 to 10 response scales, we can compare
the U-shape consequences for life satisfaction and for happiness yesterday more
consistently than is possible with the US data. We therefore repeated the analysis shown
in Figures 9 and 10 using the UK data, as reported in the statistical appendix. With or
without controls, the U-shape is much shallower for the married than the unmarried for
both life satisfaction and happiness yesterday. The coefficient on the age-marriage
interaction term for life satisfaction in the 48-52 age group, which is at the bottom of the
U-shape, is 0.46 points higher (t=9.7) for the married than for the unmarried, with or
without controls, relative to a comparison group comprising those aged 18-27. This is just
slightly lower than was found in the model with controls applied to the US Gallup data in
Figure 9. For happiness yesterday, on the same 0 to 10-point scale, the interaction
coefficient is +0.35 points (t=6.2). Thus the U-shape effects of marriage in the UK data
are somewhat greater for life satisfaction than for happiness yesterday, while being large
and statistically significant in both cases.


Assessing the combined effects of the social context at work and at home


We now use the large data samples provided from the US Gallup Daily Poll to show the
U-shape differences for two-way interactions between the social context of the working
environment and marriage with and without the use of the fuller sets of controls
frequently used in the explanation of subjective well-being. Once again, we do this using
both the Cantril ladder and happiness yesterday as alternative measures of subjective
well-being.

The coefficient 𝛾𝛾3 estimates the interaction effects between marriage and the social
context on the job for respondents in the 18-22 age group, while the coefficients 𝜷𝜷𝟒𝟒 show
the corresponding interaction effects for each age group. Almost universally, these
interaction effects are small and statistically insignificant, for both life evaluations and
happiness yesterday, and for equations with and without control variables. We
nonetheless include these small effects in the calculations shown in Figures 11 and 12.
The estimation sample is essentially the same as was used for the workplace equations, so
that the marriage results are now those for employed workers, rather than the full
population sample used for the earlier marriage results. By comparing the marriage
effects in the two samples, we find that the U-shape effects of marriage are less for the
sample of employed workers than they were previously found to be for the larger sample
including the self-employed, the unemployed, and those not in the labour force. For the
53 to 57 age group, the marriage coefficient is about 10% smaller in the employed sample,
while for happiness yesterday it is about 25% smaller. Thus, while the marriage premium
appears to be independent of work quality, it is not independent of employment status in
general.


Looking at the employed sample, we can compare the relative sizes of the marriage and
workplace effects. These comparisons are not exact, of course, as the marriage effect is
not showing the effects of marriage quality, but just whether the respondent is married or



                                                                         20
not. Previous research 18 using UK data showed that the marriage effects were twice as
large for those who also regarded their spouse as their best friend, a reasonable measure
of the quality of a marriage in terms of happiness. For the social context of the job we are
looking solely at job quality, but using only one measure among many possible. Previous
research has shown a large life satisfaction premium for being employed rather than
unemployed, in both cross-sectional and longitudinal data samples.


Figure 11a shows that the effects of marriage in reducing the size of the U-shape drop are
twice as great as the corresponding benefits of having a partner-like supervisor. In the
model with controls added, shown in Figure 11b, the U-shape attenuation is lessened in
the work situation while the effects of marriage are unchanged, so that marriage is here
three times as important as the workplace environment. What can we conclude about the
combined effects of marriage and the workplace social context? In Figure 11b, we can
see that employed workers aged 53-57 who are unmarried and have a boss-like
supervisor have life evaluations that are lower by 0.82 points than those in the youngest
age group with the same job and home characteristics. For those who are married and
have partner-like supervisors, there is still some evidence of a U-shape, about 0.28 points,
about one-third as large as for those who are unmarried and in jobs with boss-like
supervisors.

The results in Figure 12 for happiness yesterday have the same general pattern, while
showing even larger proportionate reductions in the U-shape for those who are married
and partner-like supervisors. Looking at the results with controls in Figure 12b, the U-
shape for the married in good jobs is less than one sixth as large as for those who are
unmarried and with boss-like supervisors. For those in the 53-57 age group, for example,
the reported frequency of happiness yesterday is lower by 0.02 for the married in good
jobs, compared to 0.11 for those who are unmarried and with boss-like supervisors.

The U-shape is also flatter for those who have lived longer in their communities
If the U-shape in age is importantly based on the quality of the social context, we might
also expect to find the U-shape to be less for those who have lived for longer in their
local communities, since social foundations take time to build. Danish researchers
calculated age distributions of life satisfaction separately for those who have lived for
more or less than 15 years in their communities, and found there was a U-shape for both
groups, but much deeper for those who were recently arrived in the community. 19 We
find that the same pattern appears in large samples of pooled data from several waves of
the Canadian General Social Survey (GSS). In the Danish case, the U-shape drop from
early to middle ages is significantly less (by about 0.25 points on the 0 to 10 life
satisfaction scale used in both countries) for those whose have lived longer in their
neighbourhoods.


In the Canadian case the GSS data have separate measures for time in the neighbourhood
and time in the “city or local community,” with 10 years being in both cases the dividing
line between short-term and long-term residence. The most transient of the population
groups are the 25-34 year olds. In this group, only 10% have lived for more than 10 years
in their current neighbourhood, and 33% in their city. These percentages rise thereafter
with age, to 37% and 69% for those aged 45-54, and 84% and 85% for those over 75. As
was found with the Danish data, the U-shape in age is shallower for those who have lived
for longer in the neighbourhoods.

We estimate the interacted effect of age and time in residence using two econometric
models that parallel the models without and with standard control variables used in the
previous sections. The simpler model explains well-being using age categories, a dummy
variable for long-term residence, a full set of interaction terms between the residence
variable and the age groups, plus dummy variables to capture province and year fixed
effects. The second model adds a number of individual-level control variables, as shown
in the statistical appendix. The figures reported in this section reflect the results for the
model that includes the additional controls.

More specifically, the base model is:


                                               25
𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜷𝜷𝟏𝟏 + 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜷𝜷𝟐𝟐 + 𝛾𝛾1 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 + 𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗 +
𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡 ,


where 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 indicates a subjective well-being measure of individual i in state j in year
of survey t, 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of age groups (omitting the 15-24 base age group),
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a dummy variable for long-term residence, 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 is a year fixed effect, 𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗 a
province fixed effect, and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the error term.


The corresponding model with controls added is:

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜷𝜷𝟏𝟏 + 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜷𝜷𝟐𝟐 + 𝛾𝛾1 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜃𝜃 + 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 +
𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .


where 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of individual and household covariates, including gender, marital
status, three levels of education (vs less than high-school completion), and six household
income brackets (with a dummy variable for those with income not reported).


Using the model with a full set of controls, Figure 13 shows the U-shapes separately for
those who have lived for more and less than 10 years in their current neighbourhoods.

The results are very like those for Denmark, with the age U-shape being less pronounced
for those who have lived for longer in their current neighbourhoods. Except for those
aged over 75, the well-being improvement effects are largest for those in the 45 to 54
year age group, where satisfaction with life is 0.189 points higher (t=3.3) for those with
more than 10 years in the same community than it is for more recent arrivals. Both the
size and the shape of this effect are the same as found in Denmark, in both cases about
one-quarter of a point.


The Canadian GSS provides additional information that lets us check the nature and some
possible sources for the community-based U-shape effects. First, we now have the
capacity to see whether the results are specific to time living in the neighbourhood, or
more generally to time spent in the same city. This distinction is possibly important, as if
the U-shape advantages are derived from friendly neighbours, then neighbourhood tenure
might be more important than city tenure. On the other hand, if the support is coming
from broader networks of friends in the same activities, then time in the same city might
be equally or more important. As was seen from the averages, moves between
neighbourhoods in the same city are more frequent than moves from one city to another,
such that for the whole sample 34% have lived for more than 10 years in their current
neighbourhood, compared to 62% in the same city. Although the averages are different,
and move differently between generations, the correlation between these two measures of
permanency is quite high (+0.74), making it less surprising that the U-shape effects of the
two measures are also very similar, as shown by comparing Figures 13 and 14.


Figure 14 shows the results for time spent living in the same city, just as Figure 13 does
for neighbourhood tenure. In both cases long-term residence lessens the life satisfaction
drop from youth to middle age, and increases the subsequent improvements. By flattening
the left-hand side of the U-shape and increasing the steepness of the right-hand side, the
net effect is to increase life satisfaction significantly for those in the highest age groups.

The Canadian GSS also includes a subjective measure of community belonging, thereby
permitting us to see if the U-shape effects of time in place are working though an
enhanced sense of belonging to the community. Overall, for all the roughly 60,000
observations in the pooled GSS sample, strong vs weak sense of belonging in the
community is positively, but fairly weakly, correlated with both time in the
neighbourhood (+0.13) and time in the city (+0.11). When we fit the life satisfaction
model, with controls, to the sense of community belonging at different ages using the
community belonging variable in precisely the same way as previous described for the
long-term residence variable, we find that a sense of community belonging has very
strong effects on life satisfaction, and that these effects are essentially the same for
people in all of the younger age groups. We illustrate this result in Figure 15, where we
show two different U-shapes separated only by the effects of strong vs weak sense of
belonging to the local community. Those with a strong sense of community belonging
have substantially higher life satisfaction at all ages, by 0.71 points (t=15.2) for the 15-24
year olds, and statistically similar amounts at other ages. Only for the age group 75 years
and older is there any suggestion of a greater effect, by 0.14 points (t=1.6).

The much larger Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) has the same life
satisfaction and community belonging questions, so that it is possible (a) to see if the
GSS community belonging result of a similar-size life satisfaction premium associated
with community belonging for most age groups is replicated with finer age groups and a
sample size exceeding 400,000, and (b) to test the hypothesis that community belonging
is especially valuable in the oldest age groups. This is done in Figure 16, which indicates
a positive answer to both questions. As in the GSS, the effects of community belonging
are also large and strongly significant (+0.56 points, t=26.6), and roughly equal in all the
younger age groups. Only after age 55 do significant U-shape effects appear, and become
greatest at very high ages, being +0.41 (t=6.3) in the 75 to 80 year group and +0.50
(t=8.7) for those over 80 years of age.

Thus the Canadian evidence suggests that the U-shape effects of length of residence and
of community belonging have different age patterns. Time in residence dampens the drop
in life satisfaction from young to middle ages while community belonging only acquires
significant U-shape influence at higher ages. The greater impact of community belonging
for those of greater ages may reflect changing patterns of life, with less time on the job
and more in community settings. Those in the oldest age groups are also more likely than
those in younger groups to be living alone, whether through divorce or widowhood. This
lower prevalence of supportive networks on the job or at home thus may be what elevates
the relative importance of the community as a source of social engagement and support. 20


For both Denmark and Canada, neighbourhood-level social capital, insofar as it is
fostered by time spent living in the neighbourhood, dampens the onset and lessens the
depth of the U-shape decline in life evaluations from youth to middle ages. The Canadian
evidence from two different surveys shows community belonging to be a strong support

                                               30
for life evaluations at all ages, with U-shape ramifications mainly at higher ages. The
CCHS in particular, with its much larger sample sizes, shows that those with a weak
sense of community belonging do not have the same rise in life satisfaction at higher ages
enjoyed by those with a strong sense of community belonging.


If we estimate a model that includes both time in residence and community belonging,
and the interactions between them, we find some evidence that these two measures of
local social capital are not independent. In particular, the average life satisfaction gain
from living more than ten years in the neighbourhood and having a strong sense of
belonging are about 12% less than the sum of the estimated effects when we model the
two separately.


Conclusion
Although many researchers have found a U-shape for happiness over the life course,
others have noted that the shape appears in some times and places, and not in others. 21
We argue that the social context is likely to be a key determinant of life satisfaction at all
stages of life, and in particular that a supportive social context is likely to ameliorate or in
a few cases even remove the mid-life low that is characteristic of the U-shape, and to
enlarge the typical increase in life evaluations following middle age. Although much of
our emphasis has been on the front part of the U-shape, the drop from younger ages into
middle age, 22 our study of the effects of community belonging suggests that its power lies
mainly in delivering a supportive social context at ages when the workplace become less
relevant as working time decreases with age. Our results for the community context
suggest it to be most important in the later stages of life, when it comes to replace the
workplace as the centerpiece of daily life. 23


Our evidence relates specifically to workplace congeniality, marriage, time spent living
in the same neighbourhood and city, and a sense of community belonging, all of which
are associated with higher subjective well-being in general, and especially so for those in
the middle or later stages of life. We find that the U-shape in age is significantly
shallower, and rises more in the higher age groups, for those with the most supportive


                                                 31
workplaces, families, neighbourhoods, and cities. Our evidence is based almost entirely
on big samples of cross-sectional data, large enough to show highly significant patterns,
but adequate only to suggest, but not demonstrate, causal connections. The power and
prevalence of these associations suggest to us that more experimental methods and
evidence are also likely to demonstrate the power of good social relations to support
higher life evaluations, and to provide resilience against the stresses of mid-life, or indeed
other problems that people may face.

  For example, Steptoe et al. (2015, Figures 1 to 4) show self reports of experienced pain
to become steadily more frequent as age increases in all four major groups of countries
reviewed.

  If the sequence of cross-sections is large and frequent enough, this procedure provides a
promising way to solve the age/cohort separation problems raised in the U-shape context
by De Ree and Alessie (2011), Schilling (2006) and others.
9
  For example, Schwandt (2016), using German panel data, argues that the U-shape is
more prevalent among those respondents with unmet expectations for the evolution of
their happiness.
10
   For example, see the exchange between Glenn (2009) and Blanchflower and Oswald
(2009).
11
   We find evidence for this from a sample combining several waves of life satisfaction
data from the Canadian General Social Survey. Regressions of individual SWL on
work/life balance, marital status and length of tenure in one’s neighbourhood, done
separately for the population divided into three age groups, show that the impact of the
self-assessed quality of work/life balance is ten times greater for those in the 45 to 54 age
group than for older workers. It is 50% greater than for younger workers. By way of
comparison, the coefficients for marital status and length of tenure in the neighbourhood
are the same for middle-aged and older workers, while being less for younger workers.
12
   Xing and Huang (2014) also find U-shapes that vary for different measures of
subjective well-being, in their case based on Chinese data.
13
   Stone et al. (2010), using an earlier and smaller sample of data from the same Gallup
daily poll, also show a later trough for positive affect than for the ladder, in their case
looking at the whole population.
14
   The data and procedures are explained more fully in Helliwell & Wang (2015).
15
   We exclude the larger samples from Russia, Germany and the United Kingdom
(roughly 2,000, 9,000 and 10,000, respectively) because they are sufficient for separate
analysis and are large enough to affect the overall findings from a pooled sample.

   These included the United Kingdom (Yap et al. 2012), Switzerland (Anusic et al.

19
   See Bonke et al. (2017, Figure 8).
20 This is consistent with Van Willigen’s (2000) longitudinal analysis showing that

the life satisfaction gains from volunteering were larger for elderly than for middle-
aged subjects.
21
   As emphasized by Graham & Pozuelo (2017).

   This is also the focus of Piper (2015) using UK data.
