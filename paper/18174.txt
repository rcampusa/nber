                                              ABSTRACT

We present a new model of money management, in which investors delegate portfolio management
to professionals based not only on performance, but also on trust. Trust in the manager reduces an
investor’s perception of the riskiness of a given investment, and allows managers to charge higher
fees to investors who trust them more. Money managers compete for investor funds by setting their
fees, but because of trust the fees do not fall to costs. In the model, 1) managers consistently underperform
the market net of fees but investors still prefer to delegate money management to taking risk on their
own, 2) fees involve sharing of expected returns between managers and investors, with higher fees
in riskier products, 3) managers pander to investors when investors exhibit biases in their beliefs, and
do not correct misperceptions, and 4) despite long run benefits from better performance, the profits
from pandering to trusting investors discourage managers from pursuing contrarian strategies relative
to the case with no trust. We show how trust-mediated money management renders arbitrage less
effective, and may help destabilize financial markets.

1. Introduction


        It has been known since Jensen (1968) that professional money managers underperform

passive investment strategies net of fees.       Gruber (1996) estimates average mutual fund

underperformance of 65 basis points per year; French (2008) updates this to 67 basis points per

year. Even such poor performance of mutual funds is only the tip of the iceberg. Many

investors pay substantial fees to brokers and investment advisors, who then direct them toward

the mutual funds that underperform (Bergstresser et al. 2009, Chalmers and Reuter 2012, Del

Guercio, Reuter and Tkac 2010, Hacketal, Haliasos, and Japelli 2011). Once all fees are taken

into account, some studies find 2 percent investor underperformance relative to indexation2.

This evidence is difficult to reconcile with the view that investors are comfortable investing in a

low fee index fund on their own, but nonetheless seek active managers to improve performance.


        In fact, performance seems to be only part of what money managers seek to deliver.

Many leading investment managers and nearly all registered investment advisors advertise their

services based not on past performance but on trust, experience, and dependability

(Mullainathan et al. 2008). Some studies of mutual funds note that investors hiring advisors

must be obtaining some “intangible benefits” or “babysitting”.          In this paper, we take this

perspective seriously, and propose an alternative view of money management, based on the idea

that investors do not know much about finance, are too nervous or anxious to take risk on their

own, and hence hire money managers and advisors to help them invest. Managers may have

skills such as knowledge how to diversify or even ability to earn an alpha, but in addition they

provide investors with peace of mind. Just as most patients needing care visit a doctor they

trust, investors hire managers they trust to help them make risky investments. We focus on

individual investors, but similar issues apply to institutional investors (Lakonishok et al. 1992).




2
 Berk and Green (2004) argue that low net of fee alphas result from competition among investors for
access to more skilled managers, who charge higher fees. This theory is challenging to reconcile with
negative average after-fee performance, with large fees many investors pay to brokers and advisors who
help choose funds, and with the evidently negative relationship between fees and gross-of-fees
performance (e.g., Gil-Bazo and Ruiz-Verdu 2009).

                                                  2
        Critically, we do not think of trust as deriving from past performance. Rather, trust

describes confidence in the manager, based on personal relationships, familiarity, persuasive

advertising, connections to friends and colleagues, communication and schmoozing. There are

(at least) two distinct aspects of such confidence and trust. The first, stressed by Guiso,

Sapienza, and Zingales (2004, 2008) and Georgarakos and Inderst (2011), sees trust as security

from expropriation or theft. Another aspect of trust, emphasized here, has to do with reducing

investor anxiety about taking risk. With US securities laws, most investors in mutual funds

probably do not fear that their money will be stolen; rather, they want to be “in good hands.”


        We think of money doctors as families of mutual funds, registered investment advisors,

financial planners, brokers, bank trust departments, and others who give investors confidence to

take risks.   Some investors surely do not need advice, and invest on their own, although

research by Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (2007) suggests that many such investors do not

diversify properly. But many other investors, ranging from relatively poor employees asked to

allocate their defined contribution pension plans (Chalmers and Reuter 2012) to millionaires

hiring “wealth managers,” rely on experts to help them take risk. And just as doctors guide

patients toward treatment, and are trusted by patients even when providing routine advice

identical to that of other doctors, in our model money doctors help investors take risk and are

trusted to do so even when their advice is costly, generic, and occasionally self-serving.


        We present a model of the money management industry in which the allocation of assets

to managers is mediated by trust. We model trust as reducing the utility cost for the investor of

taking risk, much as if lower anxiety reduces the investors‟ subjective perception of the risk of

investments. Managers differ in how much different investors trust them: an investor who trusts

a manager a lot perceives risky investments guided by this manager as substantially less risky.

This simple formulation has significant implications. Other things equal, an investor would

prefer to make a given investment with the manager he trusts most, enabling this manager to

charge the investor a higher fee and still keep him. Even if managers compete on fees, these

fees do not fall to cost, and substantial market segmentation remains. In fact, in our model fees

                                                3
are proportional to risks taken, with higher fees in riskier asset classes. Net of fees, investors

consistently underperform the market, but experience less anxiety and take more risk than they

would investing on their own. A very simple formulation based on trust thus delivers some of

the basic facts about money management that the standard approach finds puzzling.


        In this framework, under rational expectations managers charge high fees but at the

same time enable investors to take more risk. Investors are better off. There are no distortions

in investment allocation between asset classes.       Interesting issues arise, however, when

investors do not hold rational expectations, and perhaps want to invest in hot asset classes or

new products they feel will earn higher returns. Empirical evidence supports the role of investor

extrapolation in financial markets (e.g., Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny 1994, Hurd and

Rohwedder 2012, Yagan 2012). Would trusted money managers correct investors‟ errors, or

pander to their beliefs? In our model, managers have a strong incentive to pander, precisely

because such pandering gets investors who trust the manager to invest more, and at higher fees.

Trust-mediated professional money management does not work to correct investor biases. In

equilibrium, money managers let investors chase returns by proliferating product offerings.


        We also consider the dynamics of professional money management, and in particular

the possibility that, over time, funds flow to better performing managers (Chevalier and Ellison

1999). In this context, we ask whether professional managers have an incentive to pursue

contrarian strategies and try to beat the market.      We present a dynamic model in which

managers have the ability to earn an alpha, and are rewarded for doing so by attracting fund

flows. We nevertheless find that these performance incentives are significantly moderated in a

model with trust, because a manager must trade off the benefits of attracting future funds due to

his superior performance against the cost of discouraging current clients who want to invest in

hot sectors. Keeping the current clients might be more lucrative than trying to attract new ones,

especially when manager-specific trust is important. This is because manager-specific trust: i)

allows managers to charge high fees in hot assets, and ii) reduces investor mobility to better

performing managers. Even in a dynamic model, then, we see strong pressures to pander to

                                                4
client biases, modest flows of funds toward better-performing managers, and only a weak

incentive to bet against market mispricing. This result has implications for the effectiveness of

professional arbitrage, market efficiency, and stability of financial markets.


        Our paper connects with several areas of research. Since Putnam (1993), economists

have studied the role of trust in shaping economic and political outcomes (e.g., Knack and

Keefer 1997, La Porta et al. 1997). In finance, this research was pursued most productively by

Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2004, 2008) who show that trust in institutions encourages

individuals to participate in financial markets, whether by opening checking accounts, seeking

credit, or investing in stocks. We take a related perspective, except that we stress the anxiety-

reducing aspects of manager-specific trust, rather than trust in the system.


        In addition to voluminous research on poor performance of equity mutual funds, some

papers document net of fees underperformance by bond mutual funds (Blake, Elton and Gruber

1993, Bogle 1998) and hedge funds (Asness, Krail, and Liew 2001). An important finding of

this work is that fees are higher in riskier (higher beta) asset classes, so that managers appear to

be paid for taking market risk. One would not expect this feature in a standard model of

delegated management, in which only superior performance – alpha – should be rewarded.

Trust, however, naturally accounts for this phenomenon.


        Following Campbell (2006), financial economists have considered the nature and the

consequences of investment advice. Some of these studies suggest that investment advice is so

poor that managers chosen by the advisors underperform the market even before fees. Gil-Bazo

and Ruiz-Verdu (2009) find that the highest fees are charged by managers with the worst

performance. This finding is consistent with a central prediction of our model that managers

cater to investor biases. An audit study by Mullainathan, Noeth, and Schoar (2012) similarly

finds that advisors direct investors toward hot sector funds, pandering to their extrapolative

tendencies. In contrast, unbiased investment advice is ignored (Bhattacharya et al. 2012).




                                                 5
        Our study of incentives in money management follows, but takes a different approach

from, the traditional work on performance incentives (e.g, Chevalier and Ellison 1997, 1999).

Two recent papers that address some of the issues we focus on here, but in the traditional

context in which reputations are shaped entirely by performance, are Guerrieri and Kondor

(2011) and Kaniel and Kondor (2011).        Closer to our work are the papers by Inderst and

Ottaviani (2009, 2012), which focus on distorted incentives to sell financial products arising

both from the difficulties of incentivizing salesmen to sell appropriate products and from actual

kickbacks. Hackethal, Inderst, and Meyer (2011) find empirically that investors who rely more

heavily on advice have a higher volume of security transactions and are more likely to invest in

products which salesmen are incentivized to sell. Our focus is on the incentives of the money

management organization itself when its clients choices are mediated by trust.


        Several papers ask whether agents have incentives to conform or be contrarian. Outside

of finance, Prendergast (1993), Morris (2001), and Mullainathan and Shleifer (2005) present

models in which agents pander to principals.       In finance, a large literature starting with

Scharfstein and Stein (1990) and Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch (1992) describes the

incentives for herding and conformism. The novel feature of our model is its focus on trust as

distinct from performance in shaping incentives.


        In section 2 we present our basic model of trust and delegation. In section 3, we solve

the model and show that even the simplest specification delivers some of the basic facts about

the industry. In section 4 we consider money managers‟ incentives to pander to their clients in a

static model with no benefits to managers of superior performance. In section 5, we study a

dynamic model in which managers can earn an alpha, leading investors to update their estimates

of managerial skill based on past performance. We show that incentives to pander remain

strong even in that model. Section 6 discusses some aggregate implications of our model.




                                               6
2. The Basic Setup


         There are two periods t = 0, 1 and a mass 1 of investors who enjoy consumption at t = 1

according to a utility function that we specify below. At t = 0, each investor is endowed with

one unit of wealth. There are two assets. The first asset is riskless (e.g. treasuries), and yields Rf

> 1 at t = 1. The second asset is risky (e.g., equities or bonds): it yields an excess return R over

the riskless asset, but has a variance of σ. The risky asset is in perfectly elastic supply and

riskless borrowing is unrestricted. One can view this setup as a small open economy where the

supply of assets adjusts to demand. We are thus looking at the portfolio choice problem by

taking asset prices and expected returns as given.


         At t = 0, each investor i invests the shares xi and 1– xi of his wealth in the risky and

riskless asset, respectively. The investor can perfectly access the riskless asset but not the risky

asset. The reason is that the risky asset requires management (e.g., to create a diversified

portfolio) and the investor lacks the necessary expertise. Without expert money managers, the

investor cannot take risk. This implies, in particular, that even an index fund investment

requires a manager or an advisor; the investor does not want to do it on his own.                        The

assumption of no homemade risk taking might seem too strong, but it enables us to make the

points most clearly3. It also sharpens the analogy to medicine, in which patients seek medical

advice for all but the simplest and safest treatments.


         To implement the risky investment xi the investor hires one of two managers, A or B

(for simplicity he cannot hire both). Our key assumption is that delegation requires investor

trust. We capture investor i‟s lack of trust toward manager j = A, B by a parameter ai,j ≥ 1 that

multiplies the investor‟s baseline risk aversion. That is, the cost to an investor i of bearing one

unit of risk with manager j is given by ai,j/2. This idea is formalized by assuming that each

investor i has the following quadratic utility function:


3
  One way to formally model this assumption is to assume                   , i.e. that investors have infinite
anxiety when taking risks on their own (perhaps because they are very uncertain – relative to managers –
on how to build risky portfolios or how to react to market events). It is not important that investors do not
take any risk on their own, but rather that they take more risk with a manager than on their own.

                                                      7
                                        ( )     ( )          ( )


         One can view ai,j as the anxiety suffered by investor i for bearing risk with manager j.

This specification is thus very different from the standard approach to the delegation problem,

in which investors seek advice to achieve a better risk return combination rather than to gain

some comfort or confidence in taking risk.


         Half of the investors trust A more than B, the other half trust B more than A. The

anxiety suffered by investor i for bearing risk with his most trusted manager is equal to a. The

anxiety suffered by the same investor for bearing risk with his least trusted manager is equal to

     , where         [    ].   That is, an “A-trusting” investor i suffers anxiety             with

manager A and                    with manager B; a “B-trusting‟‟ investor i suffers anxiety

        with manager A and              with manager B. Parameter     captures the relative trust of

investor i in his least trusted manager, measuring the extent to which the two managers are

substitutes from the standpoint of investor i. An investor with          views the two managers

as perfect substitutes, while an investor with            views his least trusted manager as an

imperfect substitute for the most trusted one. In particular, when             an investor suffers

infinite anxiety when investing with his least trusted manager.


         Investors are heterogeneous in the extent to which they trust one manager more than the

other. In particular, in the population of investors      is uniformly distributed on [1 – , 1].

Differential trust       is independent of whether an investor trusts A or B more. Parameter

    [     ] captures the dispersion of trust in the population: the higher is , the greater is the

number of investors who trust one manager substantially more than the other.             At    = 0,

investors are homogenous in the sense that they trust the two managers equally: this will be an

important benchmark case of Bertrand competition. With dispersion in trust levels, managers

have some market power with respect to investors who trust them more, and would optimally

charge fees above zero even in a competitive market. Trust is permanent and does not depend

on or change with returns.

         At t = 0, the two money managers compete in fees to attract clients. Each manager j =

A, B optimally chooses what fee fj to charge per unit of assets managed. Based on the fees

simultaneously set by managers, each investor optimally decides how much to invest in the

risky asset and under which manager. At t = 1, returns are realized and distributed to investors.

3. Equilibrium fees and the size of money management


3.1 The investor’s portfolio problem


         The expected utility of an investor i delegating to manager j an amount xi,j of risky

investment is equal to:


                                   (      )                (       )


The investor‟s excess return net of the management fee is equal to               . By investing in the

riskless asset, the investor obtains no excess return and pays no fees.


         Given the fee           the investor chooses a portfolio       maximizing     (         ). This

portfolio is given by:


                                                       (       )
                                                 ̂                                                   ( )


The optimal portfolio is riskier ( ̂           is higher) if the investor hires a more trusted manager

(having lower         ). This effect plays a critical role in determining the fee structure. The utility

obtained by investor i under manager j is then equal to:

                                                       9
                                                                (        )
                                      (̂       )



The investor chooses A over B provided ( ̂                  )       (̂       ), which is equivalent to:


                                                        (           )
                                                                                                            ( )
                                                        (           )


The investor chooses manager A over manager B provided the investor‟s relative trust for A is

sufficient to compensate for the relative excess return (net of fee) promised by B. Because of

constant absolute risk aversion, higher variance            of investment reduces overall risk taking but

not the choice between A and B. That choice is pinned down only by the differential anxiety

and excess return obtained by the investor with the two managers.




3.2 Management fees and risk taking


        Denote by       the optimal amount invested by i under manager j after a manager is

optimally selected in light of equation (2). Then, at a fee structure ( ,              ), the profit of money

manager j charging     is equal to:



                                           (       )            ∫                                           ( )


which is the product of the fee         and assets under management. The profits of manager j

depend on his competitor‟s fee        via the assets under management.


        Let us derive the profits of A. If A charges a higher fee than B, namely if                       , then

the right hand side of Equation (2) is above one. Manager A does not attract any B trusting

investors (for whom                   ); he can only attract some A-trusting ones. These are the A-

trusting investors who have sufficiently low trust in B that they prefer to stick with A despite the




                                                       10
higher fee, and they are identified by the condition                          (          ) (           ) . In this case,

assets under A‟s management are equal to:


                                                     [       (       )   (        ) ]
                             (           )
                                             ∫                                                                        ( )


Expression (4) is the product of the wealth invested by each of the A-trusting investors times the

measure of them that chooses manager A. When                                  , the profits of manager A are the

management fee         times the wealth under management in Equation (4).


        Consider now the case in which A charges a lower fee than B, namely                                              .

Because the right hand side of Equation (2) is below one, manager A attracts all A-trusting

investors as well as some B-trusting investors. The latter investors are those with sufficiently

high trust in A, namely with                 (            ) (            ) . By Equation (1), each B-trusting

investor places under A‟s management only a fraction                         of the wealth invested under A by A-

trusting investors. In this case, assets under A‟s management are equal to:


                        (        )
                                     *       ∫                                                 +                      ( )
                                                 [           (       )   (        ) ]



Expression (5) is the sum of the assets invested by A-trusting investors plus the assets invested

by the B-trusting investors who found it optimal to switch to A. When                                   , the profits of A

are equal to the product of the management fee                   and the assets under management in (5).


        Putting this together, for any (                 ), the profits       (         ) of manager A are equal to:


                   (         )           [       (               ) (              ) ]   (         )

                                                                                                                      ( )
                  (          )                       [           (           ) (            ) ]
                                 *                                                                 +
            {


The profit of manager A increases in the fee charged by B, since a higher                              reduces investors‟

net excess return under B, thus increasing A‟s clientele. In contrast, a higher                                exerts an

ambiguous effect on the profits of A: on the one hand it increases the surplus extracted by the

                                                            11
manager, on the other hand it reduces assets under management (by reducing both investment

by his clients on the intensive margin and the size of his clientele on the extensive margin).


        The profits of manager A increase in the risky asset‟s gross excess return: a higher

encourages any investor to put more money under management, which increases the preference

of A-trusting investors for A. Indeed, manager A allows these investors to take more risk than

manager B by reducing their anxiety, which is particularly valuable when the excess return is

high. Second, a higher dispersion of trust         exerts an ambiguous effect on profits: it increases

them when A offers a lower net return than B (                ), but decreases them otherwise.


        By the same logic, at any (           ), the profit   (         ) of manager B is equal to:


                  (       )                   [        (       ) (               ) ]
                              *                                                        +
                                                                                                            ( )
                  (       )       [       (          ) (          ) ]     (            )
          {

The properties of (7) are analogous to those just discussed in the case of Equation (6).


        Given profits     (       ) and   (         ), a competitive equilibrium in pure strategies is a

Nash Equilibrium in which each manager j optimally sets his fee                   by taking his competitor‟s

equilibrium fee       as given. Formally, an equilibrium is a profile of fees (              ) such that:


                                                                  (        )
                                                                             .
                                                                  (        )


There is a unique competitive equilibrium in our model. This equilibrium is symmetric (owing

to the symmetry of the managers‟ profit functions), and is characterized below.



Proposition 1 In the unique, symmetric, equilibrium of the model, fees are equal to:


                                                       (      )                                             ( )




                                                     12
Each investor delegates his portfolio to his most trusted manager and the total value of assets

under management (which is equally split between A and B) is given by:



                               ∫ (             )        (     )                                  ( )




         The equilibrium fee charged by each manager is a constant fraction of the excess return

R. Intuitively, the manager extracts part of the expected surplus       that he enables the investor

to access. The fraction of excess return extracted by the manager increases in the dispersion of

trust . When       > 0, investors are willing to take more risk with their most trusted manager

than with the least trusted one (or on their own). This imperfect substitutability in anxiety

allows both managers to charge positive fees. When the dispersion of trust becomes maximal

(i.e.,      ), the two managers have huge market power and extract 1/4 of the excess return

from their investors. When, in contrast, investors trust both managers equally,           , investors

would take the same amount of risk with both managers. Perfect competition between these

managers drives fees to zero. The model predicts that fees should be higher in sectors where

dispersion of trust is higher, perhaps owing to the absence of a market index or more generally

of established measures of risk. Higher variance        exerts only a second order effect on investor

utility, so fees are independent of it.


         In our model, management fees are not a compensation for abnormal returns (alpha) but

rather a way to share risky returns (beta) between the investor and the manager. The gross

return of the managed portfolio equals the market excess return , but the net return exhibits a

negative alpha once fees are netted out.           The model thus immediately delivers the most

fundamental fact about delegated portfolio management, namely that professional managers

earn negative market-adjusted returns net of fees. The reason is that investors are willing to pay

for anxiety reduction rather than for alpha.


         Consider finally the size of the money management industry. Potentially, the assets

under management may be higher than the initial wealth of investors, which in the aggregate is

                                                   13
normalized to 1. This case occurs when the expected excess return          is so high that investors

wish to lever up, borrowing at the riskless rate (by setting          ) in order to expand the scale

of their risk taking. The size of the money management industry increases in the excess return

 , decreases in the general level of distrust or anxiety a, and decreases in the dispersion of trust

 . A higher R increases the surplus generated by the risky investment, increasing risk taking,

but also increases management fees, which decrease risk taking. The former effect is stronger,

so the higher excess return R boosts the size of the industry. A higher general level of trust (i.e.,

a lower a) brings more assets out of the mattresses and into the financial system, a finding

documented empirically by Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2004, 2008). At the same time,

higher variance of trust      increases money managers‟ market power, increases management

fees, and thereby reduces the size of the industry. Conditional on investors‟ trust in their

preferred money manager, assets under management are too small owing to management fees.

Still, in this simple model money management has a valuable social role:



Corollary 1 The presence of money managers improves investors’ welfare relative to a world in

which everyone invests on his own. The social benefit of money management is equal to:



                                               (        )



The benefit of money management is to increase risk taking, and this benefit is larger the higher

is the risk adjusted return     , the higher is average trust a, and the lower is .


        The basic model might thus help shed light on the central finding of the literature on

financial advice, namely that many investors seek it despite extremely high cost and poor

investment performance (e.g., Bergstresser et al. 2009, Chalmers and Reuter 2012, Del Guercio

et al. 2010). In our view, investors see themselves as better off with the advice than without it

since advice alleviates their anxiety about risk and enables them to take more risk. Chalmers

and Reuter (2012) actually show empirically that, among the investors predicted based on their


                                                   14
demographic characteristics to use financial advisors, those who actually use them hold

portfolios with sharply higher betas (.4 higher) than those who do not use advice. As investors

are increasingly asked to choose how to allocate their savings, rather than participate in, say,

defined benefit plans, they need to make choices about risky investments or just put money in

the bank.    Financial advice in our model helps them take risk, even when it is generic (or

worse). With positive expected returns to risk taking, advice makes investors better off.




4. Multiple Financial Products


        So far, we allowed money managers to offer investors a single, well diversified, risky

portfolio (e.g., the S&P 500). In reality, institutions such as mutual fund families, financial

planners, and brokerage firms offer a broad range of assets and sector-specific investment

options and investors individually choose how much to invest in each of them. To understand

this practice, we allow money managers to break down their product line into specialized asset

classes and then let investors choose among them. These asset classes are also portfolios

assembled by the manager - so trust is still important - but they individually are not fully

diversified (e.g., they consist of only industrial or high-tech stocks).


        We examine this model under two alternative assumptions. First, in section 4.1, we

consider the case of rational expectations, so that investors and managers accurately anticipate

the distribution of future returns. The questions we ask in this setup are: first, what is the

relationship between the fee charged for each risky asset and the asset‟s expected return? And

second, does trust-mediated money management distort wealth allocation across assets?


        In section 4.2, we revisit the issue of investment distortions when investors do not hold

rational expectations, but money managers do. For example, investors might extrapolate returns

on some assets and chase categories that previously performed well, or seek to invest in new

products. Extrapolation has been discussed extensively in behavioral finance, both with respect

to individual securities and markets (e.g., Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny 1994, Barberis,

                                                 15
Shleifer, and Vishny 1998), and with respect to mutual funds (e.g., Lamont and Frazzini 2008).

In Section 4.2, we allow for such investor misperceptions and ask whether money managers

find it profitable to pander to investor tastes, or to choose fees to correct their errors. This

approach also allows us to address what appears to be the empirically relevant possibility of

investment advisors underperforming passive strategies even before fees (Malkiel 1995, Gil-

Bazo and Ruiz-Verdu 2009, Del Guercio et al 2010), as well as to study the determinants of

product proliferation in the money management industry.


        The formal structure works as follows. There are two uncorrelated risky assets, 1 and 2.

Asset z = 1, 2 yields excess return     with variance    . Without loss of generality, we assume

that asset 1 has lower risk and return than asset 2, namely         and           . Let    denote

the wealth invested by a generic investor i in asset z = 1, 2. We then have:


Lemma 1 For any total amount (          +     ) of risky investment, investors’ optimal portfolio

places a relative share       ( ) ( ) of wealth in asset 1 relative to asset 2.


        This optimal portfolio represents the normative benchmark of our analysis, under the

assumptions of rational expectations and no management fees. In this respect, it is useful to

view the excess return R and the variance     of the risky asset in the previous section as those

delivered by the optimal portfolio of Lemma 1.




4.1 The link between fees and risk under rational expectations


        Money managers offer assets 1 and 2 separately, and at different fees, to investors. We

seek to describe the equilibrium fee structure and the resulting pattern of risk taking. At t = 0,

each manager j = A, B optimally sets the fees (               ) for investing in asset 1 and 2,

respectively. Given fees (        ), each investor i decides whether to invest in asset z = 1, 2

under manager A or B and how much to invest in each asset. By so doing, investors choose - in

a decentralized fashion - the composition of their portfolios. Managers affect portfolios via the

                                               16
equilibrium fee structure (         ). We assume that investors correctly perceive the return of

different assets, but relax this assumption in Section 4.2.


        Denote by xi,j,z investor i‟s optimal investment in asset z = 1, 2 under manager j = A, B.

Given the management fee        , the analysis of Section 3 implies that the investor chooses:


                                                (              )
                                        ̂                                                         (     )


The investor places more wealth in the asset having the highest risk adjusted excess return (net

of fees). With this investment strategy, the analysis of Section 3 immediately implies that a

generic investor i delegates his investment in asset z to manager A (rather than B) provided the

utility he earns from holding z is higher under manager A. This is equivalent to:


                                                        (          )
                                                                                                  (     )
                                                        (          )


Expression (11) says that the relative trust of investor i in manager A is sufficient to compensate

for the relative excess return promised by B on risky asset z.


        Define       as the optimal investment after (11) is taken into account. Then, at t = 0,

money managers set their fees (                         ). The profit of money manager j is equal to:



                            (                  )             ∫                ∫                   (     )


which is the sum of the fees obtained from assets under management in the two risky assets.


        Given the additive objective function in (12), manager A maximizes the sum of two

profit functions – one for asset 1, the other for asset 2 – each of which is identical to that in

Equation (6), but defined for a different return-variance configuration. The same principle holds

for manager B, whose overall profit function adds two asset-specific versions of Equation (7).

By solving for the Nash equilibrium of this game, we can characterize the market equilibrium:




                                                   17
Proposition 2 In the unique, symmetric, competitive equilibrium fees are equal to:


                                                 (       )                                    (   )


Investors take risk only with their most trusted manager and they select asset shares:



                                                                                              (   )



The total amount of assets managed (equally split between A and B) is equal to:



                      ∫ ∑          (              )      (      ) ∑                           (   )




        As in Section 3, manager specific trust (        ) allows money managers to get paid for

taking risk, and in particular to extract a fixed share of the excess return of any asset they offer

to investors. As a consequence, manager specific trust helps explain the fact that money

managers charge higher unit fees for investing in high return-high risk asset classes. For

example, Bogle (1998) finds that higher expense ratio bond funds tend to offset their higher fees

by taking both more credit risk and more duration risk. Our model further predicts that the link

between fees and return should be steeper when trust dispersion           is higher. Perhaps this

prediction might shed light on incentive fees in hedge funds and private equity funds, where

trust plays such a fundamental role in mediating investments.


        When investors correctly perceive the return of different assets, they choose the optimal

portfolio mix of Lemma 1 (see Equation (16)). The size of the money management industry

does not change relative to the case in which managers offer the portfolio of Lemma 1, because

under the sharing rule of Equation (13) the total fee paid by investors for taking risk is the same

constant share of the portfolio‟s expected return. As we show next, these results change when

investors misperceive the returns of different assets.




                                                18
4.2 Investors’ misperceptions, product proliferation and pandering


        Suppose now that investors have potentially erroneous (but homogeneous) beliefs

concerning the excess returns created by the two risky assets. The perception of variances is

correct. Investors believe that the excess return of asset z is         , where subscript e denotes

investors‟ expectation. Beliefs are erroneous whenever                  for at least one asset z = 1,

2. We focus on the case in which investors invert the ranking among excess returns, namely

            . We refer to asset 1 as the “hot asset” and asset 2 as the “cold asset”. One

justification for this assumption is that after observing a streak of relatively high returns in asset

1, investors become too optimistic about it (Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny 1998). This implies,

owing to mean reversion, that asset 2 is actually the one in which the investment is most

profitable. The best strategy from the investor‟s viewpoint is contrarian. In this section, we

consider the manager‟s static incentives; in Section 5 we examine the possibility that superior

performance attracts more funds under management.


        To extend Proposition 2 to the case in which investors misperceive excess returns, it

suffices to note that risk taking by investors in Equation (10) and their choice of manager in

Equation (11) are shaped by the perceived return         of asset z and not by its true return   . As

a consequence, management fees are equal to a constant fraction of investors‟ perceived return:


                                                    (     )                                      (   )


and investors allocate their wealth across assets according to their perceived returns, namely:




In this situation, the following property holds:




                                                   19
Corollary 2 In the unique, symmetric, equilibrium prevailing when managers offer the two

assets separately, fees are higher for investing in the hot asset than in the cold asset and

investors invest too much in hot assets relative to the case of Lemma 1.



        Because managers optimally extract a constant fraction of an asset‟s perceived return,

total fees are higher for “hot” assets, such as growth stocks as compared to value stocks, or

specialty funds compared to diversified funds, but investors still want to disproportionally invest

in them. Money managers maximize their profits by encouraging, or at least not discouraging,

investors to take excessive risks in hot asset classes. In this sense, competition incentivizes

money managers to pander to investors‟ biases rather than to correct them.


        Money managers could in principle correct investor misperceptions by suitably

choosing their fees so as to effectively debias investors. To do so, managers would need to set a

higher fee on the hot asset class so that investors choose to hold the two assets in the

proportions dictated by Lemma 1. Equivalently, money managers could directly offer investors

the optimal portfolio of Lemma 1 rather than the two assets separately. It is evident from the

above analysis that money managers do not have the incentive to do so. To see why, consider

the managers‟ equilibrium profits.      Given the perceived returns (             ), a manager‟s

equilibrium profit is proportional to the average squared perceived return across the two assets:


                                            ∑                                                (      )


Intuitively, a higher perceived return on asset class z benefits the manager in two multiplicative

ways. First, it increases the fee charged by the manager. Second, it increases investors‟ risk

taking and thus the asset base over which the fee is collected. These effects imply that a

manager‟s profits are quadratic in each expected return      .


        Denote by               √    the Sharpe ratio perceived by investors for asset              .

We can rewrite the profit in Equation (17) as:


                                                 20
                                       (    )         (   )                                  (   )


where mean and variance are computed by weighting each asset by 1/2. The manager benefits

from giving freedom of choice to investors owing to both the average Sharpe ratio and its

variance. The higher is the average Sharpe ratio that investors think they can expect to attain by

choosing assets, the greater is the risk they take and the higher is the manager‟s income. In

addition, for a given average Sharpe ratio, the manager benefits from the variance of Sharpe

ratios across assets arising from the potential volatility of investor sentiment. Such volatility

enables managers to extract very high fees from investors chasing hot asset classes. From the

viewpoint of the manager, although chasing returns causes under-investment in cold assets, it is

more than offset by the greater risk taking and by the greater fees charged in hot assets.


        Corollary 2 might help account for a great deal of evidence mentioned in the

introduction about poor performance of mutual funds, their high fees, and the negative

relationship between performance and high fees. Poor performance in our model results from

investing in overvalued assets, which investors prefer when they form extrapolative

expectations. Such a portfolio allocation in turn enables managers or advisors to charge higher

fees. In fact, in our model higher fees are precisely a consequence of managers pandering to

investor preference for assets that are overvalued. The model thus accounts for the findings of

Gil-Bazo and Ruiz-Verdu (2009) and Del Guercio et al (2010). It is also consistent with the

evidence of Mullainathan et al. (2012) that advisors direct investors toward hot sector funds.


        Both the proliferation of investment options and the prevalence of fund families

naturally arise in our model. Mutual fund families can be interpreted as a vehicle to harness

trust and increase profits across multiple asset classes (Massa 2003).            Proliferation of

investment options within asset classes helps raise demand for risky assets (and fees) from

trusting investors who chase returns. The same interpretation would apply to private wealth

management firms with extensive in-house portfolio capabilities.         A trusted advisor has a




                                                21
strong incentive to offer a wide range of products to his clients, who can then move funds

around while paying the advisor‟s fees.


           The central role of fees in the above reasoning highlights the importance of investors‟

trust for giving managers the incentive to pander to investor biases. It is precisely because trust

allows the manager to extract some surplus that he benefits from encouraging investors to chase

hot sectors. If markets were highly competitive, then managers would see limited benefits from

exploiting investor misperceptions, and might choose to act benevolently and encourage their

clients to invest appropriately. The next section formally investigates this issue by considering

the case in which investors use ex-post performance of a money manager to infer his ability.




5. Investor extrapolation and pandering by money managers


           The previous section showed that in our model money managers have strong incentives

to pander to investors‟ misperception of returns. The static setup of the analysis, however,

excludes by assumption the classic motive that managers have for investing in undervalued

assets, namely to earn superior returns, establish a reputation for being skilled, and attract

clients.    We now introduce this motivation for contrarianism into our model by allowing

managers to earn a positive alpha and attract funds. We show how trust limits the effectiveness

of this force: when      is higher, the incentive for pandering over contrarianism is stronger, and

money doctors are more likely to pander to investors‟ biases than they are when       is lower.


           To see this formally, suppose that there are three periods t = 0, 1, 2 and two generations

of one period lived investors, one born at t = 0, the other born at t = 1. We simplify the analysis

by assuming that now managers select portfolios for their clients, rather than using fees to direct

portfolio selection. At the cost of greater complexity, we could have continued with the more

decentralized framework of the previous sections.




                                                  22
           At t = 0, managers choose their fees and select portfolios for the first generation of

investors who entrust them their wealth. At t = 1, investors belonging to the new generation are

born, they update their beliefs on managerial ability based on interim returns, and choose

managers. Returns do not influence trust, so the distribution of trust among investors toward A

and B is the same at t = 0 and t = 1. The return of asset z = 1, 2 in period t = 1, 2 under manager

j = A, B is now given by:


                                         ̃                                                     (   )


In (19),      is the excess return of asset class z, which we assume to be deterministic.   captures

the ability of manager j to assemble a portfolio of sector z assets,       is a serially uncorrelated

shock capturing the manager‟s luck in constructing his portfolio. Managers and investors are

symmetrically uninformed about         , which is normally distributed with mean zero and variance

  at t = 0. The distribution of luck     is also normal, with mean zero and variance η.


           The main simplification of Equation (19) is that all volatility in returns is manager-

specific. As a consequence, there is no motive for diversifying portfolios across assets z = 1, 2.

It is optimal for the investor to invest only in asset 2, because (as previously assumed) it has the

highest true expected return. Of course, if a manager panders to investors, he invests all their

capital in asset 1, because investors expect asset 1 to deliver the highest return. We could add a

diversification motive to the model, but at the cost of added complexity.


           We denote by      the portfolio share that manager j invests in asset class 1. Because

now the manager also chooses the expected return of the portfolio, it is useful to express fees

per unit of return. Formally, we denote by        the fee charged by the manager per unit of return,

so that the total fee is equal to      . This change in notation renders the model more tractable

by separating the decision of which return to deliver from its division between the manager and

the investor. None of our previous results change under this reformulation. Denote by (            )




                                                  23
the fee and portfolio chosen by the manager at t = 0, and by (                             ) the fee and portfolio

chosen by the manager at t = 1. Figure 2 represents the timeline of the model.




                t=0                                            t=1                                         t=2

    Each manager j = A, B sets               Returns on portfolios are realized, new               Returns on portfolios

    Investors choose a manager               Each manager j = A, B sets a new fee
                                             and portfolio (𝜑𝑗 𝜔𝑗 )

                                             New investors choose a manager


                            Figure 2: Timeline of the model with managerial skill


            Before solving the model, consider how investors assess managerial ability after

observing portfolio returns at t = 1. Denote the realized return of manager j at t = 1 by:


                     ̃           ̃       (          )̃                   (         )                          (   )


To infer ability, investors: i) compute the difference between the realized return ̃                     and their

ex-ante expectation of it, and ii) divide that unexpected return into a skill and a luck component.

The attribution of unexpected returns to skill or luck is determined with Bayesian updating. We

assume throughout that investors do not update their beliefs about assets 1 and 2.4


            With Bayesian updating, investors allocate a share                         (      ) of a portfolio‟s

unexpected return to the skill of its manager, and the remaining portion to luck. In particular,

after observing returns ̃ , investors‟ posterior belief about the ability of manager j is normally

distributed with mean ̃              [   (̃                )    (         )( ̃             )] (   ) and variance

       (       ). From the perspective of t = 0, then, the future assessed ability of manager j is

normally distributed with mean:

4
 Formally, the investor has a concentrated prior on the assets‟ returns. We could allow the investor to
make Bayesian updating both on managerial ability and on excess return, but this would greatly
complicate the analysis. It is however easy to study the model under the assumption that investors
mechanically downgrade an asset after observing its bad performance.

                                                           24
                         ̃     [   (           )   (        )(           )] (       )                   (   )


and variance . The critical property of Equation (21) is that the manager can systematically

inflate his assessed ability (i.e., he can boost    ̃ ) by investing more in the undervalued asset 2.

Because this asset is undervalued, increasing investment in it (reducing                  ) generates an

abnormally positive return (               ), and induces investors to upgrade their estimates of

managerial skill.5 This effect is stronger the higher is the signal to noise ratio           .


        This effect creates the classic motive for contrarianism: invest in undervalued assets,

obtain positive abnormal returns, establish a favorable reputation, and attract more clients in the

future. We now solve for the equilibrium for the model to see how this effect plays out against

the incentive to pander described in Section 4.




5.1 Updating on managerial ability and market equilibrium at t = 1


        Consider how managers compete at t = 1 after the returns ( ̃                     ̃       ) on initial

portfolios are realized. Given investors‟ average ability assessments ( ̃ ̃ ) at                      , each

manager assembles a new portfolio            and sets a new fee        . Note the critical asymmetry:

holding portfolios constant, the more able manager delivers a higher excess return than the less

able one, looking more attractive to investors. Formally, if at t = 1 manager j chooses portfolio

    then investors expect the resulting excess return to be normally distributed with mean:


                                                       (         )       ̃                              (   )


and variance         (   )
                                   In line with Section 3, for a given portfolio-fee bundle (               ),

an investor i optimally delegates his portfolio to manager A if and only if:

5
 Again, this logic goes through under the alternative assumption that upon observing an unexpectedly
high return investors upgrade their beliefs over both managerial ability and the return of the asset in
which the manager‟s portfolio is intensive. The main shortcoming in this case is that the algebra is
substantially more complex. The real restriction in our analysis concerns the naivete of investors, who are
assumed not to infer anything about asset quality when seeing the manager‟s portfolio choices at t = 0.

                                                    25
                                            (       ) (     )
                                                                                              (   )
                                            (       ) (     )


In equation (23),          is the share of return going to investors under manager j. By exploiting

equation (23), one can derive the profit functions of the two managers, which are analogous to

those in Equations (6) and (7). In these profit functions, the payoff of manager j increases in the

perceived excess return       of his portfolio: the higher is such excess return, the higher are his

assets under management and the total fee he can charge. We thus obtain:


Lemma 2 In equilibrium, at t = 1 both managers set        (̃ ̃ )        for all ( ̃ ̃ ).


        At t = 1 all managers invest in the hot asset class 1, because we assumed that investors‟

perceptions of returns do not vary over time. Not much would change if we allowed investor

perceptions to vary: at t = 1 all managers would invest in whatever asset is expected by

investors to yield the highest return. This is not surprising. In the last period, both managers

pander because they see no reputational gain from being contrarian.


        In light of Lemma 2, investors expect manager j to return                     ̃ . Although

managers choose identical portfolios, their expected returns differ owing to perceived ability

differences. This asymmetry, as well as the nonlinearity of profit functions, implies that we

cannot solve for equilibrium fees in closed form. We characterize the key properties of the

model by linearly approximating fees and profits around the unique symmetric equilibrium that

prevails at t = 1 if managers have zero average ability ̃               ̃         This is a good

approximation provided the variance        of ability is low (so that the curvature of the profit

function plays no role).



Proposition 3 For given posterior average abilities ( ̃ ̃ ), the linear approximation of

managerial fees at t = 1 around (0, 0) is given by:


                      (̃ ̃ )           (        )          ( )̃         ( )̃                  (   )

                                                    26
where    ( ),      ( ) are positive coefficients. The corresponding linear approximation of

profits at t = 1 around (0,0) is given by:


                            (̃ ̃ )             { ( )     ( )̃       ( )̃ }                  (   )


where    ( ),    ( ) are also positive coefficients.



        In Equation (24) the fee charged by a manager rises with his assessed talent ̃ and

decreases with the assessed talent of his competitor ̃ . A manager estimated to be more

talented: i) attracts more clients, and ii) has more surplus to extract from them (because he

delivers higher expected returns). Both effects drive up his fee. In contrast, a manager facing a

more able competitor must cut his fee in order not to lose too many clients. These

considerations translate into equilibrium profits, which in Equation (25) increase in the

manager‟s own estimated talent and decrease in that of his competitor. The sensitivity of profits

to managerial ability depends on trust. Trust reduces investor mobility, which has two effects.

First, higher trust allows the talented manager to extract more from his trusting client. Second,

higher trust reduces the pool of clients a manager can gain. As we show in the next section,

these effects shape the tradeoff between pandering and contrarianism.




5.2 Equilibrium at t = 0: The pandering vs. contrarianism tradeoff


        At t = 0 managers choose a fee and a portfolio (          ) to maximize their expected

discounted profits, where the discount factor is assumed to be equal to        [   ]. The inter-

temporal linkage between a manager‟s strategy at t = 0 and his future payoff at t = 1 is due to

updating of ability. A manager placing a higher share     of his portfolio in the overvalued asset

1 realizes that doing so reduces his own assessed talent by Equation (21), which reduces his

future fee and profit by Proposition 3.



                                                 27
        To see this formally, denote by ( ̃ |            ) the          (normal) distribution of average

ability at t = 1 conditional on the manager choosing portfolio                      at t = 0. Denote by

  (                ) the profit of the same manager j at t = 0 and by               ( ̃ ̃ ) the manager‟s

equilibrium profits at t = 1 when the assessed abilities are ( ̃ ̃ ). At t = 0, then, the

manager‟s optimal strategy solves:


                       (                )       ∬    (̃ ̃ ) (̃ |         ) (̃ |       ) ̃    ̃        (   )


The portfolio      affects not only current profits but also future profits via the conditional

distribution of managerial ability ( ̃ |    ).


        The equilibrium (                   ) at t = 0 is a Nash Equilibrium where each manager

maximizes (26) taking as given the other manager‟s strategy. Simple inspection of the first

derivative of the discounted profit of a given manager, say A, with respect to his investment

in the overvalued asset illuminates the pandering vs. contrarianism tradeoff:


                   (                )                            (̃ |    )
                                            ∬       (̃ ̃ )                   (̃ |    ) ̃     ̃        (   )


The first term is weakly positive and captures the marginal benefit of pandering: by increasing

   , the manager attracts more clients and charges a higher fee, increasing current profits. The

second term is negative and captures the marginal cost of pandering: by investing more in the

overvalued asset, the manager reduces his future ability (in a first order stochastically dominated

sense), thereby reducing his assets, fees, and profits at t = 1.


        To see the role of trust, suppose that the managers pander (                         ) and consider

the incentive for A to deviate to contrarianism                   . In the absence of trust (             ),

manager A sees no cost of deviating. True, after investing in asset 2 at t = 0 the manager loses

his clients to B. However, when                  his current profits are zero anyway! Deviating to

contrarianism is thus beneficial, for it allows A to gain a reputation, many new clients, assets,

and profits at t = 1 (this is the second term in (27)). Hence, when                 , the classic motive for

                                                    28
contrarianism is strong and there is no equilibrium in which both managers pander. Matters are

different when trust is strong (         is high).       Now both managers make large profits from

pandering at t = 0. When deviating to contrarianism, A must cut fees and profits at t = 0.

Although in the future A is likely to look more skilled than B, he will not attract many new

clients precisely because     is high. In this case, the incentive to become a contrarian is too low.


        To fully characterize the conditions under which pandering does and does not prevail,

we exploit the characterization of future profits of Proposition 3 (i.e., Equation (25)).6 We

simplify the algebra by assuming that the extent of misperception is the same across the two

asset classes and equal to                                    . We can now establish:



Proposition 4 In equilibrium, manager j either behaves as a full panderer (                  ) or as a full

contrarian (         ). Pandering by both managers (                        ) is an equilibrium provided:



                                                     (            )   ( )                             (     )
                                    (            )


where     ( ) increases in     . Since     ( )           , when       there is never an equilibrium in

which both managers pander.



        Proposition 4 is the key result of this section. It is precisely the presence of manager-

specific trust that makes possible the existence of an equilibrium in which both managers

pander to investor misperceptions. When manager-specific trust is strong ( is sufficiently

high) investor mobility is low. This implies, first, that the manager can charge high fees to his

clients at t = 0, extracting much of the return they expect.                 If the manager deviates to

contrarianism, he will have to cut his fee, losing substantial profits at t = 0. Second, a high

implies that the manager does not benefit much from contrarianism because, even if he earns a


6
 The t = 0 profit is not linearized (unlike that at t = 1). This is akin to focusing on cases where hot and
cold sectors bring sharply different returns (i.e.,             and are large), so that linearization is not
viable at t = 0. We thus capture the case where investor misperception is large relative to updating of
ability. We later discuss what happens when both misperceptions and updating of ability are small.

                                                         29
higher return, he is unable to attract many new clients in the future. By reducing the extent to

which managers can gain market share based on their ability, trust reduces the manager‟s

incentive to bet against investors‟ beliefs.


        Of course, Equation (28) shows that it is not always the case that pandering is optimal in

equilibrium, even if        . For this to be the case, the future profits from contrarianism should

be sufficiently discounted (i.e.    should be low), assessments of managerial ability should not

be too sensitive to performance (i.e.       (     ) cannot be too large), and investors should be

sufficiently bullish about the hot sector (i.e.           must be sufficiently high).


        When instead there is no trust (          ), at least one money manager, or both, specializes

in the cold asset 2. In particular, the appendix proves that when             there is a threshold ̂

such that neither manager panders in equilibrium provided                ̂ . In this case, all money

doctors behave benevolently, prescribing the right treatment to their clients.


        To sum up, the model says that when fees/profits are low, money managers have the

incentive to gain market share in the future by investing in undervalued assets today. When

instead fees/profits are high, money managers have the incentive to exploit their current market

power by pandering to investors‟ beliefs. These different equilibrium configurations have

important social welfare implications. Because the return in the cold sector is higher than in the

hot one (i.e.,             ), managers behaving as “benevolent doctors” facilitate desirable

financial intermediation, while panderers “abuse” investor trust, reducing social welfare.




6. Implications.


        An important message of our model of money management mediated by trust is that, in

many circumstances, managers have a strong incentive to pander to their investors‟ beliefs. The

incentive for contrarianism is much weaker than it would be if clients were foot-loose. In

situations when investor beliefs are misguided, and highly correlated across investors, money

                                                   30
managers pursue similar strategies pandering to these misguided beliefs, while dividing the

market based on the trust of their clients.


        This message has a number of significant implications. First, it suggests that the forces

of arbitrage in financial markets might be weaker than one might have thought. Previous

research has focused on the limits of arbitrage because arbitrage is risky, or because arbitrageurs

have limited access to capital (e.g., DeLong et al. 1990, Shleifer and Vishny 1997). Here we

show that, in effect, professional money managers who are perfectly capable of arbitrage

themselves turn into noise traders, because doing so brings them higher fees from their trusting

investors. With massive amounts of investor wealth guided by such trust relationships, capital

following noise trading strategies is increased, and arbitrage capital correspondingly

diminished. In equilibrium, markets become more volatile.


        Second, when many investors seek a particular hot product, such as internet stocks or

bonds promising a higher yield without extra risk, competing money managers cater to their

demands and help destabilize prices. The technology bubble in the US saw mutual funds

shifting into technology stocks, and even so-called “value investors” turning to “growth-at-the-

right-price” strategies, which essentially amounted to chasing the bubble. More recently, prime

money market funds shifted into short term “safe” liabilities of financial institutions yielding

higher rates than Treasury bills. We have not modeled endogenous price determination here,

but one can see how such investment strategies can be destabilizing. In particular, as more

money managers cater to investor beliefs, prices of securities investors favor will tend to rise,

which will only encourage these strategies in the short run, as well as improve managerial

reputations (see Barberis and Shleifer 2003).        The long run in which contrarianism pays

becomes even longer and less attractive from the viewpoint of profit-maximizing managers.


        Third, we have focused on trust-mediated investment choices in markets, but one could

imagine similar considerations operating in banks. In the middle of a real estate bubble,

shareholders or directors of a bank might think it most prudent and profitable to expand the



                                                31
lending activity. A bank manager might wish to pander to that view, so as to raise her pay and

keep her job. This incentive exists and might be strong despite the bankers‟ own views of the

wisdom of real estate lending. For, as we have shown, the trust relationship raises the relative

payoff from pandering versus contrarianism and long-term reputation building.                The

consequence is excessive lending to real estate, which in the short run only sustains the bubble,

and reinforces the incentive to lend more.


        In conclusion, however, we should not forget the central point of trust-mediated money

management, namely that it enables investors to take risks, and earn returns, that they might

otherwise not obtain.    There are surely significant distortions in portfolio allocation, and

possibly aggregate implications for banks and other financial institutions. Such distortions are

inevitable when investors exhibit psychological biases, and are resistant to education and

debiasing (e.g., Laibson 2009). When lack of knowledge further interferes with the ability of

investors to identify experts they can rely on and trust, the ability of market competition to

direct resources efficiently is even more limited.

7. Proofs

Proof of Proposition 1 Consider the expressions for                   (            ) and    (       ) in Equations (6)
and (7). For any      , in equilibrium we must have:

                                                    [√                         ]
                                                                  √
Otherwise only one manager makes zero profits. This manager could cut his fee and make some
positive profits as well. This condition alone implies that when           the unique equilibrium
features             . When          , the equilibrium must be interior to the above interval and
satisfy the managers‟ first order conditions. When           these first order conditions are:

                        (          ) *(              )        (       )+             (          )


                                                          (           )
                             (           )                                           (          )
                                             [                             ]

The two above equations cannot be jointly satisfied for                            . To see this, set     (     ) and
solve the above first order conditions for      and     as a function of . Next, impose the
condition       . This identifies a quadratic equation in that cannot be satisfied for ( )
√      .    As a result, the only possible equilibrium featuring             is symmetric, namely
        . It is straightforward to check that in such equilibrium Equation (8) of Proposition 1 is
met. When             , the same argument shows that           is the only equilibrium fulfilling the
above first order conditions. It is immediate to see that at this symmetric equilibrium the second
order conditions are met (i.e. managers‟ objective functions are locally concave).


Proof of Corollary 1 Without managers, investors do not obtain any excess return. With money
managers, each investor invests             ( ) at excess return        under his most trusted
manager. Owing to quadratic utility, the aggregate welfare gain is equal to that of Corollary 1.


Proof of Lemma 1 Given investment                , the optimal mixture (                   ) of assets 1 and 2 solves:

                                     [                        ]       [                     ]

subject to                  . The first order conditions of the problem are equal to:



where is the Lagrange multiplier attached to the constraint                      . It is easy to see
that the above first order conditions are satisfied at the portfolio of Lemma 1.


Proof of Proposition 2 Because investors separately choose the manager under which to invest
a specific asset and the amount to invest in the latter, the profit of each manager j is separable in
the two assets and equal to (            )      (           ). Thus, managers compete on the two
assets separately and, for each of those, equilibrium fees and investments follow from
Proposition 1, yielding Equations (13), (14), and (15).

                                                         33
Proof of Corollary 2 The equilibrium under investors‟ misperception is found by replacing in
Proposition 2 the true return of asset z with investors‟ expected return. The properties
enunciated in Corollary 2 then follow.


Proof of Proposition 3 Suppose that at t = 1 investors assess average abilities to be ( ̃ ̃ ).
Then, at policies ( , , ,     ), manager maximizes the objective function:

                                                       (             )
                 (           )                 *                                  (            )+
                                                       (             )
                                                                         (                 )
                 (               )             *                                             +
            {                                                            (                 )

Where                        (             )               ̃ ,                                      ,             , and        (
                                                                              (       )
   )    . On the other hand, manager B maximizes the objective function:

                                                                          (                )
                 (               )             *                                             +
                                                                          (                )
                                                       (             )
                 (           )                 *                                  (            )+
            {                                          (             )

In the above objective functions, managers wish to maximize the perceived return on their
portfolio. As a result, at t = 1 they set    =    =1, investing in the hot asset. Consider now how
fees are set, starting with the case where                    . This can only occur when          ,
which corresponds to      ̃     ̃   . We later discuss what happens when the reverse inequality
holds, namely when ̃          ̃ . If                , the managers‟ first order conditions are:

                                                   (             )                                          (       )
                     (               ) *                                  (               )+
                                                   (             )                                          (       )

                                                                     (                )                     (       )
                         (            )*                                                +
                                                                     (                )                     (       )

These conditions identify two equations (                    )     and (                )     .
As we cannot characterize the equilibrium in closed form, we linearize the solution of the two
above first order conditions around the symmetric equilibrium where ̃     ̃      , which is the
symmetric equilibrium we studied in Proposition 1. Around (0,0), we have that ( ̃ ̃ )
  ( )          ̃         ̃ , for j = A, B. Proposition 1 showed that ( )           (      ). To
find    , we must compute, at ̃                    ̃            (i.e., at returns                               ), the 2 by 2 matrix:


                                           (       )       (                                            )

Which linearizes the first order conditions at ̃                              ̃            . We then have, for all j = A ,B:



                                               (       )

                                                            (            )            (             )


                                                                     34
After some tedious algebra, one can see that:



                             (      )
                                        (                                                         )

Additional algebra shows that:




By using these expressions, and by solving the respective linear system, we find that:

                      (           )(      )                    (                          )
                                 (      ) [(             )(                      )            (       )(           )]
                       (             )(     )                      (                          )
                                   (     )    [(          )(                         )            (     )(              )]

Thus, around (0,0) managerial fees increase in own ability and drop in the competitor‟s ability.
By using the same procedure one can check that these properties also hold for ̃        ̃ . The
only difference when ̃     ̃ the above expression for        holds for     while     holds for
      . As a result of these computations, for any deviation of abilities from (0,0) it is possible to
define coefficients        ( )          and   ( )                      so that Equation (24) holds.

Consider now the linearization of profits. Using the envelope theorem, the total variation of
manager k = A, B profits after a marginal increase in , for j = A , B, is equal to

             . After some algebra, one can find that when ̃                ̃ :


                                                    [                                 ]
                                                                       (             )
                                                    [                                 ]
                                                                       (             )

By plugging in the above equations the change in fees, we find                                    ,          and
and            . The same properties are found to hold for ̃                         ̃ . Thus, for any deviation

( ̃ ̃ ) from (0,0) one can find the coefficients         ( )           ,         ( )                  of Equation (25).


Proof of Proposition 4 Let us start with the case in which there is no trust, namely          . In
this case, there is Bertrand competition among money managers and we do not need to rely on
the linearization of Proposition 3 to find the equilibrium. Suppose that in equilibrium managers
pander (                ). In this equilibrium, managers make zero profits at t = 0. At t = 1, the
manager with higher assessed ability captures the entire while the other makes zero profits.

         Consider now the outcome attained at t = 1 by manager A. When ̃            ̃ , he captures
the full market. If ̃                ̃ , the fee A can charge is restricted by what investors can
obtain with manager B. In formulas, manager A charges a fee           ̃     ̃ so that investors are
just indifferent (but they all invest with A). At this fee, the manager‟s profit is proportional to

                                                    35
(     ̃ )( ̃     ̃ ). If instead ̃             ̃ , manager A is so talented that he can act as a
monopolist. As a result, he charges a fee       (       ̃ ) and his profit is proportional to
(     ̃ ) . Thus, when             the future expected profit of manager A are proportional to:

                                                                        (                )
                             ̃                                                                                        ̃ )
                                                                                                 (
          ∫        *∫            (           ̃ )( ̃        ̃ )          ∫                                                   + (̃ ̃ |          ) ̃        ̃
                       ̃                                                                 ̃

Where      (        ) is defined to be equal to the integral. Since the profit of manager A
increases in ̃ , the manager wishes to boost as much as possible his ability at t = 1. As a result,
full pandering is never an equilibrium. If                   , the above expression is not just the
expected profit at t = 1 but the entire profit that A can obtain across the two periods. As a result,
both managers gain by deviating to contrarianism               . By so doing, they do not lose any
current profit (which is zero anyway), but boost future profits.

Consider now the possibility for both managers to act as contrarians, again when              . By
being contrarian, the two managers make zero profits in this period. If manager A deviates to
pandering (i.e. he sets      ) he can attract the entire market at t = 0. The optimal fee is equal
to            (                ) , and the resulting gain in t = 0 profits is equal to
  (                )
      (        )
                       Manager A then sees no benefit of deviating to pandering when the above gain is
smaller than the second period cost. This is equivalent to:

                                                (                   )                (                            )
                                                    (           )       [       (        )                    (        )]

Under the above condition, the unique equilibrium prevailing for                                                               is full contrarianism.

        Consider the case in which there is trust, namely             We now look for conditions
under which a pandering equilibrium with                      emerges. In such an equilibrium,
using the linearized profits of Equation (25), the expected profit of manager A at t = 1 is:

                                     { ( )          ( )[        (                        )           (                 )(           )] (          )

                                               ( )[        (                     )           (                    )(             )] (        )}

By contrast, at t = 0 the profit of the manager at full pandering is equal to:

                                                            (               )
                                                        (               )            (                   )

If manager A deviates to contrarianism, he loses his t = 0 profit but gains                                                                       ( )(
          ) in the future. By substituting in the profit gain the condition for ( ) obtained in
          )(
the case where ̃      ̃ (which would be on average true after a deviation to contrarianism),
pandering remains an equilibrium provided:

                                                                                 (                                                       )
                                                    (                   )
                                 (              )                               (                                                       )

Denote the ratio of polynomials on the left hand side by                                                     ( ). Then, after some tedious algebra
one can check that ( )       .
