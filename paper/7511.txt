Sticky-Price Models of the Business Cycle: Specification and Stability
Peter N. Ireland
NBER Working Paper No. 7511
January 2000
JEL No. E31, E32, E52

                                               ABSTRACT

        This paper focuses on the specification and stability of a dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium
model of the American business cycle withsticky prices. Maximum likelihood estimates reveal that the data
prefer a version of the model in which adjustment costs apply to the price level but not to the inflation rate.
Formal hypothesis test detect instability in the estimated parameters, particularly in estimates of the
representative household’s discount factor. Evidently, more detailed descriptions of the economy are
needed to explain movements in interest rates before and after 1979.
