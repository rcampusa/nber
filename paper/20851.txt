                                              ABSTRACT

In the Belle Époque, Belgium recorded an unprecedented trade boom, but growth in output per capita
was lackluster. We seek to reconcile this ostensible paradox. Because of the sharp decline in both fixed
and variable trade costs, the trade boom was as much about the expansion in the number of products
delivered and markets served as it was about shipping more of the same old products. We use a new
highly disaggregated data set on bilateral exports at the product level to illustrate these claims. In line
with new trade theory, the effect of trade on productivity was mediated by sector-level firm heterogeneity
and product differentiation. In new technology sectors, like tramways, the high degree of firm heterogeneity
amplified the effect of trade on productivity. But in other sectors, mainly old staple industries like
cotton textiles, a high level of firm uniformity muted the effect of trade. Into the twentieth century,
old staples trumped new technology sectors, per capita income growing modestly as a result.

I. Workshop to the world: Round two

       Of the known unknowns about the dynamics of globalization, the relationship
between international trade and economic growth presents a vexing question. Consider
Belgium’s trade boom between 1870 and 1914. In the mid nineteenth century, the country
exported a narrow range of products to a handful of destinations. By the eve of the war,
the number of products shipped abroad had more than doubled, and so did the number of
export destinations. Like the UK fifty years earlier, Belgium had emerged as a workshop
to the world. 1 The trouble is that, despite the exceptional performance in trade, growth in
output per capita failed to accelerate in step.

       There are a number of competing explanations of the link between trade and
growth in the late nineteenth century. In the factor-endowment framework of O’Rourke
and Williamson (1999), the exchange of New World resources for Old World
manufactures, the signature trade of the period, promoted convergence in real wages. This
portrait of the Belle Époque would come as a surprise to a transporter in Antwerp for
whom intraindustry shipments were as important as interindustry ones, if not more so. In
Temin’s (1997, 2000) Ricardian model of the industrial revolution, the broad brush of
technological change promoted and sustained UK export superiority across a broad range
of sectors. 2 But in the second industrial revolution, the mapping of exports onto
productivity fit awkwardly. Typically, a Ghent textile manufacturer sold goods in low and
high-productivity countries alike, even the UK.

       Other leading trade models yield different predictions—and raise other problems. In
a model incorporating increasing returns and a “love of variety” (Krugman 1979), the
process of economic growth expands the range of goods produced and exported (Hummels
and Klenow 2005). The implication is that, by the late nineteenth century, because of
home-market effects and agglomeration economies industrial and export activities would
have been concentrated in the largest and richest domestic markets, the U.K., France, and
Germany. Relatively smaller and poorer countries would have been shut out from many

   During this same period, Kindleberger (1956) reported comparable transitions in the Netherlands,
Switzerland, and to some extent in Scandinavia.

  Temin (2000) believed that the British experience was unique:
     I showed in my [Temin] 1997 article that the list of manufactures exported from England was very
     long and very different from the list of imports. It seems unlikely that any other country was exporting
     “other manufactures” in such diversity and at such low prices…There are trade data for other countries
     in this period; did these other countries export the same astonishing variety of manufactured goods as
     Britain? If not, and I predict not, then the suggestion of intra-industry trade must be deemed
     ahistorical.

destinations. This depiction is at odds with Belgium’s achievement. The increase in the
export share of GDP was about twice that of big and rich economies (O’Rourke and
Williamson 1999, p. 30; Huberman 2012, p. 6). By 1900, the country was the fifth largest
exporter in Europe (De Leener 1906). Taking the Krugman model as a baseline, Belgium
was clearly punching above its size.

       This paper presents a new perspective on Belgium’s trade boom, and, more
generally, the relationship between globalization and growth before 1914. We do so in
several ways. First, we introduce explicitly trade barriers, specifically the fixed costs of
entering a new destination and creating a market for a new product. A Krugman-type
model assumes only variable trade costs and predicts that all goods are exported to all
countries, if they are exported at all. A typical feature of the period, however, was that
new goods were not shipped everywhere and that new destinations did not receive all
goods. To explain this phenomenon, we posit that beachhead or fixed costs varied across
products and destinations, and that firm-level productivity was heterogeneous within
sectors. The intuition is that barriers to trade and relative productivity were two sides of
the same coin (Romer 1994). Below some threshold, unproductive firms did not export.
Thus the surge in exports could have represented an increase in the innate productivity
advantages of new and more firms to overcome the threshold. But it may have also been
the case that more firms participated in trade because the fall in trade costs, in certain
products and destinations, established a lower threshold of exporting.

       The second contribution of the paper is the attention we give to fixed costs. Classic
studies (Harley 1988) of international trade in the period have tended to focus on
transport costs, which are typically classified as “variable” or ad valorem. This focus is
partly due to the availability of information on freight rates. Exploiting the comprehensive
reports prepared by an international network of trade diplomats, organized and subsidized
by the Belgian state, we identify the role of business intelligence in lowering the threshold
of setup costs in new markets and for new goods.

       Our final contribution derives from the level of analysis. In effect, the impact of
trade costs is revealed in the margins of trade: the intensive margin (bilateral exports per
product or total exports per country) and the extensive margin (the number of products
exported to a destination or the number of countries served). 3 Using granular trade data,

3
  A parallel decomposition holds for imports. We refer to export margins throughout this paper. Here, by
assumption, and because of the lack of firm-level data, we mainly identify firms with products. The
contemporary trade literature draws on firm-level data and, occasionally, firm shipments. See Cadot et al.
(2012) for a review of recent research.

                                                    3
our decomposition of trade renders a novel interpretation of the supposed paradox of
globalization and productivity in Belgium before 1914. Because of the sharp decline in
both fixed and variable trade costs, the trade boom was as much about the expansion in
the number of products delivered and markets served as it was about shipping more of the
same old products. 4 In support of new trade models (Chaney 2008), the effect on the
number of products was amplified in sectors with a high level of product differentiation
and a high degree of uniformity in productivity across firms. The rub was that the fall in
trade costs in the same sectors had the likelihood of attracting previously uncompetitive
firms into export activity. 5 In this fashion, the expansion in trade between 1870 and 1913
went hand-in-hand with modest growth in output per capita.

     Aside from data availability, our choice of Belgium merits comment. In many ways,
it was a microcosm of late nineteenth-century Europe. It shared a common institutional
framework, the legacy of longstanding commercial and political relations with its
neighbors. It participated in, if not initiated, international trade agreements on the
Protection of Industrial Property (1883) and the Brussels Convention on unfair
competition (1900). Typical of other continental economies, the proportion of intraindustry
trade exceeded that of interindustry exchanges. And like many of Europe’s small
economies, it maintained low tariffs in the face of rising protectionism on the continent.

       The puzzle we have identified is not particular to Belgium. In fact, the evidence on
the output gains of trade before 1914 is decidedly thin (O’Rourke 2000; Irwin 2002; Liu
and Meissner 2013). For skeptics, tariff protection seems to have been an ally as much as
an adversary of productivity growth. But different policies may have had different and
offsetting effects in a world of trade costs and imperfect competition. In Belgium, the state
promoted trade liberalization, but it also invested in an international network of diplomats
that grew the trade boom. On this basis, the opposition of states and markets is a false
dichotomy.

      Allen’s (2009) general model of industrialization provides an alternative framework to
situate our findings. Allen observes that in the first half of the nineteenth century, a
period in which economies were relatively closed, continental wages were too low (and
energy prices too high) relative to British levels to bring about the adoption of modern
technology. The open-economy forces of the last quarter of the century ought to have


4
  From a conceptual perspective, the extensive margin exists because firms that could not cover fixed costs
do not export at all.
5
  The same decline in trade costs may have led to more import competition. But these types of forces were
likely to be muted in a small-open economy like Belgium producing new goods in differentiated markets.

                                                    4
pushed wages up in economies like Belgium which was also abundant in coal (O'Rourke
and Williamson 1999; Liu and Meissner 2013). 6 As more productive firms congregated in
the export sector, and uncompetitive firms closed down, the trade boom would have
nudged continental economies closer to the technological frontier, a defining feature of the
second industrial revolution, However, Belgium did not seem to benefit entirely from the
positive selection effects of trade. 7 Into the early twentieth century, Belgian wages
decidedly lagged British levels. In this regard, the decline in trade costs had generated a
race between a core group of technologically advanced incumbents and new low performing
entrants in export activities. The final balance sheet was mixed, the trade boom having
only a moderate effect on growth.

       The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we describe the trade costs
that precipitated the trade boom, and identify two features of the Belgian economy, the
large share of small firms and the degree of product differentiation of exports, that may
help explain the absence of a strong effect of the decline trade costs on economic growth.
We proceed to introduce a simple new trade model that incorporates these parameters,
along with fixed and variable trade costs. The model makes several predictions about the
relation between trade costs, the margins of trade, and economic growth. Next, we present
our dataset on Belgian exports. We then evaluate the effect of trade costs on the extensive
and intensive margins. In the last section of the paper, we study the impact of the trade
margins on productivity growth.

II. International trade and economic growth in Belgium

       Measured by the share of exports and imports in GDP in Figure 1, Belgium's
international exposure increased at a rate of 1.1 percent per annum between 1870 and
1900, and 1.5 percent in the shorter period between 1900 and the eve of the war. 8 On a
per capita basis, Belgium’s trade exhibited the fastest growth in Europe. The standard
account of the trade boom starts with the transport revolution, which in Belgium can be
dated to the opening of the Scheldt and subsequent investments in the port of Antwerp
(Loyen 2002). Thereafter, maritime freight rate fell, by about 30 percent between 1870 and

6
   Neither the Stolper-Samuelson effects explored in O’Rourke and Williamson (1999) nor the market
potential channel explored in Liu and Meissner (2013) depend on total factor productivity to bring about
rising real wages and convergence. Gains from trade accrue solely from the elimination of resource-wasting
trade costs.
7
  Between 1870 and 1913, Belgian wages remained at 75 percent of British levels (Williamson 1995). See
Huberman (2008) and Scholliers (1995) on the persistence of the low-wage economy.

  Trade share of GDP in 1870 = .34; 1913 = .60. Figures based on nominal GDP from Smits, Woltjer, and
Ma (2009), and trade values from Horlings (1997).

1913, much of the decline happening in the first part of this period (Jacks et al. 2010;
Jacks and Pendakur 2011). Because of investments in its rail and canal networks, the
sharp contraction in shipping costs was matched by that of inland freight rates. 9 Although
Antwerp remained far and away the major hub of traffic, the share of five other
international ports (in order of importance: Ostend, Ghent, Brussels, Bruges, and
Nieuwpoort) increased over the period. According to one assessment (Suykens 1986, p.
375), competition among ports forced Antwerp to maintain the lowest pilotage and loading
fees in Europe.

       The decline in transport costs, while substantial, did not secure foreign market
access, if only because all countries benefited from lower freight rates. In contrast, the
fixed costs of acquiring international market presence were not only considerable, but
idiosyncratic, because they varied across products, and by sources and destinations. These
costs ranged from gaining familiarity with local market conditions, to establishing or
accessing wholesale networks, and learning about shipping methods and customs’
formalities. Belgium faced particular disadvantages in this regard. Unlike France and
Great Britain, the country did not reap the advantages of a large empire; unlike Germany
and Italy, it could not rely on emigrants to promote its goods. 10

      Belgium pursued a mixed strategy of reducing fixed costs. From the 1860s, the
country accorded most favored nation treatment with its close neighbors and new trading
partners. 11 The number of treaties peaked in the decade after France and Germany
approved restrictive trade policies. In addition, the country signed general trade
agreements, traité d’amitiés, for instance with Venezuela in 1884, and specific treaties,
such as protocols safeguarding product design and trade marks with Romania in 1881

Huberman (2008).
10
   From 1885 to 1908, the Congo Free State was the private enclave of the Emperor Léopold II, after which
it became a colony of Belgium. In 1900, the Congo accounted for less than 5 percent of manufacturing
exports. On empire and trade, see Mitchener and Weidenmeir (2008). As for immigration, the trade consul in
the US mid west (Recueil Consulaire [hereafter RC], vol. 86 (1894), p. 394) observed a large concentration of
Belgian immigrants in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The consul went on to report that the new arrivals did not
have much need for Belgian goods, especially cheese.
11
   In the wake of the Cobden-Chevalier treaty of 1860, Belgium signed a MFN agreement with France in
1861, followed by treaties with Britain (1862), the Netherlands (1863), and Prussia (1865). Late into the
century, when the two-tier tariff system was widely adopted in Europe, the country negotiated agreements
with new partners, including Mexico (1895) Greece (1904) and Bolivia (1912). On Belgian commercial policy,
see Degrève (1982). In the empirical sections of this paper, we rely on Pahre’s (2007) dataset of trade
treaties.

                                                     6
(Traités de commerce 1900). As for financial risk, the adoption of the gold standard (1878)
progressively locked in exchange rates with its commercial partners. 12 All told, the
uncertainty of doing business abroad declined since trade policy reversals became more
predictable—but also less likely.

       Still, across these measures, Belgium had no apparent advantages, acting as much
as a follower as leader. In many ways, ‘natural’ disadvantages of size constrained access to
foreign markets. Big countries, like Germany and the US, tended to have a high
proportion of large firms that achieved lower unit costs because of large domestic markets,
and that also had the capacity to invest in merchant houses and networks of agents in the
field (De Leener 1906, p. 156). Because of their ties to financial institutions, German
manufacturers offered foreign customers favorable credit terms. In contrast, the average
size of firms was smaller in Belgium—we return to this feature below—and industry
concentration considerably less. Belgian firms had few if no commercial agents, often
depending on the availability of British and German services (De Leener 1906, p. 16). And
while Belgian had a developed financial sector, with some exceptions, most exporters had
limited means to offer financing.

        Belgium’s comparative advantage seems to have been embedded in its particular
institutional framework (Nunn and Trefler 2014), the outcome of the role it had
established for itself in the international community. As a small, open and non-aligned
country, Belgium sought to participate, and often initiate, international networks, such as
those in the fields of labor and social reform, and science. The state’s engagement to
nurture trade networks (Rauch 1999) was an extension of this preoccupation. At home,
the country hosted a series of international trade fairs (Antwerp 1885 and 1894; Brussels,
1888, 1897, and 1910; and Liège 1905) that showcased export lines. Abroad, Belgium was
the first foreign country to have a chamber of commerce in New York (Bairoch 1989, p.
97). Since private initiatives in this field had proved to be insufficient, the state assumed
responsibility for establishing an international presence in support of commercial interests.

       From an early date, the state invested resources in developing an extensive network
of consular offices. The first delegates at mid century were located in neighboring
countries, but, as early as 1870, Belgium was represented on all continents, even if trade
with many regions was trivial or non-existent. At the turn of the century, of the nearly
600 representatives (some of whom were actually foreign nationals) in 84 destinations
(independent countries and colonies), more than half were located outside the European

core (De Leener 1906, p. 209). 13 Altogether, spending on political and consular agents rose
from 0.6 million francs in 1860 to 1.5 million in 1890 (Bairoch 1989, p. 96). The consular
network was complemented by the presence of foreign representatives in Belgium. Figure 2
summarizes the available information on Belgian and foreign diplomats, along with other
means the country exploited to manage trade costs. The spike in delegates, and other
measures after 1890, conforms to the sharp upswing in trade in the decades before the war.

       The reports of the consuls, published annually in the Recueil consulaire (RC),
provided an inexhaustible source of business intelligence for Belgian manufacturers. 14 In
1910, the RC comprised 5 volumes, containing 127 reports on 41 countries, and covering
over 250 different items. The state promoted Belgian goods and effectively subsidized the
fixed and variable costs of conducting business abroad. The résumé on Chile (RC, vol. 63,
1888, pp. 325-53) concentrated on exchange rates, tariff policy, and internal transport;
that for Japan (RC, vol. 39, 1882, pp. 23-71) on consumer preferences and freight rates;
the report on the Philippines on packaging, labeling, and the importance of keeping to
contractual deadlines (RC, vol. 142, 1908, p. 492-501). Ever practical in their outlook, the
consuls gave recommendations on opportunities in individual markets. The representative
(RC, vol. 53, 1885, p. 138) in Lisbon acknowledged that, although the productivity of
British cotton-textile workers was superior and that Lancashire’s hold on foreign markets
in “sheetings” and “shirtings” was impenetrable, Belgian firms had opportunities for
“towlings, embroidered textiles, checked domestics,” among other narrow varieties.15 Did
this type of information reduce the probability of failure? Although we give a more definite
answer below, at first pass, the answer would be in the affirmative. In 1890, Japan, was
not a major destination for Belgian goods. In the next two decades, the number of
diplomats doubled, from 4 to 8. By the eve of the war, Japan was Belgium’s eighth largest
export destination.

        The collapse in trade costs ought to have coincided with a movement of resources
to the export sector and the shuttering of uncompetitive import-competing concerns. After
all, there was no shortage of capital, and because of its dense rail network, Belgian workers

14
   The geographical distribution of the reports mirrored that of the trade diplomats. Based on the countries
listed in the indexes of the RC, in 1870 the percent of European reports was 40 percent; by 1910, the figure
was cut in half.
15
    The consul in Chile (RC, vol. 63, 1888, p. 374) gave a typical list of market opportunities: ”lingerie
confectionnée pour hommes, de toutes étoffes (chemises, caleçons, gilets, pantalons, cols, cravates, etc.), la
lingerie confectionnée pour dames (bonnets, chemises, jupons, peignoirs, cols, collerettes, manches, mouchoirs,
etc.), la lingerie de table, de toilette et de bain (nappes, serviettes, peignoirs, caleçons, etc).”

were highly mobile across sectors (Huberman 2008). The terms of trade would have
improved. For the most part, however, structural change was glacial, economic
performance being hostage to a handful of regionally based staple industries, such as
textiles and glass making (De Brabander 1981). There was no discernible trend in patents
delivered (Annuaire statistique, various years) and human capital formation was weak,
levels of education being well behind the European norm. Summarizing the dominant
narrative, Van der Wee and Goossens (1991) described a fin-de-siècle economy "ossified,
rigid, and imprisoned in traditional, unviable sectors, without economic future." Overall,
growth in Belgian per capita growth was about half that of the trade component of GDP.
Until 1890 it was 0.65 percent per annum, and only slightly more, 0.89 percent, in the
decades before the war (Horlings and Smits 2002, p. 86). The second industrial revolution
seemed to have pass Belgium by, the ‘modernization’ of industry postponed until the 1920s
(Boschma 1999).

        In the absence of an overarching explanation, the literature does provide several
clues that may help in explaining the weak effect of the trade boom on output per capita.
First, was the nature of the export expansion itself. Drèze (1960, 1989) claims that because
of its small domestic market, Belgium restricted exports to “standardized goods,” that is
semi-finished and non-differentiated goods. 16 High entry costs in distant markets compelled
firms to sell to customers close to home and ship more of the same goods, as opposed to
diversifying into new markets and new goods. The high degree of substitution between
foreign and Belgian goods had the same effect. As a result, Drèze concluded, the lack of
specialization dampened the potential gains of trade.

        This image clashes with the testimony of foreign diplomats on product
differentiation. 17 It does not follow, however, that the expansion in product varieties
translated into higher per capita income. In fact, Drèze’s explanation can be turned on its
head. The export of specialized goods may have had ambiguous effects on productivity,
because competitive forces were weaker in highly differentiated and often farflung markets.
In markets with a greater degree of substitution between goods, competition would have
been stiffer, and firms had to meet high performance standards to survive.

      A related feature of the Belgian economy was the predominance of small firms.
Business historians (Van der Wee 1984) concur that big concerns and dynamic enterprises
were few and far between, even in the international sector (Cassiers 1989). During the

  Rauch (1999) made the more general point: By their very nature, few manufactured commodities are
actually traded in organized markets.

                                                   9
peak years of the trade boom after 1896, the absolute size of the domestic or putting-out
sector actually increased (Belgium, Recensement 1910; Delbeke 1982). The degree of
industry concentration was comparatively low (Van Meerten 2003). Cooperation between
investment banks and industry was restricted to transport and iron and steel, and, even in
these sectors, cartelization was less pronounced than in Germany.

       This portrait is curious because in dynamic export economies, firms in the tradable
sector have been found to be generally larger, more capital intensive, and more productive
than those in the domestic sector (Bernard et al. 2006, 2007). The claim is that firms
operating below a certain profit threshold do not export. In cases where the distribution of
firms is concentrated or heterogeneous, the fall in trade costs causes a shift in resources to
highly performing concerns, aggregated productivity increasing as a result. Using
contemporary data on Sweden, Ferguson and Forslid (2014) report that large and medium
sized firms benefit most from government spending on trade promotion, like the
establishment of foreign trade consulates. Again, these results can be inverted. If the
distribution of firms is uniform, a small change in trade costs would enable those firms
clustered slightly below the profit cut off to enter export activity, leaving only a small
footprint on productivity.

        In the remainder of this paper, we study the impact of trade costs, both fixed and
variable, on the Belgian trade boom and output per capita. Our claim is the effects of
trade costs were mediated by the degree of product differentiation and the distribution of
firms. The expansion in the number of products might have come at the expense of
productivity in differentiated goods industries and in sectors dominated by firms of similar
size. To sort through the possible outcomes, in the next section we present a simple model
of international trade that integrates both product and firm differentiation.

III. Trade costs and trade margins: A conceptual framework

        Consider Chaney’s (2008) model of international trade in which firms produce a
range of differentiated goods. Assuming a Pareto distribution, firms are heterogeneous with
respect to their labor productivity. The amount of heterogeneity in firm-level productivity
is summarized by the shape parameter 𝛾𝛾. As 𝛾𝛾 increases, firms are more homogeneous and
productivity is more uniform. Consumers purchase a set of products, each good containing
a number of varieties. Firms are identified by varieties. Each product, k, is allowed to have
a different elasticity of substitution between varieties, 𝜎𝜎 𝑘𝑘 , such that varieties of a product
with higher 𝜎𝜎 are closer substitutes for each other. Chaney’s setup provides for variation
within industries (which is to say within products) in firm productivity. Since we have no

                                               10
information on shipments by firm and are restricted to product level data, our
specification will equate each item exported as a variety produced by a representative firm,
or a set or firms within which firms were sufficiently homogenous. Firms are heterogeneous
in productivity across products. In this setup, a sector k consists of a group of products. As
such, we will largely be interested in the bilateral value of exports for a sector k, the value
of exports in a sector per good, and the number of goods exported.

       With this framework, Chaney starts with observation that lower trade costs
decrease the productivity threshold necessary for firms to attain export status. He proceeds
to compare the effects of changes in variable and fixed trade costs on bilateral (aggregate)
exports for a sector, exports per firm (the intensive margin) and the number of firms
engaged in export activity (the extensive side). The breakdown is informative because
changes in the fixed and variable costs on trade have different implications for exports per
firm and the number of exporters.

       Start with the effect of variable trade costs on trade. The elasticity of exports to a
country d for sector k with respect to a change in variable trade costs is given by the sum
of the elasticities on the intensive margin and the extensive margin:



                                        intensive margin   extensive margin

                       𝑑𝑑ln 𝑥𝑥
            𝜉𝜉𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 ≡ − 𝑑𝑑ln 𝜏𝜏 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = (𝜎𝜎 𝑘𝑘 − 1) + �𝛾𝛾 𝑘𝑘 − (𝜎𝜎 𝑘𝑘 − 1)� = 𝛾𝛾 𝑘𝑘        (1)
                                 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑




The overall elasticity of export values for a change in variable trade costs is larger as firm-
productivity heterogeneity declines, or 𝛾𝛾 increases. The first component, (𝜎𝜎 𝑘𝑘 − 1), denotes
that the impact of a change of variable trade costs on the intensive margin (exports/good)
decreases in the degree of product differentiation or the elasticity of substitution of 𝜎𝜎 𝑘𝑘 .
The impact on the extensive margin depends on both productivity heterogeneity and the
elasticity of substitution between goods. The strong prediction here is that, in a gravity
regression for total exports in a given sector, the coefficient on measures of variable trade
costs should be larger in absolute magnitude in industries in which firms do not differ
much in their productivity.

      Consider next the effects of changes in the fixed costs of trade. Chaney (2008)
demonstrates that the elasticity of bilateral exports of a given sector k, with respect to a
change in the fixed costs of trade, is given by

                                                           11

                        𝑑𝑑ln𝑥𝑥𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                     𝛾𝛾 𝑘𝑘         𝛾𝛾 𝑘𝑘
           𝜉𝜉𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 ≡ −              =         0    + � 𝑘𝑘     − 1� = 𝑘𝑘     −1              (2)

where f denotes the fixed costs of exporting a particular good. By inspection, fixed costs
affect the total value of trade, but only through the extensive margin. The intuition is that
demand for a particular good is not related to fixed costs. Fixed costs affect only the entry
decisions of goods (firms). Moreover, the elasticities on the extensive margin and on total
trade are related inversely to the level of firm-level heterogeneity, and positively to the
degree of product differentiation. In industries with significant firm-level differences in
productivity, the overall elasticity is expected to be small in absolute value. Holding firm-
level heterogeneity constant, industries with a high level of differentiation, or a low
elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods, would have large elasticities. In
other circumstances, a high degree of heterogeneity may offset a high level of product
diversification, and the elasticity would be smaller.

        The Chaney model informs our resolution of the Belgian paradox. We are
specifically interested in three main predictions of the model.

     1) Whereas the decline in variable trade costs affected both intensive and extensive
        margins, the decline in fixed costs caused a change in the extensive margin only.


     2) The decline in trade costs raised bilateral trade as the degree of product
        differentiation and the uniformity of productivity across firms increased.


     3) The effects of lower trade costs (and increased trade) on sectoral productivity also
        varied. In sectors with a high degree of firm heterogeneity, productivity increased in
        step with trade. But in sectors in which firms were more similar, and product
        diversification greater, the effect of trade on productivity was softened. 18

18
  In theory, some firms at the low end of the productivity distribution, often those producing exclusively for
the domestic market, might have been eliminated due to competition from imports. Some caveats may
apply. Our story concentrates on the declines in trade costs in new markets arising from Belgian investments
in diplomatic capital and other beachhead costs. In these cases, Belgium may have faced relatively little
direct competition from producers in less developed countries because of different patterns in specialization

                                                              12
III. Boats, cars, and trams: Belgian trade, 1870-1914

       Our main data source on international trade is the Tableau général du commerce
extérieur. We recorded the trade of manufactured goods, which represented about 50
percent of all exports in 1900 and 20 percent of all imports, at five-year intervals beginning
in 1870 and until 1910. 19 The Tableau separates goods in transit from those manufactured
in Belgium. It includes shipments along all means of transport which remained relatively
stable over the period. For exports, about 45 percent of goods were shipped by boat, a
similar share by land transport, and 10 percent by barge using the canal and river system.
The Appendix gives background information on the Tableau and the methodology used in
defining new and established goods, categories of goods, and destinations.

        Figure 3 depicts the growth in the (net) number of export items and destinations.
The expansion in products has a sharp break after 1890; that in destinations was steady,
reflecting, no doubt, the limit in the number of outlets available. The approximately 70
outlets recorded in 1910 was a considerable achievement since there were less than 200
potential trading partners, composed of sovereign states, colonies, and territories, at this
date. The steady accretion in destinations is at odds with a world of zero gravity (Eaton
and Kortum 2002), or a world without fixed costs of trade, in which initially firms would
have sold products to many destinations and, as new products came on stream would have
them shipped to a comparable set of markets. In presence of significant entry costs, firms
learned about their export potential market-by-market (Albornoz et al. 2012). At first,
they might have restricted export lines to a handful of the lowest cost destinations, and
then expanded the scope of their markets, either because trade costs declined or because of
productivity improvements.

       The types of goods traded and destinations (Figures 4A and 4B) evolved over the
period. The relative share of textile exports declined, although it still amounted to about
30 percent, whereas that of clothing, metal products, and vehicles increased. The
persistence of textiles as a major export item gives credence to Van der Wee and
Goossens’s (1991) claim about a torpid economy steeped in old staples. That said, the
share of exports of these same industries may also indicate that trade costs had fallen


and gaps in technology. Owing to the country’s size and location, it was also likely that, in many of the
industries we study, most firms were exporters. In this case, marginal firms become less productive when
trade costs fall.
19
   In a previous treatment of the Tableau, Degrève (1982) was mainly concerned with estimating the value of
trade. His presentation does not identify export destinations and import sources.

                                                    13
considerably to permit even low-performing firms in differentiated goods markets to extend
their reach. The rest of Europe bought more than 90 percent of exports in 1870, but by
1910 its share had dropped to about 65 percent, replaced by the development of new
markets in Africa, the Americas, and Asia.

        In making their recommendations on market opportunities, the trade delegates
classified goods by the degree of overlap or substitution between rival items. Along this
line, in the empirical sections of this paper, we divide products into four categories of
differentiation. 20 Category 1, the least differentiated items, comprised labor-intensive
manufactures, manufacturing inputs (for instance, threads, hides, parchment, and paving
stones), and low-value metal products. These types of goods were destined primarily for
domestic markets. Category 2 goods consisted of semi-skilled industrial goods and textiles.
Product differentiation in this category was increasing in significance. The Tableau in
1910 identifies exports and imports of 17 varieties of cotton textiles (items 38-55 in the
appendix). Category 3 included semi-skilled or high-skilled manufacturing goods with
substantial capital input (high-end textiles, crystal, and elaborate and finished metal
products), and category 4, the most differentiated goods, high unit value capital-intensive
manufactures, such as tramways, ships, machines, and machine tools. By the turn of the
century, Belgium exported streetcars made of copper, iron, steel and wood (items 164-167).
Based on the number of references in the indexes of the RC, the trade diplomats devoted
increasing attention to category 3 and 4 goods. This made sense since markets for category
1 and 2 goods were more competitive. Anticipating Rauch’s (1999) concept of related
trade, the consuls insisted that differentiated goods were not traded in organized or
‘auction’ like markets. Hence, the value placed by manufacturers in obtaining information
on potential buyers and their specific preferences in order to establish brands and grow
demand.

       Figure 5 presents a closer look at the relationship between destinations and
products. The number of destinations is estimated from a weighted regression of the
number of countries served by each product on the number of periods Belgium had non-
zero exports of this item, as well as a full set of period and good level indicators. After the
first period, the conditional average number of destinations was 17.75. The average
number of markets served peaked after five periods, leveling off at about 26 markets.
Firms, it appears, built their market base sequentially, the ability to stay in each market
being strongly correlated with the number of trading partners. This correspondence sits
well with Besedeš and Prusa’s (2006) finding that, while the duration of trade is very low


20
     The appendix gives full details on products by category and the value of trade by category.

                                                        14
for many products, if firms survive the initial period or two, and meet operating costs,
they stay in these markets for a long time.

        Finally, the above relationship is reversed in Figure 6 which gives the number of
products delivered to each destination. The dispersion of products cannot be easily
explained either by geography or by market size or income. As expected France, received
the most products, but Switzerland imported as many products as the US and Argentina,
countries at different levels of development and with different commercial policies. Canada
and Japan became trading partners of Belgium around the same time and had the same
arc in imports. Interestingly, the number of diplomats was the same in the two countries.

       To summarize, the portrait of international trade that emerges from the Tableau
differs considerably from that usually described by economic historians. The factor-
endowment trade model of O’Rourke and Williamson presumes that goods were
homogenous. A basic Krugman model of imperfect competition assumes a given number of
destinations because it ignores fixed costs of entry. The dataset we have assembled points
to the contrary on both fronts. The expansions in product categories and in destinations
were the defining features of Belgium's trade performance before 1914.

IV. Trade costs and the extensive and intensive margins

In this section, we examine the basic predictions of the Chaney model regarding the effects
of variable and fixed trade costs on trade. We are particularly interested to what extent
the degrees of product differentiation and firm heterogeneity filtered the impact of trade
costs. To gain leverage on these effects, we decompose the value of trade into extensive
and intensive margins. 21

       We use gravity models of bilateral exports to study the impact of trade costs on the
trade margins. As in Lawless (2010a, 20110b; Dutt et al. 2013), we are restricted to
country level data. Our dependent variables are then: (1) bilateral exports; (2) the number
of products exported per country (extensive margin); (3) average exports or the ratio of
the value of exports to the number of products per country (intensive margin). 22 In
subsequent gravity regressions, we explore bilateral exports of these margins for different
industry or sector classifications. Since GDP data is limited, we use population of the
trading partner as our measure of size. We include proxies for both variable and fixed


21
     The appendix estimates the relative importance of the extensive and intensive margins in bilateral exports.
22
     As before, we implicitly identify products with firms.

                                                        15
costs in our regression specification. In the absence of direct information on freight rates,
we use great circle distance between national capitals to approximate transport costs.
Other indicators of trade costs include whether or not the trading partner shared a
common border and language with Belgium, signed a trade agreement, and pegged its
exchange rate. We also exploit information on diplomatic representation both in Belgium
and abroad, and include an indicator variable for whether the trading partner is a colony
of another country. To the extent that these factors increased information and decreased
uncertainty, they may be construed to be good proxies for the fixed costs of trade,
although we acknowledge that they could also plausibly be associated with variable, ad
valorem costs of trade. For instance, the reports of the diplomats provided business
intelligence on setup costs for each product in each market, as well as information on tariff
rates and transport costs.
        The coefficients in Table 1 have the expected signs. For bilateral exports, Belgium
traded more with bigger and more proximate markets. Entry costs were lower in
independent states than in the colonies of other countries. Trade increased when the
partner pegged its exchange rate and had signed a trade agreement. Investments in the
consular network seem to have paid dividends, diplomatic representation in a foreign
market growing the value of exports. So did the presence of trade delegates in Belgium. All
told, business intelligence was a contributing factor in the Belgium trade boom.

        There are subtle but important differences between the extensive and intensive
margins in columns two and three of the table. The former is less responsive to distance
than the latter. This is what we would expect if Belgium exported differentiated goods. In
line with equation 2, the coefficients on variables that proxy for fixed trade costs are
generally larger in the regression of the extensive margin. The presence of trade diplomats
effectively reduced setup and other costs in new markets. The intensive side was less
responsive to business intelligence of this type, the implication being that the diplomatic
network operated mainly on fixed costs. A complementary reading is that new goods
became known and new markets established, the effect of trade diplomats on average sales
diminished. A trade treaty does not appear to have an effect on the extensive margin,
perhaps because Belgium negotiated accords with countries with which it had previously
established trade relationships. But it may also have been the case that an MFN
agreement was less effective in opening doors than diplomatic ties, since trade in
differentiated goods was dependent on informal related networks,



       The bottom line of the Chaney model is the notion that the effects of trade costs on
trade are mediated by the degree of product differentiation and the heterogeneity of firm

                                             16
productivity. 23 Consider a variable cost like distance. Standardized items would be shipped
closer to home, and so, too, would have been older goods that had achieved a long product
cycle, or those produced using well-known technologies. Conversely, highly differentiated
goods may have found openings in faraway destinations because competition was slack in
these markets. Neither would geography have been a barrier for firms retaining first-mover
advantages or delivering newer goods developed on experimental technologies. As for the
distribution in firm productivity, equation 1 implies that variable costs, like distance,
would have had a larger negative impact on exports in industries in which firms are
relatively similar.

        To evaluate these effects on bilateral exports, in Table 2, we classify goods into the
four categories introduced previously, the degree of product differentiation being lowest for
category 1 goods. We expect heterogeneity to be lowest as well in category 1 since, from
equation 2 (Chaney 2008), variable trade costs have a decreasing influence on the total
value of bilateral trade at higher levels of firm-level heterogeneity. The impact of trade
costs on trade did indeed vary with the degrees of differentiation in products and firms.
For category 1 goods, trade costs strongly dampened trade. Exporters depended on
proximity, an MFN agreement, and diplomatic representation to sell more goods. The
effect of distance diminished with the degrees of specialization and firm heterogeneity. For
category 3 goods, better intelligence obtained by the diplomatic network abetted trade.
The most highly specialized goods in category 4 seem to have sold by themselves,
reputation being a more important determinant of sales than an MFN agreement or
diplomatic representation. For instance, Belgium was renowned for its streetcars,
producers having customers in 40 destinations in 1910. Nevertheless, the exposure of these
goods in the colonies and protectorates of Britain, France, and Portugal was delayed.
According to Martínez López (2003), sales of tramways and investments in supporting
infrastructure were concentrated in the Middle East and Southern and Eastern Europe,
since U.K. manufacturers of similar goods invested heavily in the British Empire.

        As a further test of the model’s claim about variable costs, we investigated the role
of distance on bilateral exports at the industry level. To start, we aggregated products into
20 different industries. 24 We then employed a gravity model of trade at the industry level


23
   We find similar results (not reported) when we include item specific dummies in a regression on the total
value of bilateral exports by product in order to control for value to weight ratios within categories. Low
value, high bulk goods should be more sensitive to distance, the opposite being the case for goods with high
value to weight. It would also be informative to classify goods by their elasticities of substitution.
Unfortunately, the data do not allow for this type of estimation.
24
   The industries selected are based on Gaddiseur’s (1980, 1997) series of sectoral output.

                                                    17
that included the full vector of trade costs in Table 1. The results in Table 3 support the
Chaney model. Producers of standardized goods, like wool and linen threads, were
restricted to customers close to home. At the other extreme, machinery and streetcars,
typical category 4 goods, were sent all over the globe. These findings would not come as a
surprise to the trade consuls who implored manufacturers to intensify specialization so as
to succeed in distant markets.

        Next, exploiting information on the different categories of goods, we studied the
association between variable and fixed trade costs and the intensive and extensive margins
(value of exports per product and number of products). Recall the basic predictions of the
Chaney model (equation 2). For the intensive margin, the effect of variable trade costs
decreases with the degree of product differentiation, but fixed costs have no impact. As for
the extensive side, the effects of variable and fixed costs of trade vary negatively with the
elasticity of substitution between traded goods and the degree of firm-level heterogeneity.
If the degree of firm-level heterogeneity increases (a decline in the Pareto dispersion
parameter) in proportion to the decline in the demand elasticity, the impact on the
extensive margin of fixed costs is expected to be similar across products.

        To fix ideas on the effects of product differentiation and firm heterogeneity,
consider the glass and crystal industry. Celebrated for its diversified product range, the
industry served about 60 destinations in 1910, exports reaching distant markets in Asia
with improvements in packaging. Still, the trade diplomats puzzled why the industry never
achieved its potential of being world leader (RC, vol. 90, 1895, pp. 126, 304, 388, 421).
According to one study (Douxchamps 1951), the patchwork of firms of different sizes
impinged on export performance. At one end of the distribution, there was a large
proportion of small firms exploiting artisanal techniques; at the other, a smaller group of
large firms using state of the art technologies. Over the trade boom, the number of firms
in the industry remained stable, with entry at both tails. The consequence was that while
the degree of product diversification deepened the impact of declining trade costs on the
extensive margin, the degree of firm heterogeneity had the opposing effect.

       For the entire sample of products, Tables 4 and 5 invoke the gravity model to
investigate the relationship between trade costs and trade margins for each category of
goods. On the intensive side, defined as average sales (sales per product), the effect of
distance declines as the level of differentiation and firm heterogeneity rises. Interestingly,
several variables, including diplomatic representation, colonial status, and shared language,
are statistically insignificant and relatively small. These variables approximate information
available to manufacturers about foreign markets, and other technical, political, and

                                             18
economic barriers that comprise the beachhead costs of trade. In confirmation of Chaney’s
model, these variables are unlikely to operate through the intensive margin.

       Table 5 gives direct results on trade costs and the extensive margin. The dependent
variable is the number of products by category sold in a destination country. 25 Here the
impact of our proxies for trade costs seems to be stable across categories, the effects of
fixed and variable costs having roughly the same magnitude across industries and goods.
This is consistent with models of heterogeneous firms in which the degree of heterogeneity
increases, or 𝛾𝛾 declines, in proportion to the elasticity of substitution, 𝜎𝜎. This seems
natural since, as we surmised, the degrees of product differentiation and firm heterogeneity
increase in tandem across the categories.

        To summarize: The availability of high quality information and adequate
commercial infrastructure, among other factors, fed the expansion in products and possibly
in destinations too.       In industries exhibiting a considerable degree of product
differentiation, manufacturers could expect to sell goods in distant markets. But there was
a flipside to this story. The effect of trade costs on trade varied inversely with the degree
of firm heterogeneity. In the next section, we look at the implications of these offsetting
forces on the relationship between productivity and growth.

V. The margins of trade and productivity: Case studies

        New trade models give conflicting predictions about the effects of trade costs on
aggregate productivity. A general reduction in trade costs, as in Melitz (2003), causes
aggregate productivity to increase because of positive firm selection effects. Some of the
weakest firms in the economy are forced to exit. The export sector benefits from the
reallocation of resources, the most productive firms within the set of exporters increasing
their share of the market (Melitz 2003); also, as revenues go up, exporters invest in new
technologies (Bustos 2011). But the same decline in trade costs also lowers the threshold
level of productivity required for domestic firms to begin exporting (Melitz 2003; Chaney
2008). This ‘negative’ selection effect might be substantial in export markets for highly
differentiated goods. In these markets, firms do not compete head on against commercial
rivals and, as a result, they can succeed in capturing market share. The positive
reallocation effects arising from exit may be also less likely under these circumstances.



25
  This is the same definition of the extensive margin as before except it is by category. Santos Silva,
Tenreryo and Wei (2014) rely on a similar definition.

                                                  19
       In this section, we provide some tests for the presence of these types of selection
effects during the Belgian trade boom. The growth of industry-level productivity
contracted, or did not grow as quickly as it might have, in sectors with low firm level
heterogeneity, even as the extensive margin increased. We show this first for a cross
section of industries, before turning our attention to case studies.

       Our first step was to determine the association between openness and productivity
at a disaggregated sector-level. Unfortunately, data on productivity is not as detailed as
that on exports and imports. We rely on Gaddiseur’s (1980; 1997) estimation of labor
productivity and real output growth for 20 industries for two subperiods, 1880-1896 and
1896-1910. The sectors studied comprise 80-90 percent of the products exported and
imported. Average productivity growth of these industries in the first period, 1880-1896,
was 1.08 percent (1.26 on an export value-weighted basis); for 1896-1910, growth was 3.03
percent (2.45 percent on a weighted basis). These averages mask significant industry-level
variation. We then proceeded to match as many goods in our dataset as possible to the 20
industries.

      We are interested in the following relationship:

                     �𝑌𝑌                    �
                                          𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡

where t denotes one of two time periods (1880-1896 or 1896-1910) and the hats represent
percentage growth rates. For our panel of 20 industries over two time periods, Figure 7
plots the relationship between the change in openness (the difference in the average
growth rates of exports and total output) and average productivity growth for these years.
The ‘circles’ represent industry size and are proportional to total exports in 1880. Overall,
the trade boom did not have much of a positive impact on productivity growth, if
anything the relationship was negative. Column 1 of Table 6 reports the regression
underlying the figure. The coefficient on the change in openness is -0.79 and is significant
at the 5% level.

      To be sure, the true relationship in column 1 of Table 6 could be obscured by
endogeneity or simultaneity problems. First, output growth enters directly on both sides,
and third forces, not included here, could have been acting to change exports and
productivity. To limit these problems, we follow an approach based on Frankel and Romer
(1999) who use ostensibly exogenous geographic information from a gravity model to



                                                      20
predict trade at the bilateral level, and then use predicted total trade as an instrument.
Specifically, we run a gravity regression of the following form:

                                                               ′
                         ln(𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 𝜅𝜅𝑖𝑖 + 𝑧𝑧𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝛽𝛽𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 + 𝜖𝜖𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔                     (4)

where 𝜏𝜏 indicates a subset of years {1870, 1875, 1880}, {1890, 1895}, or {1900, 1905,
1910}, g indicates one of the 20 industries classified by Gaddiseur, i indicates a particular
item belonging to industry g, and d represents a destination. The explanatory variables in
the vector z include the logarithm of distance to Belgium, the log of destination
population, indicators if the trade partner was a colony of another country, shared a
border and a common language, and if the country had a diplomatic representative in
Belgium, and year dummies. We assume that the variables in z are exogenous in the sense
that they drive trade patterns and hence overall trade, but they do not have any influence
on productivity except via their effect on trade. In order to generate instruments (IV), we
aggregate as follows:

                                                                       ′ ̂
                              𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 = 𝑍𝑍𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 = ln�∑𝑑𝑑 ∑𝑖𝑖 exp�𝜅𝜅�𝚤𝚤 + 𝑧𝑧𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝛽𝛽𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 ��                     (5)

        We are able to predict trade for 1880, 1895 and 1910 using the three subsets of
years denoted by 𝜏𝜏, one subset for each year of our sample. To gain statistical power we
use the levels of IV in the first year of each period as well as the 16-year differences. Our
first stage regression result, presented in Table 6, confirm that we do not suffer from a
weak instruments problem. The second stage instrumental variables regression, where we
use export growth to explain productivity growth, suggests no significant positive
relationship between these two variables (OLS is reported in column 3). We also enter
predicted trade directly as a determinant of productivity in the last column. This
regression measures the direct relationship between that portion of trade determined by
trade costs and foreign market factors, and productivity growth. In effect, there is no
statistically significant relationship. The evidence corroborates our main claim that that as
trade costs fell, low productivity firms were able to produce, export, and survive.

       In essence, the association between exports and productivity varied by industry or
category.26 To this end, column 2 of Table 6 allows for the different slopes on the change

26
   Figure 7 highlights considerable variation across industries. To see this, we broke down growth in
productivity for industries in categories 1 to 4, where group 4 included the most differentiated products and
the highest degree of firm heterogeneity. As anticipated, category 1 has the lowest average annual growth
rate of productivity (0.95); category 4 (3.48) significantly higher growth. Categories 2 (2.52) and 3 (1.85) had
similar rates. Averages weighted by export value in 1880. Productivity figures from Gaddiseur (1997).

                                                               21
in openness for each of our four categories. Panel OLS regressions suggest much lower
productivity growth in category 2 compared to category 4. The point estimates for
category 1 and category 3 are also much lower than those of category 4, but we cannot
reject equality at high levels of confidence. The upshot is that our claim about firm
uniformity and flat productivity growth holds at the category level.

       The fates of Belgium’s metal and textile industries illustrate the channels by which
the degree of product differentiation and firm heterogeneity impacted on productivity. The
metal sector produced a range of products, from crude and medium grade iron and steel to
machine-making equipment, the latter being highly specialized items. At the same time,
the distribution of firms indicates a high degree of heterogeneity. Figure 8a presents
histograms of the distributions of firms in 1880 and 1910 for five levels of total
capitalization based on data from the Annuaire Statistique. The heyday of the trade boom
saw a hollowing out of the middle, with major growth occurring in larger concerns, and to
a lesser extent at the smaller end. Because of the combination of product diversity and
firm heterogeneity, the decline in trade costs translated into strong export performance
and a commensurate increase in productivity. 27 The share of steel output exported was
about 30 percent, and, since exports were not sensitive to distance (Table 3), producers in
1910 served a customer base of more than 30 destinations (Brooks and La Croix 1920).
Productivity growth matched the export expansion, achieving a rate of 3.38 percent per
annum between 1896 and 1910.

       Finally, consider the effects of product diversification and firm heterogeneity on the
cotton-textile industry. The business intelligence on market opportunities provided by the
trade diplomats widened the range of products manufactured and exported. Interestingly,
owing to enhanced differentiation, distance was less of a barrier for textile exports than
those of glass, the number of destinations served by the industry doubling, from 25 to 50,
between 1880 and 1910. The increase in trade caused by product diversity was
complementary to that which can be attributed to the degree of firm similarity. According
to one estimate, 20 new spinning establishments began production after 1896 (Van Houtte
1949, p. 101). 28 These establishments were often small, some of which were temporary
sheds located in the countryside. The outcome, portrayed Figure 8b, was a major
transformation in the distribution of firms. Using evidence on capitalization in spinning,

27
   In comparison, the glass and crystal industry had high level of product differentiation, but a larger share of
smaller firms than the metal and steel sector. It recorded a productivity advance of 1.03 percent per annum,
less than half the average rate of Gadisseur’s 20 industries.
28
   Van Houtte (1949, p. 103) estimated 142 establishments in the cotton-textile sector in 1896, and 306 in
1910.

                                                       22
weaving and clothing manufacture, for wool, linen and cotton, the 1880 distribution was
dominated by medium-large firms; that of 1910 indicates a broader distribution of sizes,
mostly concentrated in the middle ranges. The growth in the number of small firms had
implications for sectoral productivity in cotton textiles which increased by a meager 0.13
percent per annum between 1896 and 1910. 29 Spinning in linen and wool also recorded
subpar performances with growth rates of 0.83 and 0.70.

VI. Conclusion: Technology vs geography in the second industrial revolution

        There are a number of competing explanations why the exponential rise in
international trade did not unleash stronger economic growth. O’Rourke and Williamson
(1999) have popularized the textbook factor-endowment model to track the dynamics of
trade and growth in the first era of globalization. Others, like Temin (1997), have posited
a Ricardian structure to back out the forces of early industrialization. These competing
paradigms dominate our understanding of nineteenth-century international trade, the
outcome of an inordinate focus on British trade and an over-reliance on aggregate trade
statistics. To a large extent, both approaches ignore the presence of intraindustry trade in
differentiated goods and a “love of variety”.

        Exploiting granular data, we study the case of Belgium, a small open economy in
the crucible of the second industrial revolution during the pre-1914 trade boom. In the
spirit of modern trade theories, we find that trade costs explain as much, if not more, of
the patterns of trade as factor endowments. In particular, investments by the Belgian state
in the trade diplomatic network expanded the number of products delivered and markets
served. At the industry level, the effect of trade costs on the value of trade, the direction
of trade, and the composition of goods traded varied with the degree of product
differentiation and the degree of similarity in firm productivity.

       We have made a preliminary attempt to connect changes in trade costs and
productivity. The expansion in new trade partners and new goods did not guarantee faster
growth in per capita income. Indeed, the opposite may have held in sectors with high
degrees of product differentiation and uniformity in firm productivity. As the fixed costs of
establishing new goods in new markets came down, new entrants with lower productivity
than incumbents expanded market share. This process underlies the seemingly paradoxical
acceleration in openness beginning in the 1890s and Belgium’s lackluster productivity


29
  The uptake in ring spinning frames lagged that of its European competitors in low and medium value
goods (Saxonhouse and Wright 2004).

                                                23
performance in the same period. Rather than acting as a driver of growth, globalization
actually delayed Belgium’s second Industrial revolution.

       Can we generalize from these results? It has become a cliché to claim that deeper
integration reallocates resources more efficiently. But the pathways underlying this process
cannot be taken for granted. In the presence of entry costs, a type of race can ensue
between the positive selection effects of shifting resources and the negative effects due to
declining trade costs, or, more broadly, technology vs geography. The bottom line is that
globalization may not always show up in the growth numbers. Our findings echo Rodrik’s
(2011) observation that, sooner or later, the process of international integration comes up
against diminishing marginal returns. If so, we have uncovered another way in which the
second globalization echoes the first.

                    Background Information on Belgian Foreign Trade

General information

       The Tableau général du commerce extérieur distinguished between all goods
shipped (commerce général), which included re-exports and goods in transit, and items
produced exclusively in Belgium (commerce spécial). For the latter, we recorded trade in
manufactured goods, which represented about 50 percent of all exports in 1900 and 20
percent of all imports, at five-year intervals beginning in 1870 and until 1910. 30 The degree
of overlap in the types of trade, while certainly not trivial, declined over the period. The
attraction of concealing goods, either as re-exports or special goods from the authorities
diminished during the period under investigation, because custom duties came down. But
the same fall in duties would have encouraged “disguised transit”, the incentive for
merchants to declare their goods intended for re-export as imports for domestic
consumption, and subsequently claim the same goods as exports of domestic origin (in
order to avoid red tape and the delays associated with leaving goods in transit). 31 Horlings
(2002, p. 120) reports that most disguised transit comprised low-taxed, low-value bulk and
crude commodities, rather than processed and manufactured goods that are our interest.
Altogether, Federico and Tena (1989), measuring the accuracy of trade statistics using
exports and imports from source and destination countries, score Belgium only slightly
below the figure of the average European country.

Classification: Items, categories, and countries

        Our classification of products follows that recorded in the Tableau. The level of
detail of the products listed in Table A1 corresponds to the SITC four or five-digit level. A
recurrent problem with this type of exercise is the ability to distinguish genuinely new
products from new titles given to existing products, and other products listed in a new
separate entry but were in fact previously folded into another group. For clearly identified
new products, like streetcars made with copper this concern was immaterial, but in
broader classifications, like cotton yarn, this problem was unavoidable. To minimize
double counting, beginning with the 1870 product listing, we labeled as existing items
those 'new products' with similar titles, and other supposedly new goods whose export or
import values were of the same order of magnitude as previously recorded established

30
  We leave a full treatment of imports to further research.
31
  To avoid delays, merchants were willing to pay customs duties. Unlike items in transit, re-exports passed
through the national trade framework.

                                                     32
products. For example, when the 1880 return subdivided tissus de coton unis into tissus de
coton unis, croisés et coutils pesant 3 kilogr et plus les 100 mètres carrés, écrus, and
tissus de coton unis, croisés et coutils pesant 3 kilogr et plus les 100 mètres carrés,
blanchis, we counted these as one new product. This procedure reduced the number of
products by roughly 10 percent. For 1910, we recorded 171 distinct products or categories
exported. Over all years in our sample, the Tableau reported 202 distinct export products
and 205 distinct import products.

       Table A1 classifies goods into four categories of product differentiation, with
category 1 the least differentiated; Figure A1 plots the value of exports in each category.
There was strong growth in categories 3 and 4. This expansion coincides with the
attention given by the reports of the trade consuls in the RC to highly differentiated
goods.

        With regard to export destinations and import sources, we had two considerations.
We defined countries according to their 1910 borders. For instance, New South Wales was
recorded as Australia. But since we also needed information on GDP, we treated
Newfoundland as part of Canada. In total, we had 69 countries listed as export
destinations in 1910 based on the original sources. Table A2 presents the summary
statistics of our dataset for imports and exports. The number of import sources was
smaller than export destinations since imports of manufactured products were mainly from
European countries. Until the mid-1890s, unit values of manufactured imports actually
exceeded that of exports; thereafter the trend was reversed.

Unit values

        The spike in average unit values in Table A2 merits discussion. The Tableau, like
other nineteenth-century international trade sources, recorded official prices. This
shortcoming is minimized because prices were adjusted annually, although their reliability
varied across commodities. For some of the early years, many goods were declared in value
only. The sources of the official prices and the nature of their revisions are unclear.
Horlings (2002, p. 114) presumes they were wholesale prices rather than c.i.f. or f.o.b
prices. Despite these drawbacks, his own recalculation of trade values concentrated on the
period before mid century. Until 1845, Horlings (2002, p. 117) reduced export prices by the
order of 6 percent, but “during the remainder of the century the revision of price data
caused a change of between 1 and 3 percent of import and export values.” A drawback is
that recorded prices do not vary with destination or source, again a common feature of
historical trade statistics especially those collected on the European continent.

                                            33
       Table A3 gives unit values at the industry level. It presents a more nuanced picture
of the increase in unit values after 1890. The price rise would appear to conflate the entry
of capital-intensive firms producing high-quality-high-value added items, as in Yi (2003),
and the entry of poor performers with high marginal costs, or both. For textiles, export
prices in 1905 were only slightly higher than they were twenty years earlier, and this was
the case for paper and glass products, and pottery as well. But machine and metal prices
more than doubled. At the same time, there was also a spike in average unit values
because of big-ticket items, including the boats, cars, streetcars, and railroad wagons that
Belgium began exporting toward the end of the century.

The Theil index of international trade

       The Theil index of international trade measures the product diversification of
international trade. The index is often decomposed into within and between components.
The former is equivalent to changes in concentration along the intensive margin (defined
here as the set of commonly traded goods over a certain period); the latter captures
changes in the extensive margin (defined as newly traded or disappearing goods and/or
trade partners). 32

       The panels in Figure A2 present Theil indexes and its components for all possible
combinations of export products and destinations, and for destinations and products only.
The indexes decline in value, indicating that exports were becoming more diversified,
although after 1905 there is a small movement toward concentration. 33 The extensive
margin (the light shaded area) is initially larger than the intensive margin (the dark
shaded area), and then declines over time. This is not surprising since, sooner or later, all
trade folds into trade of existing product lines and with established markets. That said,
the tendency in overall diversification seems to be driven by the adding and dropping of
products and markets. Note that, for all three indexes, the extensive and intensive margins
have a gradual pattern which is consistent with the presence of differential trade costs by



32
    This paragraph follows Cadot et al. (2012). Export concentration measured at the intensive margin
represents inequality between the shares of active export lines. Conversely, diversification along the intensive
margin means convergence in export shares.
33
   In an influential paper, Imbs and Wacziarg (2003) found a U-shape pattern of diversification. At low levels
of income, countries' production is highly concentrated in a narrow range of products. As technology diffuses
and skill levels accumulate, product diversification intensifies. At high levels of income, countries revert to
specialization.

product and by country. A strict Ricardian model would predict abrupt changes in the
contribution of new products to overall exports.

   Notes and sources: The line plot shows the average number countries served for a good
   which has had a “spell” of the given length of non-zero exports. The averages are from
   a weighted regression of the number of countries served on a set of year indicators and
   good dummies. Weights are the total value of exports of the good. Robust confidence
   intervals were used to form the error bounds. Trade values from the Tableau, various
   years.

Notes: Dependent variable in each column is number of items exported to country d within a given
level of differentiation. Method of estimation is Poisson PML. Least differentiated goods (Category
1) include labor-intensive manufactures and manufacturing inputs. Category 2 includes semi-skilled
industrial goods and textiles. Category 3 includes semi-skilled or high skilled manufacturing goods
with substantial capital intensity. The most differentiated goods include high unit value capital
intensive manufactures such as tramways, ships, machines and machine tools. Time dummies
included but not reported. Sample includes 1870, 1875,…,1910. Robust standard errors clustered over
destinations are reported in brackets. *** p-value < 0.01, ** p-value < 0.05, * p-value < 0.1. See

Notes: Dependent variable in each row is average annual growth rate of labor productivity in
industry g. Method of estimation is OLS. Observations are weighted by their export values in
1880. A constant is included in each regression but not reported. Sample includes two periods
for each industry which cover 1880-1895 and 1895-1910. Furniture had no exports in 1880. It is
excluded from the sample since the growth rate of exports is not defined. Robust standard
errors clustered over destinations are reported in brackets. *** p-value<0.01, ** p-value <
0.05,* p-value<0. See appendix for sources.
