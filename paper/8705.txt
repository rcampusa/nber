When Do Firms Shift Production Across States to Avoid Environmental Regulation?

                                                 ABSTRACT

This paper takes a new approach to testing the impact of state environmental regulatory stringency
on firms' location decisions, focusing on firms' allocation of production across states. We use Census
data for the paper industry to measure the share of each firm's production in each state during 1967-2002.
We use a conditional logit model, controlling for a variety of state characteristics that influence firm
costs and revenues, and testing several measures of state environmental stringency. Firms allocate
significantly smaller production shares to states with stricter regulations, but there is significant heterogeneity
across firms in their sensitivity to regulatory stringency. Firms with low compliance rates are more
sensitive than firms with high compliance rates, consistent with a model where compliance rates are
driven by differences across firms in the costs of compliance, rather than in the benefits of compliance.

1. Introduction


        Environmental regulation in the U.S. has a decidedly federal nature, with state regulatory

agencies responsible for much of the enforcement activity, along with some setting of standards.

Different states, facing different benefits and costs from environmental regulation, might be

expected to choose different levels of stringency, imposing different abatement costs. In turn,

firms might respond to differences in costs by shifting their operations, opening or expanding

plants in less stringent states, and closing or reducing their operations in stricter states.

        We examine the impact of regulatory stringency on firms’ allocation of their production

across different states, measured by the share of a firm’s total production occurring in each state.

This is (to our knowledge) the first examination of this topic. Existing studies of regulatory

impact using plant-level data have tended to focus on discrete decisions: plant openings and

closings. Bartik (1988), McConnell and Schwab (1990), and Levinson (1996) found relatively

small or insignificant impacts, but more recent studies have found larger impacts. For example,

Becker and Henderson (2000) found large reductions in the number of new plants opening in

counties with stricter regulation, as did List, et. al. (2003). Furthermore, Gray (1997) found

lower birth rates of new plants in states with stricter regulation, and Deily and Gray (1991) found

that steel mills facing more stringent regulatory enforcement were more likely to close. Finally,

Greenstone (2002) a paper much closer in spirit to the our paper, finds significant reductions in

economic activity of polluting plants in higher-stringency counties, but doesn’t consider the

firm-level aspect of the decision.

        In addition to being novel, examining shifts in production shares is quantitatively

important. In our data, changes in production at existing plants account for two-thirds of the

                                                   1
aggregate changes in firms’ production shares over time, while plant openings and closings

account for only about one-sixth each. It is not obvious whether differences in environmental

regulation should affect production shares more than they affect plant openings and closings. On

the one hand, shifting production among existing plants may be easier than opening or closing

plants, making such shifts more sensitive to differences in regulation. On the other hand, many

regulations, such as new source performance review, tend to be stricter for new plants and

exempt existing ones due to grandfathering, possibly making existing plants less affected by

differences in regulation than new plants.

       We use eight years of plant-level Census year data (1967-2002) for the pulp and paper

industry from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Research Database. The data set includes firm

identifiers, allowing us to calculate the share that each state represents in a firm's shipments. We

also use information on each firm's compliance status from EPA regulatory databases to see

whether more compliant firms are more or less sensitive to state regulatory differences. We also

control for other state characteristics are included that could influence production allocation,

such as factor prices and quality, industry concentration, and product demand.

       We find a significant relationship between regulatory stringency and production

allocation. States with stricter regulations have smaller production shares, even after controlling

for a variety of other state characteristics. This impact is concentrated in firms with low levels of

compliance with environmental regulations. If anything, firms with high compliance rates tend to

prefer more stringent states, though this effect is relatively small. These results are consistent

with a model where differences across firms in compliance rates are driven primarily by

differences in compliance costs (e.g. economies of scale in compliance), rather than by

differences in the benefits of compliance (e.g. maintaining the firm's reputation). Briefly, if
                                                  2
firms choose low compliance rates because they see few benefits from complying, they would

have no need to avoid high-stringency states. If, instead, low-compliance firms would like to

comply, but don’t because it is too costly, they would avoid high-stringency states - which is

what we observe.

        Section 2 presents the theoretical and econometric models we use in analyzing the firm's

decision to allocate its production across states. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 presents

the results, followed by our conclusions and some thoughts for future research in Section 5.



2. Model

        State regulatory stringency may influence firms' decisions along many dimensions. The

usual assumption is that production costs are higher in stricter states where firms are required to

meet tougher emissions standards, install higher-capacity (more expensive) pollution control

equipment, incur higher operating costs, and perform more frequent maintenance.1 In addition to

higher production costs, more stringent states may have more complex permit procedures,

requiring firms to undertake lengthy negotiations whenever they wish to change their production

process, and perhaps imposing uncertainty about whether the changes will be permitted at all.

Since these permits are commonly required when opening a new plant, there could also be a

direct impact of regulatory stringency on the expenses or time required to open a new plant.2


1
 Becker (2005) demonstrates the connection between regulatory stringency and pollution abatement
costs. Other studies have measured regulation-induced increases in costs as decreases in productivity.
Fare et al (1989), Gray (1987), and Barbera and McConnell (1986) use industry-level data. In plant-level
work, Gollop and Roberts (1983) study electric utilities, while Berman and Bui (2001), Boyd and
McClelland (1999), and Gray and Shadbegian (2002,2003) examine manufacturing plants.
2
  The importance of permit uncertainty in the paper industry is discussed in Gray and Shadbegian (1998).
We have no direct measures of permit difficulties, but conversations with industry people suggest that
states which are stricter on our regulatory stringency measures are likely to have more delays and
                                                      3
        In addition to the overall impact of regulatory stringency on firms’ decisions, we are also

interested in heterogeneity across firms in their decisions. For example, we observe variations in

regulatory compliance across firms, with larger firms serving national markets having better

environmental performance (being more often in compliance with regulations) than smaller firms

serving local markets. Why might such differences occur?

        Differences in compliance between large and small firms could arise from differences in

their costs of dealing with the complexity of environmental regulations. Larger firms can afford

a corporate environmental staff supporting many plants. Smaller firms, relying on plant-level

personnel with many other responsibilities, cannot keep up with frequent regulatory changes.3

Larger firms may also have the political clout to intervene in the standards-setting process,

making compliance easier.4 These economies of scale in compliance should give larger firms an

advantage, especially in states with stringent regulations (and more complex bureaucratic

procedures to enforce those regulations), allowing them to choose higher compliance rates.

        Differences across firms in compliance could also arise from differences in their benefits

of compliance, attributable to the importance of reputation, both in terms of reputation with

regulatory agencies and with customers. Failure to comply with regulations may result in lost

sales, if customers value a ‘green’ image for the products they consume. Regulators may punish


uncertainty in their permitting process.
3
  These differences may be growing smaller over time (though we do not test for that here). Down-sizing
and cost-cutting pressures at large corporations have reduced the size of corporate staffs, and there has
been greater use of outside consultants specializing in environmental issues, providing smaller firms with
access to some scale economies. These trends have been more pronounced in recent years, so should be
less important for the period being studied here.
4
 Environmental officers at large corporations commonly serve on state environmental advisory boards,
where they are in a position to influence the development of new regulations.

                                                    4
violators with stricter future enforcement at all plants owned by the firm (see Harrington (1988)).

In both cases, the importance of reputation relies on non-compliant behavior being highly

visible, and on there being a large number of future interactions where the punishment can take

place. Smaller firms have fewer other plants or future sales to be punished, and their violations

are likely to be less newsworthy. Therefore smaller firms should face smaller benefits from

compliance, leading them to choose lower levels of compliance effort.

       Now consider the optimizing decision of a profit-maximizing firm choosing its

production level Qs in each of a number of different states, as shown in Equation 1 below.

R(Qs) and C(Qs) refer to the revenue function (net of transportation costs to consumers, possibly

located in other states) and production cost function in state s. We assume that over the relevant

range of output the revenue and cost functions have the usual shape – diminishing marginal

revenue (d2R(Qs)/dQs2<0) and increasing marginal costs (d2C(Qs)/dQs2>0). We also assume

that production of Q causes pollution and the firm is faced with a choice about how much of its

pollution to abate, As (0<=As<=1), with resulting abatement costs PAC(As). We further assume

increasing marginal abatement costs (d2PACs/dAs2>0). On the other hand, not abating pollution

can also be costly, as the firm faces expected penalties Ps from state regulators, where Ps

depends on both inspection frequency and the level of penalties for violations. Note that both

abatement costs and penalties are measured proportional to output. The model allows for

heterogeneity across firms in both costs of abatement αc (e.g. economies of scale in abatement)

and benefits from abatement αb (e.g. “penalties” from customer backlash if the firm is found in

violation).



(1) Max Π = R(Qs) - C(Qs) - αc*PAC(As)*Qs - αb*Ps*(1-As)*Qs
                                                 5
    Qs, As


       The profit-maximizing firm chooses both the optimal level of output (Qs*) and the

optimal level of abatement (As*) in each state. The first-order condition for choosing Qs* is

shown in Equation 2, where the usual equality between marginal revenue and marginal cost

(R’=C’) is complicated by an additional wedge, based on a combination of the cost of pollution

abatement and the penalties from non-abatement. The first-order condition for choosing As* is

shown in Equation 3, where the firm sets its marginal abatement cost equal to its expected

penalties from not abating pollution, adjusted by the firm-specific factors αc and αb.



(2) R’(Qs*) = C’(Qs*) + αc*PAC(As*) + αb*Ps*(1-As*)

(3) PAC’(As*) = (αb / αc)*Ps



       With constant or declining marginal costs of production and no transportation costs, a

profit-maximizing firm should produce all its output in the lowest-cost state, taking into account

pollution-related cost differences. Since we are analyzing data for firms that produced output in

at least four different states, they must have either increasing marginal production costs or

transportation costs, in order to have an interior solution to Equation 2 in multiple states. Firms

will tend to produce less in those states with higher regulatory stringency: all else equal, higher

Ps in a state encourages a greater abatement effort (As), both combining to create a larger wedge

between marginal revenue and marginal cost. In the extreme, firms may choose to produce

nothing in states with sufficiently high regulatory stringency.

       We are also interested in differences across firms in their sensitivity to state regulatory

                                                  6
stringency, dQs*/dPs. These differences could arise from differences in the firms’ αc or αb. We

don’t observe αc and αb, but we do observe the firm’s level of regulatory compliance, which we

take as an indicator of its average abatement decisions. Suppose that differences in compliance

across firms are driven by differences in their αc. High-compliance firms would be those with

lower αc and a smaller wedge, and thus would be less sensitive to regulatory stringency. If,

instead, differences across firms in compliance are driven by differences in their αb, high-

compliance firms would be those with higher αb and a larger wedge, and thus would be more

sensitive to regulatory stringency.

       We can see this more simply by considering the extreme cases, where αc=0 or αb=0. If

αc=0, then it is costless for the firm to abate, so it sets As*=1 and the wedge disappears. In this

case, differences in Ps have no effect on high-compliance firms. On the other hand, if αb=0, then

the firm sees no benefit from abatement, so it sets As*=0. Again the wedge disappears, but now

it is low-compliance firms that are unaffected by differences in Ps. In our empirical work, we

interact the firm’s overall compliance rate with a measure of state regulatory stringency. Based

on the argument above, a positive coefficient on the interaction term indicates that differences in

the costs of pollution abatement are the more important source of firm heterogeneity: higher firm

compliance reduces the negative impact of state stringency on production within the state. A

negative coefficient indicates that differences in benefits are more important.

       We use a conditional logit model for the analysis, examining the probability that a firm

allocates a given unit of production to a given state, given the characteristics of that state and all

the other available states to choose from:




                                                   7
                                         exp( β ∗ Z s + δ ∗ Ps + γ ∗ Ai ∗ Ps )
(4) Prob( firm i chooses state s ) =                                           .
                                        ∏ exp(β ∗ Z j + δ ∗ Pj + γ ∗ Ai ∗ Pj )
                                          j



State characteristics Zs include the cost of labor and other inputs, along with factors that might

influence marginal revenue, such as industry concentration and an index of product demand

within the state. Following this model focuses our attention on the differences in regulation (and

other explanatory variables) across states at a given time. A general increase in regulatory

stringency across all states could leave the ratio in equation (2) unchanged, in which case it

would be predicted not to influence the firm’s allocation decision – every unit of production has

to be allocated somewhere, and it’s differences in P and Z across states which matter in the

conditional logit model.


        Firm characteristics cannot directly enter the model, since they would cancel out in the

numerator and denominator of (2), but we interact our measures of regulatory stringency with the

firm’s compliance rate, to see whether low-compliance firms respond more or less to regulatory

differences. We use the fraction of all of the firm’s plants that are in compliance, based on all

plant-year observations with compliance data, so each firm has one compliance rate, fixed over

time. This is intended to capture differences across firms in their long-term compliance

tendencies.5 We consider two types of interactions, one using the continuous measure of

compliance and the other using a spline in compliance to see how responsiveness changes as

compliance rates change.



5
 Comments on an earlier version suggested concerns about possible endogeneity of compliance. This
seems less relevant in the conditional logit model, but we did test instrumenting for the firm compliance
rate, modeling plant-level compliance for the firm’s plants based on plant age and output, state regulatory
enforcement, and state and year dummies, with essentially identical results (available from the authors).
                                                     8
         The model doesn’t allow us to differentiate shifts in production across existing plants

from shifts due to plant openings and plant closings. We might expect shifting production

among existing plants to be easier than opening new plants, since new plants are generally

subject to more stringent regulations. However, air pollution regulations requiring stricter rules

for new plants (New Source Performance Standards) can also require existing plants to be treated

as new if they substantially expand their production process. This could make production shifts

among existing plants more costly. In any event, our estimated effects are best thought of as

averages across the different categories of changing production shares, weighted by their relative

sizes.


         To implement our model using a standard conditional logit routine, we treat each firm as

making 100 decisions in each time period, allocating 100 ‘percentage points’ of its production

across the available states. The estimation routine interprets this as generating a huge sample

size for the analysis, with correspondingly small standard errors and large t-statistics – but the

impact is predictable, so we can adjust for it.6 The key is to decide what the “true” sample size

is, from which the appropriate adjustment factor can be calculated and applied. In our analyses

we use the actual number of firm-state observations with positive production. This should be a

conservative measure of sample size, since it excludes any states where the firm is not currently

producing.




6
 For example, doubling the sample size (allocating 200 rather than 100 shares of production) would
double the log-likelihood and reduce all standard errors by the square root of 2, but has no effect on the
estimated coefficients.

                                                     9
3. Data


        Our basic plant-level data on production comes from the Longitudinal Research Database

(LRD) maintained at the Center for Economic Studies of the Census Bureau (see McGuckin and

Pascoe (1988) for a detailed description). We use information from the Census of Manufactures,

done every five years since 1967 on all manufacturing plants in the country (around 300,000

plants in each census). For this paper, we concentrate on pulp and paper mills, which we have

studied extensively, including an analysis of the impact of pollution abatement costs on

productivity (Gray and Shadbegian (2002) and Shadbegian and Gray (2005)). The plant-level

data includes a firm identifier, with which we link together all the paper mills owned by the same

firm in each Census year from 1967-2002.

        We add up the total value of shipments from each plant owned by the firm and calculate

the share of a firm's production arising in each state, which forms the dependent variable

(SHTVS) for our analysis.7 In order to focus on those firms which are in a position to allocate

production across states, we limit our sample to those firms which produced in at least four

different states at some point. This would give us a ‘balanced’ panel, if all firms were in

business throughout the period. A few of our firms are out of existence at some point

(corresponding to the birth or death of the entire firm). We drop those firm-year observations

since their production shares cannot be defined in that year, but keep them in the sample for the

other years.

        In what ways do firms shift production in our data? Changes in production shares at



   7
     We could calculate plant-level production shares, but all of our explanatory variables are state-
specific, so we use state-level shares instead.

                                                    10
continuing plants accounted for 68 percent of all share changes, while plant openings accounted

for 17 percent and closings for 15 percent. Thus changes in production shares at existing plants

are about four times as important as plant openings or closings in terms of moving production

activity across plants in different states.

        Does it make sense to treat the market as being served by plants in many different states?

The 1993 Commodity Flow Survey reports the distance traveled by shipments for particular

industries. Based on these data, paper shipments traveled an average of 238 miles, with 26

percent of shipments traveling further than 500 miles.8 This indicates a somewhat national

market for paper, with opportunities to shift production across states, but not a market in which

firms are concentrating all their production in one or a few states.

        As noted earlier, firms' decisions about whether or not to comply with regulations may

provide some information about their sensitivity to regulatory costs. We use plant-level air

pollution compliance data for 1979-1989 taken from the EPA's Compliance Data System, where

compliance is defined as not being ‘in violation’ for any pollutant at any point during the year.

All of the available plant-years of compliance data were linked together by firm, and the 'firm

compliance average' was calculated as the fraction of all observations in compliance.9 We use a

single compliance measure for each firm (not a time-varying one) because the compliance data is

not consistently available before the 1980s. Using a single compliance measure is appropriate as

long as differences in compliance primarily reflect long-run differences between firms, rather

than transitory fluctuations.

        Aside from the firm compliance variable and firm and year dummies, all of the

explanatory variables in our model are state-specific. These range from state-level regulatory

variables to input cost and other factors expected to influence the production decision. In earlier

plant-location analyses (Gray (1997)) the issue of endogeneity of these explanatory variables

arose, and was addressed in part by lagging the explanatory variables by five years. Thus 1977

explanatory variables are assumed to influence the birth rate of new plants between 1977 and

1982. We use a similar procedure here, so that 1977 explanatory variables are used to explain

production shares in 1982.

        The state-level regulatory data comes from a variety of sources. One problem with our

regulatory measures is that they tend not to be available before the 1980s, and often have no

time-series variation available at all. Our principle index of regulatory stringency does have

some time-series variation: support for environmental legislation in Congress. The League of

Conservation Voters calculates a scorecard for each member of Congress on environmental

issues, with data available back to the early 1970s. We use the average score for the state's

House of Representative members (VOTE) in our analysis.10

        The Census Bureau's Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures (PACE) survey

reports the dollars spent for pollution abatement by manufacturing firms, giving totals for all

industries in each state and for all plants nationwide in each industry. We divide annual

pollution abatement operating costs by total manufacturing shipments to measure pollution


   10
     The earliest year available in the League of Conservation Voters data is 1970. We calculated
comparable measures for the 1960s, using congressional voting data on environment-related legislation in
the 1960s. Of course the environmental bills being considered in the 1960s were fewer and less costly
than those in later years, but the votes should reflect similar differences in state preferences for regulation.

                                                      12
abatement intensity (for each state and each industry). We then calculate the predicted

abatement intensity for each state, multiplying each industry's abatement intensity by its share in

total state employment (from the Census of Manufactures). The residual abatement intensity

(actual minus predicted), is used in the regressions (PAOCADJ). The survey was first done in

1973, and the 1973 values are used for all years of data before 1973. This is equivalent to

assuming that the relative rankings of the states were unchanged before 1973 and allowing the

year dummies in the regressions to control for the expected (but unmeasured) tendency towards

lower expenditures before 1973.

        The Green Index publication (Hall and Kerr 1991) contains one-time rankings of all the

states on a large number of environmental-related variables. A measure of regulatory stringency

is the ‘Green Policies’ (ENVPOLICY) index, designed to measure the stringency of state

environmental regulations based on a set of 77 specific indicators, such as the presence of state

laws on specific topics such as recycling. A measure of environmental problems in each state is

the 'Green Conditions' (DIRTY) index, which indicates the state's combined ranking on over 100

measures of the quality of the state's environment, including air and water pollution

information.11 CONVMEMB (taken from the same source) is the number of members of three

conservation groups (Sierra Club, Greenpeace, and National Wildlife Federation) per 1000 in the

state population, indicating support for environmental issues among the state's electorate.

REGSPEND is the dollars per capita spent on the state's programs for environmental and natural

resources in 1988 (Council of State Governments (1991)).


   11
     The original rankings were designed so that low scores reflected stricter regulation and a cleaner
environment. Since all other stringency measures use higher values to indicate stricter regulation, we
multiplied the Green Policies index by -1 to improve comparability.

                                                    13
           A direct measure of enforcement activity for air pollution regulation is taken from the

EPA's Compliance Data System. This database reports all air pollution inspections, identifying

the affected plant by industry and location. The total number of inspections of manufacturing

plants between 1984 and 1987, divided by the number of manufacturing plants in 1982, was

calculated for each state (AIRINSP). Greater enforcement activity is expected to put more

pressure on plants in the state to come into compliance with air pollution regulations, raising

costs and reducing profitability. In Deily and Gray (1991) a similar measure of enforcement was

found to increase the probability that a steel plant would close.

           One final regulatory variable (NONATTAIN) measures the state's attainment status for

key pollutants. We select a single air pollutant that is particularly relevant for the paper industry

(particulates), and calculate the fraction of the counties in the state that are not in attainment.12 A

high value should be associated with more regulation, as dirtier air calls for more restrictions on

plant expansion or new plant construction.

           We also create a few variables measuring the characteristics of the industry in each state.

DEMAND is a state-specific demand index for paper in the state. We use data on employment

for each one-digit industry in the state, and combine it with data from the 1982 input-output

tables on how much paper each one-digit industry consumes (per employee). To capture ‘final

demand’ for paper by consumers, we use the state's total income and calculated final demand per

dollar of total state income. Adding up the industry and consumer demand for paper gives an

indicator of total demand in the state. It only captures shifts in within-state demand; to the extent

that the market is national or regional in scope, this local demand index may be less important.

     We would like to thank Randy Becker for providing this attainment data.

                                                     14
       HERF is the Herfindahl index for plants in the state, measuring how concentrated the

production of paper is in the state. We identify all plants in the industry in each Census year,

add up their individual shipments, and calculate a share of each plant in the total shipments.

Finally, we square each plant's share and sum them. A number close to one indicates highly

concentrated production, while numbers near zero indicate little concentration. To the extent

that a more concentrated industry has more market power, it could raise price in response to

stricter regulations, so may be less sensitive to regulatory pressures. Of course, an ideal measure

of such concentration would be firm-level, rather than plant-level, and might include plants in

nearby states that supplied the same market.

       CLOUT is paper industry shipments from plants in the state, divided by the total gross

state product. A large industry might be expected to have more political power, and thus to be

able to gain exemptions from regulatory pressures. On the other hand, a large industry is likely

to be a larger contributor to the total pollution problem in the state, and may be a more visible

target for stricter regulatory pressures. CLOUT should get a positive coefficient, reflecting

whatever characteristics make the state a desirable location.

       In addition to the regulatory variables, a number of other variables are used to control for

differences across states that might influence production allocation. These variables were used

in earlier work focussing on plant location, Gray (1997), and were designed to capture a wide

range of the other factors affecting the location decision. The earlier work found them to be

generally significant as a group, although only a subset would be individually significant in any

given regression. Factor price measures include ENERGYPRI (dollars per million BTU, from

the Energy Information Administration), LANDPRICE (value per acre of agricultural land and

buildings, from the City and County Databook), and WAGE (average hourly wage in
                                                 15
manufacturing, taken from the Statistical Abstract). All dollar values are converted to real 1982

values using the GDP deflator. Labor market indicators include UNION (percent of non-

agricultural workforce unionized, from Bureau of Labor Statistics), UNEMP (civilian

unemployment rate), and INCOME (income per capita). Labor quality is measured by the

fraction of the over-25 population with college degrees (COLLEDUC). Tax differences are

measured by state and local taxes, divided by gross state product (TAXGSP). ELECDEM is the

percentage of votes for Democratic candidates in the U.S. House of Representatives for the state.

Population density (POPDEN) controls for differences in the size of the local product market

and possibly also for ‘agglomeration effects’ (the tendency to locate where existing businesses

are already located). AREA provides a physical measure of the extent of the available market in

the state.



4. Results

        Table 1 presents the means and standard deviations for each variable used in the analysis.

In our data, the average paper firm is operating in about 15 states, resulting in an average of

about 6-7 percent of the firm’s production occurring in each state (or alternatively a probability

of about 6-7 percent that any given unit of the firm’s production occurs in that state). We have

about 40 firms in our sample and 7 years of data, resulting in a sample size of 3574 firm-state

observations with non-zero production. Most firms have relatively high compliance rates,

averaging around 70 percent of their plants in compliance.

        Table 2 presents the basic models, using the conditional logit model described earlier.

The model explains 10-15 percent of the variation in production allocation across our firm-state

observations, once state characteristics or state dummies are included in the model. Consider
                                                16
model 3, which includes state characteristics but not state dummies. The DEMAND index, as

expected, shows that higher state demand for the industry’s product is associated with greater

production in the state; CLOUT is also positive. ENERGYPRI and WAGE have the expected

significant negative impact on production shares: states with higher energy prices and a higher

wages are allocated lower production shares. COLLEDUC has the expected positive effect on

production shares, though it is only marginally significant. On the other hand, several variables

have unexpected effects, and some of them are significant in model 3, such as LANDPRICE,

TAXGSP, and ELECDEM. Not surprisingly, including state dummy variables in model 4 raises

the overall explanatory power of the model, but reduces the significance of most of the state

characteristics. In fact, DIRTY and AREA drop out of the model when the state dummies are

included, since they are purely cross-sectional variables.

       The main focus of this study is on state regulatory stringency, as measured by VOTE, and

its interaction with firm compliance rates. The VOTE variable is consistently negative and

significant, while the interaction between compliance and stringency (COMP*VOTE) is

consistently positive and significant. This indicates that firms with low compliance rates tend to

avoid states with stricter regulation, but that the effect is smaller for firms with higher

compliance rates. In fact, at a high enough compliance rate, the marginal effect of more

stringency is positive. The ‘crossover’ compliance rate varies from 56-74 percent in the models

with state dummies to 97 percent in the models with state characteristics, but not state dummies.

The average compliance rate in our sample, 70 percent, is near the crossover point of 74, so the

marginal impact of stringency on a typical firm's production allocation is likely to be small.

Still, the results indicate that low-compliance firms are more likely to avoid high-stringency

states, which is consistent with compliance decisions being driven by differences in compliance
                                                  17
costs across firms (economies of scale in compliance), rather than differences in benefits

(maintaining firm reputation).

        In Table 3 we examine the interaction between the regulatory measures and the firm’s

compliance rate using a less constrained approach, creating dummies for firms with compliance

rates exceeding 70 percent and 85 percent, which correspond very roughly to the median and 75th

percentile of the firm compliance distribution.13 For those models that incorporate state

characteristics, we find that the impact of regulatory stringency on production allocation, as

measured by VOTE, is negative and significant for those firms with less-than-average

compliance rates (below 70 percent). For firms with intermediate compliance rates (between 70

and 85 percent), the impact of regulatory stringency is smaller, but still negative, while those

firms with very high compliance rates (over 85 percent) tend to show a positive impact of

regulatory stringency of production allocation.

        Table 4 examines six other measures of state regulatory stringency, along with their

interactions with firm compliance. Because these measures (except PAOCADJ and

NONATTAIN) have no within-state variation, we cannot include state fixed-effects in these

models. We do include the full set of state-specific control variables, which have similar

coefficients (not shown here) to those found in Table 2 (model 3). In the upper panel, most of

the other stringency measures give results similar to VOTE, with a negative coefficient on the

regulatory variable and a positive interaction with firm compliance (only ENVPOL has the

unexpected positive sign on the regulatory variable). Those measures for which both terms are

significant (PAOCADJ, NONPM, and CONVMEMB) have cross-over points for their

                                                    18
compliance rates roughly similar to those found for VOTE, ranging from 54 percent for

PAOCADJ to 97 percent for CONVMEMB.

       The results in the lower panel of Table 4 show the interactions of these 6 regulatory

measures with dummies indicating firm compliance rates greater than 70 or 85 percent. The

impacts here are less consistent than those for VOTE in Table 3, but for those regulatory

measures with consistently significant effects in the upper panel, we see that firms with below-

average compliance are more sensitive to regulation than high-compliance firms. Also, the

highest-compliance firms have consistently positive effects – allocating relatively more

production to those states with more stringent regulation.



5. Conclusions

       We examine the decision faced by a firm trying to allocate its production across plants in

several states, based in part on the regulatory stringency in those states. We are able to measure

these decisions between 1967 and 2002, at five year intervals, using the Census Bureau's

Longitudinal Research Database. We focus on paper firms, which face relatively stringent

environmental regulation and have many firms with operations in multiple states.

       We find a significant relationship between our regulatory variables and production

allocation within the paper industry. States with stricter regulations have smaller production

shares, even after controlling for a variety of other state characteristics. Interacting firm

compliance and state stringency, we find that the impact of stringency is concentrated on low-

compliance firms. In fact, firms with high compliance rates appear to be slightly more likely to

produce in more stringent states. The crossover points (where state stringency has no impact on

production location), occur between 50 and 80 percent compliance rates, relatively close to the
                                                 19
actual compliance rates of about 70 percent in our data.

           Our result that high-compliance firms are less likely to avoid more stringent states seems

consistent with compliance decisions being driven by differences in compliance costs across

firms (economies of scale in compliance), rather than differences in benefits (maintaining firm

reputation). If firms are choosing low compliance rates because they do not see any benefits

from complying, they would not need to avoid high-stringency states (since they are not

planning to comply anyway). If the low-compliance firms are trying to comply, but failing due

to high compliance costs, they would want to avoid high-stringency states – consistent with our

results.

           We anticipate further work in this area, looking in more detail at changes in allocation

over time and developing a model of a firm's compliance behavior in order to better understand

how regulation affects production allocation decisions.
