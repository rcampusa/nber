Introduction

    The modern literature on the choice of fixed versus flexible exchange rate regimes traces back

to Friedman (1953). Friedman’s contribution emphasized the enhanced flexibility of relative prices

afforded by floating exchange rates in a world where nominal goods prices adjust slowly. A

country can be insulated to some degree from foreign demand shocks under floating exchange rates

because relative price movements absorb some of the changes in demand that would have to be met

by changes in quantities produced under fixed exchange rates.

    Friedman’s early work was supplemented and refined in the 1960s by Mundell (1960, 1961a,

1961b, 1963) who explored the role of capital mobility in the choice of exchange-rate regimes.

Whether fixed or floating exchange rates are better depends in Mundell’s work on whether the

source of shocks was monetary or real; on the degree of capital and other factor mobility; and, on

the relative size of countries.

    A large literature in the 1970s and 1980s, in turn, extended Mundell by incorporating a role for

expectations. Contributors include Turnovsky (1976, 1983), Fischer (1976), Hamada and Sakurai

(1978), Flood (1979), Flood and Marion (1983), Weber (1981), Kimbrough (1983), Aizenman and

Frenkel (1985), and Glick and Wihlborg (1990). These papers evaluated the optimality of

exchange-rate regimes on ad hoc criteria, generally involving variance of output and inflation.

    We investigate the optimality of exchange rate regimes from a welfare maximization standpoint.

Others have studied the welfare properties of alternative exchange-rate systems, including Lapan

and Enders (1980), Helpman (1981), Helpman and Razin (1982), Eaton (1985), Aizenman (1994),

Chinn and Miller (1998), and Neumeyer (1998). These papers, however, do not assume any sort of

nominal price stickiness, and therefore do not follow directly in the tradition of Friedman and

Mundell.




                                                  1
    The model we use is a two-country, infinite-horizon model of optimization under uncertainty.

Consumers get utility from consumption, leisure and real balances. We assume that there is perfect

capital mobility, because we allow a complete market of state-contingent nominal bonds. The

sources of uncertainty are random monetary shocks at home and abroad. We assume that

monopolistic firms must set nominal prices prior to the realization of monetary shocks. Prices

adjust fully after one period.

    Two important features of the economy that we examine are motivated in part by the empirical

research of Robert Lipsey. First is the nature of how price setting affects the optimal choice of

exchange-rate regime. Friedman and Mundell assumed that producers set prices in their own

currency, and that those prices do not adjust when exchange rates change. Indeed, in their models,

the law of one price holds for all goods.

    Lipsey has demonstrated how poor the law of one price assumption is. The seminal paper in

this regard is Kravis and Lipsey (1978).1 That paper demonstrates that prices show substantial

deviations from purchasing power parity. Moreover, relative prices move with exchange rates:

countries with weaker currencies have lower prices. These movements appear to be attributable to a

large extent to failures of the law of one price: “There are reasons for believing that there may be

substantial deviations from the law of one price even for traded goods (p.227).” Furthermore, it

appears from microeconomic data that firms set different prices for consumers in different

countries. They conclude, “A given seller may charge different prices for a given product to

different destinations (p. 234),” and, “Price discrimination … is quite common in international trade

(p. 234).”

    More recent empirical research confirms those findings.2 Swedenborg and Lipsey (1998)

conclude that even for highly tradable food items, a significant temporary factor affecting relative

prices across countries is exchange rate movements. We conclude that a better description of price

setting is that nominal prices are sticky in the currency of the consumer. We refer to this type of

price stickiness as “pricing to market”.

    We have argued that the type of price stickiness may be of critical importance in the analysis of

fixed versus floating exchange rates (Devereux and Engel (1998)). We find that under floating

exchange rates and pricing to market, foreign monetary shocks do not affect domestic

consumption.3 In contrast, when prices are set in the producers’ currencies, the prices paid by home

residents for foreign goods changes as the exchange rate changes. This introduces a channel

through which the foreign monetary shocks can affect domestic consumption. The larger the share

of foreign goods in consumption, the more vulnerable will consumption be to foreign money

shocks. The type of pricing behavior also influences the average level of prices, consumption and

leisure under floating exchange rates.

    We extend our earlier paper by examining the role of the price-setting behavior of firms when

there is internationalized production. Lipsey’s empirical work has documented the large and

increasing role for multinationals in U.S. and world production. Lipsey (1998) finds that

internationalized production grew from four and a half percent of world output in 1970 to seven

percent of world output in 1995. In manufacturing, the share rose from twelve percent in 1970 to

sixteen percent in 1990 (and probably much higher by 1995.) Blomstrom, Fors and Lipsey (1997)

find that U.S. firms allocated more labor-intensive operations to foreign affiliates. Kravis and

    However, we shall see that foreign monetary variance may influence the expected level of home consumption.

Lipsey (1982, 1992), and Lipsey (1988, 1993) document the increasing role for multinational

production for U.S. firms.

   For purposes of comparison with standard models that assume no internationalized production,

we make the extreme assumption that all production for export occurs in foreign affiliates. Kravis

and Lipsey (1992) document that by the late 1980s, U.S. multinationals export more from their

foreign affiliates abroad than from the U.S.

   The model in this paper of floating exchange rates with prices set in producers’ currency is

based on Obstfeld and Rogoff (1998). That model, in turn, is influenced by the non-stochastic

models of Corsetti and Pesenti (1998) and Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995). These models are examples

of recent international models with optimizing agents and prices which are sticky in producers’

currencies which include Svensson and van Wijnbergen (1989), Kollman (1996) and Hau (1998).

   Our pricing to market model shares some of the characteristics of Bacchetta and van Wincoop’s

(1998) examination of how exchange rate regime affects the volume of trade and capital flows in a

stochastic two-period model of pricing to market. Our model of pricing to market is also related to

the work of Betts and Devereux (1996, 1998a, 1998b). Other recent general equilibrium models in

which prices are sticky in consumers’ currencies include Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (1997), Tille

(1998a, 1998b) and Engel (1996).

   None of the aforementioned models, however, allow for any internationalized production.

   The general models are laid out in section 1. In section 2, we investigate the welfare

comparisons of fixed versus floating exchange rates under the two models of price-setting behavior.

Section 3 compares the results with those of Devereux and Engel (1998), so that we can ascertain

the role of internationalized production. The concluding section points to some potential

weaknesses of our analysis and directions for future research.




                                                  4
1. The Model

   Here we lay out the main features of the models we examine. The model for consumers follows

exactly that of Devereux and Engel (1998), which in turn closely follows the model of consumption

in Obstfeld and Rogoff (1998). Consumers maximize expected lifetime utility, taking prices and

wages as given. Home-country agents own home-country firms (and similarly for foreign country

agents). Firm managers make production and pricing decisions. Each consumer receives a share of

profits from every firm in which he owns shares. Monetary authorities in each country let the

money supply fluctuate randomly in the floating exchange rate models, and this is the only source

of uncertainty in the model. In the fixed exchange rate model, the foreign monetary authority

determines the foreign money supply (randomly), while the domestic central bank controls the

domestic money supply in order to keep the exchange rate fixed.

   There are sticky goods prices in our models. Producers must set prices prior to the realization of

monetary shocks. One could justify this constraint with an appropriate menu-cost model, though we

do not model this and simply view the stickiness of prices as an institutional constraint. Prices

adjust fully to monetary shocks after one period. There is no persistence to the price-adjustment

process. We consider two separate types of price setting. In the first type, producers must set prices

in their own currency. For example, the home currency price of home goods is preset, and

unresponsive to monetary shocks. This implies that the price for home goods paid by foreign

consumers varies when the exchange rate changes in response to monetary shocks. In the other type

of model, producers preset prices in consumers’ currencies. Home firms set one price for home-

country consumers in the home currency and another price for foreign-country consumers in the

foreign currency. In the fixed exchange rate model, the currency in which prices are set is irrelevant




                                                  5
since the exchange rate is assumed to be fixed permanently. In each of the models, the objective of

the firm managers is to maximize the expected utility of the representative owner of the firm.

   We shall contrast the exchange-rate regime choice when all production by home firms is

accomplished with domestic factors of production (as in Devereux and Engel (1998)), with a

production configuration in which the domestically-owned firm produces goods for sale to

foreigners using foreign factors of production. (Similarly, goods sold by the foreign-owned firm to

home residents are produced by home-country factors.)



Consumers

   The representative consumer in the home country maximizes:

                   ∞            
        U t = E t  ∑ β s −t u s  , 0 < β < 1
                   s =t         

where

                1                 M     

               1− ρ                Ps    

C is a consumption index over home and foreign consumption:

                 C hn C 1f−n
        C=                       .
               n n (1 − n )1−n

There are n identical individuals in the home country, 0 < n < 1 , and 1-n in the foreign country. Ch

and Cf , in turn, are indexes over consumption of goods produced at home and in the foreign

country, respectively:

                                         λ                                                     λ

        C h = n λ ∫ C h (i ) λ di                     C f = (1 − n ) λ ∫ C f (i ) λ di 

                                                             6
The elasticity of substitution between any two goods produced within a country is λ , which we

assume to be greater than 1. There is a unit elasticity of substitution between the home goods and

foreign goods bundles. M              represents domestic real balances, and L is the labor supply of the
                                P

representative home agent.

     The utility function we consider here is one case investigated by Devereux and Engel (1998).

They examine a more general welfare function in which real balances enter as a power function, and

labor enters quadratically. We choose this simpler representation for utility here for several

reasons. The model can be solved analytically in closed form for this welfare function, while the

more general welfare function requires us to use second-order Taylor series approximations. We

found in Devereux and Engel (1998) that the assumption of real balances entering logarithmically

makes little difference for the conclusions on the optimality of fixed vs. floating exchange rates.

     We justify the linearity of labor on two grounds. First, some literature has found that when

individuals face a discrete choice of working a fixed number of hours or not working at all, the

appropriate aggregate representation for leisure in the utility function is linear.4 Second, we do not

believe there is a strong tradition in economics of considering the effects of risk-averse behavior

toward uncertainty about consumption of leisure. Risk-neutrality toward leisure is probably a

plausible assumption.5

     P, the price index, is defined by

(1) P = Phn Pf1−n ,

     The preferences of foreign consumers are similar to home country residents’ preferences. The

terms in the utility function involving consumption are identical in the two countries. Note that this

implies that if the law of one price should hold for both goods, then purchasing power parity

obtains: Pt = S t Pt* , where S t is the home-currency price of foreign currency. The functional form

for real balances and labor are also the same, but, for foreign residents, they are functions of foreign

real balances and foreign labor supply.

     The optimal intratemporal consumption choices take on simple forms:

                                      −λ                                       −λ

          Ph C h = nPC ,                         Pf C f = (1 − n ) PC ;

and,

              n                                   1

     We assume that there are complete asset markets -- residents of each country can purchase state-

contingent nominal bonds. As Obstfeld and Rogoff (1998) emphasize, the structure of the utility

functions ensures that there is complete consumption risk sharing when the law of one price holds,

irrespective of what assets are traded.6 But the law of one price does not hold in the pricing-to-

market model. We consider the assumption of complete asset markets to be convenient, and an

approximation to the assumption of perfect capital mobility.

     Given the intratemporal consumption choices above, the budget constraint of the representative

home agent is:

5
    The existence of overtime pay, however, suggests that there is some desire to smooth leisure.




                                                                   8
           Pt Ct + M t + ∑z t +1 q(z t +1 , z t ) B( z t +1 ) = Wt Lt + π t + M t −1 + Bt + Tt .

B( z t +1 ) are contingent home-currency denominated nominal bonds whose prices at time t are

q( z t +1 , z t ) , where z t represents the state at time t. π t is the representative agent’s share of profits

from all home firms. Tt represents monetary transfers from the government. Wt is the wage rate.7

      In addition to the consumption demand equations, we can derive the money demand equation

for the representative home-country resident:

    Mt   χC tρ
(2)    =        ,
    Pt   1 − dt

where dt is the inverse of the gross nominal interest rate, equal to:

                C −ρ P 
      d t = Et  β −t ρ+1 t  .
                C P 
                  t     t +1 


The trade-off between consumption and leisure is given by:

       Wt
(3)             =η .
      Pt C tρ

      Before turning to the role of government, and the production and pricing decision of firms, it is

convenient to express the equilibrium condition that arises from the complete market in nominal

bonds:

                        ρ
    S P*  C 
(4) t t =  t*  .
     Pt     Ct 

   See Cole and Obstfeld (1991) for an analysis of how the terms of trade changes can serve as a substitute for capital
mobility.
7
    To avoid excess notation, we will not continue to use this state-contingent notation from here on. The important
point to remember is that complete asset markets are necessary to sustain the full risk-sharing condition in equation
(1.10) below.


                                                                  9
    There are immediately two important things that arise out of condition (4). First, when the law

of one price holds (as it does in the PCP and FER models defined below), then home consumption

always equals foreign consumption: Ct = C t* .8

    Second, the factor price equalization holds. This arises immediately out of equations (3) and

(4), and does not require that the law of one price hold for either good. We have:

    Wt = S tWt* .



Government

    Government alters the money supply with direct transfers. The government budget constraint

(in per capita terms) is

         M t = M t −1 + Tt .



Firms

    Here we shall discuss the production and pricing decisions for firms with internationalized

production. Ultimately we will contrast our welfare results in this model with those in Devereux

and Engel (1998). That paper assumes all production by home firms takes place domestically, and

all production by foreign firms takes place in the foreign country.

    Firms are assumed to be monopolistic competitors. The production function by the home-

country firm i for sale to domestic residents is given by:

         X ht (i ) = Lt (i ) .

So, total output sold to domestic residents by firm i, X ht (i ) , is produced using only labor.

Similarly, the production function for sales to foreign consumers by firm i is given by:

8
    It is not necessary that markets be complete to sustain this condition in the PCP model.

                                                           10
         X ht* (i ) = L*t (i ) .

   The objective of the domestic firms is to set prices to maximize the expected utility of the

owners, who are the domestic residents. Firms must set prices before information about the random

domestic and foreign money supplies is known. We will consider three models:

   PCP: PCP refers to producer-currency pricing. Producers set the price in their own currency.

The price that foreigners pay for home goods, and the price that home residents pay for foreign

goods fluctuates when the exchange rate changes. This model is examined by Obstfeld and Rogoff

(1995, 1998).

   PTM: PTM refers to pricing to market. Producers set the price in the consumers’ currency.

Prices consumers face do not respond to exchange rate changes. A PTM model was introduced by

Devereux and Engel (1998).

   FER: FER refers to permanently fixed exchange rates. Prices are set ahead of time, but the

choice of currency is irrelevant since there is essentially a single currency.

   No state-contingent pricing is allowed in the three models.

   The firm owners maximize the expected present value of profits using the market nominal

discount factor for the owners of the firm. This is equivalent to maximizing expected utility of the

owners. In the PCP model, the firms choose a single price for both markets. Given there is no

intertemporal aspect to the firms’ optimization problems (see, Obstfeld and Rogoff (1998)), this

reduces to maximizing:

    Et −1 (d t −1 (( Pht (i ) − Wt ) X ht (i ) + ( Pht (i ) − S tWt * ) X ht* (i ) )).

Given that factor price equalization holds in all of our models, this objective function can be

simplified to:

    Et −1 (d t −1 (( Pht (i ) − Wt )( X ht (i ) + X ht* (i ) ))



                                                                         11
    Then, using the fact that home and foreign consumption are equal in the PCP model, the optimal

price set by the home firm is:

                       λ Et −1 (Ct1− ρWt )
     Pht (i ) = Pht =                       .
                      λ − 1 Et −1 (Ct1− ρ )

From equation (3), this price-setting rule can be rewritten as:

           λη  Et −1 ( Pt Ct )
(5) Pht =                  1− ρ
                                  .
           λ − 1  Et −1 (C t )

In a world of certainty, the price would be a mark-up over unit labor costs. Here, there is a risk

premium incorporated in the goods price (as Bacchetta and van Wincoop (1998) and Devereux and

Engel (1998) discuss) arising from the covariance of the firm’s profits with the marginal utility of

consumption.

    The law of one price holds for the price charged to foreigners by the home firm:

          P
(6) Pht* = ht          .
                 St

    Analogous relationships hold for the prices set by the foreign firms:

            λη  Et −1 ( Pt Ct )
                             * *
(7) Pft* =                 *1− ρ
                                   ,
            λ − 1  Et −1 (Ct )

(8) Pft = S t Pft* .

    In the PTM model, the firm chooses two different prices – one for residents of its own country,

and for residents of the other country. The typical home firm maximizes:

          [ (                                                                               )]
     Et −1 d t −1 Pht (i ) X ht (i ) + S t Pht* (i) X ht* (i ) − Wt ( X ht (i ) + X ht* (i )) ,

where we have used factor-price equalization. The price charged by the home firm to the home

residents is the same as in the PCP model, and is given in equation (5). But, making use of the risk-

sharing condition (4), we find the price charged to foreign residents is given by:



                                                                      12

Likewise, the price charged by foreign firms to its own residents is the same as in the PCP model,

and is given by equation (7), but the price charged to home-country consumers in the PTM model

is:

                                   1− ρ
                   λ  Et −1 (C t Wt )  λη  Et −1 ( Pt C t )

                   λ − 1  Et −1 (Ct )     λ − 1  Et −1 (Ct )

Comparing equation (10) to (5), we see that in the PTM model, home residents pay exactly the same

price for the home and the foreign good. Likewise, equations (9) and (7) show that the foreign

resident pays the same price for the two goods (although the prices do not necessarily equal the

price paid by home residents.)

      In the FER model, the exchange rate is fixed at all times, so the pricing rule is the same whether

the firms state prices in their own currency or the foreign currency.

      Equilibrium in the home market for labor requires that labor employed equal to demand for

home goods and foreign goods by home residents:

                     Pt Ct           PC
(11)        Lt = n         + (1 − n ) t t .
                      Pht             Pft

      In both of the models with floating exchange rates, some simplifications of equation (11) are

readily derived. In the PTM model, we note that since Pht = Pft = Pt , we arrive at

(12)        Lt = Ct .

The logic of that relationship is straightforward. Since the relative price of home goods to foreign

goods is always one, and both goods are produced by domestic labor, then the amount of labor

demanded will equal the amount of the good consumed (since the production function is Yt = Lt .)

      The expectation of equation (11) can be simplified in the PCP model. From equation (5):


                                                          13
                PC       λ −1

                Pht         λη

                         Pt  Pt*
If we use the facts that    = * , and Ct = C t* , then we get, using equation (7):
                         Pft Pft

                PC                * *

                Pft               ft 

Equations (11), (13) and (14) then tell us in the PCP model:

                         λ −1
(15)    Et −1 ( Lt ) =        Et −1 (Ct1− ρ ) .
                          λη

   These equations suffice to solve the three models. In the next section, we will analyze welfare

under fixed exchange rates, and under the two models of floating exchange rates.



2. Welfare Comparisons

   We shall assume the money supply follows a random walk:

(16)    Et ( M t            )=µ.
                   M t +1

       Under these assumptions, it is easy to verify from the money demand equation, (2.2), that

consumption is a function only of the real money supply:

                   1 − µβ M t
(17)    Ctρ = (          )    .
                      χ    Pt

An analogous equation holds for the foreign country.

   This equation implies that the home and foreign nominal interest rates must be constant. The

gross nominal interest rate is given by the inverse of dt, which is defined is section 1. The ex post

real interest rate is determined by the rate of change of consumption: higher consumption growth is

associated with higher real interest rates.


                                                                   14
   Consider a monetary expansion in the home country under flexible exchange rates. In each of

our models, a monetary expansion lowers the real interest rate. Since money is neutral in the long-

run (i.e., after one period), current consumption must grow. A monetary expansion also leads to

expected inflation. The future domestic price level increases more than the current price level in

each of our models. When money enters the utility function logarithmically, the increase in

expected inflation exactly offsets the decline in the real interest rate, leaving the nominal interest

rate unchanged.

   It follows immediately that in both the PCP and PTM models, the exchange rate must follow a

random walk. In our model, uncovered interest parity may not hold exactly, because there may be a

foreign exchange risk premium. However, under assumptions that will be introduced shortly

(specifically, that the variance of monetary shocks is constant over time), the risk premium is

constant. Since domestic and foreign interest rates are also constant, the expected change in the

(log of) the nominal exchange rate must be zero. Because money is neutral in the long run, the

current change in the exchange rate is proportional to changes in domestic money (with a positive

sign) and foreign money (with a negative sign.) In fact, from equations (4) and (17):

                M t (1 − µβ )
(18)    St =                       .
               M t* (1 − µ * β )

   We can now derive one of the chief results of this section: in the PTM model, foreign monetary

shocks have no effect on domestic consumption, but they do affect home consumption in the PCP

model. Recall that P = Phn Pf1−n . In the PTM model, P is predetermined, so it is not affected by

foreign (or domestic) money shocks. It follows from equation (17) that domestic consumption is

determined in the short-run entirely by the domestic money supply. Changes in the foreign money

supply have no effect on domestic consumption. In contrast, in the PCP model, Pf increases when




                                                   15
the price of the foreign currency increases, since that price is fixed in foreign currency terms. So, a

one-percent jump up in the foreign money supply leads to a one-percent decrease in S, a one-percent

decrease in Pf, and a 1 − n percent decline in P. So, a one-percent increase in the foreign money

                      1− n
supply induces a           percent increase in C.
                       ρ

          We have compared the two floating exchange rate models (PCP and PTM.) How do these

models compare to the fixed-exchange rate (FER) model? To keep exchange rates fixed, the

domestic money supply must move in proportion to the foreign money supply (see equation (18).)

It follows that in response to a one-percent shock to the foreign money supply, the domestic money

supply must change one percent. Since goods prices do not change, equation (17) tells us there

              1
must be a       percent change in domestic consumption.
              ρ

     If our only concern were how the variance of foreign money shocks affected the variance of

domestic consumption, it is clear that floating rates dominate fixed exchange rates. Under fixed

                                                                  1
rates, a one percent shock to foreign money leads to a              percent changes in domestic consumption,
                                                                  ρ

percent in the PTM model. Table 1 shows how the variance of (the log of) consumption is related

to the variance of (the log of) the foreign money supply in each model.9

    These results are derived formally in Appendix 1 in equations (A.9), (A.16) and (A.23)

        But, the variance of consumption this is not the only welfare consideration. Even ignoring

the effect on welfare coming from money in the utility function, the variance of foreign monetary

shocks has further effects on utility. Leisure enters utility linearly, so greater variance of output

(and hence leisure) does not directly influence welfare. But, the variance of foreign monetary

shocks has further effects on welfare because it influences the means of both consumption and

leisure. This channel arises from the effects that monetary variances have on goods prices.

    We assume shocks to money supplies are log-normally distributed. Using equation (16):

                                1
(19)    mt +1 − mt = − ln( µ ) + σ m2 + υ t +1 ,
                                2

where mt is the log of Mt (we will follow the convention that lower-case letters are logs of upper-

case letters), υ t +1 is the white-noise shock to domestic money, and σ m2 is the variance of υ t +1 .

An analogous equation holds for the foreign money supply process.

    We can write equations (17) and (18) as

(20)    ρct = mt − pt + ln(1 − µβ ) ,
                                 χ

(21)    s t = mt − mt* + ln(1 − µβ ) − ln(1 − µ * β ) .

    In log terms, equation (3) can be written as:



                                                          17
(22)    wt = pt + ρct + ln(η ) ,

and analogously for the foreign country.

   The solutions for goods prices, consumption and leisure depend on the particular model of

price-setting behavior. The Appendix derives solutions in terms of the exogenous variables – the

domestic and foreign money supplies – for each of our models.

   The average levels of consumption and leisure can be different depending on the exchange-rate

regime. This may seem surprising, since it implies average long-run consumption depends on a

monetary choice –fixed or floating exchange rates. The intuition for this outcome can be seen from

equation (3). The level of consumption is related to the mark-up of prices over wages: when the

mark-up is smaller, the level of consumption is higher. The level of prices is affected by the

exchange-rate regime because the risk premium incorporated in prices differs between regimes. In

turn, since labor is used to produce consumption goods, the expected level of leisure is also

different under the different exchange-rate regimes.

   We compare the influence of the variance of foreign money shocks on the expected level of

consumption by setting the variance of domestic money equal to zero in equations (A.10), (A.18)

and (A.24). These values are reported in Table 2.

   From Table 2, the expected level of consumption is higher in the FER model compared to the

                         2−n
PCP model when ρ >              . A sufficient condition is ρ > 1 . The condition of ρ > 1 is necessary
                         3 − 2n

and sufficient for expected consumption to be higher in the FER model than in the PTM model.

Although there is little agreement empirically about the correct value for ρ , virtually all studies

agree that ρ > 1 . So, while the variance of consumption is higher for fixed exchange rates than in

either floating exchange rate model, there is a higher average level of consumption under fixed

exchange rates.

   This implies a trade-off in utility. Examining for the moment the consumption term alone, using

the fact that consumption is log-normal, we can write:

         1                  1                        − ρ (1 − ρ ) 2 

Welfare is positively related to the expected level of consumption, but falls with increases in the

variance of consumption.




                                                               19
   Utility also depends on expected leisure. The greater the average level of employment, the

lower is welfare. Table 3 reports the expected levels of employment in each model (taken from

equations (A.12), (A.18) and (A.26).

   Employment is higher under fixed exchange rates, as compared to floating under PCP, when

         2−n
1< ρ <        . When n is large (that is, close to one), it is likely that expected employment is
         1− n

higher and expected leisure lower under fixed exchange rates. But, for a small country (n close to

zero), average employment under fixed exchange rates will be smaller unless ρ falls in the narrow

range between one and two. So, in comparing leisure effects between FER and PCP, the size of the

country is quite important. On the other hand, expected employment is higher and expected leisure

lower under FER compared to PCP when ρ > 1 .

   In comparing welfare under fixed and floating exchange rates, we look at the effects of the

variance of foreign money shocks on domestic welfare. A fixed exchange rate system eliminates




                                                             20
the possibility of domestic money shocks, but even under floating rates central banks can choose a

zero variance. So, we set σ m2 = 0 in our welfare analysis.

   Real money balances enter the utility function. It may not be wise to evaluate exchange rate

systems in terms of how they affect the real balance part of the utility function. Money in the utility

function is a convenient way to create demand for an asset, money, that would otherwise be

dominated by other assets. But there are other ways to model demand for money that may be more

realistic (and more complicated) that do not involve welfare being directly influenced by holdings

of real balances. In making welfare comparisons, we will assume real balances are not important in

welfare ( χ → 0 ).

   Utility, then, can be expressed in terms of expected consumption, the variance of consumption,

and expected leisure. Tables 1, 2 and 3 compare the models for each of these components of utility.

The comparisons seem ambiguous: FER is the worst in terms of the variance of consumption, the

best in terms of expected consumption, and there is some ambiguity about the ranking in terms of

expected leisure. We can further clarify the matter by looking at all three effects together.


PCP vs. FER models

       In the PCP and FER models we can use equation (15) to write the welfare expression simply

as a function of the mean and variance of consumption:

                       1 + ρ (λ − 1)               1 + ρ (λ − 1)                      − ρ (1 − ρ ) 2 
(24)        E (u ) =                 E (C 1− ρ ) =               ( E (C ))1− ρ ⋅ exp              σc .
                         λ (1 − ρ )                  λ (1 − ρ )                            2         

   There is a trade-off in choosing between fixed and floating exchange rates. Fixed exchange

                                                                           2−n
rates have a higher expected level of consumption (when ρ >                       ), but under floating rates the
                                                                           3 − 2n

variance of consumption is lower.



                                                          21
                                                                    2−n
   We find that welfare is higher under floating rates when ρ ≤          . When ρ ≤ 2 , floating rates
                                                                    1− n

are always better. As n approaches 1, so that the home country is getting very large relative to the

small country, then floating rates dominate. This accords with the intuition that smaller countries

may find it desirable to fix their exchange rate to the currency of a larger country, but large

countries are better off with their own independent currency.

   As ρ increases, the fixed exchange rate system’s advantage in terms of expected consumption

increases. Its disadvantage in terms of variance also falls as the square of ρ increases, although that

is offset by the fact that the importance of the variance in welfare rises with the square of ρ (see

equation (24).) On net, for large values of ρ , fixed exchange rates become more desirable.



PTM vs. FER Models

   We have seen from Table 1 that foreign monetary variance does not affect either the mean or

variance of consumption in the PTM model. Compared to the FER model, the variance of

consumption is lower, but the mean of consumption is also lower when ρ > 1 . The PTM model has

the advantage in terms of expected leisure when ρ > 1 .

                                                                                      λ −1
   As is the case with the PCP and FER models (equation (15)), we have E ( L) =            E (C 1− ρ ) .
                                                                                       λη

In the PTM model, this follows from equations (12) and (A.14). So, conveniently, the analysis

simplifies to a comparison of the models in terms of expected consumption and the variance of

consumption. Equation (24) holds in the PTM model as well as the other two models.

          Utility in the PTM model is not influenced by foreign monetary policy shocks. We can

derive:




                                                   22
                             1− ρ
                   λ −1           ρ
                                         1 + ρ ( λ − 1) 
    E (u PTM ) =                                    .
                   ηλ                   λ (1 − ρ ) 

This can be compared directly to welfare in the FER model:

                             1− ρ
                   λ −1           ρ
                                         1 + ρ (λ − 1)        ρ −1 2
    E (u FER ) =                                   exp(     σ *).
                   ηλ                   λ (1 − ρ )          2ρ 2 m

   It is clear from examination of these equations that any variance in foreign money shocks lowers

welfare in the FER model, so

        E (u PTM ) > E (u FER )

for all admissible parameter values. Even though, when ρ > 1 , there may be less expected

consumption under floating exchange rates and PTM, the fact that home consumption is completely

insulated from foreign money shocks is enough to insure that floating rates always dominate fixed

exchange rates in this model.



3. How Internationalized Production Matters

   How do the comparisons between levels of welfare under fixed and floating exchange rates in

the models of this paper, with internationalized production, relate to the comparisons in Devereux

and Engel (1998) where there is no internationalized production?

   There are surprising similarities in the welfare comparisons. A major reason why the welfare

comparisons are not very different whether or not we assume internationalized production is that

there is factor price equalization in our model. Since home-country wages equal foreign-country

wages, the prices set by firms are the same whether or not domestic labor or foreign labor produces

output. That is, there is a risk premium incorporated in nominal goods prices arising from the




                                                                23
covariance of labor costs with revenues. But, that risk is the same whether domestic or foreign

labor is employed because the two types of labor are paid the same wage.

   Why is there factor-price equalization? From equation (3), the marginal utility of taking one

                                  η
more dollar’s worth of leisure,      , is equal to the marginal utility from one more dollar’s worth of
                                  Wt

               Ct− ρ
consumption,         . That is, each agent only works so much that the last dollar earned creates as
                Pt

much utility from consumption as it does disutility from working. But, our assumption of perfect

capital mobility and complete nominal asset markets means that the marginal utility of a dollar for

                                                                   C t− ρ C t*− ρ
the home-country resident is worth the same for the foreigh agent:       =          . Together, these
                                                                    Pt     S t Pt *

imply that the dollar value of wages must be the same in the two countries: Wt = S tWt* . In short,

the complete asset markets in nominal bonds assures that the marginal value of a dollar spend on

                                            η     η
leisure is the same in the two countries:     =       .
                                            Wt S tWt*

   Since wage equalization implies that the nominal price set by firms is not affected by the

location of production, then neither exchange rates nor consumption levels (from equation (17)) are

affected by the location of production. So, any welfare comparison involving consumption is not

influenced by whether or not there is internationalized production.

   Welfare is also influenced by leisure. One would expect that term to be different depending on

where production is located. In Devereux and Engel (1998), domestic workers produce goods

consumed by foreigners, so movements in foreign demand for domestic goods change employment.

But, in the model of this paper, domestic workers produce only for domestic consumption: they

produce both the home and foreign goods for home consumers.



                                                   24
   Surprisingly, in the PCP model, even the leisure term is not affected by the location of

production. In the PCP model, as Obstfeld and Rogoff (1998) emphasize, the current account is

always balanced. Even though there is perfect capital mobility, the unitary elasticity of demand

between foreign and domestic consumption combined with the law of one price assumption ensures

that the value of goods purchased from abroad by home residents continuously equals the value of

goods sold to foreign residents by home firms. But, the prices of home goods and foreign goods are

expected to be the same (prior to the realization of monetary shocks.) Since the value of exports

and imports are equal, and the expected prices are the same, the expected quantity of goods home

firms produce for foreign residents always equals the expected quantity of goods foreign firms

produce for home residents. So, it does not matter where the goods are produced – expected

employment will not be affected by the location of production.

       Welfare in the PCP model is not affected by the presence of internationalized production.

The same is true for the FER model, since given the structure of the model, the FER model is

identical to the PCP model with n = 1 . The welfare comparisons for this paper between the PCP

and FER worlds are exactly the same as in Devereux and Engel (1998) for these two models.

   Expected leisure in the PTM model does depend on where output is produced. In the model of

this paper, where domestic labor only produces for home consumers, there is no influence of foreign

money shocks on expected employment. In the model of Devereux and Engel (1998), foreign

money shocks change domestic employment because they affect foreign demand for home goods

(which, in that model, are produced with domestic labor.) In that model, when ρ > 1 , a higher

foreign monetary variance raises expected demand for home goods and lowers expected home

leisure. So, expected domestic leisure is higher when there is internationalized production. Still,




                                                  25
whether or not there is internationalized production, floating rates in the PTM model always yield

higher expected utility than fixed exchange rates.



4. Conclusions

   We find that the hypothesis of how prices are set has implications for the optimal choice of

exchange-rate regime. If we follow the traditional literature in assuming that prices are set in

producers’ currencies, and that the law of one price holds, there is no clear-cut answer on which

regime is preferable. When a country is small, or very risk averse, it would prefer fixed exchange

rates; otherwise, floating exchange rates are preferred.

   However, the empirical evidence supports the model of pricing in which producers set different

prices in different markets. Prices are set in consumers’ currencies and adjust slowly to demand

shocks. In that case, we find that floating exchange rates are unambiguously preferred to fixed

exchange rates.

   That conclusion is not altered by incorporating internationalized production in the model.

Indeed, we find under pricing to market that the economy is even more sheltered from foreign

shocks in a floating exchange rate system then in a world where all production of the domestic firm

takes place in the home country. The reason is straightforward: one potential avenue for foreign

shocks to hit the home economy is through employment changes in response to changes in foreign

demand for the home good. If a monetary shock abroad changes foreign demand for the home

good, that may alter domestic employment. But, to the extent that the foreign demand is met by

production by foreign subsidiaries of the home country, domestic employment is sheltered from the

foreign shock. So, one avenue through which foreign shocks could affect domestic employment




                                                  26
and welfare under a floating exchange rate system with pricing to market is closed when the home

good is produced internationally.

   The model considered here is quite simple. We only look at a special case examined by

Devereux and Engel (1998), in which real money balances enter the utility function logarithmically

and leisure enters linearly. This specification simplifies the analysis considerably. For example,

nominal interest rates are constant in equilibrium. But, it also loses some of the interesting and

more realistic dynamic behavior of the more complex models. Still, in Devereux and Engel (1998),

the flavor of the welfare analysis of exchange-rate regimes was not appreciably altered by

consideration of the more complex model.

   One important extension to this model would allow for price-adjustment that lasts longer than a

single period. Indeed, it is possible that the speed of price adjustment could differ between

exchange-rate regimes, and that could alter the welfare analysis. We would also like to consider

investment questions. In this study, internationalized production is undertaken using only foreign

labor as an input. More interesting would be an analysis that allowed for domestically-owned

capital to be combined with foreign labor in producing output for sale abroad.

   We are not certain which direction these extensions would tilt the welfare analysis. But, this

study has highlighted some differences in the exchange-rate systems, and the roles of price-setting

and internationalized production, that would be important in any extended model.

      Recall that the pricing formulas for Pht and Pft* are the same in all three models. Using the fact

that prices and consumption will be log-normally distributed in equilibrium, we can write equation (5)

as:

(A.1) pht = mt −1 − ln( µ ) + σ m2 + (1 − ρ )σ mc + ln( λη (1 − µβ )                   ),
                                                                          χ (λ − 1)

where σ mc is the covariance of mt and ct conditional on t − 1 information. (In general, we will use the

notation σ xz to denote Covt −1 ( x t , z t ) , and σ z2 to denote Vart −1 ( z t ) .) Similar derivations yield from

equation (7):

          p *ft = mt*−1 − ln( µ * ) + σ m2 * + (1 − ρ )σ m*c* + ln( λη (1 − µ β )
                                                                             *
(A.2)                                                                                            ).
                                                                                    χ ( λ − 1)

      Equations (A.1) and (A.2) hold in all three models. We will also use the relationship

(A.3)     pt = npht + (1 − n ) p ft ,

and the analogous expression for the foreign price level. These equations must be augmented by

equations for p ft and p ht* , as well as equations for output, in order to complete derivations in each

model.



A.1      The PCP Model

      The law of one price holds in this model, so

(A.4)     p ft = st + p *ft ,

(A.5)     pht* = pht − st .

      Recall, also, the perfect risk-sharing property of this model, so that

          ct = ct* .

                                                                1
    Then, using (21), (A.2), (A.3) and (A.4), we can derive for the domestic price level



                       1                                      1                               λη (1 − µβ )
(A.6) pt = mt − n(υ t − σ m2 − (1 − ρ )σ mc ) − (1 − n)(υ t* − σ m2 * − (1 − ρ )σ m*c ) + ln(              ).
                       2                                      2                                χ (λ − 1)

    From equations (21) and (A.6) we get

                      1                                      1                                λη
(A.7)    ρct = n(υ t − σ m2 − (1 − ρ )σ mc ) + (1 − n)(υ t* − σ m2 * − (1 − ρ )σ m*c ) − ln(      ).
                      2                                      2                               λ −1

    We can derive expressions for σ mc and σ m*c directly from equation (A.7):

               n 2
    σ mc =       σm,
               ρ

               1− n 2
    σ m* c =       σ m* .
                ρ

    Plugging these into (A.7), we arrive at our expression for domestic consumption:

                n      1 − n * nρ + 2n 2 (1 − ρ ) 2       (1 − n) ρ + 2(1 − n) 2 (1 − ρ ) 2     1    λη
(A.8)    ct =     υt +      υt − (               )σ   − (                                )σ m* − ln(    ).
                ρ        ρ                                                                      ρ λ −1
                                                    m
                                    2ρ  2
                                                                      2ρ  2



         The variance of domestic and foreign money shocks affects utility also because they affect the

variance of consumption. From equation (A.7),

                        n 2 2 (1 − n ) 2 2
(A.9)          σ c2 =      σm +         σ m* .
                        ρ2       ρ2

The expected level of consumption is given by:

(A.10)

                            2       λη                                ρ                                  ρ
                                                                          2                                  2
                                                                    2                                2                            


Expected utility depends on both the expected level and the variance of consumption:




                                                                       2

      From equation (15), we can derive the expected level of output easily as:

(A.12)

                                                 1

A.2      The PTM Model

      From equations (5) and (10), we see that Pft and Pht are equal. Using this fact, and the definition

of the price index in equation (1), we have:

                                  ηλ Et −1 ( Pt C t )
(A.13) Pft = Pht = Pt =                                 .
                                 λ − 1 Et −1 (C t1− ρ )

But, since Pt is in the time t-1 information set, equation (A.13) gives us that

                               ηλ
(A.14) Et −1 (C t1− ρ ) =          Et −1 (C t ) .
                              λ −1

Writing this equation in logs gives us:

                                            (1 − ρ ) 2 2        λη                  1 2
              (1 − ρ ) Et −1 (ct ) +                  σ c = ln       + Et −1 (ct ) + σ c .
                                                2               λ −1                2

Solving, we find

                               − 1  λη  ρ − 2 2
(A.15)        Et −1 (ct ) =       ln   +     σc .
                               ρ  λ −1    2

      Since Pt is in the time t-1 information set, we have from equation (20)



                                                                           3
                      1 2
(A.16)       σ c2 =      σm .
                      ρ2

As compared to the PCP model (equation (A.9)), domestic monetary variance has a greater effect on

the variance of domestic consumption. Substituting into equation (A.15), we get

                       − 1  λη  ρ − 2 2
(A.17) Et −1 (ct ) =      ln    +     σm.

      The expected level of consumption is given by

                                                       1

          E (C ) = exp( Ec + σ c

                                   2       λη                      2ρ
                                                                         2
                                                                                

      The expected utility term involving consumption is derived directly from equation (A.14) using

equation (A.18):

                                                1− ρ

      From equation (12), Lt = Ct , so equation (A.18) gives us the expression for E (L) .



A.3      FER Model

      We will assume the exchange rate is fixed at 1, so st = 0 for all t. From equation (21) it follows

that

(A.20) mt + ln(1 − µβ ) = mt* + ln(1 − µ * β ) .

The domestic money supply moves in reaction to foreign money supply shocks in order to keep the

exchange rate fixed.

      Because exchange rates are fixed, Pft = Pft* and Pht = Pht* . We can use equations (A.1) and (A.2) to

derive expressions for prices. Noting that all prices are preset, the money demand equation (20)

(combined with relation (A.20)) tells us

                                                                      4

         σ mc = σ m*c* =    σ *.
                           ρ m

We can then derive:

                                            1 2         λη (1 − µ * β )
(A.21)         pht = p ft = pt = mt*−1 +      σ m* + ln( *              ).
                                            ρ            µ χ (λ − 1)

   Then, using equation (20) we get the expression for consumption under fixed exchange rates:

                      1 * ρ −2 2        1    λη
(A.22)       ct =       υt +      σ m* − ln(    ).
