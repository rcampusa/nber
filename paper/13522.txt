                                           ABSTRACT

The ability of firms to reposition their products can determine the effects of demand shocks, mergers
and policy interventions in differentiated product markets. This paper estimates a dynamic oligopoly
model to measure repositioning costs in the commercial radio industry. Based on a set of markets where
industry revenues were around $88 billion, I find that stations may have spent as much as $6 billion
on repositioning. However, repositioning costs are not large enough to prevent radio markets adapting
quite quickly to demand shocks.

1    Introduction

While there have been considerable advances in modelling consumer demand in diﬀerentiated product

markets in the last 15 years (for example, Berry et al. (1995) and Hendel and Nevo (2006)), almost

all analyses treat the set of available products as given. Yet in many industries the set of available

products changes quite frequently and the ability of firms to alter their product oﬀerings could sub-

stantially aﬀect the outcomes of demand shocks or policy changes.             For example, the medium-run

eﬀects of rising gas prices and environmental policies on the automobile industry will depend on how

diﬃcult and costly it is for American manufacturers to introduce more fuel eﬃcient models (Berry et

al. (1993)).

    The potential for product repositioning already plays an important role in the analysis of horizontal

mergers.    In particular, the Horizontal Merger Guidelines recognize that if repositioning costs are

small then the threat of repositioning by competitors may constrain market power even if demand-side

substitution is limited (US Department of Justice (1997)). However, even though the potential for

repositioning has been an issue in the analysis of mergers in industries as diverse as fountain pens,

chewing tobacco, commercial radio and organic supermarkets, these analyses have taken place without

any detailed study of how costly it is for firms to reposition their products in these types of industries.1

    This paper fills this gap in the literature by estimating a dynamic oligopoly model to measure

the costs associated with format switching in the broadcast radio industry. The basic structure of

the model is as follows.     In each period, a random coeﬃcients demand model determines station

audiences as a function of station formats, observed and unobserved station characteristics and local

tastes, which depend on evolving market demographics. A revenue function translates audiences into

revenues, allowing for listeners with diﬀerent demographics to have diﬀerent values to advertisers.

Stations choose their formats to maximize expected future profits, recognizing how their choices may

of repositioning after mergers, focusing on repositioning by the merging firms.

aﬀect the future format choices of other stations.

       The model allows for repositioning to be costly in three diﬀerent ways.                  First, switching may

reduce a station’s quality, lowering its audience (quality eﬀect).               Second, it may cause revenues to

fall, conditional on listenership, as the station searches for new advertisers (revenue eﬀect). Third,

there may be additional sunk expenditures associated with repositioning (sunk repositioning costs).

These costs could arise from replacing staﬀ, updating the station’s programming library, hiring format

consultants or additional marketing.

       I estimate the model using a two-step approach. In the first step I estimate the demand model, the

revenue function, station strategies and the transition processes for market demographics and station

qualities.    Assumptions on the timing of format choices allow me to estimate demand consistently

even though format choices are endogenous.               The first step provides estimates of the quality and

revenue eﬀects.        In the second step I bound sunk repositioning costs using a moment inequality

estimator.

       I find that both the revenue eﬀect and sunk repositioning costs are significant, but that there is

no evidence of a significant quality eﬀect as switching stations gain listeners even in the short-run.

These qualitative results are broadly consistent with the Department of Justice’s view of why format

switching is costly.2     My analysis also provides quantitative estimates. The revenue eﬀect reduces

station revenues by about 12% in the quarters immediately following a switch.                       The lower bound

estimates of the additional sunk costs are of a roughly similar size. The upper bound estimates are

larger, equal to about one year’s revenue for the average switching station. The upper bound estimates

imply that the sample stations spent over $6 billion on sunk repositioning costs compared with total

revenues of $88 billion (at 2004 prices) between 1997 and 2006. The dollar value of repositioning costs

increases with market revenues, suggesting that markets of diﬀerent sizes may adjust just as quickly
   2
    “And, as we have learned through our investigations, the cost of these promotional expenditures and the loss of
advertising revenue during the course of the format change while the station looks for new advertisers can be high.
Picking up on this last point, the theory that says radio stations will jump in with new formats to defeat price increases
makes the questionable assumption that it’s as easy to change formats as it is changing clothes. But that grossly
overstates the situation. As a practical matter, almost any existing station has invested time, money and eﬀort to
develop its format, audience and advertising base. If it decides to change its format, it must abandon at least some of
these on-going relationships.” (Klein (1997))

to demand shocks or mergers.

    I also estimate some of the eﬀects of the repositioning that I observe in the sample. Repositioning

raised Hispanic listening by over 20%, as stations entered Spanish-language formats in many markets.

Black listening also increased as stations switched to Urban and Contemporary Hit Radio formats.

When I simulate the model I also find that stations move quite quickly in response to changes in

ethnic/racial demographics, an example of a relatively permanent demand shock.                       Repositioning

reduced the listenership of older listeners as there was some exit from formats such as Variety, Big

Band and Easy Listening.

    I also estimate how format switching aﬀected the revenues of switching and non-switching stations.

While repositioning tended to increase the revenues of switching stations, the average eﬀect on non-

switchers was small as in most cases repositioning simply changed which stations faced the most

competition.

    The paper is unusual in focusing on product repositioning by incumbents rather than market

entry by new firms. This focus makes sense in my industry where spectrum constraints and licensing

restrictions make station entry and exit unusually rare. However, repositioning is also likely to be

the more important margin of change in any industry with large scale and scope economies (such

as automobiles) especially in the relatively short time horizons considered in many policy analyses.3

For example, merger analysis asks whether entry or repositioning could constrain market power in a

period of one to two years.

    There are several features of the radio industry which make it an excellent place to study repo-

sitioning. The existence of discrete measures of positioning (formats) and the lack of technological

barriers to repositioning provide a close fit to the model which I set out below.                The local nature

of the industry allows me to observe many examples of format switching even though the rate of

switching is quite low.      In addition, some of the most important drivers of repositioning, such as

demographic changes, are observable and diﬀer significantly across markets. Finally, the feasibility
   3
     Bernard et al. (2006) show that changes in the products oﬀered by existing firms account for much larger changes
in output than firm entry and exit in most manufacturing industries.


                                                         4
of repositioning has been a substantive issue in the analysis of many radio stations mergers.      My

estimates of repositioning costs are therefore directly relevant to an on-going policy debate.


1.1     Relationship to the Existing Literature

1.1.1    Format Switching and Repositioning Costs

The substantive topic of the paper is related to a couple of other literatures. Berry and Waldfogel

(2001) and Sweeting (2006) provide reduced-form analyses of how radio station ownership aﬀects

variety and listenership.   Berry and Waldfogel (1999) find evidence of excess entry in the radio

industry, in the sense of Mankiw and Whinston (1986), using a static entry model. Tyler Mooney

(2006) uses a static structural model to show that during the late 1990s stations migrated to formats

which were more valued by advertisers.     Romeo and Dick (2005) show that stations gain listeners

when they switch format.

   While there has been no previous attempt to estimate the costs which firms have to pay to

reposition their products in a horizontally diﬀerentiated industry, there have been several attempts to

estimate the migration costs paid by individuals or households when moving between diﬀerent cities

(Kennan and Walker (2006), Bayer and Juessen (2006) and Gemici (2007)) oﬀering diﬀerent labor

market opportunities. The firm setting is more complex in that it is necessary to model competitive

interactions between firms. On the other hand, it may be easier to estimate the opportunities facing

firms in diﬀerent market niches than it is to estimate the labor market opportunities available to a

particular household.


1.1.2    Estimation of Dynamic Oligopoly Models

A dynamic model is needed to estimate repositioning costs because the returns from repositioning are

likely to be realized over a number of periods during which a market might evolve in many diﬀerent

ways.    Several recent papers (Aguirregabiria and Mira (2007), Bajari et al. (2007), Berry et al.

(2007) and Pesendorfer and Schmidt-Dengler (2003)) have proposed methodologies for estimating


                                                   5
dynamic discrete choice games with Markov Perfect Nash Equilibria.                     Following Hotz and Miller

(1993) and Hotz et al. (1994) in the single agent setting, these approaches avoid solving for equilibrium

strategies at each step of the estimation process. The approach which I take is closest to the two-step

procedure suggested by Bajari et al. (2007). In the second step, I use moment inequalities to estimate

repositioning costs, using the methods proposed by Pakes et al. (2006). These methods have been

used by Ho (2007) and Ishii (2005) to estimate models in static settings. Holmes (2007) uses these

methods in a dynamic analysis of Wal-Mart’s store location problem.

       Ryan (2005), Collard-Wexler (2005), Beresteanu and Ellickson (2006) and Macieira (2006) have es-

timated dynamic oligopoly models using industry data. Ryan (2005) and Collard-Wexler (2005) exam-

ine entry and exit in the homogenous product cement and ready-mix concrete industries. Beresteanu

and Ellickson (2006) and Macieira (2006) use logit demand models to allow for a simple form of ver-

tical product diﬀerentiation in the supermarket and supercomputer industries. In the radio industry

both horizontal product diﬀerentiation and vertical product diﬀerentiation are important and I use a

rich random coeﬃcients demand model to capture these eﬀects.

       The two-step estimation approach requires me to consistently estimate a model of listener demand

in the first step allowing for format choices to be endogenous.4 I achieve this by making assumptions

on the timing of innovations in station quality relative to station format choices. This is similar to the

way in which the structural productivity literature uses timing assumptions to address the endogeneity

of input choices (Olley and Pakes (1996), Blundell and Bond (2000), Levinsohn and Petrin (2003),

Ackerberg et al. (2005)).5
   4
     The endogeneity problem could also be solved by estimating demand and product choice simultaneously, as attempted
in the static setting by Crawford and Shum (2006) and Draganska et al. (2006). This type of approach would not be
computationally feasible in a dynamic setting with a rich model of demand.
   5
     Berry et al. (1995), p. 854, recognize that timing assumptions might be used in the demand context. Einav’s (2007)
approach to dealing with the endogeneity of movie release dates by assuming a particular process for the decay of a
movie’s appeal has a similar spirit.

1.2     Outline

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data and Section 3 presents some stylized

facts on format switching. Section 4 presents the model and Section 5 details the estimation procedure.

The empirical results are presented in Section 6. Section 7 concludes.



2       Data

Data on station characteristics (formats, band, signal coverage etc.), station ownership and station

ratings are taken from BIAfn’s Media Access Pro database.6                    This database also includes BIAfn’s

estimates of station advertising revenues. I use data from the Spring and Fall quarters each year from

Spring 1996 to Spring 2006, although 56 markets are missing share data for Fall 1996.7 The database

only contains ratings data for commercial stations, and only these stations are used in what follows.8


2.1     Formats

Table 1 lists the ten formats used to categorize each station’s programming together with several

measures of listener demographics.9 These formats combine some of BIAfn’s format categories, such

as Rock and Album Oriented Rock, which are particularly similar.                        The “Other Music” format

includes several format categories which appeal to older listeners. The structural model also includes

a “Dark” format for stations which are oﬀ-air.


2.2     Geographic Markets and Demographic Data

Arbitron defines local radio markets for estimating station ratings.                   These markets are also used

by the FCC and the Department of Justice.                The stylized facts below are based on data from 274
    6
     Some gaps in the BIAfn data, including data on stations leaving the industry before 2001 were filled in using old
editions of Duncan’s American Radio.
   7
     Smaller markets are only rated in the Spring and Fall quarters, so using data from only these quarters avoids having
to deal with problems where markets are observed with diﬀerent frequencies.
   8
     I include market-format fixed eﬀects in the demand specification which should control for the eﬀect of non-commercial
stations which remain in the same format and do not change quality over time.
   9
     The format trends data reported on Arbitron’s website indicates that there has been relatively little change in format
demographics from 1998 to 2006.


                                                            7
Arbitron markets, excluding Puerto Rico, markets dropped by Arbitron prior to 2006 and markets

added by Arbitron after 2001. Local market demographics (age, sex and ethnicity/race combinations)

are measured using the US Census’s Annual County Population Estimates aggregated to the market

level.10

         Some Arbitron radio markets are close enough that stations from several markets may compete

for the same listeners. I include these markets when presenting several stylized facts about format

switching but I exclude them when estimating the structural model to avoid modelling interactions

between markets.


2.3        Station Listenership and Revenue Data

Arbitron reports quarterly estimates of station listenership based on diaries completed by a sample

of listeners.     I use the station’s aggregate market share, where the market is the time available to

the population aged 12 and above during a broadcast week of Monday-Sunday 6am-midnight.11 As

described in Section 5, I also use Arbitron data on the average demographics of listeners to each

format in Arbitron’s 100 largest markets. I use BIAfn’s estimates of annual station revenues. These

estimates are based on a combination of data reported by stations and a proprietary formula.



3         Format Switching: Some Stylized Facts

This section briefly describes several stylized facts about format switching and what happens to

stations’ listenership when they switch formats. I focus on those facts which are informative about

repositioning costs and which motivate the structure of my model. The statistics are based on stations

in their home markets.
    10
     The estimates come from July of each year, so I interpolate to give numbers for the Spring and Fall quarters.
Counties are matched to markets using Arbitron’s 2005 market definitions. Market definitions are changed only rarely.
  11
     This share is calculated by multiplying the station’s “AQH Share” (which measures its share of all radio-listening),
reported by BIAfn, with the market’s APR figure(which measures the proportion of people aged 12 and above listening
to radio). The APR numbers come from Duncan’s American Radio up to 2001, M Street’s STAR database for 2002
and Spring 2003 and from additional data provided by BIAfn from Fall 2004. For the two missing numbers I simply
interpolate between the missing quarters. This is reasonable as APR numbers change relatively little from quarter to
quarter.



                                                           8
1. The switching rate is 4.2% per half-year and AM and FM Stations exhibit distinctive

switching patterns. Table 2 shows the format-to-format switching matrices for AM and FM sta-

tions. On average, 4.2% of stations switch formats every half-year (the data comes from the Spring

and Fall quarters) with 3,830 switches observed in the data. Switching patterns diﬀer across bands.

AM stations are more likely to switch to talk formats, such as News/Talk and Religious, consistent

with the AM signal providing lower quality for music programming.                     This diﬀerence is potentially

useful in revealing how sensitive switching behavior is to diﬀerences in expected revenues. FM sta-

tions switch more evenly across formats.             In particular, FM stations are not systematically more

likely to switch between diﬀerent contemporary music formats (e.g., Country and Rock) than between

these formats and non-music programming. This suggests that my format classification does identify

diﬀerent types of programming and that, as I assume below, the costs of switching between diﬀerent

pairs of formats are similar.12


2. Format switchers stations gain significant listenership. Figure 1 shows what happens, on

average, to a station’s share when it switches formats. Market shares are measured as the percentage

of time spent listening to a station by people aged 12 and above during a broadcast week of Monday-

Sunday 6 am-12 pm (the sum of market shares for all of the stations in market is typically around 13%).

In the figure I normalize the station’s share to be zero in the period (-1) immediately prior to the

switch (the average switcher has a market share of 0.5%).13 A station’s share increases significantly

in the two periods (one year) following a format switch and then levels oﬀ.

    I focus on horizontal product repositioning as the way in which stations gain listeners/revenues,

modelling the evolution of station quality in a simple way. Figure 2 provides some evidence that format

switching is a major way in which stations gain listeners. The solid line shows the kernel density of
   12
      The average changes in market share for stations making diﬀerent kinds of switch are also not significantly diﬀerent
from one another. Of course, these patterns partly reflect the fact that my coarse format definitions exclude very small
changes in programming (e.g., Soft Adult Contemporary to Lite Adult Contemporary) which are more common.
   13
      The plotted points are coeﬃcients from a station-fixed eﬀects regressions including a full set of Arbitron quarter
dummies and dummies for the quarters around a switch. Only stations observed for all of the quarters around the
switch are included. Stations switching to and from the inactive format (Dark) are excluded.

changes in share over a two year period and the dashed line shows the proportion of stations in each

share change bin which switched formats during the same two year period. The average proportion

of stations changing format is 0.15, but this rises to over 0.5 for stations experiencing the largest

share increases. The diagram also shows that relatively few format switchers lose significant share

suggesting that they may face relatively little uncertainty about how they will perform in their new

formats.


3. The rate of format switching is similar in markets of diﬀerent sizes. If the dollar value

of format switching costs is the same in every market then one would expect to observe less switching

in smaller markets where stations have fewer listeners and lower revenues. One would also expect to

see switching stations increasing their market shares by larger amounts in smaller markets. Figures

3(a) and (b) show that the rate of switching and the share gain of switchers is very similar across

markets of diﬀerent sizes, suggesting that repositioning costs must be smaller in smaller markets.

   One can calculate a very rough estimate of the magnitude of repositioning costs using an estimate

of the value of listeners gained following a format switch. For example, suppose that the marginal

switcher expects its market share to permanently increase by 0.08 percentage points if it switches and

that both the market population and the price per listener are fixed at their average 2004 values.

Assuming an annual discount rate of 10%, Table 3 lists the present discounted value of this change

in share in five markets. Of course, there are many things that this calculation ignores, such as the

diﬀerence in the expectations of the marginal and the average switching station, the diﬀerent value to

advertisers of diﬀerent groups of listeners and the many ways in which markets might evolve in the

future. The structural model is designed to take these factors into account.


4. Changes in market demographics and competition aﬀect format switching. My model

explains format switching by competition for listeners and changes in market demographics, espe-

cially changes in their ethnic/racial composition.    Table 4 shows coeﬃcients from long-diﬀerenced

IV regressions (Spring 1996 to Spring 2006 for those markets always followed by Arbitron) where the


                                                 10
dependent variable is the proportion of local stations in a format and the explanatory variables include

ethnic/racial demographics and the market share achieved by out of market stations as a measure of

competition. This variable is potentially endogenous and I instrument for it as explained in the notes

beneath the table.

    The coeﬃcients show the expected pattern. Increasing black (Hispanic) populations are associated

with more Urban and Religious (Spanish) stations.         Competition generally reduces the number of

stations in a format and the coeﬃcient is statistically significant when the formats are pooled together.



4     A Dynamic Model of the Radio Industry

This section describes the various components of the dynamic model of the radio industry.


4.1     State Space

The state space is composed of (i) a set of station, market and format characteristics which are

observed by all stations when they make their format switching decisions and which are observed

or can be estimated by the econometrician (denoted S in what follows), and (ii) a set of iid private

information payoﬀ “shocks” that aﬀect a station’s payoﬀ from making each format choice for the next

period.


4.1.1     Station Characteristics

There are Nm stations in market m. Each station is in exactly one format in each quarter. There

are eleven available formats (F ): those listed in Table 1 and a “Dark” format (0) for inactive stations.

Each station has several observed quality characteristics which are assumed to be fixed over time:

band, signal coverage, transmitter power, year first on air and out of market status. The quality of

AM stations is also allowed to vary by format. Each station also has a quality component ξ smt which

can evolve over time. This is not directly observed in the data but I assume that it can be estimated.

    Treating the number of stations as fixed is a simplification, but it is a reasonable first approximation


                                                    11
in this industry. Entry is severely limited by both spectrum constraints, especially in larger markets

and in densely-populated regions of the country, and by the FCC’s licensing process.                   As a result

there are only 290 examples of new entry during the sample period, compared with 4,739 stations

active in 1996. There were also less than 50 examples of exit and many of these were due to the FCC

withdrawing the station’s license.14 I assume that entrants and exiters are in the Dark format when

they are not active.


4.1.2     Market Characteristics

The population in each market is made up of 18 mutually exclusive age-gender-ethnic/race groups (3

age x 2 gender x 3 ethnic/racial). Age-gender mixes diﬀer relatively little within markets over time

and I only model the growth of the three ethnic/racial groups (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic

blacks and Hispanics), assuming that the same growth rate applies to each of the relevant age-gender

groups. Each market is also associated with a particular advertising price per listener and each format

in each market has a particular attractiveness to listeners (γ Fm ) which is assumed to be fixed over time

and which can be estimated.


4.2     Timing

There are an infinite sequence of periods, corresponding to the Spring and Fall ratings quarters. In

each period the timing of the game is as follows:


   1. stations observe current station qualities, formats, market demographics and the attractiveness

        of each format;


   2. listeners choose which station to listen to based on current station qualities, formats and the

        attractiveness of each format.      Station listenership is translated into revenues by a function
  14
    These counts of entry and exit exclude cases of a construction licence being granted but the being relinquished
without the station ever going on-air. The entry count also does not include stations which start being rated by
Arbitron during the sample period because they gain enough listeners to start meeting Arbitron’s Minimum Reporting
Standard (about 0.3% of radio listening). The analysis in Berry and Waldfogel (2001) would include these examples as
cases of station entry.

      capturing the operation of the advertising market. Active stations incur a fixed cost;


  3. each station observes additive random shocks (εF ) to its payoﬀs from choosing to be in a partic-

      ular format in the next quarter. These shocks are iid across stations, formats and time and are

      private information to the station. Having observed its εF s, each station simultaneously chooses

      a format for the next period. Station payoﬀs (advertising revenues, fixed costs, repositioning

      costs, εF ) for the current period are realized; and,


  4. station formats change according to station format choices. Other features of the state space,

      including the unobserved station qualities, evolve according to the stochastic processes described

      below.


4.3    Static Station Payoﬀs

A station’s payoﬀ in a period depends on its listenership, which is translated into dollars by a revenue

function, a fixed cost and its format switching choice. Formally, the payoﬀ for station s in market m

and format fst in quarter t which chooses fst+1 for the next quarter is



  π smt (f, S, εst , α, θ, σ) = R(Lsmt (S, Γ), α) − θ1 I(fst+1 6= fst , fst+1 6= 0)

                                                                                  − θ2 I(fst 6= 0) + σεFst (fst+1 )



L and R are the functions determining listenerhip and revenues.                  The parameter θ1 is the sunk

repositioning cost paid when a station switches to a diﬀerent active format and θ2 is a per-period

fixed cost paid when a station is on-air (not Dark).            σ scales the iid payoﬀ shocks (εFst ) which are

assumed to be drawn from a Type I extreme value (Gumbel) distribution with location parameter 0.

Diﬀerences in the εF s can be interpreted as reflecting heterogeneity in format repositioning costs and

I use this interpretation in Section 6.




                                                         13
4.3.1    Listener Demand (Lsmt (S, Γ))

Listener demand is determined through a static, discrete choice, random coeﬃcients logit model. The

market is defined as the time available to people aged 12 and above. Each listener chooses at most

one station. The utility listener i in market m receives by choosing station s in quarter t is



                            uismt = γ C          F             S            L
                                      i + Fsmt γ imt + Xsfs t γ + ξ smt + ν ist                        (1)



where Fsmt is a row vector indicating the current format of station s and ν L
                                                                            ist is the standard logit

error.   γC
          i allows for heterogeneity in utility from listening to commercial radio and I assume that

γC          2      F
 i ∼ N(0, γ C ). γ imt is individual i’s taste for diﬀerent formats and I assume that




                             γ Fimt = γ Fm + γ FA Ai + γ FE Ei + γ FG Gi + ΓFRC viF                    (2)



γ Fm is a vector of market-format fixed eﬀects which allows tastes to vary across markets and controls

for the presence of significant non-commercial competitors in some market-formats.          γ FA , γ FE and

γ FS allow additively separable eﬀects of age, ethnicity/race and gender on format preferences. The

viF s are assumed to be drawn from a standard normal distribution and allow for individuals to have

systematic preferences for stations in the same format in addition to those due to demographics. As

is standard in most of the literature, ΓFRC is assumed to be diagonal. Xsfs are observed characteristics

of station s, such as signal coverage, as well as a full set of AM band-format interactions. ξ smt is the

unobserved component of station quality. It is assumed that all listeners value ξ smt and the observed

Xsfs characteristics in the same way.


4.3.2    Revenue Function, R(L, α)

The revenue function is used to translate listenership into dollars of revenue. In the simplest specifi-

cation, I assume that station s in market m in quarter t receives revenues Rsmdt when it is chosen by



                                                      14
a listener with demographics d



                           Rsmdt = αmy(t) (1 + Wsmt αW )(1 + Dd αD ) + εR
                                                                        smt                          (3)



αmy(t) are a full set of market-year fixed eﬀects which capture diﬀerences in advertiser demand that

are common across all stations in a market. I use market-year fixed eﬀects as revenues are reported on

an annual, rather than quarterly, basis. W captures additional station characteristics. In particular,

I allow per listener revenues to vary with the degree of competition that the station faces in its format

and whether the station is commonly owned. I also allow an additional eﬀect of a recent format switch

on revenues, as format-switchers may have to lower advertising prices or carry fewer commercials while

they develop new relationships with advertisers.


4.4     Evolution of the State Space

Three parts of the state space evolve over time: station formats, unobserved station qualities and

market ethnic/racial demographics. Station formats evolve deterministically with station choices.


4.4.1    Unobserved Station Quality

I assume that unobserved station quality evolves according to



                                     ξ smt = ρξ1 ξ smt−1 + μξt + ν ξ1smt                             (4)



for stations remaining in the same format where ν 1smt are iid innovations in quality drawn from some

distribution. The μξt s are time fixed eﬀects. I assume that quality evolves according to



                                  ξ smt = ρξ2 ξ smt−1 + μξt + μξ2 + ν ξ2smt                          (5)




                                                     15
for stations switching formats. This second transition process applies only between the periods when

the format switch takes place.


4.4.2    Market Demographics

I assume that the growth rate of each ethnic/racial group e also follows a stationary AR(1) process


                                          D
                                         gemt = ρD gemt−1
                                                    D
                                                          + μD + ν D
                                                                   emt                                            (6)



where ν D           e
        emt ∼ N(0, η ). I assume that the parameters are the same for all ethnic/racial groups, but

with a high value of ρD , the current rapid growth of Hispanic populations in many markets tends to

persist for some years into the future.


4.4.3    Repositioning Costs

The model allows for three diﬀerent types of repositioning cost.                  First, a station’s quality may

fall when it switches formats causing it to lose listeners (μξ2 ).         Second, a station may receive lower

revenues, for given listenership, following a format switch as it searches for new advertisers (Wsmt αW ).

Third, a station may have to pay additional sunk costs when switching (θ1 ).                    These costs could

result from hiring format consultants, marketing the station, replacing staﬀ or making investments in

programming that have not been explicitly modelled.


4.5     Equilibrium Concept: Markov-Perfect Nash Equilibrium

In common with the literature, I assume that stations play a symmetric, anonymous, stationary, pure

strategy Markov Perfect Nash Equilibrium.15            Formally, a station’s Markov Perfect strategy ς s is a

function mapping from the current observable state space (S) and the station’s own current payoﬀ
  15
    This involves making an assumption that this type of equilibrium exists as well as which equilibrium is played if
there are several. Dorazelski and Satterthwaite (2003) examine the existence of Markov Perfect Nash equilibria in
dynamic oligopoly models. One obvious diﬀerence between my model and the stylized model that they consider is that
I have continuous rather than discrete state variables, but one could convert my state variables into discrete ones by
considering an arbitrarily fine discretization.



                                                         16
shocks (the εFs s) to actions (format choices), i.e., ς s : S x εFs → As .

   Station s’s value function prior to the realization of its current εFs s is

                                      ∙                         Z                               ¸
                                                        F             0           0       F
                  Vs (S|ς s ) = EεF    π s (S, ς s (S, εs )) + β Vs (S |ς s )dP (S |ς(S, ε ), S)         (7)



where β is the common discount factor, π s (S, ς s (S, εFs )) are its static payoﬀs as a function of the

state variables and its own strategy and P (S 0 |ς(S, εF ), S) is the probability that the state in the next

quarter will be S 0 given current state S and the strategy profiles of all stations ς. For ς ∗s to be optimal

it must provide s with a higher expected value than alternative strategies at all points in the state

space

                                      Vs (S|ς ∗s , ς ∗−s ) ≥ Vs (S|ς 0s , ς ∗−s ) ∀S, ς 0s               (8)


Prior to the realization of the εFs s a station’s optimal strategy implies a probability distribution over

format choices.    A profile of strategies ς ∗ is a Markov Perfect Nash Equilibrium if each station’s

strategy is optimal given the strategies of other stations.

   An important simplifying assumption is that stations are treated as entities maximizing their

individual payoﬀs, even though many stations are commonly owned and there was increasing common

ownership during the sample period. Common ownership could aﬀect format choices because owners

want to avoid audience cannibalization, desire to exercise market power over listeners or advertisers

or exploit economies of scope by oﬀering similar kinds of programming on diﬀerent stations.             It is

beyond the scope of the current paper to include the eﬀects of common ownership in the dynamic

model.    Instead I attempt to control for the eﬀects of common ownership on station revenues and

station policies, and then estimate repositioning costs treating stations as individual payoﬀ-maximizing

firms.




                                                              17
5     Estimation

5.1     Road Map

I follow most of the recent literature by estimating the model using a two-step approach. Listener

demand, station strategies, the revenue function and transition processes of the state variables are

estimated in the first step. In the second step the remaining parameters of the payoﬀ function (θ1 , θ2

and σ) are estimated. This involves using forward simulation to calculate future station payoﬀs and

then finding the parameters which make the observed policies optimal. I follow standard practice in

assuming, rather than estimating, the value of the discount factor (β = 0.95).


5.2     First Step: Listener Demand and Station Quality Transitions

I estimate the parameters of the demand model and the transition processes governing unobserved

station quality using a GMM procedure.               My assumptions on the timing of format choices and

innovations in quality allow for consistent estimation of these parameters even though format choices

are endogenous.


5.2.1    Quasi-Diﬀerenced Demand Moments

The “mean utility” of station s in market m at time t is



                              δ smt = Fsmt γ Fm + Xsfs γ S + ξ smt = X
                                                                     ]     L
                                                                      smt Γ + ξ smt                                (9)



where ΓL are the linear demand parameters. An endogeneity problem arises if unobservable qualities

ξ smt are correlated with local format tastes. A correlation would exist if, for example, higher quality

stations tend to select into formats which are more popular (e.g., Country might be a more attractive

format for a high quality station in Knoxville, TN than Boston, MA).16
   16
      In my setting it is important to distinguish between the role of format and station quality in explaining station
listenership. For example, if there is high listening to Country in Knoxville only because Country is popular in
Knoxville then other stations may want to switch into Country. On the other hand, if Country listening is high because
the stations in Country are of high quality then other stations would have less incentive to enter the format.


                                                          18
   My assumptions on the timing of innovations in station quality allow me to overcome the endo-

geneity problem. Specifically I assume that the innovation in unobserved quality between period t

and t + 1 is only realized after the format choice for period t + 1 is made. This allows me to form

moments based on the innovations in quality.

   For a station remaining in the same format



                                    ξ smt = ρξ1 ξ smt−1 + μξt + ν ξ1smt                           (10)



so that the innovation in quality can be found by taking quasi-diﬀerences



                                    ν 1smt = ξ smt − ρξ1 ξ smt−1 − μξt                            (11)
                                                  ³                    ´
                         = (δ smt − ρξ δ smt−1 ) − X
                                     1
                                                    ]
                                                    smt    − ρξ ^
                                                              1X         L  ξ
                                                                 smt−1 Γ − μt                     (12)



A similar quasi-diﬀerence gives the innovation in quality for format switchers



                                 ν 2smt = ξ smt − ρξ2 ξ smt−1 − μξ2 − μξt                         (13)
                                                ³                   ´
                      = (δ smt − ρξ2 δ smt−1 ) − X]        ξ ^          L ξ ξ
                                                  smt − ρ2 Xsmt−1 Γ − μ2 − μt                     (14)



The innovations can be used to form moment conditions



                                         E[Zsmt ν smt (Γ, ρξ )] = 0                               (15)



where the Zs are instruments.     Under my assumptions, all of the observed station characteristics,

                                                                               ]
including formats at t and t − 1, are valid instruments. The inclusion of both X         ^
                                                                                smt and Xsmt−1 as

instruments results in a large degree of overidentification as the ΓL parameters on them are restricted

to be the same. Additional instruments, based on format x demographic and competition interactions,




                                                    19
help to identify the non-linear taste parameters.17             I also include the log of the t − 1 market share

interacted with an indicator for whether the station changes formats to help identify the ρξ s.

       Mechanically the calculation of these moments works as follows. First, the contraction mapping

procedure of Berry et al (1995) is used to calculate the mean utilities given the current value of

the non-linear taste parameters.18          Second, given values of the ρξ parameters, which are included

in the set of non-linear parameters, the value of the linear demand parameters (which include all

of the market-format fixed eﬀects) can be found using the first-order conditions for minimizing the

GMM objective function defined below as suggested by Nevo (2000).19 Finally, the innovations are

calculated and these are used to form the sample moments.


5.2.2      Additional Demographic Moments

As illustrated by Petrin (2002) additional information is useful in estimating the non-linear taste

parameters. I add two sets of moments. The first set match the proportion of a station’s audience in

five age, gender or ethnic groups (females, 12-24, 25-49, blacks and Hispanics) with those reported for

each format by Arbitron in its Radio Today publications for Spring 2003, 2004 and 2005. The numbers

reported by Arbitron are averages for stations in the format across the largest 100 markets.20,21 The

moments are
                                                      \
                                         E[Zdsf mt (Pdsf mt (Γ) − Pdf t )] = 0                                       (16)
  17
     Specifically I include period t and t − 1 format interactions with the number of other AM stations in the format,
the number of other FM stations in the format and the sum of the proportion of market covered by the signals of
other stations in the format. I also include the period t values for the proportion of blacks and Hispanics in the market
population interacted with format dummies. This gives a total of 80 additional instruments.
  18
     I use 50 Halton draws for each of the 18 demographic groups in each market-quarter (900 overall) and then calculate
market shares by weighting each demographic group appropriately. I also use independent draws across market-quarters,
which is appropriate as the Arbitron ratings panel varies across from quarter-to-quarter.
  19
     This is possible because the additional moments I define below only depend on the δs and the value of the non-linear
taste parameters.
  20
     I also have age and gender-specific share data on listenership to individual stations in Spring 2006. I do not use
this data because shares are not reported when they are too small, introducing a selection problem into the demand
estimation. However, the shares for larger stations, where less data is missing is similar to the averages that I use, and
the demand coeﬃcients are similar using the station-specific share data and ignoring the selection problem.
  21
     For blacks and Hispanics the numbers are calculated using the subset of markets where Arbitron tracks ethnic and
racial listening.




                                                           20
where Zdsf mt is an indicator equal to one if station-quarter st is in format f and in a market m used

by Arbitron in calculating its reported proportions.

    The second set of moments match total time spent listening by blacks and Hispanics to those

reported by Arbitron for a set of markets in Fall 2004,


                                                   \
                                        E[Zemt (T SLemt (Γ) − T SLemt )] = 0                                       (17)



where Zemt is an indicator for a reported market.


5.2.3    Objective Function

The moments are stacked into a vector G(Γ, ρξ ). The objective function is



                                              min G(Γ, ρξ )0 W G(Γ, ρξ )                                           (18)
                                              Γ,ρξ



where W is a weighting matrix. Following Hansen (1982) I use a two-step procedure where W is the

identity matrix in the first step and the inverse of the covariance matrix of the moments calculated at

the first step parameter values in the second step. Analytic derivatives are used to speed the search.


5.3     First Step: Revenue Function

The revenue function is estimated using BIAfn’s estimates of annual station revenues and the pre-

dictions of demographic-specific station listenership from the estimated listener demand model. The

empirical specification uses average revenues per listener as the dependent variable and allows for the

fact that years (y) contain more than one period.22

    I use average revenues per listener as the dependent variable as these are similar across markets of diﬀerent sizes,
whereas total revenues are much larger in larger markets.

The additively separable error does not have a structural interpretation - one might think of it as

measurement error in BIAfn’s estimates - and the function is estimated by non-linear least squares.23


5.4      First Step: Station Policy Functions

Stations’ equilibrium strategies can be inferred from the probabilities that they make diﬀerent format

choices conditional on the observed state variables.            In an ideal world these probabilities would

be estimated non-parametrically.         However, despite the large amount of data available, the size of

the state space makes a non-parametric approach infeasible.                I therefore assume that the choice

probabilities can be adequately approximated using a multinomial logit model where the explanatory

variables are functions of the state variables as well as controls for the eﬀects of ownership.               This

approach is also used by Ryan (2005), Ryan and Tucker (2006) and Beresteanu and Ellickson (2006)

and it has the advantage that the plausibility of the coeﬃcient estimates can easily be verified.

       Both the multinomial format choice model and the revenue function have estimates from the de-

mand model as explanatory variables. It is not feasible to estimate all of these models simultaneously

but I calculate corrected standard errors by expressing the first order conditions of the non-linear

least squares and maximum likelihood estimators as moment conditions and applying the two-step

estimator cited in Ho (2006).


5.5      First Step: Demographic Transitions

The process controlling the growth of ethnic/racial populations is estimated using the County Popu-

lation Estimates. To prevent changes in very small population groups having an excessive eﬀect on

the estimates, I only use observations on those groups with at least a 5% share of market population.
  23
    The key assumption is that format choices are not made in anticipation of future shocks to per listener revenues
which might diﬀer across formats.

5.6     Second Step: Estimation of Sunk Repositioning Costs

The parameters θ1 (mean sunk repositioning costs), θ2 (fixed costs of being on-air) and σ (the scaling

parameter of the εF s/heterogeneity of sunk costs) are estimated in the second step using a moment

inequality estimator.


5.6.1     Estimating the Value Function

The inequalities are formed using the necessary equilibrium condition that a station’s actual strategy

yields higher expected payoﬀs than any alternative strategy



                                      Vs (S|ς ∗s , ς ∗−s , θ, σ) − Vs (S|ς 0s , ς ∗−s , θ, σ) ≥ 0 ∀ς 0s                                    (20)



Vs (S|ς s , ς ∗−s , θ) is a linear-in-parameters value function with four components representing the value

of expected future revenues, fixed costs, switching costs and εs given strategies and future transitions

of the state variables



                      Vs (S|ς s , ς ∗−s , θ, σ) = Rs,ς s ,ς ∗−s − θ1 Ss,ς s ,ς ∗−s − θ2 Fs,ς s ,ς ∗−s + σεFs,ς s ,ς ∗−s                    (21)

                                                                                                          X

and expectations are taken with respect to future transitions of the state variables given strategies.

Bajari et al. (2007) describe how to formulate unbiased estimates of R, S, F, εF using forward

simulation. Appendix A describes my forward simulation procedure in detail. The logit assumption

allows the expected value of εFst (fst+1 ) to be calculated analytically using the choice probabilities.

R, S, F, εF are calculated for a station’s actual strategy and a set of alternative strategies which I

describe below.




                                                                        23
5.6.2       Pakes et al. (2006)

Given estimates of the value function, several estimators could be used to estimate the parameters. I

choose Pakes et al. (2006)’s moment inequality estimator because it can provide consistent estimates

even when there is simulation error in the estimated value function. Allowing for simulation error

is important as it is prohibitively expensive to do enough simulations to eﬀectively eliminate the

simulation error from each observation.24


General Pakes et al. (2006) formulation. Pakes et al. (2006) consider estimating parameters

using the necessary condition that a firm s’s expected profits from using its actual strategy (or,

depending on the setting, using its chosen action) ς ∗s are greater than under any alternative ς 0s



                                         E[π(ς ∗s , ς ∗−s , x) − π(ς 0s , ς ∗−s , x)|Is ] ≥ 0                          (22)



where x are variables aﬀecting profits and Is is firm s’s information set at the time it chooses its

strategy.

       The researcher is assumed to have an estimate of π(ς s , ς ∗−s , x), r(ς s , ς ∗−s , x0 ; θ), where x0 are vari-

ables observed by the econometrician and θ are parameters.                             They define two sources of diﬀerence

between π and r, ν 1,s,ς s and ν 2,s,ς s



                                  π(ς s , ς ∗−s , x) = r(ς s , ς ∗−s , x0 ; θ) + ν 1,s,ς s + ν 2,s,ς s                 (23)



ν 1,s,ς s is assumed to have an unconditional mean of zero, to be independent of Is and not to aﬀect s’s

choice of strategy. ν 1,s,ς s can include the econometrician’s error in measuring profits. On the other

hand ν 2,s,ς s is known by the firm and potentially aﬀects its choice of strategy.
  24
    Simulations are computationally costly because a random coeﬃcients demand model and multinomial choice problems
for as many as 50 stations have to be solved in each period. Many simulations are required to remove the simulation
error because market demographics, qualities and format choices can evolve in many diﬀerent ways.         On average, I
found that it required an average of just over 7,000 simulation paths for the estimate of expected future revenues to
converge to within 1% of its true value (estimated using 11,000 simulations). Instead I use 220 forward simulations per
observation and use an estimator which allows for simulation error.


                                                                  24
    As is standard in the dynamic games literature, I assume that I observe the same state space as the

firms. As a result there is no v2 when the value function Vs is defined prior to the private information

εF s being realized. This case corresponds to Pakes et al.’s Example 1 and several of their empirical

examples. Substituting (23) into (22) and using E(ν 1,s,ς s |Is ) = 0



                                    E[r(ς ∗s , ς ∗−s , x0 ; θ) − r(ς 0s , ς ∗−s , x0 ; θ)|zs ] ≥ 0                     (24)



where zs ∈ Is .

    (24) can be turned into an estimating moment inequality by specifying a set of non-negative

instrument functions h(zs ), interacting them with the inequalities and taking sample averages across

observations
                                S
                             1 X £¡ ∗ ∗                                             ¢        ¤
                                   r(ς s , ς −s , x0 ; θ) − r(ς 0s , ς ∗−s , x0 ; θ) ⊗ h(zs ) ≥ 0                      (25)
                             S s=1

The ν 1 errors are “averaged out” across observations.                      The number of moment inequalities can be

increased by expanding the set of instruments h(zs ) or increasing the number of alternative strategies

considered. The parameters are estimated by finding the θs which satisfy the inequalities (or minimize

violations if there are no parameters for which all the inequalities hold). Estimation is particularly

simple when r is a linear function of θ. Pakes et al. prove consistency of the estimator (as the number

of observations increases) and show how to construct two types of confidence interval.25


Applying Pakes et al. (2006) to Estimate Repositioning Costs. In my setting, the r(.)s

are the simulated value functions and the ν 1 s are additively separable simulation errors in measuring

station revenues (I will come back to simulation error in the other components of expected payoﬀs in a

moment). There are three parameters to estimate, θ1 , θ2 and σ. I perform the estimation separately

for six groups of markets of diﬀerent sizes, so that the parameters can vary freely between the groups.
   25
      It is not known how to analytically correct these confidence intervals for estimation error in the first step. The most
obvious solution would be to bootstrap the confidence intervals by repeating the forward simulations for diﬀerent draws
from the first step parameters. This would be very time consuming and I have not done it. However, I do examine how
the second stage estimates change when I change the specification for the transition of unobserved station quality which
directly aﬀects how attractive switching is. The second stage parameter estimates change relatively little in this case.


                                                                 25
   I use the simplest possible application of the Pakes et al. methodology to my setting. I define the

h(zs )s to be a set of constants and consider four alternative policies which provide lower and upper

bounds on θ1 , and upper bounds on θ2 and σ. I add the natural restrictions that θ2 ≥ 0 (fixed costs

are positive) and σ ≥ 0 (the scale parameter on the εF s are non-negative). As a result, the system

of inequalities for each group of markets g reduces to

                ⎡                                                                        ⎤

               ⎣                                                                         ⎦ ≥ 0 for 4 alternative ς 0s   (26)
        Sg s∈g                                                \             \
                 −θ2 (F\                 \                    F             F
                        s,ς ∗s ,ς ∗−s − Fs,ς 0s ,ς ∗−s ) + σ(εs,ς ∗ ,ς ∗ − εs,ς 0 ,ς ∗ )

                                                      θ2 ≥ 0, σ ≥ 0



A nice feature of these inequalities is that additively separable simulation error in the S, F, and εF

terms should also be averaged out across observations.

   I now describe the alternative strategies.              A strategy specifies a set of cutoﬀs for the εF s, as

functions of the observed state variables, which lead to diﬀerent format choices. A strategy implies

a probability for each format choice in each state prior to the realization of the εF s. My alternative

strategies vary the choice probabilities and, equivalently, imply diﬀerent cutoﬀs for the εF s.

   The logic behind each of the alternative policies can be seen writing the inequality as



                        (R∗ − R0 ) − θ1 (S∗ − S0 ) − θ2 (F∗ − F0 ) + σ(εF ∗ − εF 0 ) ≥ 0                                (27)



and rearranging it to provide bounds on the parameters of interest

Consider an alternative strategy which raises expected revenues (R) at the cost of increasing the

number of switches (S). The fact that this strategy is not chosen implies a lower bound on the sunk

repositioning costs as a function of θ2 and σ (inequality 28).              On the other hand, the fact that a

strategy which reduces switching but also reduces future revenues is not chosen provides an upper

bound on sunk costs (inequality 29). I operationalize the first alternative by changing the station’s

strategy so that the probability that it remains in its current format falls by 0.05 in every state with

the probabilities of every alternative format scaled up proportionally. The second alternative has the

station never switching formats. The results are similar varying the size of the changes in strategy

unless the changes are very small (as I discuss below).

       Pakes et al. provide a graphical interpretation of their procedure (p. 55).               Figure 4(a) shows

the bounds constructed using these alternative strategies in (θ1 , σ) space where the inequalities are

averaged over stations in markets with between 3 and 5 million people and θ2 = 0. A format switch

tends to yield a higher value of εF , so that as σ increases higher sunk costs are required to rationalize

why stations rarely switch formats. This causes the bounds to slope upwards.

       An upper bound on σ can be found using an alternative policy which increases εF while reducing

future revenues, holding switching roughly constant (inequality 30). I construct an appropriate alter-

native strategy using a feature of the multinomial logit choice model. For a given set of alternatives,

the expected value of the εF associated with the chosen alternative increases as the choice probabil-

ities are made more equal.26 The specific alternative strategy which I consider leads to the station

not changing the probability that it remains in its current format but equalizing the probabilities of

choosing each alternative format.27 Figure 4(b) adds this bound to the diagram. The resulting upper

bounds on (θ1 , σ) are ($47m, $4.7m) and the lower bounds are ($6.4m, $0m). Figure 5 shows that

the diagrams constructed for other market groups are qualitatively very similar, although the scale of
  26
     This results from the εs being iid across choices. An agent who chooses the alternative with the highest ε (disre-
garding other features of the choice) will choose each alternative with equal probability.
  27
     A specific example may help to provide more intuition. AM stations rarely choose Rock and frequently choose
News/Talk. This presumably reflects the fact that AM stations expect higher revenues in News than in Rock. On the
other hand, if AM stations simply maximized the εF s associated with their format choices there would choose Rock with
the same probability as News. I can estimate how much lower expected revenues and higher expected εF s would be if
an AM station was to choose News and Rock with equal probability and this lets me construct an upper bound on σ.


                                                          27
the axes varies with market size.

         An upper bound on per-period fixed costs can be found by considering an alternative strategy

which reduces the number of periods the station is on-air (F) while also reducing revenues (inequality

31).       The alternative strategy increases the probability than an active station goes oﬀ-air by 0.05,

with the other choice probabilities reduced proportionally.28


5.6.3        Alternative Second Step Estimators

I use the moment inequality approach because it allows me to consistently estimate the parameters

even when there is some error in the simulated payoﬀs of each station. Estimators such as Maximum

Likelihood (using observed station choices) or moment estimators which calculate choice probabilities

will not produce consistent estimates because they use non-linear transformations of the simulated

payoﬀs.

         A disadvantage of the moment inequality approach is that it produces only bounds on the pa-

rameters. However, one can approximate moment equalities (representing the first-order conditions

of the firm’s maximization problem) using small perturbations of station strategies.                    I have exper-

imented with this approach and when the perturbations are not too small it produces estimates of

repositioning costs which are similar to the (reasonable) upper bound estimates produced using the

inequalities. When very small perturbations are used, the results become sensitive to the number of

forward simulations. This suggests that the larger changes in strategy considered when calculating

the moment inequalities may also be helpful in dealing with simulation errors.



6         Results

This section presents the empirical results.           I estimate the model using data from Spring 1997 to

Spring 2006 for 100 markets (listed in Table 5) where less than 6% of radio listening is to out of
    28
    A lower bound on per-period fixed costs can be estimated by increasing the probability that oﬀ-air stations become
active. However, many of my oﬀ-air stations have lost their licenses or are waiting to be licensed so they may prevented
from entering even if it was profitable to do so.

market stations.29 I limit the sample in this way to avoid modelling interactions between markets.

In the second step I simulate the model for each station observed in the data in Fall 2004.

       I also make two additional adjustments to the data. First, radio listening has declined since the

mid-1980s and real revenues per listener have increased. Since 2001 these trends have roughly oﬀset

each other. To avoid modelling these trends I remove the national trend from the share data and,

when simulating the model forward, I assume that real revenues per listener will remain fixed at their

2004 levels.

       Second, BIAfn does not report the market shares of stations which fail to meet Arbitron’s Minimum

Reporting Standards (Arbitron (2002)). These stations have low market shares (generally less than

0.3% of radio listening each), but they can account for as many as 25% of all stations.                           To avoid

imputing shares for such a large proportion of the sample, I drop stations which are missing data for

over half of the sample periods (17% of stations) and impute a share for the remainder based on how

many quarters are missing and the share of the smallest reported station in the market-quarter.


6.1      First Step: Listener Demand

Table 6 presents the estimated coeﬃcients from the demand model and the processes governing station

quality.30 Specification A is the model described above. The demographic format taste parameters

show the expected pattern, with, for example, females preferring Adult Contemporary and disliking

Rock, and most of these coeﬃcients are precisely estimated.                     The standard deviations of the ran-

dom components of format tastes are small and insignificantly diﬀerent from zero.                          This finding is

consistent with demographics capturing most of the systematic diﬀerences in individuals’ tastes for

diﬀerent types of programming within markets.31 The standard deviation of the random coeﬃcient
  29
      A little over 12% of stations in this subsample of markets have listeners in other markets. I assume that stations
do not consider revenues they get from listeners in other markets. This is plausible because local advertisers will place
less value on reaching listeners in other markets (the BIAfn revenue data suggests that an out of market listener counts
for about 20% of the value of a home market listener).
   30
      The parameters which are not listed include a set of time dummies. The time coeﬃcients are all small and
statistically insignificant (this reflects the fact that I take out the trend in radio listenership when calculating the share
data). When I simulate forward I ignore their eﬀects.
   31
      The market-format fixed eﬀects should capture systematic diﬀerences in format preferences across markets.




                                                             29
on the commercial radio constant is also quite small, indicating that there is a reasonable degree of

substitution with the outside good which includes non-commercial stations and the fringe stations

which are too small to be included in the sample.

   The coeﬃcients on the fixed station quality characteristics are sensible, with greater signal coverage

and more powerful transmitters associated with higher station quality. The small number of out of

market stations are estimated to be of lower quality, and the coeﬃcient on the dummy included for

stations with imputed shares is also negative as these stations, by definition, have small shares. AM

band stations are, as expected, estimated to have higher quality in the News format than formats

such as Rock and Urban.        However, AM stations are estimated to have higher quality in Adult

Contemporary and CHR than in News, even though there are very few AM AC or CHR stations.

   The final part of the table reports the coeﬃcients for the processes controlling unobserved station

quality. The ρξ parameters are less than one so that the processes are stationary. While quality is

more persistent for stations staying in the same format, it is also persistent (ρξ2 = 0.7) for stations

which switch formats. The μξ2 coeﬃcient indicates the quality falls on average in the period following a

switch even though listenership increases. However, this quality decline is not statistically significant:

quality is largely transferred across formats.

   Figure 1 shows that listenership increases for two periods following a switch, rather than adjusting

to a new level immediately. Specification B captures this eﬀect by adding an additional constant to the

quality evolution process (4) for stations which changed formats one period earlier. The coeﬃcient is

positive and statistically significant, with the other transition parameters remaining almost the same

as in specification A (this also applies to the other coeﬃcients which I do not report).        The most

obvious interpretation of this increase in quality is that listenership increases as listeners become aware

of the station’s new format with some additional benefit arising because of novelty or from investments

undertaken at the time of switching which have not been modelled. Allowing for this quality increase

tends to makes switching more attractive and, a result, increases how large sunk repositioning costs

have to be to explain why stations rarely switch. In what follows I use the specification B results,


                                                    30
but show how the second step parameters change if I use specification A instead.

    Figures 6(a) and (b) show the pdfs of the innovations in unobserved station quality (the residuals

from the quasi-diﬀerenced moments) and Figure 6(c) shows the pdf of quality itself (ξ smt ). All of

the distributions are close to bell-shaped with more weight in the tails than one would expect given

normal distributions.        Most of the weight in the tails of the innovation distributions comes from

small stations for whom shares and changes in share may be aﬀected by my imputation or Arbitron’s

mismeasurement. In the analysis which follows I draw the innovations in quality from the empirical

distributions of innovations for stations with shares above the 25th percentile, although the fit of the

model is very similar using a wide range of cutoﬀs.32

    I can also compute how well the demand model and innovation processes perform at predicting

how listenership changes over time.           To do this, I use the estimates of station quality in period t,

simulate (one set of) changes in station quality and calculate stations’ market shares in their t + 1

formats with t + 1 market demographics. Figure 7 and Table 7 compare the changes in share seen in

the data with those simulated from the model. The actual and simulated distributions match closely

for both switchers and non-switchers.

    One can also calculate the model’s performance at predicting changes for individual stations.

This can be done either by using just one simulation or using multiple simulations (I use 20). The

correlation between these average predicted changes and the changes seen in the actual data for format

switchers is 0.56.33 The correlation for stations remaining in the same format is lower, 0.14. This is

not surprising as non-switchers are less aﬀected by the type of structural change in product positioning

which the estimated demand model is designed to capture.
   32
      If no cut-oﬀ is used the changes in share for larger stations have greater variance than those observed in the data.
The fit of the model is also similar when separate innovation processes are estimated for small and large stations. The
demand system parameters are also essentially identical in this case.
   33
      As a benchmark one can compare this correlation with the correlation between a single simulation and the mean
from 20 diﬀerent simulations. This correlation is 0.62, indicating that the model only does a slightly worse job of
predicting what happens than would be expected if the model was perfectly specified.




                                                           31
6.2       First Step: Revenue Function

Table 8 reports the coeﬃcients from several specifications of the revenue function.                     The revenue

function is estimated using BIAfn’s revenue data and estimates of audience composition from the

demand model. The first specification assumes a price per listener which does not vary with the size

of a station’s listenership but does vary with listener demographics.               Females are estimated to be

more valuable than males, listeners aged 25-49 to be more valuable than older or younger listeners

and whites to be more valuable than blacks or Hispanics. These demographic coeﬃcients are similar

across the specifications. The bottom section of the table provides some statistics on the performance

of the revenue model in predicting changes in annual revenues given the changes in listenership. The

simplest specification underestimates the average increase in (nominal) revenues for non-switchers and

overestimates them for switchers, although the correlations between predicted and observed changes

in revenues are reasonable in both cases.

       The second specification allows for eﬀects of format competition, common ownership as well as

an additional eﬀect on revenues in the year following a change in format (when a station may carry

fewer commercials or discount commercial time while it develops relationships with new advertisers).

Common ownership with an additional station in the format increases revenues per listener by 2%.34

Competition reduces revenues by a small and barely significant amount (0.2%).                     The absence of a

competition eﬀect is consistent with advertising prices being set in a broader advertising market. The

specification also reveals a large, direct eﬀect of format switching on station revenues as prices per

listener are estimated to fall by 14% in the year following the format switch.

       The last two specifications allow for prices per listener to vary with the number of listeners. This is

partly motivated by Fisher et al.’s (1980) finding that advertising prices charged by local TV stations

increase with audience size.        The third specification allows for prices to vary with the diﬀerence

between the station’s market share and the market average. Consistent with Fisher et al., prices per
  34
     This could be rationalized by (i) common owners being able to oﬀer advertisers bundles of ads on diﬀerent stations
which allows them to extract more advertiser surplus or (ii) by being able to exercise some market power over either
listeners (making them listen to more commercials) or advertisers. In either case the common ownership eﬀect is
relatively small.


                                                          32
listener increase with station size and allowing this eﬀect increases the predicted change in revenues

for format switchers, as they tend to gain listeners. The predicted change in revenues for switchers

and non-switchers is lower than the observed changes by similar amounts.

       The final specification allows the prices per listener in each of the 18 demographic groups to vary

with the proportion of the station’s listenership who are in that group.               This is motivated by the

idea that advertisers may value more homogenous audiences. However, the coeﬃcient is negative and

significant. There is no obvious explanation for a negative eﬀect and in using the revenue function

below I use the results from the third specification.


6.3      First Step: Station Policy Functions

Table 9 reports the coeﬃcients from the multinomial logit estimates of station strategies. An advantage

of the parametric specification is that it is easy to see whether the signs of the coeﬃcients are sensible.

       The first part of the table shows the coeﬃcients on variables that one should think of as aﬀecting

the intrinsic attractiveness of a format. The pattern of coeﬃcients is sensible. For example, large and

growing Hispanic populations make stations more likely to choose the Spanish format. Larger black

populations make stations more likely to choose Urban and Religious formats, although black growth

is not estimated to have significant eﬀects.         This is probably because black growth rates show less

variation than Hispanic growth rates during my sample period. The coeﬃcients on the measures of

market-format attractiveness (the market-format fixed eﬀects from the demand system) are positive,

as one would expect, but they are generally insignificant.35

       The second part reports the coeﬃcients on variables reflecting competition from other stations.

As expected, most of the coeﬃcients are negative (more competition makes it less attractive for a

station to choose the format). A station is also more likely to stay in a format if it is the largest

station and, in general, stations with larger shares are less likely to switch. The third part lists the
  35
    I have to impute qualities for market-formats in which stations are never observed. Religious formats in markets
outside of the South and Spanish formats in markets with few Hispanics make up the majority of the cases. I assume
that market-format attractiveness in these markets is equal to the 25% percentile of markets where attractiveness can
be estimated. The results do not appear to be sensitive to the percentile used.



                                                         33
coeﬃcients on interactions between format and band. I allow the coeﬃcients to diﬀer depending on

whether stations are already in the format (Stay x) or are in a diﬀerent format (Switch x). The AM

x Switch coeﬃcients are consistent with the pattern in Table 2 that AM stations are more likely to

switch to talk programming (News and Religious). The market size interactions indicate that there

is less switching, conditional on the other variables, in larger markets.

   The final part reports the coeﬃcients on the ownership variables included as controls, as well as

a miscellaneous selection of other variables. The national ownership variables indicate that stations

are more likely to switch stations into formats where they own other stations (in any market). The

magnitude of the eﬀect is largest for Spanish, suggesting that there may be larger economies of scope

from operating stations in the same language. There is also a highly significant eﬀect that stations

which have undergone recent ownership changes are more likely to switch formats, suggesting that the

optimal format choice may diﬀer from owner-to-owner. However, the within market ownership eﬀects

are much weaker: a station is slightly (but not significantly) more likely to leave a format where it has

sister stations, but it is also more likely to switch to a format where it has sister stations. There are

no significant eﬀects of other firms owning multiple stations in a format. Stations which have switched

formats in the previous year (Recent Switch x) are slightly, but not significantly, more likely to make

a further switch.

   One can also calculate a pseudo-R2 statistic by comparing the maximized log-likelihood with the

log-likelihood when the model only contains a constant for staying in the same format. The additional

variables explain just over 14% of the variation in station switching decisions. This compares favorably

with the pseudo-R2 s reported in Ryan (2005) and Beresteanu and Ellickson (2006).




                                                   34
6.4      First Step: Demographic Transitions

I estimate the demographic transition process using data from all markets, not just the 100 markets

used to estimate the rest of the model. The estimates are



                                          gemt = 0.863 gemt−1 + 0.002 + ν D
                                                                          emt                                           (32)
                                                   (0.057)           (0.000)



and the standard deviation of ν D
                                emt is 0.0100. This implies that average long-run population growth

of 1.5% per year.


6.5      Second Step Estimates: Sunk Repositioning Costs

With the first step estimates in hand, I use the moment inequality estimator described above to bound

sunk repositioning costs.          Table 10(a) show the bounds and associated confidence intervals for six

diﬀerent groups of markets which diﬀer in size. The estimates assume that the parameters are the

same for each station within each market group.                   In LA and Chicago, the lower and upper bound

estimates of θ1 are $700,000 (4% of annual revenues for the average station) and $81 million (over 4

times annual revenues).

      The upper bound estimates of mean sunk repositioning costs may seem implausibly large, but

if the εF s represent heterogeneity in repositioning costs then the mean will not reflect repositioning

costs paid by stations which choose to switch formats. The table also reports the estimated average

repositioning costs of stations switching formats during the sample period. This is calculated as the

expected value of θ1 − σ(εFa − εFb ) where εFa is the εF associated with the chosen format and εFb is the

εF associated with remaining in the station’s current format.36 As the estimate of σ is zero at the

lower bound estimate of θ1 , the estimated lower bound of repositioning costs paid is just θ1 . On the

other hand, the upper bound average sunk repositioning cost of switchers is much lower than θ1 . In

LA and Chicago the upper bound estimate is $11.5 million or 64% of annual revenues for the average
 36
      This expected value is estimated by simulation using the conditional choice probabilities estimated in the first stage.




                                                             35
station.     Total sunk repositioning costs paid, at the upper bound estimates, by format switchers

in LA and Chicago during the sample period are estimated to be $727 million.                      During the same

time period total revenues in these markets were around $16.3 billion. The average cost of reduced

revenues following the format switch was $1.9 million ($120 million total).

       These estimates of repositioning costs can be compared with the “back of the envelope” estimates

of the present discounted value of revenue gains accruing to switchers reported for 5 markets in Table

3. For Chicago, the estimated revenue gains per switcher was $29 million which is greater than the

upper bound estimate of sunk repositioning costs paid by switchers. This is not surprising as there

are several reasons for believing that the back of the envelope assumptions should lead to estimates

which are too high. For example, the marginal switcher should expect to gain fewer listeners than the

average switcher used in Table 3; a switcher may not expect to maintain its increase in share forever;

and, many of the observed switchers move to formats such as Spanish where listeners are less valuable

to advertisers.

       The upper bound estimates fall as market size decreases. This pattern is expected, as there is at

least as much switching in smaller markets as larger ones, even though station revenues are smaller.37

It also consistent with marketing costs being a large component of sunk repositioning costs as the

costs of advertising per listener share point will be higher in markets with larger populations.                    In

addition, a station may also have to market itself to a greater number of potential advertisers. On

the other hand, the costs of replacing staﬀ or programming libraries or of hiring format consultants

would seem likely to be similar across markets, suggesting that these costs are less important.

       I assume that fixed costs are only paid by stations in periods when they are on-air. The upper

bound estimate of these costs is identified from the fact that if they are too high then stations would

prefer to switch to Dark which we rarely see.38                In most of the market groups the upper bound
  37
     The lower bound estimates suggest that sunk switching costs are small in all markets (the second market group is
an exception) which would also explain why we can observe switching in smaller markets.
  38
     I assume that a station’s unobserved quality evolves in the same way when it is Dark as it does in active formats,
except that I assume that it does not experience the jump in quality in the second period following a switch. This
assumption also tends to make it less attractive for a station to switch to Dark.




                                                          36
estimate is around 66% of the revenues of the average station, being a slightly higher percentage in

smaller markets.      These estimates are consistent with measures of revenues and operating income

reported by publicly-traded radio companies.39

    The modelling assumption that a radio station’s costs do not vary with its listenership is not

quite right. Licensing fees for music and syndicated programming increase with station revenues.40

Although it is diﬃcult to identify stations’ marginal costs using only information on format choices

and revenues, the way in which the estimates of sunk repositioning costs would change if stations were

only to keep a proportion of any increase in revenues as profit is clear from inequalities (28)-(30). For

example, if 90% of any revenue increase is kept then the constants on the right-hand side of inequalities

would be multiplied by 0.9, reducing the estimated values of θ1 and σ.

    Table 10(b) shows how the estimated parameters change when quality transition specification

A is used, so that there is no systematic increase in unobserved station quality following a format

switch. As a result switching becomes less attractive and lower repositioning costs rationalize how rare

switching is. However, the change in the bounds of θ1 is relatively small. For example, in markets

with between 500,000 and 1 million people, the lower bound estimate of θ1 falls from $100,000 to

-$500,000 and the upper bound estimate falls from $10.3 million to $9.1 million.


6.6    Applications of the Model

While the richness of the estimated model prevents me from resolving it to conduct certain counter-

factuals (e.g., the eﬀects of a repositioning subsidy), it is possible to use the first stage estimates to

learn about some of the eﬀects of format switching and how sensitive format choices are to changes

in the environment (state space). I consider two examples here: first, how switching observed during

the sample period aﬀected listeners and revenues, and second, how sensitive positioning is to changes
  39
     For example, Clear Channel reported that operating income was 38% of revenues for its radio stations in its 2004
10-K filing. Cumulus, a radio company operating in medium-sized and smaller markets, reported that operating income
was 25% of revenues.
  40
     The performing rights agencies ASCAP, BMI and SESAC charge broadcast radio stations a proportion of their
revenues. For example, ASCAP charged stations with annual revenues above $150,000 a rate of 1.65% of revenues for
a blanket license in the late 1990s (http://www.ascap.com/licensing/radio/radiofaq.html). Syndicated programming is
typically sold by allowing the syndicator to sell a certain number of minutes of advertising time on a station.


                                                         37
in market demographics (relatively permanent demand shocks).


6.6.1      Eﬀects of Format Switching 1997-2006

I use the demand and quality transition estimates to estimate how listenership and revenues changed

due to observed format switching.         To be precise, I compare listenership and stations revenues in

Spring 2006 given observed format switching with a simulated estimate of what they would have been

if stations had remained in their Spring 1997 formats but market demographics had evolved in the

same way as they did in the data. I report changes in per period revenues (i.e., flows) rather than

discounted future values.

       The upper part of Table 11 shows the diﬀerence in listenership between these two scenarios for

seven demographic groups. In larger markets, observed format switching led to quite large increases

in the listenership of Hispanic and blacks, small increases for women and small decreases for whites

and people over 50. The increase in listenership of Hispanics is consistent with the 72% increase in

the number of Spanish language stations in the first three groups of markets. The increase in black

listenership may seem more surprising but it is explained by the 28% and 17% increases in the number

of Urban and Contemporary Hit Radio stations which are popular with blacks. The decline in older

listenership is explained by the decrease in the number of Other Music (e.g., Easy Listening, Variety,

Middle of the Road and Jazz) stations which attract mainly older listeners.

       Format switching caused broader increases in listenership in smaller markets.              This is because

there was more switching out of Dark (entry) in these markets and these switches unambiguously

increase the listenership of every demographic group.41

       The lower part of Table 11 shows how format switching eﬀects the revenues of switching and non-

switching stations. Berry and Waldfogel (1999) argue that when an additional station enters a radio

market listeners are taken from existing stations. This externality can lead to “excess entry”. On the

other hand, when a station switches between active formats it frequently only changes which group of
  41
    In the first two market groups there are 1 and 5 examples of stations moving from Dark, whereas there 33, 25, 25
and 47 cases respectively in the smaller market groups.



                                                        38
stations it takes listeners from. In larger markets, there is little switching from Dark (entry) so that

the increase in revenues for switchers is not associated with a significant net change in the revenues of

non-switchers. Figure 8 shows the distribution of changes in revenue for non-switchers in the second

group of markets, with stations facing more competition as a result of format switching tending to lose

revenues. In smaller markets there is more switching from Dark. The entering stations obviously gain

revenues, but their entry reduces the revenues of both non-switchers and stations switching between

active formats.


6.6.2    Sensitivity to Demand Shocks

I use observed station strategies to examine how sensitive format choices are to shocks in demand.

Table 4 (long diﬀerenced IV) shows that format availability does respond to the relatively slow changes

in market demographics seen in the data.42 Here, I illustrate the response implied by the estimated

policy function to a larger change in demand using the Minneapolis-St. Paul market as an example.

In Fall 2004 there were no Urban stations in this market and only a small (5.5%) black population.

I shock the market by making 20% of the white population black, and then simulate the model to see

how quickly we should expect stations to enter the Urban format.43 Based on the demographics of

the shocked market, a between market regression predicts that there should be 3.4 Urban stations.

    Figure 9 shows what happens to the number of Urban stations when I simulate the model for

twenty years 100 times. On average, there is one Urban station within 2 years, two Urban stations

within 4 years and three after 8 years. After this point, the number remains stable at between 3 and 4

stations. Thus, despite the presence of significant repositioning costs, the results suggest that format

availability adjusts quite rapidly to demand shocks. This relatively rapid adjustment is interesting

because many policy analyses (e.g., of mergers) considers whether repositioning could take place in a
  42
     Waldfogel (2003) also shows that there are more black (Hispanic)-orientated stations in markets with more blacks
(Hispanics) using cross-sectional data.
  43
     I assume that the growth rates of the black and white populations evolve from their pre-existing (i.e., non-shocked)
levels, so that there is not a massive spike in black growth. Of course, a limitation of this exercise is that the policy
function can only approximate station policies at points seen in the data. Once we step to points in the state space well
outside the range in the data, the approximations may be less reliable.

period of one to two years.



7    Conclusion

The last 15 years have seen considerable progress in modelling both static and dynamic consumer

demand for diﬀerentiated products.      However, there has been relatively little work modelling the

supply of diﬀerentiated products, and this is a potential problem for understanding the eﬀects of any

kind of shock which might lead to firms wanting to change the products that they oﬀer.

    I estimate a dynamic model of commercial radio markets which provides insights into what drives

product repositioning as well as estimates of how expensive repositioning is for firms and how it aﬀects

listeners. I find significant evidence of two types of repositioning cost. First, stations tend to receive

lower revenues per listener following a format switch.      This reduction is consistent with it taking

time for stations to develop relationships with a new set of advertisers. Second, there are sunk costs

associated with switching. There are many potential sources of these costs, such as marketing, hiring

format consultants, replacing staﬀ or updating the station’s programming library, but the fact that

they are larger in larger markets suggests that marketing costs may be the most important.            For

stations which choose to switch formats these costs could be as large as one year’s revenues, but these

costs are not large enough to prevent markets adjusting quite quickly to changes in demand.

    The quantitative results are specific to the commercial radio industry which is one of the industries

where the antitrust authorities have considered whether repositioning could constrain market power

following mergers.   More generally, the paper provides a framework for examining repositioning in

any industry with evolving product variety.     The framework can handle many firms and numerous

types of product which appeal to diﬀerent kinds of consumer.

    Understanding the potential role of repositioning following mergers was one of the primary moti-

vations for this paper. My results suggest that radio stations may only switch formats if they expect

to realize quite significant gains. However, it is important to acknowledge that multi-product own-

multi-product firms and I do not model how firms expect product ownership to change in the future.

Modelling multiproduct firms in a more sophisticated way and estimating how mergers aﬀect product

selection through market power, business cannibalization and economies of scope, both within and

across markets, are important topics for future research.

A      Details of the Forward Simulation Procedure

In this Appendix I describe the forward simulation procedure which I use to calculate the components

of stations’ expected future payoﬀs.


A.1     Simulations Using Actual Station Strategies

The simulation procedure goes through the following steps in each time period.


    1. the random coeﬃcients demand model is solved, given station formats, qualities and market

       demographics, to give the listenership of each station in each of the 18 demographic groups. I

       use 10 Halton draws per demographic group for the viF s;


    2. the estimated revenue function is used to calculate discounted revenues for the station of interest.

       These are added to the sum of discounted revenues from previous periods. The calculation is

       done assuming that the station is independently owned. If the station is not Dark a discounted

       indicator is added to the count of how many periods the station has been on-air. This count is

       used in calculating expenditure on fixed costs;


    3. the variables which aﬀect the multinomial logit format choice problem for each station are

       calculated. These include measures of competition and demographics which may have changed

       since the previous period. All stations are assumed to be independently owned;


    4. the multinomial logit choice probabilities for each station are calculated and compared with

       random draws from a uniform distribution to simulate a choice for each station;


    5. if the station of interest switches to an active format, a discounted indicator is added to the

       count of how many times it has switched formats. The choice probabilities are used to calculate

       the expected discounted value of the εF s associated with its format choice. The multinomial




                                                    47
      logit structure of its problem gives this expected value a convenient analytic form



                              E(εf |f chosen,S,ς s ) = 0.57721 − log(Pr f s (S,ς s ))                   (33)



      where Prf s is the probability that format f is chosen by station s given observed state space S

      and strategies ς s .


  6. the evolution of station qualities, conditional on current and previous format choices, is sim-

      ulated.    The random components are drawn from the appropriate empirical distribution of

      observed quality innovations;


  7. the evolution of demographics is simulated, by assuming that the same growth rate applies to

      each of the demographic groups of the same ethnicity/race.           The census data only provides

      annual changes in growth rates, so I also only simulate changes in annual growth rates every

      two periods, assuming that the same growth rate applies within two periods each year; and,


  8. station formats are updated.


   As some stations only switch formats with low probability, one would need many simulations to

get even a small number of simulations where the station switches formats.              Therefore, I simulate

the expected payoﬀs from making each format choice in the first period 20 times and weight these

simulations using the first period choice probabilities.       Each simulated path goes forward for 60

periods with a discount factor of 0.95. Results are similar using paths of 80 periods.


A.2    Simulations Using Alternative Station Strategies

The alternative strategies involve changing the conditional choice probabilities of the station of interest.

The strategies of other stations remain the same as before. Therefore the only change to the above

procedure is that in step 4, I recalculate the choice probabilities for the station of interest according

to the alternative policy that I am using.

quarters

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. **,*** denote statistical significance at the 5%,1% levels respectively. Regressions use data from the first and last
quarters in which the market is observed in the Arbitron ratings data and include quarter and market-format fixed effects. The pooled regression include
format x quarter and format x demographic interactions.
I instrument for the Out of Market Share variable in the following way: I calculate the average (across quarters) share of listening in each market to stations
which are home to every other market. I then find each station's average (across quarters) share of listening in its home market. I multiply these two
numbers together to calculate the predicted share of each out of market station. I then add the predicted shares of all of the out of market stations in a
format to create the instrument. This instrument implicitly assumes that an out of market station's choice of format does not depend on the number of
home market stations in a format. This is a reasonable assumption for most markets in the data, as out of market stations with significant listenership
are typically based in much larger markets and their format choices are unlikely to be affected by the decisions of stations in smaller markets. For example,
several Boston stations have significant share of listenership in Worcester, MA, but only a small proportion of their listeners come from Worcester.
Worcester stations have few listeners in Boston, so the format choices of Boston stations are unlikely to be influenced by those of Worcester stations.
