What Do Small Businesses Do?

                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper, we show that most small business owners are very different from the entrepreneurs that
economic models and policy makers often have in mind. Using new data that samples early stage entrepreneurs
just prior to business start up, we show that few small businesses intend to bring a new idea to market.
Instead, most intend to provide an existing service to an existing market. Further, we find that most
small businesses have little desire to grow big or to innovate in any observable way. We show that
such behavior is consistent with the industry characteristics of the majority of small businesses, which
are concentrated among skilled craftsmen, lawyers, real estate agents, doctors, small shopkeepers,
and restaurateurs. Lastly, we show non pecuniary benefits (being one’s own boss, having flexibility
of hours, etc.) play a first-order role in the business formation decision. We then discuss how our
findings suggest that the importance of entrepreneurial talent, entrepreneurial luck, and financial frictions
in explaining the firm size distribution may be overstated. We conclude by discussing the potential
policy implications of our findings.

1.     Introduction

Economists and policy makers alike have long been interested in the effects of various economic

policies on business ownership. In fact, the U.S. Small Business Administration is a federally

funded agency whose sole purpose is to help Americans “start, build, and grow businesses.”

Researchers and policy makers often either explicitly or implicitly equate small business owners

with “entrepreneurs.” While this association could be tautological, we show the typical small

business owner is often very different than the entrepreneur that economic models and policy

makers have in mind.       For example, economic theory usually considers entrepreneurs as

individuals who (1) innovate and render aging technologies obsolete (Schumpeter, 1942), (2)

take economic risks (Knight (1921); Kihlstrom and Laffont (1979); Kanbur (1979), and

Jovanovic (1979)), or (3) are considered jacks-of-all-trades in the sense that they have a broad

skill set (Lazear, 2005). Policy makers often consider entrepreneurs to be job creators or the

engines of economic growth.

       In this paper we shed light on what the vast majority of small businesses actually do and,

further, what they report ex-ante wanting to do. The paper proceeds in six parts.      We begin by

highlighting the industrial breakdown of small business within the US.      When referring to small

businesses, we primarily refer to firms with between 1 and 19 employees which employs roughly

20 percent of the private sector workforce.     However, throughout our analysis, we also define

alternative classifications such as firms with between 1 and 100 employees. As we show in this

section, over two-thirds of all small businesses are confined to just 40 narrow 4-digit NAICS

industries. All of these industries are ones where participants provide a relatively standardized

good or service to an existing customer base.      Specifically, these industries primarily include

skilled craftsmen (e.g., plumbers, electricians, contractors, painters), skilled professionals (e.g.,


                                                                                                   1
lawyers, accountants, and architects), insurance and real estate agents, doctors, dentists,

mechanics, beauticians, restaurateurs, and small shop keepers (e.g., gas station owners and

grocery store owners). Although there is still substantial within industry heterogeneity in size,

we show these industries have a disproportionate share of small businesses. This composition of

small businesses foreshadows our subsequent empirical results.

        In Section 3 of the paper, we study job creation and innovation at small and/or new firms.

First, using a variety of data sets, we show that most surviving small businesses do not grow by

any significant margin. Most firms start small and stay small throughout their entire lifecycle.2

Also, most surviving small firms do not innovate along any observable margin. We show that

very few small firms report spending resources on research and development, getting a patent, or

even copywriting or trade marking something related to the business (including the company’s

name). Furthermore, we show that nearly half of all new businesses report providing an existing

good or service to an existing market.          This is not surprising in light of the most common small

businesses. A new plumber or a new lawyer who opens up a practice often does so in an area

where existing plumbers and existing lawyers already operate.

        Most of the existing research attributes differences across firms with respect to ex-post

performance to either differences in financing constraints facing the firms (e.g., Evans and

Jovanovic (1989) and Clementi and Hopenhayn (2006)), differences in ex-post productivity

draws across the firms (e.g., Bonini and Simon (1958), Jovanovic (1982), Pakes and Ericson

(1989), Hopenhayn (1992)), or differences in entrepreneurial ability of the firms owners (e.g.,

Lucas (1978)). In Section 4, we use new data which samples nascent small business owners

2
  Haltiwanger et al. (2010) show that controlling for firm age there is no systematic relationship between firm size
and growth. They conclude that the small firms that tend to grow fast (relative to large firms) are those newly
established small firms. We discuss how our results add to these findings in later sections. In particular, we show
that most surviving new firms also do not grow in any meaningful way.
                                                                                                                  2
about their expectations for the business in the future to show that these stories are incomplete.

When asked at the time of their business formation, most business owners report having no

desire to grow big and no desire to innovate along observable dimensions. In other words, when

starting their business, the plumber and lawyer do so while expecting to remain small well into

the foreseeable future and with little expectation to innovate by developing a new product or

service or even enter new markets with an existing product or service.

       If most small businesses do not want to grow or do not want to innovate, why do they

start? We address this question in Section 5. Again, we use a new data set that samples nascent

business owners at the time they were starting their business that specifically asks about motives

and expectations. We find that over 50 percent of new businesses reported that non pecuniary

benefits were the primary reason as to why they started their business. Non pecuniary benefits

included answers such as “wanting flexibility over schedule” or “to be one’s own boss”. By

comparison, only 34 percent of respondents reported that they were starting the business to

generate income and only 40 percent indicated that they were starting a business because they

wanted to create a new product or because they had a good business idea. Using the panel nature

of the data, we show that those small businesses that started for other than innovative reasons

were less likely to subsequently grow, less likely to report wanting to grow, less likely to

subsequently innovate, and less likely to report wanting to innovate.

       Collectively, these results suggest that there are other first order reasons why small

businesses form aside from the innovation or growth motives which are embedded in most

theories of entrepreneurship. For example, non pecuniary benefits of small business ownership

may be an important driver of why firms start and remain small. Additionally, some industries

may have a natural size of production at an establishment level that is quite low (e.g., insurance

                                                                                                3
agent).     In Section 6 of the paper, we discuss how our results challenge much of the existing

work on entrepreneurship and small firm dynamics. In particular, we highlight how our findings

suggest that the importance of entrepreneurial talent, entrepreneurial luck, and financial frictions

in explaining the firm size distribution may be overstated.              In the last section of the paper, we

discuss the policy implications of our results.

          The work discussing the diversity of motives and expectations among small businesses in

developing economies is more extensive than for developed economies.3                       Recent work by La

Porta and Shleifer (2008) and Banerjee and Duflo (2011) show that most small businesses in

developing economies do not grow or innovate in any observable way. In the latter sections, we

also discuss how the qualitatively similar outcomes we observe are driven by different forces

than in developing economies.

          Overall, our results show that there is substantial skewness among small businesses

within the U.S both in actual and expected growth and innovation behavior. Most small

businesses do not want to grow or innovate which are the usual cornerstones of most of these

entrepreneurial models and policy justifications. Our results suggest that it is often inappropriate

for researchers and policy makers to use the universe of small business (or self employment) data

to test standard theories of entrepreneurship. Researchers and policy makers interested in testing

theories of entrepreneurship may need to use more specialized data sets like the ones that track

small businesses seeking venture capital funding because these firms have been shown to be

  Two notable exceptions include Bhide (2000) and Ardagna and Lusardi (2008). Bhide (2000) examines the
attributes of the founders of many successful firms and concludes that the actions and behaviors of the founders are
an important determinant of firm growth.         Ardagna and Lusardi (2008) use survey data from the Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) to show that there are demographic differences between those individuals who
report starting a business because they had a good business opportunity or other business owners.
                                                                                                                  4
more likely to actually grow or innovate relative to other small businesses.4 Additionally, policy

makers wanting to promote growth and innovation may want to consider more targeted policies

as opposed to creating policies that target the universe of small businesses.


2.       Industrial Composition of Small Businesses

The goal of this section is to show that most small businesses are concentrated in a small number

of 4-digit NAICS industries that mostly provide standard services to local customers. This

context is important when interpreting our findings that the majority of small businesses do not

intend to grow or innovate in any substantive way.

         To examine the types of small businesses that exist within the U.S., we use data from the

Statistics of U.S. Businesses (SUSB) compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau.5 To create these

statistics the Census compiles data extracted from the Business Register, which contains the

Census Bureau’s most current and consistent data for U.S. business establishments. 6 The data

cover most U.S. firms with at least one paid employee.                   Below, we discuss how our results

would extend if we included information from the non-employer firms. We focus our attention

on the statistics from the years 2003 to 2007, all of which are coded using the NAICS 2002

industry definitions; additional data from the Economic Census are also available for 2007.

However, it should be noted that our results are nearly identical if we pick any year between

1998 and 2008. Throughout the paper we classify business size by total firm employment in


4
   Some papers in the literature take this approach. See, for example, recent work by Kaplan and Lerner (2009),
Puri and Zarutskie (2010), and Hall and Woodward (2010). As shown by Puri and Zarutskie (2010), firms who seek
venture capital funding are much more likely to grow than the universe of remaining firms.

   For a complete description of the data, see http://www.census.gov/econ/susb/.

  The Business Register is updated continuously and incorporates data from the Census Bureau’s economic censuses
and current business surveys, quarterly and annual Federal tax records, and other departmental and federal statistics.
The data includes information from all NAICS industries aside from crop and animal production; rail transportation;
National Postal Service; pensions, welfare, and vacation funds; trusts, estates, and agency accounts; private
households; and public administration.
                                                                                                                    5
order to exclude large firms operating many small establishments.7 For most purposes in this

section, we refer to "small businesses" as those businesses with between 1 and 20 employees,

although we consider alternative definitions based on different employment size cutoffs.

        As is already well known, small businesses are a very large fraction of the population of

employer firms. In Figure 1, we use the SUSB data from 2007 to construct the cumulative

distribution function for firm size using several measures of economic activity. In 2007, there

were roughly 6 million firms with paid employment; 90 percent of these firms had fewer than 20

employees.      These firms comprised 20 percent of aggregate paid employment and about 15

percent of sales receipts and payroll. The conclusions only change slightly if we look at firms

with fewer than 100 employees. The additional firms with between 20 and 99 employees

represent an additional 8 percent of all employer firms and 15 percent of aggregate employment.

        Next we study the concentration of small businesses with paid employees at very fine

levels of industry classifications. These results yield two important messages. First, most small

businesses are concentrated in a few detailed industry classifications. Second, within these few

detailed industries, the distribution of employment across all firm sizes is different than the

overall distribution for all other industries.        Most of the industries in which small businesses

reside are also industries in which a disproportionate amount of economic activity takes place in

small firms.

        We start by taking the universe of all employer firms with fewer than 20 employees.

Within these small firms, we rank the represented 4-digit industries by a crude measure of




7
 A firm (termed enterprise) may consist of many establishments, which are distinct locations of business activity.
For example, the Starbucks corporation operates thousands of small establishments. Given our focus on total firm
employment, we do not treat the individual Starbucks establishments as small businesses.
                                                                                                                6
concentration, namely each industry’s share out of the set of small firms.8                 Specifically, we

define:

                                                         sj
                                                 xj 
                                                        s
                                                        j
                                                              j




where sj is the number of small businesses in industry j and xj is the share of small businesses in

industry j out of all small businesses (regardless of industries).                This measure gives the

importance of a given industry out of the universe of all small businesses with fewer than 20

employees. There are 294 four-digit NAICS industries in the SUSB data; industries are ranked

from 1 to 294, with the industry with the largest xj being ranked 1.

          Figure 2 shows the cumulative sum of xj across each of the 4-digit industries by rank.

For example, the first twenty 4-digit industries account for just about 50 percent of all firms with

fewer than 20 employees. In other words, when talking about small businesses, roughly half of

them fall into only 20 narrowly defined 4-digit industries.                The top 40 4-digit industries

comprise two-thirds of all firms with fewer than 20 employees. The employment shares for the

top 20 industries and the top 40 industries (out of all employment in firms with fewer than 20

employees) were also nearly 50 percent and 65 percent, respectively.

          Table 1 lists those top forty 4-digit industries ranked by xj. Again, two-thirds of all small

businesses in 2007 are in one of these forty 4-digit industries.         As seen from the list, most small

business are either restaurants (full service, limited service, or bars), skilled professionals

(doctors, dentists, lawyers, accountants, architects, consultants), skilled craftsmen (general

contractors, plumbers, electricians, mason workers, painters, roofers),                professional service


8
  The national SUSB data are available at the 6-digit level of aggregation. Without much loss of generality, we
aggregate these data to a 4-digit level of aggregation.
                                                                                                             7
provides (clergy, insurance agents, real estate agents, and travel agents), general service

providers (auto repair, building services such as landscaping, barbers/beauticians), or small

retailers (grocery stores, gas stations, pharmacies, and clothing stores).

       These results are robust to alternative cuts of the data. If we extended our classification

to the top sixty 4-digit industries (which comprise over 80 percent of all firms with fewer than 20

employees), the type of industries in which small businesses reside are not altered.     The firms

ranked 41 to 60 are similar in spirit to those in the top 40. For example, they include dry

cleaners, office supply stores, hardware stores, jewelry stores, auto dealers, liquor stores,

furniture stores, and the like.   Additionally, if we extend our results to those firms with fewer

than 100 employees, our results are very similar. The 40 industries listed in Table 1 also

represent 66 percent of the firms and 61 percent of the employment in firms with fewer than 100

employees.

       One concern may be that the important small business industries may reflect the overall

size of the industry rather than the role of small businesses within the industry. In fact, the bulk

of small businesses are concentrated in industries where a disproportionate amount of

employment is concentrated in small firms. For example, looking within the skilled craftsmen

industries, 48 percent of all employment (on average) is in firms with between 1 and 20

employees. Notices, this figure is much larger than the 20 percent of employment that is in firms

with between 1 and 20 employees for the entire economy (as shown in Figure 1).

       To better document the relationship between the importance of an industry within small

businesses and the amount of activity that takes place within small firms within that that




                                                                                                  8
industry, we present Figure 3.9 The x-axis of Figure 3 are deciles based upon x j , the number of

small firms within a given industry out of all small firms in the economy. As in Figure 2 and

Table 1, we define small firms as those firms with between 1-19 employees.                           However, the

patterns we show are broadly consistent if we define small firms to have between 1 and 99

employees.       The y-axis of Figure 3 is the within industry share of employment in small firms

relative to all employment in the industry averaged across the industries in the decile. Formally,

we define the within industry share of employment in small firms as:

                                                             e sj
                                                      yj 
                                                             e nj

where e sj is the number of employees in small businesses within industry j and e nj is the number

of employees in all businesses (regardless of size) within industry j. The figure is drawn using

data from 2007. The results of Figure 3 show that industries that comprise the bulk of small

businesses (i.e., they have a high xj) are also industries where more of the employment within the

industry is in small firms (have a high yj). The top decile of industries with respect to xj is

comprised of the first 29 industries documented in Table 1. These industries comprise about 60

percent of the number of small businesses and about 60 percent of the employment within small

businesses.      For these industries, about 40 percent of employment within the industry, on

average, is in small firms. As seen from Figure 1, only about 20 percent of employment across

all industries is in small firms. The high x j industries are skewed toward small firms. As x j

falls and the industries become less important as a fraction of all small businesses, the scale of

these industries, for the most part, monotonically increases.

9
  We also performed a different set of robustness results. In particular, we made a measure of the importance of
small businesses in industry j out of all small businesses adjusting for the importance of industry j out of all firms
regardless of size. The patterns in Table 1 and Figures 1-3 were robust to this adjustment.
                                                                                                                    9
        A few other comments can be made about Figure 3. First, the top three deciles of xj

contain roughly 90 4-digit industries that comprise roughly 85 percent of all small businesses.

Even the industries in the second and third deciles have within industry employment (yj) that is

skewed toward small firms. Second, the difference between the average yj for the industries

within the first decile is statistically different from the average yj for the industries within all

other deciles. For example, the p-value of the difference between the first and the second deciles

is 0.017 and the p-value of the difference between the first and fourth deciles is < 0.001.

Likewise, the p-value of the difference between the average yi for the second and third deciles

relative to the fourth decile is about 0.03. This figure suggests that it may not be surprising that

most small firms do not grow nor report wanting to grow given that most small firms are in

industries where the observed scale of production is quite low.

        Our analysis in this section focuses on employer firms, which have at least one paid

employee. Most firms within the U.S., however, are non-employer firms. In 2007, for example,

there were 21.7 million zero employee firms which represented roughly 78% of all firms. Often,

these are second businesses or independent consultants who report self employment income on

their Federal income tax returns. As a result, despite their importance in the number of firms,

the non-employers collectively represent less than 4 percent of all sales or receipts within the

U.S. during a given year.10 Because many of the existing datasets, exclude the non-employers

from their analysis, it is hard to systematically analyze their composition.               Recently, however,

the U.S. Census has released data that segments the non-employer firms both in numbers and

receipts by broad industry classifications.11           We summarize this data for 2007 in Appendix


10
   Even though they are currently small, the non-employers are an important source of future paid employee firms.
Many eventual employer firms start outs and non-employers. See Davis et al. (2007) for a more detailed discussion.

employer firms are in a handful of industries where the bulk of production takes place in small

firms. As a result, we feel our broad results extend to the inclusion of the non-employer firms.

       The major take away from this section is that most small businesses are from a limited set

of narrowly defined industries where more of the industries’ economic activity takes place in

small firms. As we discuss in later sections of the paper, these industries usually do not match

the theoretical models of "entrepreneurship" that is usually put forth in the literature.

       Before proceeding, we wish to acknowledge that even within the industries where most

small businesses are located there are many firms that are still quite large. John Haltiwanger, in

his discussion of our paper that follows, emphasizes this point. Any theory focusing on the

distribution of firm size needs to account for the fact that (1) most small businesses are

concentrated in a small set of industries, (2) the fraction of employment in small businesses

within these small business intensive industries (y) is higher than in other industries, and (3) even

within the small business intensive industries, there are still many large firms.     We emphasize

the first two points while Haltiwanger emphasizes the third.


3. Ex-Post Small Business Growth and Innovation

A.     Small Business Growth

It is well documented that there is heterogeneity in the extent to which small businesses grow

across observable factors such as firm size or firm age. Most recently, Haltiwanger et al. (2010)

find, that there is little relationship between firm size and firm growth conditional on firm age.

Employment growth is driven by young firms, who also happen to be small.           In this section, we

use some new and existing data sets to illustrate some additional facts about the distribution of


                                                                                                   11
growth propensities across both small and young firms. Specifically, we show that even among

young firms and conditional on survival, growth is still rare overall.

       Tables 2a and 2b show data from the 2005 Business Dynamic Statistics (BDS). The BDS

is produced by the U.S. Census Bureau from longitudinal annual establishment-level

administrative data similar to the source data for the SUSB discussed above. The BDS provides

measures of gross job creation and destruction by firm size and age for the years 1977 through

2009. Sector level measures are available for the US, and overall measures are available by state.

Again, like the SUSB, the database only tracks the employment patterns of employer firms.

Table 2a shows the percent of businesses within different firm age categories that are businesses

with fewer than 20 employees. We do this for the entire economy (top row) and then separately

within different one digit sectors.

       Table 2a should be read as follows. In 2005, of all operating firms within the economy

that have survived fewer than ten years, 92 percent have fewer than 20 employees (column 1).

Within the construction sector (column 1, fourth row), 93.6 percent of operating “young” firms

have fewer than 20 employees. Table 2b shows the share of employment in firms with fewer

than 20 employees as opposed to the share of firms. The employment share exhibits similar

patterns: for example, firms with fewer than 20 employees have 44.8 percent of the total

employment for all firms who have been in existence for fewer than ten years.

       Tables 2a and 2b highlight two important facts. First, among mature firms (firms in

existence between ten and twenty-five years), most firms and much of the employment is in

firms with fewer than twenty employees. For example, across the economy as whole, small firms

represent nearly 90 percent of all firms and nearly 25 percent of all employment out of all firms



                                                                                               12
that have been in existence between ten and twenty-five years. Even well into their lifecycle, the

overwhelming majority of firms remain small.

        Second, similar to the results in the previous section, there is substantial variation among

industries. Relative to construction, very little of employment of mature firms is in small

businesses within the manufacturing industry (16 percent). Additional industries that include a

high concentration of the employment of mature firms being in small businesses include the

FIRE, wholesale trade, retail trade and service industries. Again, this is consistent with the

results from Table 1 and Figure 3. The heterogeneity in the firm size distribution across sectors

implies differences in dynamics by sector.

        To shed light on employment dynamics for firms of different ages and industries, we use

data from a variety of additional sources. We start by using data from the 2003 Survey of Small

Business Finances (SSBF).12 The SSBF is a random sample of businesses with fewer than 500

employees and was conducted by the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve. The

survey is designed to measure the financial position of these businesses. However, the survey

also contains other background questions. In 2003, firms were asked to state whether in the past

year the total employees within their business grew, remained the same, or contracted. Firms

were also asked the same question over a three-year horizon.

        The responses to these questions by small firms are shown in Table 3. Like above, we

define small firms as those firms with fewer than 20 employees. We break down the responses

by firm age to try to highlight differences between newer businesses and more established

businesses. The SSBF asks businesses to report how long the business has been in existence. As

seen from the table, the overwhelming majority of small firms do not grow by adding employees

12
  The SSBF was formerly known as the National Survey of Small Business Finances. It was a quinquennial survey
that began in 1983 and was last conducted in 2003.
                                                                                                           13
year to year or even over three-year periods.13 Not conditioning on firm age, only 14 percent of

surviving small businesses added an employee between 2002 and 2003 and only 21 percent

added employees between 2000 and 2003. Taking the converse, roughly 80 percent of surviving

small firms did not grow at all over a relatively long three year period. The percentages are

slightly higher among newer firms. However, even among small firms which have been in

existence between 1 and 10 years, only 19 percent grew between 2002 and 2003 and only 28

percent grew between 2000 and 2003. These data show that while most aggregate employment

growth may come from small (new) firms growing big, the vast majority of small (new) firms do

not grow, even over longer horizons.

        Within the modest share of growing firms, the SSBF data does not tell us by how much

the firms grew. To assess this question, we turn to the Kauffman Firm Survey (KFS). The KFS

is a panel study of 4,928 businesses that were newly founded in 2004 administered by the

Kauffman Foundation.14           As shown in Haltiwanger et al. (2010), it is the new firms that

contribute, on average, to job growth. Yet, as we have just shown, this is rare for typical small

businesses. While much employment growth is due to new firms, it is not true that most new

businesses generate employment growth. To create the KFS sample, researchers began with a

sample frame of nearly 250,000 new businesses started in 2004 provided by the Dun and

Bradstreet database.      From this data, the KFS oversampled businesses in high tech industries

and businesses for whom research and development employment in the primary business

industry was high. The final sample admits 4,928 firms, which are re-surveyed annually in


13
   We exclude newly founded firms that are unable to answer the employment change question because they did not
exist in the base year. The firms responding to the 1 year change question are at least 1 year old, and the firms
responding to the 3 year change question are at least 3 years old.

follow up interviews. Currently, public use data is available on these firms up through 2009. For

the work below, we only focus on those firms that have survived through 2008. There were

2,617 such firms in the data.    When using the KFS data, we use the survey weights proved

which are designed to make the firms in the sample representative of all new firms in the

economy.

       Because the KFS is a four year panel, we can assess the growth rate of employment for

new businesses within the KFS over four years. In each wave of the survey, the KFS asks firms

to report the number of their employees. Column I of Table 4 shows that between 2004 and

2008, 41.9 percent of the surviving firms in the KFS reported growing the total number of

employees within their business. In columns 2 and 3 of Table 4, we show the fraction of new

surviving businesses who added more than 5 employees (column 2) and 10 employees (column

3) between 2004 and 2008. While about forty percent of the surviving new firms within the KFS

added employees, very few added more than one or two employees. Specifically, 60 percent of

all new firms in this sample did not add an employee, 90 percent added fewer than 5 employees,

and 97 percent added fewer than 10 employees.

       The results from the KFS hold more broadly in the U.S. We find that small businesses

within the top small business industries (i.e, the ones documented in Table 1) actually have lower

than average job creation rates. To see this we pool employment change data from the SUSB

from the years 2003 to 2006. These data are released as a companion to the levels reported in the

SUSB annual data. Using the same administrative data, the Census Bureau measures the number

of jobs created (either from expanding or new establishments) or destroyed (either from

contracting or exiting establishments) at the establishment level and aggregates these into annual



                                                                                               15
measures of gross job creation and destruction by industry and firm size.15 At the 4-digit industry

level, we compute for each size category the gross job creation rate, the gross job birth rate, and

the gross job destruction rate. We split job creation into jobs created at continuing establishments

(the gross job creation rate) and jobs created at opening establishment (the gross job birth rate).

The job destruction rate reflects job loss at both contracting or exiting establishments. We follow

Davis, et al. (1996) and define these rates as follows:

                                                                M sjt
                                               jt 
                                             g Ms
                                                      (e sj ,t  e sj ,t 1 ) / 2

where     M sjt represents a measure of job creation or destruction (either jobs created from

expansion, jobs created from births, or overall jobs destroyed from contracting and exiting

establishments) for small businesses, s, within industry j between period t and t  1 , and e sjt is

defined as above to be the number of employees in small businesses within industry j during

period t. Consistent with our earlier definition, we define small businesses to be those firms with

between 1 and 20 employees.            Davis, et al. (1996) show that this form of growth rate has a

number of desirable properties: it accommodates entry and exit, and is equivalent to a log

difference up to second order.

        We use these growth rates to ask whether or not industries that comprise a large fraction

of small businesses can predict the degree of job creation or destruction for small businesses

within that industry, conditional on aggregate industry characteristics. To do this, we estimate

the following:


15
  The distinction between firms (referred to as enterprises by the Census Bureau) and establishments is important.
The SUSB data report expansions (contractions) by firm size, by measuring the employment changes at the
establishment level. If the Starbucks Corporation opens 100 new stores in a year and closes 50, the gross job
creation and destruction from the establishment births and deaths (as well as from continuing establishments) would
be attributed to the 2500+ firm size category.
                                                                                                                16
                                          jt   0   1 x j  Z j  t   jt
                                        g Ms                                 s




where g Ms
        jt takes one of three different measures, depending on the regression, representing

either the gross job creation rate, the gross job birth rate, or the gross job destruction rate for

firms of small firms in industry j. These measures are define above. Likewise, as above, xj

represents the share of small businesses in industry j out of all small business across all

industries. This measure is the same as what was summarized in Figure 2 and Table 1. Zj is a

vector of industry level controls and μt is a vector of year dummies. The industry level controls

include industry wide measures of gross job creation rate, the gross job birth rate, and the gross

job destruction rate. The sample for this regression is all 4-digit industries with non-missing

measures of M sjt during the 2003-2006 period.                 This gives us 929 observations for the small

business gross job creation regressions, 666 observations for the small business gross job birth

rate regression, and 656 observations for the small business gross job destruction regression.

The difference in sample sizes is due to more missing data for the measures of births and job

destruction relative to job creation at the 4-digit industry level.

        Table 5 reports the estimation results. We estimate each specification first where each

industry is equally weighted and second where each industry is weighted in proportion to its

share of small businesses. The weighted estimation is similar to a grouped data estimator and

would deliver the same point estimates as firm level data if each small firms employment share

within an industry were equal.16 The results support our earlier claims that the "typical" small

business does not create jobs. The small business share of an industry has little to say about small

business job creation through new small businesses or small business job destruction (columns 4

16
  This is a reasonable approximation since all firms have fewer than 20 employees, so there would be very little
variation in the employment share within an industry if this were estimated with the underlying administrative micro
data.
                                                                                                                 17
and 5 of Table 5). However, it is a powerful predictor of weaker than average small business job

creation for existing firms (columns 1-3 of Table 5). The most common small businesses (those

with a high xj shown in Table 1) grow slower than average. These results hold even controlling

for each industry’s overall characteristics (comparing column 1 vs. column 2 of Table 5). One

may be concerned that that the difference between the strong effects for job creation relative to

the no effects found for job births and job destruction could stem from differences in the samples

across the regression. Column 3 of Table 5 shows such concerns are unwarranted. In this

regression, we restrict the job creation regression to only include observations that had non-

missing job births and job destruction. The job creation results are unaltered with this additional

sample restriction.

       According the to the weighted results, for each percentage point increase in the share of

small businesses, an industry's small business job creation rate falls by a little less than three-

quarters of a percentage point. To provide greater context, a one-standard deviation increase in

xj (1.1 percentage points) reduces the job creation rate by roughly 0.8 percentage points.      The

average weighted job creation rate for the sample was 14.6 percent.              So, a one-standard

deviation increase in the industry share of small businesses reduces the small business job

creation rate by about 6 percent (0.8 divided by 14.6). When industries are treated equally, a one

standard deviation increase in xj reduces the industry small business job creation rate by roughly

8 percent. All the results are robust to alternative specifications of industry controls.

       It may initially be surprising that so little job creation comes from the industries that most

small business owners are likely to enter. However it is consistent with an understanding of the

important heterogeneity among small businesses.        Most small businesses (those highlighted in

Table 1) start small and stay small throughout the life of their business. Collectively, we can

                                                                                                  18
conclude three things from the results in Tables 2-5. First, there is substantial skewness across

firms in the extent to which they grow over time. While some firms do grow (in terms of the

number of employees) over time, most do not. Only a small portion of small firms add a more

than ten employees over the life of their business.      To this end, the bulk of employment in

mature firms is still concentrated in firms with fewer than 20 employees. Second, even among

new or young firms, most firms do not grow by any meaningful amount, even conditional on

survival. Finally, a portion of the heterogeneity in employment growth for small firms is

explained by industry.    While many mature businesses in manufacturing are quite large, most

mature businesses in other industries like construction remain quite small. The industries that

tend to remain small are the industries that tend to comprise the bulk of small businesses.

       We wish again to stress that even within these small business intensive industries there is

considerable heterogeneity and skewness. The focus of this paper is on the behavior of small

firms, which in our selected small business intensive industries account for nearly half of the

employment. John Haltiwanger, in his discussion of this paper that follows, looks closely at the

other half. It turns out that in many of these industries where employment in small firms is

overrepresented, the firms within these industries can also be more dynamic than average. In

retail trade, for example, the industry is composed of local shopkeepers and big box stores. In

the retail trade industry, job creation was almost 10 percentage points higher than average over

the two year period from 2003 to 2005 relative to other industries. However, almost all of the job

creation was due to a relatively small number of high impact firms. The high degree of skewness,

especially in these industries, makes analyzing the averages very deceiving. As we show, the

typical (modal or median) small business is not creating jobs. In the last section, we return to the

potential implication of these findings for public policy.

                                                                                                 19
B.        Small Business Innovation

In this sub-section, we document that there is also substantial heterogeneity across firms in the

extent to which they successfully innovate along observable measures.         Again, while some

authors have shown that a large share of measured innovation (patent applications for example)

is attributed to small businesses, the converse is not true.17 Most small firms do not seem to

innovate along those observable margins. Before proceeding, we want to stress that it is hard to

measure all aspects of potential small business innovation via the surveys we are analyzing.   As

a result, we focus on some broad measures of innovation that are asked of firms within the

surveys.

          We begin by documenting the fact that very few new firms innovate via patent,

trademarks, or copyrights during the first 4 or 5 years of their existence using two data sources.

First, we continue our use of the Kaufman Firm Survey focusing on the same sample as above.

The KFS survey asks respondents to report separately whether they have already applied or are

in the process of applying for any patents, copyrights, or trademarks. We focus on the responses

in 2008 when the firms have been in business for four years already. These results using the

2008 data from the KFS are shown in Table 6. Within the first four years of business, only 2.7

percent of the businesses in the sample had already applied or were in the process of applying for

patents. Copyright and trademark usage is slightly higher but still most firms do not innovate at

least according to these crude observable measures. According to the KFS, nearly 85 percent of

small businesses did not acquire a patent, trademark or copyright during their first four years of

existence.

         We augment our analysis of patents and other measure of innovation using data from the

Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics II (PSED).18                         The PSED started with a nationally

representative sample of 34,000 individuals during the fall of 2005 and the early winter of 2006.

An initial screening survey identified 1,214 "nascent entrepreneurs". To be considered a nascent

entrepreneur, individuals had to meet the following four criteria. First, the individual had to

currently consider themselves as involved in the firm creation process. Second, they had to have

engaged in some start up activity in the past twelve months. Third, they had to expect to own all

or part of the new firm. Finally, the initiative, at the time of the initial screening survey, could

not have progressed to the point that it could have been considered an operating business. The

goal was to sample individuals who were in the process of establishing a new business.

         In the winter of 2006, after the initial screening interview, the 1,214 respondents that had

been initially identified as being in the process of starting a business were surveyed about a wide

variety of the activities associated with their business start up. As part of the first real interview,

respondents were asked detailed questions about their motivation for starting the business, the

current activities undertaken as part of the start up process, the competitive environment in

which the business would take place, and their expectation of desired future business size and

activities.      Follow up interviews occurred annually for 4 years so that the data has a panel

dimension. When analyzing the PSED data, we use three samples. The first is a sample of all

1,214 PSED respondents. The second sample is the 602 respondents who actually had positive

revenues during their first interview in 2006. This latter sample distinguishes people who only

said that they were planning to start a business from those who actually followed through and

  There was an early wave of the PSED (PSED I) that was a test run for the bigger PSED II. We do not use the initial data in

engaged in some market business activity.       The third sample is the 162 respondents who had

positive revenues from the same business venture in 2010, four years after the first interview.

       In terms of innovation activity, the PSED asks three different types of questions. First,

the PSED respondents were asked a similar question as the KFS respondents with respect to

patent, trademark, and copyright application. However, instead of being asked about the three

measures separately, they were asked one joint question. As seen from the PSED data in Table

7, only between 5 and 6 percent of the new firms applied for patents, trademarks, and copyrights

during their first few years in existence. By the fifth year of operation, surviving firms appear

similar to those in the KFS with roughly 17 percent having obtained a patent, trademark or

copyright.

       Of course patents, copyrights, and trademarks are imperfect measures of innovation.

Many firms can innovate without applying for a patent, and many firms can trademark their

company name without doing any real innovation.        We focus first on these measures because

they are easily observable in both the KFS and the PSED.           The PSED, however, also has

broader measures of innovation. In a separate set of question, businesses were asked directly

whether they have "developed any proprietary technology, processes, or procedures". This is a

slightly broader measure of innovation than patent, trademark and copyright applications in that

it conceivably covers a more fluid set of activities that the business owner could relay about the

innovation in production or business model that is taking place within their business. Yet, only

between 6 and 8 percent of new businesses (depending on the sample) reported than they had

developed any proprietary business practices or technology during their first few years of




                                                                                                  22
business. Even conditional on survival five years later, 80 percent of firms still report not

developing any proprietary technology, process or procedure.19

        The PSED asks one last broad question about the potential innovation taking place within

the firm.     This question asks about how the product or service produced by the businesses

compares with the products and services of other producers within the market.                     Specifically,

PSED respondents were asked: “Right now, are there many, few, or no other businesses offering

the same products or services to your [intended] customers?” Respondents were allowed to

provide one of the following answers: many, few, or no other. This question is informative in

the sense that it states whether the firm is providing a new product or service to existing

customers or an existing product or service to potentially new customers.                    Across the three

samples, between 36 and 43 percent of new business owners report providing a similar service to

an existing customer base as existing firms in the market.              These businesses, more often than

not, provide a standardized service (e.g., plumbing) to existing local customers.                  Conversely,

Table 7 also shows that fewer than 20 percent of respondents reported that no one other business

was provided their expected product or service to their expected customer base.

        There was substantial variation in the response to this question across business owners in

different industries. For example, owners who reported starting a business in the professional,

health, construction and real estate industries, were between 7.5 and 9.5 percentage points more

likely to report saying that they were staring their business in an area where there were many

current providers of the service to their expected customer base.                    Owners in these same


19
  We should be wary of putting too much emphasis on self reports of innovative behavior by small businesses.
However, most behavior stories of how the business owners would respond to such questions would likely lead us to
believe that the innovation numbers are upper bounds on actual behavior. This would occur if the respondents were
more likely to report that they were innovative even if there was no actual innovation taking place within the
business.
                                                                                                              23
industries were nearly 10 percentage points less likely to report that they were providing a new

product or service or were targeting an underserved customer base.

4.     Ex-Ante Expectations About Growth and Innovation

In this section, we document that many business owners have no expectation or desire to grow or

innovate when they start their business. One of the strengths of the PSED data is that it asks the

nascent business owners about their expectations for the business, their desired future business

size, and for their motivations for starting the business.   For example, all new firms were asked

the following: “Which of the following two statements best describe your preference for the

future size of this new business: ‘I want this new business to be as large as possible’ or ‘I want a

size I can manage myself or with a few key employees’”.         The top row of Table 7 shows the

response to this question across our three different PSED samples.        For the sample of those

businesses who lasted to 2010, we report their expectations when they were first asked in 2006.

Nearly three quarters of all respondents, regardless of sample, reported they wanted to keep their

business small.

       Of course the meaning of a manageable size could vary across respondents. In a separate

part of the survey, the respondents were asked to provide their expectation as to the number of

employees that the firm would employ when the firm was 5 years old.           Again, we report the

responses for each sample when they were first asked in 2006.             The median number of

employees was between 3 or 4, depending on the sample. Even the 75th percentile of responses

was small as respondents only expected to employ between 6 and 10 employees. Not only do

very few small businesses grow, most of them do not want or expect to grow when they form

their new business.



                                                                                                 24
       The PSED also asks about expected innovative activity. Specifically, businesses where

asked, at the inception of starting their business, whether they expected to innovate in the future.

These results are also shown in Table 8. For example, only roughly 10 percent of all new

businesses reported that they plan to develop proprietary technology, processes, or procedures in

the future. The numbers are slightly higher with respect to a business's expectation about future

patent, copyright and trademark behavior. This is likely because many firms trademark the name

of their business.

       Firms in the PSED were also asked if they expected that research and development will

be a major priority for the business.   Again, as seen in Table 8, nearly 80 percent of all new

businesses report that they have no plans for research and development to be a majority priority

for the business when they are establishing the business.

       The results in Table 8 suggest that the observed lack of innovation and growth may be

deliberate; When starting their business most business owners have no plans to grow or innovate

in the future. Interestingly, despite new business owners’ expectations that their businesses will

remain small with little innovation, they remain committed to starting and running a firm. In the

next section, we examine the stated motives of nascent small business owners and explore how

these motives correlate with expectations.

5.     Motivations For Starting Businesses

To explore heterogeneity in founders’ motives, we again turn to the PSED data. As part of the

initial survey of the PSED, the business owners were asked “Why did you want to start this new

business?”. The respondent could report up to two potential motives. The respondents provided

unstructured answers and the PSED staff coded the answers into 44 specific categories. All the

categories are listed in Appendix Table A2, along with the number of all PSED respondents who
                                                                                                 25
provided the reason on either their first report (in the first parentheses) or on their second report

(in the second parentheses).

       We took the raw responses to the question “Why did you start your business” and created

five broad categories of our own. The five categories were: (1) non pecuniary reasons, (2)

reasons related to the generation of income, (3) reasons related to the desire to develop a new

product or because they had a good business idea, (4) reasons related to the fact the respondent

has no better job options, and (5) all other reasons. The main responses in the non pecuniary

category include: “want to be my own boss”, “want flexibility over my schedule”, “want to work

from home”, “enjoy the work/it is my hobby”. The main responses in the generating income

category include: “to make money” or “need extra income”. The main responses in the new

product/business idea category include: “satisfy a business need”, “there is high demand for this

product/business”, “untapped market”, and “lots of experience at this type of work”. A full

breakdown of our classification of the raw responses into these five broad categories can also be

found in Appendix Table A2.

       Table 9 provides the distribution of first responses by category (column A) and the

distribution of either the first or second response by category (column B) for the three PSED

samples discussed above. Three preliminary things should be noted. First, only 60 percent of

respondents provided a second response. Second, given that the respondents could provide any

answer they wanted, the first and second response often fell into the same broad category (e.g.,

answer 1 was “be own boss” and answer 2 was “have flexibility over schedule”, both of which

we count as being a non pecuniary benefit of starting a business). Third, summing down column

A exactly equals 100 percent while summing down column B exceeds 100 percent given that

respondents could report a second answer.

                                                                                                  26
        The main result from Table 9 is that there is substantial heterogeneity across respondents

in their reported primary reason for starting a small business. In particular, non pecuniary

benefits play a leading role for most respondents. These results are consistent across all three

PSED samples. For example, between 35 and 37 percent of first reports across all samples

referred to non pecuniary reasons being the primary driver of the business start up decision.

Combining the first and second reports, over half of all respondents in all samples stated that non

pecuniary benefits were an important component of their start up decision.

        The second most common response for the business start up motivation was having a

good business idea/creating a new product. Roughly 30 percent of first reports and roughly 38

percent of combined reports referred to the fact that the reason the business was started was

because of a good business idea or a new product.           Many people also reported that they wanted

to “generate income”.       Answers in this broad category represented roughly 20 percent of first

reports and 32 percent of combined reports.            Finally, very few people reported starting the

business because of a lack of other employment options.20

        In the remainder of this section, we explore to what extent the respondents’ reported

motives can predict their expected and actual values of growth and innovation measures. We

focus on two motives in particular: new business idea and non pecuniary. The first is the motive

most closely associated with the traditional role of an entrepreneur whereas the second is

typically ignored or only considered anecdotally. To do this, we define a dummy variable for

each motive that is equal to one if that motive was identified in either the first or second mention.

Then we run a simple regression of the various measures described in Tables 7 and 8 from the



20
   Ardagna and Lusardi (2008) show that the lack of employment options is a much more important motivation for
starting a small business in developing economies.
                                                                                                           27
PSED on the two dummy variables.21 Note that since a motive can be identified in either

mention, it is possible for both dummies to be equal to one. The results to these regressions are

shown in Tables 10a and 10b. We only show these results for the first two PSID samples (in

Tables 10a and 10b, respectively). Given the small sample size for the third sample (those that

are still earning revenues in 2010), power is an issue for the interpreting the coefficients. We do

wish to note, however, that even in this sample the patterns for the signs of the coefficient were

very similar to what are shown for the other samples in Tables 10a and 10b.

        For each sample in Table 10, we show five sets of results.                   The first column is the

constant from the regression and represents the unconditional mean for those individuals who

never report starting a business for either "non pecuniary" or "create a new product" motives.

The next two columns show the coefficients on the two dummy variables for the reason that the

business was started. These coefficients can be interpreted as the percentage difference in

probability of the outcome (or difference in employment forecast) relative to respondents that

mention neither business idea or non pecuniary motives.22 In the fourth column, we show the

difference in the coefficient on the non pecuniary motivation dummy (column 3) relative to the

coefficient on the business idea motivation dummy (column 2). This can be interpreted as the

difference in probability of the outcome (or employment) for those that mention exactly one of

the motives. For example, respondents who specified a business idea and did not mention non

pecuniary motives were 13 percent less likely than those that specified non pecuniary motives




21
   Estimating the saturated version of this regression with an interaction term had almost no effect on the point
estimates and p-values shown in Tables 10a and 10b. We also estimated the same regression with each category that
could be named in either mention represented. This also did not change the results.
22
   Respondents that mention neither motive, would have specified either for income reasons, lack of other options,
or some other motive. The vast majority of these cases specified income motives .
                                                                                                               28
and not a business idea to enter a market already offering the same product or service          In

column 5, we show the p-value of a two-sided test for equality.

       Individuals who start their business because they think they have a good idea or because

they want to create a new product are much more likely to 1) want to grow, 2) want to innovate,

and 3) actually innovate. Conversely, those who start for non pecuniary reasons are less likely

to want to grow, less likely to want to innovate, and are less likely to actually innovate.     As

mentioned above, those with non pecuniary motives were much more likely to enter an already

crowded market relative to those with a new business idea. Likewise, they were 5.1 percentage

points less likely to report that they have already developed some proprietary technology or

processes as part of their business start up and are 9.0 percentage points less likely to report

expecting to get a patent, trademark, or copyright in the future.     The p-values on both these

differences are 0.01.

       As can also be seen in Table 10, those who reported starting their business because they

had a new idea were much more likely to want to be big in 5 years and to grow their business

than those who started for non pecuniary reasons.    For example, those who started because they

had a good idea were 8.3 percentage points less likely to report wanting to remain small opposed

to growing the business.

       We wish to highlight a few additional results not shown in Table 10. First, there is little

statistical difference in survival rates to 2010 for those who reported non pecuniary benefits as a

primary motivation of starting the business relative to those who reported a new idea as the

reason they started. If anything, in some samples and specifications, those that reported non




                                                                                                29
pecuniary benefits as a primary motivation survived with a higher probability.23 Second, there

is no statistical difference of actual firm size across the different groups based on the reason they

started the business in 2010.         The reason for this is that nearly all firms have only 1 or fewer

employees even four years after the business started.                 There is not much variation across the

firms in this small sample of survivors. This is consistent with the results shown in 3 showing

that most surviving firms remain really small.             Finally, there is some variation across industries

with respect to non pecuniary reasons being an important driver relative to wanting to create a

new product.        Specifically, those in the finance industry were statistically much more likely,

relative to other industries, to have people report non pecuniary benefits be an important motive

for starting in that industry. A similar pattern appears among those starting businesses in retail

trade. Two industries where the dominant reason to start the business was because of a desire to

create a new product/service was in manufacturing and wholesale trade. The data lack enough

power to draw decisive conclusions about the other industries.

         The results in this section show that there is substantial ex-ante heterogeneity across

individuals in why they started their businesses. Only a fraction of firms start because they have

a good business reason. However, these firms at the time of inception report a higher desire to

grow and innovate and higher actual realizations of innovation. Many firms, however, report

non pecuniary benefits as being an important driver of small business behavior. Incorporating

such ex-ante heterogeneity into models of small business dynamics will almost certainly alter

conclusions about the importance of ex-post measures of heterogeneity such as stochastic



23
    This would be consistent with a model where non pecuniary benefits are a large part of the return to small
business formation as shown in Pugsley (2011). In that model, individuals will be willing to stay in business even if
they get a bad productivity draw because the pecuniary returns are just a small portion of the total return to business
entry.
                                                                                                                    30
productivity draws or binding financial constraints. We turn to this discussion in the next

section.

6.      Why Heterogeneity in Starting Motives/Expectations Can Matter

There are a number of reasons why ignoring the ex-ante heterogeneity in motives and

expectations may matter. We sketch how this ex-ante heterogeneity confounds inferences in a

number of relevant contexts. We consider two literatures: firm dynamics and the measurement of

the private equity risk-return tradeoff. Finally, we also assess how our work relates to the recent

papers documenting the nature and growth patterns of small businesses in developing economies.

A.      Firm Dynamics

In theoretical models, differences in employment growth across firms are attributed to either

differences in entrepreneurial ability (e.g., Lucas, 1978), differences in realized productivity

draws (e.g., Simon and Bonini (1958); Jovanovic (1982); Pakes and Ericson (1989); Hopenhayn

(1992)), differences in access to capital markets (e.g., Evans and Jovanovic (1989);

Vereshchagina and Hopenhayn (2009)), or some combinations of the above (e.g., Clementi and

Hopenhayn (2006)). While all of the above highlights some potential drivers of firm dynamics,

the results we document in the prior sections suggest that these stories are, at best, incomplete.

It is not only differences in luck, talent, or credit market access are the only determinants of firm

size.      As we show above, there is also substantial ex-ante heterogeneity in the desires and

expectations of new business owners with respect to their growth process. In other words, some

firms do not grow or innovate simply because they do not want to grow or innovate.

        What drives these differences in ex-ante expectations and desires across owners of newly

formed firms with respect to their desire to grow or innovate? The results in the prior sections

point to at least two potential channels. First, many small business owners start their businesses,
                                                                                                  31
in part, because of the non pecuniary benefits associated with small business ownership.                        As

seen from the PSED data, many small business owners report starting their business because they

value the control and flexibility provided by small business ownership.                        If these benefits

diminish with firm size, individuals who start for these reasons will prefer to keep their

businesses small. We do find evidence of such correlations in the data: those business owners

that report starting their business in part for non pecuniary reasons were much more likely to

want to keep their firm size small well into the future.

        Second, some businesses may stay persistently small because they are in industries which

have low natural efficient scales. Many small businesses are dentists, plumbers, real estate and

insurance agents, small shop keepers, and beauticians. Within these industries, the productivity

of the firm is directly linked to the individual's skill set.           Given the fixed costs of production

may be small relative to the variable costs, optimal firm size may be quite small. As a result,

firms may start with no expectations of growth given that their natural scale is quite low.24

These firms may be particularly attractive to business owners driven by non pecuniary motives.

        Pugsley (2011) and Pugsley and Hurst (2011) formalize the insights put forth in this

paper by writing down models of small business formation and small business dynamics where

individuals are allowed to have differential utility from small business ownership and industries

differ in their natural returns to scale. In these models, they show that many of the predictions

of the standard models of firm dynamics can be replicated in a model with no differences across

firms in entrepreneurial ability and no difference across firms in their financing constraints.
24
   This idea is consistent with recent research by Holmes and Stevens (2010) which attributes the variation in firm
size within narrowly defined manufacturing industries to differences between large plants who produce standardized
goods and small plants that make custom or specialty goods. Similar differentiated product stories can also
potentially explain the within industry size variation in other narrow industries like retail (big box stores versus
smaller mom and pop stores), health care (small doctor practices versus hospitals), or lawyers (small law offices
versus big corporate law firms). Explaining the variation in within industry firm size is an interesting avenue for
future research.
                                                                                                                 32
There are two important results from these papers. First, Pugsley and Hurst (2011) show that the

existence of non pecuniary benefits can generate a positive relationship between wealth and

starting a business, by making business ownership a normal good, where wealthier individuals

“purchase” these benefits as their marginal utility of consumption diminishes. Second, Pugsley

(2011) shows that there is not a one-for-one mapping between the distribution of firm size and

productivity draws (like the ones emphasized in much of the literature outlined above) when

industries differ in their fixed costs and owners have a preference for keeping their business

small, which cautions against using unconditional firm level dynamics to estimate a process for

entrepreneurial productivity.

           Finally, much of the empirical work on firm dynamics proceeds by studying either the

universe of firms, or focuses specifically on a sector thought to be representative of that universe.

Typically, this is the manufacturing sector where micro-level administrative data have

historically been the most available. It is in this empirical context where the applicability of

“Gibrat’s” law, which states firm growth rates are on average independent of size, or why the

distribution of firm sizes appears to follow a particular power law (“Zipf’s” law) are frequently

demonstrated.25 Why these empirical regularities appear at the aggregate level is an interesting

question. However, consistent with Pugsley (2011) it does not suggest that imposing this

structure on a particular industry, or assuming a representative industry typified by

manufacturing, is appropriate. The concentration of small businesses in industries varies

considerably, and the heterogeneity we consider is especially important for industries we




25
     See, for example, Sutton (1997) and Gabaix (2008).
                                                                                                  33
highlight in this paper. There is considerable cross industry variation in the distribution of firm

sizes, even conditional on average firm size.26

B.      Understanding the Risk-Return Tradeoff

There is a separate literature assessing the risk-return trade off of small business owners.                   For

example, Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen (2002) document that the returns to investing in

private equity (business ownership) are no higher than the returns to investing in public equity

despite the poor diversification and higher risk. Their focus is only on the pecuniary returns of

private business investment. This spans a large class of businesses, many of which are the small

businesses we study here. However, even among venture-backed startups, which are a tiny

fraction of small businesses, the risk-return tradeoff looks poor. Hall and Woodward (2010)

show that even among the highly skilled population of venture-backed entrepreneurs, potential

entrepreneurs would be roughly indifferent between salaried employment and launching a

venture-backed startup considering the high idiosyncratic risk of the payoffs to entrepreneurship

        Not surprisingly, a model with non pecuniary benefits can help to explain these findings.

If there are private benefits to small business ownership (relative to allocating effort to the labor

market), the measured pecuniary return could be lower than the total return. Our results above

suggest that for many individuals, non pecuniary benefits are an important motive for starting

their small business.      While the results above are based on survey reports, they are consistent

with the work of Hamilton (2000) that shows the median small business owner receives lower

accumulated earnings over time relative to paid employment.27


26
  For example, Figure 3 highlights these patterns at broad industry groupings.
27
  Hamilton (2000) does not take into account of income underreporting by the self employed when performing his
analysis. Hurst, Li, and Pugsley (2011) show that such income underreporting by the self employed is important.
Although, the results of Hamilton are mitigated when income underreporting is account for, it still appears that the
median self employed individual takes a pecuniary earnings loss when becoming self employed.
                                                                                                                 34
       Overall, our results suggest that for many individuals, non pecuniary benefits could be an

important factor driving their small business formation. Incorporating such preferences into our

models of small business formations can alter our assessment of the risk-return tradeoff of small

business ownership.

C.     Small Businesses In Developing Economies

       Recent work has emphasized the fact that most small businesses in developing economies

do not grow, do not innovate, and are started because of a lack of jobs in the larger firms within

the economy.      For example, La Porta and Shleifer (2008) examine the importance of the

informal sector in developing economies. They conclude that, on average, the small firms that

populate the informal sector in developing economies are much less productive than similar

small firms in the formal sector.    As a result of the low quality of the inputs into production

(including human capital), it is not surprising that the small firms in the informal sector do not

grow or innovate in any observable way. Banerjee and Duflo (2011) document the existence of

"reluctant entrepreneurs" in developing economies. They find that most individuals who own a

small business in the developing countries they analyze do not grow, are not profitable, and often

do so because of the lack of jobs in larger, established firms.

       The results in our paper both complement this literature and show that different

mechanisms are at play in a developed country like the United States. In terms of similarities

with the literature on small businesses in developing economies, it is true that most small

businesses in the U.S. do not grow. However, the reason that small business seem to exist and

the nature of the small business owners seem quite different. In the U.S., many of the small

business owners are highly skilled (lawyers, doctors, dentists, etc.).   It is a well established fact

that there is little relationship between formal years of schooling and the propensity for either
                                                                                                   35
small business entry or survival.28 Additionally, as we have shown above, very few of the small

business owners in the U.S. (less than 4 percent) report starting a business because of a lack of

employment options. In other words, it does not appear that the U.S. small business owners are

"reluctant entrepreneurs".

           Overall, our results showing that most small business in the U.S. do not want to grow or

innovate is consistent with small businesses in developing economies, the underlying reasons for

this may be very different. A more formal analysis of the similarities and differences between

small businesses within developed and developing economies would be a worthy area for future

research.

7.         Policy Implications

Economic arguments for subsidizing small businesses hinge on small businesses being important

contributors to aggregate innovation and growth where market forces alone fail to allocate

sufficient resources to the sector. Market failures may stem from technological spillovers ignored

by entrepreneurs or financial constraints that inhibit an optimal quantity of capital from reaching

the small business sector. The subject of entrepreneurship and technological spillovers is well

studied in the endogenous growth literature (e.g. Audretsch et al. (2006), Acs and Audretsch

(2009)). If a substantial portion of R&D occurs in small firms, the social returns to

entrepreneurship could far exceed the private returns. Jones and Williams (1989), for example,

find the optimal level of investment in R&D to be 2 to 4 times the observed level of investment.

Additionally, subsidizing small businesses may be appropriate if liquidity constraints or other

financial market imperfections prevent small businesses from securing the financing they need to

bring their innovations to market (Evans and Jovanovic (1989); Evans and Leighton (1989)).


28
     See, for example, Evans and Leighton (1989) or Asoni (2011).
                                                                                                36
        Given the belief that there are social spillovers from small business innovation or that

small businesses face liquidity constraints, many developed economies enact policies that favor

small businesses relative to established firms.          The subsidies to small businesses could come in

two potential forms. First, there may be direct subsidies to small businesses where the explicit

intent is to promote small business activity. Within the United States, for example, small

business subsidies include providing subsidized or guaranteed loans to small businesses,

providing small businesses with access to special lending programs, exempting small businesses

from various regulations, providing small businesses preferential treatment when awarding

government contracts, and providing small businesses with preferential treatment through the tax

code.29 Adam Looney, in his discussion of our paper that follows, discusses a number of these

government mandated small business subsidies in the United States. These direct small business

subsidies are usually linked explicitly to firm size. Firms with less than a certain amount of

employees are eligible for the subsidy while firms with more than a certain amount of employees

are not eligible for the subsidy. As a result, many of the small business subsidies promote small

business entry but do not promote small business growth because if the firms grow beyond a

certain size the subsidy no long applies.

        Second, there also are indirect subsidies that can promote small business activity. For

example, the fact that non pecuniary attributes are not taxed results in sectors where non

pecuniary benefits are a larger fraction of total compensation being tax preferred relative to other

sectors. To the extent that small business ownership offers larger non pecuniary benefits relative

to owning a larger business or being a wage worker, the small business sector would be tax

preferred even if there are no other direct subsidies. Additionally, there is a large literature

29
  See De Rugy (2005) for a detailed discussion of the various ways the U.S. government provides subsidies to U.S.
small businesses.
                                                                                                               37
showing that small business owners are much more likely to underreport their income to tax

authorities relative to wage and salary workers.30 Again, if it is easier to underreport income to

tax authorities if one owns a small business, the small business sector again would be tax

preferred relative to other sectors even if there are no additional direct small business subsidies.

The point we want to emphasize in this section is that while policy makers and researchers often

invoke the potential benefits of direct small business subsidies, there is very little quantitative

research documenting the actual benefits and costs of small business subsidies. The results in

our paper suggest that the potential costs may be nontrivial.

           The potential costs associated with small business activity come from two sources. First,

as we show above, the bulk of small businesses report ex-ante that they do not want to grow nor

do they want to innovate. And, as anticipated, most small firms do not grow or innovate. Linking

small business subsidies to firm size may support the handful of firms that eventually turn into

Google or Microsoft, but they also stimulate real estate agents, small law firms, and construction

workers where the social spillovers and growth potential may be much smaller. To the extent

that these subsidies alter the behavior of firms who start for reasons unrelated to growth and

innovation, the policies can be distortionary by allocating more resources to the small business

sector than would be otherwise optimal.                   Second, as mentioned above, the structure of most

current direct small business subsidies is to link the subsidies to firm size.            As a result, if the

benefits associated with subsidizing small business activity comes from the small businesses

actually growing, the policies, as currently structured, may actually inhibit firm growth. If a firm

grows beyond a certain size, the small business subsidy no longer applies.

     See Hurst, Li, and Pugsley (2011) for a recent discussion of this literature.
                                                                                                          38
       In a companion paper, Pugsley and Hurst (2011) illustrate the potential costs of small

business subsidies in a simple static general equilibrium model of small business formation and

occupational choice.     Within the model, industries differ by their natural return to scale.

Households differ by the size of the non pecuniary benefit they receive (in flow utility) from

starting their own business.      To highlight the potential costs of subsidizing small business

activity in the model, we assume that there are no differences across individual in their talent,

there are no social spillovers from small business formation and there are no liquidity constraints

preventing firm formation.     These extreme assumptions allow us to focus on potential costs of

subsidizing small businesses in a world where individuals get non pecuniary benefits from small

firm ownership. Individuals in the model can either allocate their labor to running a business or

working for some other business. Household run businesses cannot grow to their efficient scale

without forfeiting the utility flow.

       The model makes many predictions which can inform researchers and policy makers

about the potential costs of small business subsidies. First, subsidizing small business (funded

with taxes on labor income) will distort the allocation of production within the economy to

smaller scale businesses. Individuals choosing to start a small business trade-off the size of their

non pecuniary benefits from owning a small business with the loss in wages they would incur

from foregoing the benefits of agglomeration.          When small business activity is directly

subsidized, the economy as a whole becomes less productive given the response of individuals to

work in small (subsidized) self-owned firms as opposed to establishing larger firms which can

produce at lower average costs by taking advantage of the returns to scale.           Notice, such

distortions could occur even in a world where there are no direct subsidies to small businesses

and only the indirect subsidies discussed above.

                                                                                                 39
       Moreover, in such a model where the non pecuniary benefit of small business ownership

is a normal good, the subsidies to small businesses are regressive. The reason for this is that the

high wealth individuals are going to be the ones that are much more likely to start a business in

the no subsidy world because they are more able to afford (in utility terms) the foregone benefits

of agglomeration when they start their business. For the wealthy, the small business subsidy is

simply a transfer tied to activity that they were more likely to do anyway.        Not only do the

existence of non pecuniary benefits to small business ownership result in subsidies being welfare

reducing, lower wealth households suffer more from the subsidy than do higher wealth

households.

       To our knowledge, there is no empirical work that evaluates whether subsidizing small

businesses is a positive net present value venture.   Addressing this question seems like a very

important area for future research. Our work suggests that subsidies may be less distortionary if

they were targeted at growth and innovation as opposed to being mostly linked to firm size.

Such policies could address the concerns raised by our results in at least two ways. First, we

show that most small businesses operate in industries with potentially smaller natural scales.

Business owners with little intention to grow or innovate may select into these industries for that

very reason. By focusing the subsidy on the intensive margin, the subsidy is more likely to be

taken up by a business owner focused on growth or innovative activity. Subsidies could lower

the cost of credit for existing firms, and by increasing their value entice productive entrepreneurs

with high wage employment opportunity costs. Second, if non pecuniary compensation is

independent of the scale of the firm, the incidence of an expansion subsidy would be undistorted

by non pecuniary benefits. If anything, non pecuniary benefits may help separate businesses that

want to grow from businesses that would prefer to remain small. Of course there may be other

                                                                                                 40
social virtues to non-innovative small businesses, such as supporting communities and

neighborhoods, which are aided by subsidizing the entry and exit margins. However, when

targeting job creation or innovative risk taking, our findings suggest caution when supporting

businesses purely by size. At a minimum, future research is necessary to better understand both

the costs and benefits of subsidizing small business activity.

8.     Conclusion

In this paper, we have shown that there is substantial skewness in the desires and expectations of

individuals who start small businesses. Specifically, the vast majority of small business owners

do not expect to grow, report not wanting to grow, never expect to innovate along observable

dimensions, and report not wanting to innovate along observable dimensions. We also show that

there is also substantial heterogeneity in the reported reasons for why individuals start their

business.   In particular, only about one-third of new businesses (on the eve of their start up)

reported that they were starting their business because they have a product or service that they

want to bring to market. Instead, the most common response for why individuals were starting

their business was the existence of non pecuniary benefits. Individuals reported that they liked

being their own boss and like the flexibility that small business ownership provided.

       Our results suggest that much of the current literature has overlooked an important

component of many small businesses.       Essentially all of the current literature on firm dynamics

explains the ex-post distribution of firm size with models emphasizing differences in

entrepreneurial talent, differences in entrepreneurial luck, and differential access to credit

markets.    The results in this paper, however, suggest that another factor may be at play: many

small business owners just do not wish to grow big or innovate along observable dimensions in

any meaningful way.       The paper shows two potential reasons for the ex-ante differences in
                                                                                                 41
desires and expectations with respect to future growth. First, the natural scale of some industries

may be quite small. For example, the fixed costs to be a plumber, barber, lawyer, or insurance

agent may be small relative to the variable costs making the returns to scale quite small.

Second, the existence of non pecuniary benefits of owning a small business (because of

increased flexibility and control) may cause individuals to forgo some natural benefits of

agglomeration in exchange for higher utility.    Regardless of the exact reason, most individuals

who start their small business have little desire or expectation to grow their business beyond

having a few employees.

       Recognizing these characteristics common to many small businesses has immediate

policy implications. Often subsidies targeted at increasing innovative risk taking and overcoming

financing constraints are focused on small businesses. Our analysis cautions that this treatment

may be misguided. We believe that these targets are better reached through lowering the costs of

expansion, so they are taken up by the much smaller share of small businesses aspiring to grow

and innovate. In fact, the US Small Business Administration already partners with venture

capitalists whose high powered incentives are aligned with finding these small businesses with a

desire to be in the tail of the firm size distribution. We also think a missing component of the

academic and policy discussion is a formal cost-benefit analysis associated with small business

subsidies. To do this, more work is needed on the potential frictions to small business growth

and on the externalities associated with small business growth.

       Lastly, we conclude that our results suggest that it is often inappropriate for researchers

to use the universe of small business (or self employment) data to test standard theories of

entrepreneurship. Most small businesses do not match our conceptual measures of

entrepreneurship which focuses on the desire to innovate or grow. Researchers interested in

                                                                                                42
testing such specific theories of entrepreneurship may need to use more specialized data sets like

the ones that track small businesses seeking venture capital funding.

Notes:           All      data      in     Tables      2a     and      2b      can      be    found      at
http://www.ces.census.gov/index.php/bds/bds_database_list. The industry classifications are the ones
provided by the Business Dynamic Statistics (BDS). Like the Statistics on U.S. Business (SUSB) data,
the BDS data only includes information on firms with paid employees. The data in each column of Table
2a should be read as the percent of small business firms in a given firm age and industry grouping out of
all firms in that firm age and industry grouping. Table 2b is analogous except it is for employment
instead of firms. In these tables, we define small businesses as firms with fewer than twenty employees.

Notes: See text for a description of both the 2003 SSBF sample (used in Table 3) and the KFS sample (used in Table 4). We restricted the SSBF
to focus only on those firms with fewer than 20 employees. For the KFS sample, we looked at all new firms regardless of firm size. However,
we did restrict the KFS sample to only those firms that remained in business for the four years since the survey started. The median and mean
number of employees for the firms in the KFS sample was 1 and 3, respectively. The 90th percentile of number of employees for the firms in the
KFS sample was 14. All data was weighted using the sample weights provided within the survey.

Notes: The table reports estimation results of five specifications estimated with and without firm frequency weights. The regressions are small firms (firms with
between 1 and 19 employees) gross job creation rate (columns 1-3), gross job birth rate (column 4), and gross job destruction rate (column 5) on the industry's
share of small firms out of all small firms. The unit of observation is 6-digit industries. The regression assesses, for example, whether the gross job creation rate
of small firms within a narrow industry is related to the industry's share of small firms out of all small firms. Data for these regressions come from the pooled
2003-2006 SUSB data. All regressions included time effects. Other controls are listed on the table (when included). Robust standard errors are in parentheses.
The weighted estimation can be viewed as a grouped data estimate of firm level job creation/destruction from administrative records if employment shares of
small firms within an industry are approximately equal.

Notes: This table summarizes the responses to the questions asked of the nascent small business owners in the PSED about their actual and expected innovative
activities. See text for the details. We focus on three samples. The first sample is all PSED respondents of nascent small business owners. The second
sample is the set of all nascent entrepreneurs who actually had positive revenues during 2006 (first wave of the survey). The third sample is the set of all nascent
entrepreneurs who actually had positive revenues during 2010 (most recent follow up wave of the survey). All data are weighted using the PSED sample
weights from their respective survey wave. Responses for samples 1 and 2 are from the initial wave. Responses for sample 3 are from fifth wave.

Note: Data comes from the PSED. See text for the details of the survey and details about the individual questions summarized in the table. We
focus on three samples. The first sample is all PSED respondents of nascent small business owners. The second sample is the set of all nascent
entrepreneurs who actually had positive revenues during 2006 (first follow up wave of the survey). The third sample is the set of all nascent
entrepreneurs who actually had positive revenues during 2010 (most recent follow up wave of the survey). All data are weighted using the PSED
sample weights from their respective survey wave. Sample sizes differ slightly from those in Table 7 because not all respondents provided
responses to all the questions. However, the differences in sample sizes were small when they existed.

Notes: The table uses the same dataset and sample construction as in Table 7. This table summarizes the responses to the questions “Why did you
start this new business?” We classified the responses to the open ended question of “Why did you start this new business?” into five broad
categories of response: non pecuniary responses, income reasons, having a good business idea, lack of other employment options, and other. For
a complete discussion of our classification, see appendix Table A1. Respondents were allowed to provide up to two reasons for why they started
the business. In columns A, we report the fraction of respondents who provided the specific reason on their first report. In columns B, we report
the fraction of respondents who provided the specific reason on either their first or second report. The numbers in column B sum to fewer than
200 percent because about one-quarter of respondents did not provide a second report and, of those that did, some provided a report that was
classified in the same broad category. All data are weighted using the PSED sample weights.

Notes: The results in Tables 10a and 10b are from a regression of different dependent variables indicating the business or the expectation about
the business for future growth and innovation on a dummy for whether the respondent reporting starting the business because they wanted to
create a new product (row 3 from Table 9) or because of non pecuniary reasons (row 1 of Table 9). For the regression, the dummy variable equals
one if the respondent reported the given motive on either their first or second report. Columns 2 and 3 of this table show the coefficients on these
dummy variables. Column 4 is the simple difference of these coefficients. Column 5 is the p-value on the difference. Column 1 shows the mean
dependent variable for the omitted groups (the constant from the regression). Robust standard errors are in parentheses.

Note: Figure starts with the sample of all firms with fewer than 20 employees from the 2007 SUSB. These firms
are then grouped by their 4 digit NAICS industry code. There are 294 such industries. Industries are then ranked
by the fraction of small businesses (out of all small businesses) that are in each industry. A rank of 1 means that
industry had the largest fraction of small businesses (out of all small businesses) in that industry. The rank is then
plotted against the cumulative fraction of small businesses (out of all small businesses) in an industry of a given
rank.

Notes: The y-axis in this figure is the average within industry share of employment by small firms across different
industry deciles. The within industry share of employment by small firms is defined as yj in the text. This measures
the share of employment in small firms in industry j out of all employment in industry j. The x-axis are deciles
based upon the share if firms from industry j out of all small firms (regardless of industry). This is defined as xj in
the text. This is the same metric used to rank firms in Table 1 and Figure 2. The sample includes all 294 4-digit
industries. Each decile, therefore, includes roughly 29 industries. For example, decile 1 includes the top 29
industries from Table 1.

Note: Table shows the grouping of PSED respondent answers to the following open ended questions:
“Why do you/did you want to start this new business?” Each respondent was allowed to provide up to
two responses. This question was only asked in the initial wave of the PSED. The PSED staff took the
responses to the open ended questions and coded them into the 44 specific responses – all of which are
listed in this table. In the codebook, the 44 responses were grouped into 6 broader categories. Those
categories were “income”, “business opportunities”, “employment”, “personal reasons”, “lifestyle”, and
“other”. For our purpose, this classification was not exactly ideal. For example, the personal reason
category included both “lots of experience at this type of work” and “enjoy the work, have passion for it;
hobby”. As a result, we reclassified the responses into the five categories above (used in Tables 9 and
10). Our classification was close to – but not identical to – the PSED classification. One can see the
PSED code book for an exact comparison. Lastly, the numbers in parentheses represent the actual
number of respondents who provided the reason on their first report (in the first parentheses) and on their
second report (in the second parentheses). These numbers are for all PSED respondents and the sample
from which they are drawn is analogous to the sample described in column 1 of Table 9. The numbers in
the second parentheses sum to fewer than the full sample because roughly 500 respondents did not
provide a second response.
