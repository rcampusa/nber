                 Mobility Increasing or Mobility Impeding?



                                 ABSTRACT



      This paper studies the influence of education on labor and geographic

mobility. Mobility is an important equilibrating factor in a changing

economy. Therefore, any factor that induces mobility also alleviates the

symptoms of disequilibriun, and any factor that inhibits mobility also im-

pedes economic adjustments. Does the high level of education in modern in-

dustrial societies help or hurt economic transitions?

     Economic theory provides conflicting arguments. On the one side, the

theory of firm-specific capital predicts that education increases job dura-

tion and therefore inhibits job mobility (Jovanovic, 1979). On the other

side, education should increase mobility in markets with imperfect informa-

tion because better educated persons should be better able to collect and

process information, reducing search and transctions costs.

     In a PSID subsample consisting of 736 individuals, we observed labor

and geographic mobility from 1968 to 1982 and related it to the level of

education at 1968. It appears that labor and geographic mobility are

governed by quite different behavioral mechanism. Education strongly af-

fects future labor and geographic mobility, but in opposite ways. A high

level of education inhibits labor mobility, but increases geographic

mobility.

      1. Introduction



      This paper studies the influence of education on labor and geographic

mobility. Mobility is an important equilibrating factor in a changing

economy.1 Therefore, any factor that induces mobility also alleviates the

symptoms that accompany a state of disequilibrium in the economy, such as

the current high rate of unemployment in the United States and in Western

Europe. By the same token, any factor that inhibits mobility also impedes

economic adjustments. What role does the high level of education in modern

industrial societies play? Does it help or hurt economic transitions?

     There are many notions of mobility. Labor mobility is understood to

include three kinds of job changes: job changes within the same industry

and occupation (such as promotions), the change from one occupation to

another occupation (occupational mobility), and the change from a job in

one industry to a new job in another industry (sectoral mobility).

Similarly, geographic mobility can be categorized into intraurban mobility,

moves between different communities within the same region, and

interregional migration.

     Relative to other markets (for instance, financial markets), both the

labor market and the housing market are characterized by the overwhelming

importance of market frictions. As opposed to financial markets, imperfect

information, product heterogeneity, specific and immobile capital, and

idiosyncratic relationships in labor and housing markets imply very high

transactions costs and make adjustments of labor supply and housing

consumption very costly. Therefore, labor and housing markets tend to be

sluggish and exhibit long lasting deviations from market equilibrium. The

same factors and sometimes government intervention and other institutional
                                    -2-



arrangements make for sticky wages and rents. Once in disequilibrium,

labor mobility is a crucial mechanisms to change the qualitative nature of

labor supply, i.e., the composition of skills available in the labor

market, just as geographic mobility is the almost exclusive mechanism by

which housing demand is changed.2

     Labor and geographic mobility are closely tied together if not only by

the fact that the distribution of industries is historically distributed,

such that the decline of an industrial sector almost always implies the

decline of an entire geographic region. Typical examples are the

Pittsburgh region in the United States or the Ruhrgebiet in West Germany.

On the household level, commuting distance and neighborhood choice link

housing and job decisions within an urban area. Important job events such

as becoming unemployed for an extended duration may precipitate migration

with consequential housing adjustments. The reverse dependency may occur

when a household migrates because of local amenities such as climate and

the searches for a new job at the new place.3

     Studying the determinants of labor and geographic mobility is

 important because of the implications on labor market policies. The

 current persistent unemployment in the United States and in Western Europe

 (on an even more pronounced scale) is concentrated in certain industries

 and occupations. In the short run, government subsidies may save jobs in

 declining industries by creating demand or reducing cost.   However in the

 long run, unemployment is likely to persist unless there is considerable

 sectoral and occupational mobility. Long run economic policy must create

 incentives to encourage labor mobility, the only mechanism of qualitative

 change in labor market supply.

      The very same argument holds for geographic mobility. As was argued

 above, unemployment tends to be regionally distributed, and, unless firms
                                     -3-



 move to regions of high unemployment and unless new jobs are created and

 also accepted by the existing labor force, regional unemployment is only

 alleviated if workers migrate from depressed regions. On a smaller scale,

 a new job may be found within a region, but only with a greatly increased

 commuting distance. It therefore eventually force the worker to move into

a different neighborhood.

      The lack of willingness to move and migrate in many European countries

is often considered an aggravating factor which contributes to the

persistence of unemployment in Western Europe. This is contrasted to the

more footloose American society where labor supply moved away from the

North East in the sixties and seventies and now returns back to the North

East during its current upswing. An interesting case study is Pittsburgh,

Pennsylvania. The recent impressive renaissance of Pittsburgh is the

consequence of a combination of outmigration (Pittsburgh lost one third of

her population from 1960 to l98O) and a drastic change of the industrial

base made possible by a degree of sectoral mobility that is unparalleled in

Europe (41.7 percent of all employees that worked in the primary metal

industry in 1972 had changed to a different industry in l982).

     Modern industrial societies are characterized by a high level of

education and professional qualification. The central question of this

paper is whether education increases or impedes geographic and labor

mobility. Does the high level of general education and the still rising

level of professional skills in our society lock workers in specific tasks

at specific locations such that economic transitions are increasingly

painful? Or does it provide for better processing of information, hence

more flexibility that makes transitions easier in a changing economy?

Economic theory provides conflicting arguments. On the one side, the

theory of firm-specific capital predicts that education increases job
                                        -4-



duration and therefore inhibits job mobility (Jovanovic, 1979). Directly

or indirectly, better education creates skills that may become increasingly

specific to a firm, an occupation, or an industry. The mor,e of such

specific skills are acquired, the more a worker becomes tied to a firm, an

occupation, or an industry.

     On the other side, education should increase mobility in markets with

imperfect information. Educated persons should be better able to collect

and process information and are more efficient searchers, hence have lower

transactions costs, and may therefore move and change jobs more easily

(Greenwood, 1975). Also, educated workers should have an comparative

advantage with respect to learning and implementing new technologies

(Bartel and Lichtenberg, 1987). A common pattern among very highly

educated and experienced workers is to carry out innovative tasks

("missions") until the task becomes routine, somebody less qualified takes

over, and the highly qualified person takes on the next mission (Nelson and

Phelps, 1966). Finally, more educated workers are likely to have faster

careers and will change jobs more often as an institutional requirement to

step up on the career ladder.

     Task of this paper is to let empirical evidence sort out which

mechanisms prevail - -   those   that make education induce mobility or those

that make education inhibit mobility. We will follow 783 American workers

 from 1968 to 1982, recording all their moves and job changes in this 15

year time span. The sample is drawn from the Panel Study of Income

 Dynamics. We will relate the frequency of moves and job changes to several

 measures of education, correcting for other determinants of labor and

 geographic mobility such as demographic variables, income, and wealth.

      The paper proceeds in four steps. First, we briefly describe the

 econometric methodology. Second, we describe the data and collect the most
                                    -5-



important stylized facts about education and mobility. Third, we present

Poisson regression results that indicate the role of education conditional

on demographic characteristics, income, and wealth. Finally, we interpret

these results in the light of economic theory and draw policy conclusions.



     2. Econometric Methodology



     A central methodological problem in empirical mobility analysis is the

handling of the time dimension. The most common procedure is to relate the

probability of moving, migrating, or changing jobs within a given time

interval to an array of explanatory variables.6 These studies fail to

account for repeat mobility and the sample selection problem introduced by

frequent and less frequent movers. Some studies employ continuous time

duration models that overcome these problems, however, their computational

effort is magnificent, particularly so, if the analysis describes more than

one state.7

     The primary question of this paper is whether a person with a given

level of education is more or less likely to move, to migrate, or to change

jobs in the future. Therefore, the appropriate experiment is to collect a

cross-section of persons with different levels of education at a given time

and then observe their mobility behavior as life continues, holding all

other characteristics constant. We then ask ourselves, how the number of

moves or job changes in their life times is related to their initial levels

of education. This view of mobility is quite different from those models

of mobility that compare the economic benefits and costs of a specific move

or job change. For the question at hand, we are not interested in the

returns from making such a change per Se. We also abstract from the choice

of geographic destination or target job, the "pull-factors" (Greenwood,
                                         -6-



1975). Rather, our goal is a predictive model that discriminates among

more or less mobile individuals by their level of education and other

characteristics. The Poisson regression technique is a well-suited model

to do so.

       The probability of the number of moves (job changes, etc.) made by an

individual can approximately be described by a Poisson distribution:



Prob(individual moves k times)         exp(-A) â¢ Ak /     k!                     (1)




where the parameter A denotes the expected number of moves.8 The expected

number of moves will not be a constant across individuals. This is the

place to test our hypothesis: does this expected number vary by the level

of education as well as by other demographic and economic attributes of

individuals? We postulate that the expected number of moves (job changes,

etc.) by individual n can be expressed as9


                K
An =   exp(     E knk )                                                          (2)
              k=1


where xnk denotes attribute k of individual n. These attributes include

basic demographics, income, wealth, and various measures of education which

will be specified in more detail in Section 3. The parameters k measure

the relative effects of attributes Xnk on the expected number of moves.

They will be estimated by maximum likelihood. The corresponding

 loglikelihood function is


            N           K                    K
 log.t â    E       [   E   knkn -   exp(         knk )        -
                                                                   log(m!)   ]   (3)
           nâi kâi                          kâl


 where          denotes the number of moves (job changes, etc.) by individual n.
                                        -7-



 The likelihood function (3) is concave and can quickly be maximized by

 Newton-Raphson iteration. Its inverse second derivatives yield the

 standard errors of the coefficients



        3. Data Description and Basic Statistics



        The 1982 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) includes about 3600

 families that represent a random sample of the United States population in

1982.11 For each family, data is available on a yearly basis from 1968 to

1982. Among all families, we selected those in which the head stayed the

same and was in the labor force throughout the entire period from 1968 to

1982.12 The resulting sample of household heads includes 736 individuals.

        Because of the relatively long duration of the panel   -   - 15   years - -
these data provide a unique basis for an empirical analysis of the

questions posed above. These data help to alleviate a common problem in

empirical mobility analysis, namely, that job or geographic mobility is a

relatively rare event. The data record all job and locational changes from

1968 to 1982, old and new occupation and industry in case of a job change,

and old and new county and distance to city center in case of a geographic

move.

        We consider nine different variables that indicate the various aspects

of mobility. In order to measure labor mobility, we count the number of

job changes (NJOB), the number of changes of occupation (NOCCUP) and the

number of changes of industry (NINDUS))-3 Geographic mobility is measured

by the number of intercounty moves (NCOUNTY), the number of intercity moves

(NCITIES), and the number of interstate moves (NSTATES).14 Finally, we

count the number of times in which an individual changed city and job

during the same 12-month period (NCITJOB). Similarly, we counted the
                                         -8-



number of combined city and occupation changes (NCITOCC) and of combined

city and industry changes
                              (NCITIND))5 Table A-i in the Appendix lists the

observed numbers of events indicating considerable geographic and labor

mobility in the United States.

     A wide array of demographic and economic characteristics of the family

are reported in the PSID which will serve as explanatory variables. Table

A-2 displays the most important background variables and their relation to

mobility. Mobility is highest among male, white, young individuals with

low income and no children. It decreases sharply with age and number of

children.

     In addition, several measures of education and professional

qualification are recorded for each family member. They will be used as

indicator variables and for the construction of a simple index of

education:


NRDWRIT      (indexO)      person is not able to read or write,
GRADE-5      (index=l)     5 or less grades of high school completed,
CRADE-8      (index2)      6 to 8 grades of high school completed,
GRADE11      (index=3)     9 to 11 grades of high school completed,
GRADE12      (index=4)     12 grades of high school completed,
PRACTTR      (index=5)     12 grades high school plus practical training,
COLLEGE      (index=6)     attended college without degree,
COLL.BA      (index=7)     attended college with degree (BA or equivalent),
UNIV.MA      (index8)      attended university with advanced degree (MA,Ph.D.).


 We also record previous work experience and the score of a simple IQ-test.

      Table 1 cross-tabulates the nine different mobility measures by level

 of education. Clearly, the level of education has quite different

 implications on the different kinds of mobility: education appears to

 substantially impede labor mobility, but it appears to increase geographic

 mobility and - -   to   a lesser extent - -   combined mobility.

     4. Poisson Regression Results



     The entries in Table 1 must be interpreted with care because they are

confounded by other demographic and economic attributes. Education is

highly positively correlated with income and wealth, and negatively

correlated with age, household size, and minority status. Table 1 may

indicate these factors rather than a direct effect of education. To

separate the direct effect of education from the indirect effect through

other demographic and economic attributes, we applythe Poisson regression

model delineated in Section 2 to the nine dependent variables introduced in

the preceding section. Full regression results are reported in the

Appendix, Tables A-3 and A-4. Table 2 summarizes the effect that the index

of education (Section 3) has on mobility.

    Two   conclusions   emerge from Table 2. Even after correcting for other

demographic and economic factors, a high level of education emerges as a

substantial deterrent to labor mobility. On the other hand, more education

appears to increase geographic mobility and combined mobility.

      represents a statistically significant reduction of mobility.




     These conclusions from Table 2 are confirmed by a more careful

analysis in which the simple index of education is replaced by a set of

dummy variables that indicate which level of education has been achieved.

     The detailed results now quite clearly establish the patterns already

detected in Tables 1 and 2. Labor mobility and geographic mobility are

affected by education in exactly the opposite way. Individuals with a high

level of education are less likely to change jobs but are more inclined to

move geographically. These opposing effects are particularly pronounced

among academically trained individuals but also precisely measurable among

the large number of individuals with completed high school and no

additional education.

     Table 4 translates the regression coefficients of Table 3 into the

expected number of job changes, moves, and combined changes. The entries

are computed by evaluating equation (2) using the estimated coefficients of

Table A-4 and the means of all background variables.

A higher level of education virtually always strongly reduces labor

mobility. The effect of education on the expected number of changes is

quite large: 50 percent more job changes and 2 to 2.5 times as many

occupation and industry changes are predicted for the highest as compared

to the lowest level of education. Note that in comparison to the simple
                                   -12-



cross-tabulation in Table 1, these predicted differences are smaller

because of the confounding effects in Table 1 of other variables that are

correlated with education and have their own effect on mobility.

Therefore, the magnitudes of the pure effects of education on labor

mobility are particularly impressive.

     The reverse relation between education and mobility is true for

geographic mobility, although the picture is a little more complicated.

Very high levels of education (college or university degrees) substantially

increase the likelihood of migration, but there is also an above average

willingness to move among those individuals that a high school education

completed after ninth to eleventh grade. Geographic mobility is lowest

among individuals with very little education (eight or less high school

grades) or an aborted college education. As was the case in labor

mobility, the differences in geographic mobility among education levels are

very pronounced: an individual with college education is predicted to move

roughly three times as often than a person with high school education

aborted at or before the eighth grade.

     What is the interpretation of these results? How do they relate to

economic theory? The labor mobility impeding role of education is

consistent with the theory of firm-specific capital. A worker is more

likely to accumulate skills and knowledge that are specific to a firm, a

job, or an industry if he or she has a high level of education. Note that

this effect is measured net of age and work experience -   - it   is solely the

effect of education at the beginning of the observation period in 1968.

Not surprisingly in light of the theory of firm-specific capital, work

experience itself has a mobility deterring effect. If statistically

significant, its effect is strongly negative (second to last row in Table

3, labelled WORKEXP).
                                       -13-



     The geographic mobility increasing role of very high levels of

education is consistent with the theory of search and transactions costs

that decrease with a higher level of education because more educated

individuals are likely to accumulate more information and process

information more efficiently. Note that this effect is measured net of

other demographic factors and income that may affect transactions costs.

Intellectual ability, though quite coarsely measured by the score of a

simple sentence completion word test, appears to increase mobility in most

cases (last row in Table 3, labelled IQSCORE))6

     Is there a contradiction? After all, most geographic mobility occurs

in conjunction with labor mobility. The apparent contradiction is resolved

by looking at the absolute frequency of changes, Table 3.      Job changes

occur substantially more often than geographical moves. Except for

transfers, geographic moves are indeed combined with a change of job.

However, most job changes take place without geographic mobility. We

conclude that job changes, including change of occupation or even industry,

need to overcome on average a lower threshold of transactions costs than

geographic changes. This lower threshold is higher for educated

individuals as compared to individuals with lower levels of education

because they accumulated more firm-specific capital; However, an even

higher threshold has to be overcome for geographic mobility. This second

threshold now varies inversely with education. Once job ties are severed,

distance of move is a matter of information, courage, and the willingness

to accept a new environment - -   properties   which are positively correlated

with a high level of education.

    Added evidence for this two-threshold explanation comes from the

horizontal pattern of coefficients in Table 3. First, education matters

more for larger geographic distance. In most education categories, the
                                    -14-



coefficients are largest for interstate and smallest for intercounty

mobility.17 This pattern in geographical mobility confirms the role of

geographic distance in transactions costs. Second, industry changes --

which are presumably the most incisive labor market change - -   exhibit   much

smaller negative (if not positive) coefficients than occupation or general

job changes. This appears to indicate that the higher the threshold is

that has to be overcome to precipitate a move or a job change, the more

important is the role of information processing and other factors that

correlate positively with education.

     Finally, it follows that combined labor and geographic mobility,

characterized by a very high threshold, should be affected positively by

education and intellectual qualification. The three left-most columns of

Table 3 confirm this conclusion, though with little precision due to the

relatively infrequent occurrence of such changes.



     5. Summary and Conclusions



     In a sample consisting of 736 individuals, we observed labor and

geographic mobility from 1968 to 1982 and related it to the level of

education at 1968. Education affects future labor and geographic mobility

in opposite ways. A high level of education inhibits labor mobility, but

increases geographic mobility. The empirical results confirm the theory of

firm-specific capital in labor relations (better education implies more

 specific skills which in turn imply longer job durations), but the role of

 informational transactions costs in geographic mobility (better education

 provides for more information which lowers psychic and monetary

 transactions costs). The opposing effects of a high level of education are

 only an apparent contradiction because labor mobility as a much more
                                   -15-



frequent event may very well be governed by different behavioral mechanisms

than the relatively infrequent event of a geographic move.

     The results suggest that it is not easy to design a policy that

relieves regional unemployment through increased mobility induced by better

education. Geographic mobility will be encouraged by a very high level of

general education. However, there appears to be a well pronounced trough

in geographic mobility for persons with a medium level of education.

Moreover, increasing the general level of education will decrease labor

mobility. In order to encourage labor mobility away from declining

industries and occupations, it appears that specific training rather than

just general education is required --   training   that teaches those new

skills that are associated with stable or rising industries and

occupations.

 related to the question at hand are Bartel (1979) and Linneman and Craves
  (1983). Greenwood (1975) provides a useful summary of the migration
 literature.
    See Heckman and Borjas (1980) on employment durations.
8 A is also the variance of the Poisson distribution. This restricts the
 possible spread of the predicted data, given the mean. In this and most
 other applications, the data exhibits more variation than implicit in the
 Poisson assumption.
.   Linearity is chosen for simplicity. The exponentiation ensures a
 nonnegative number of events.
10 See Maddala (1983) for a description of the Poisson regression model
  and some applications.
     The PSID includes an additional 2400 mostly low income families sampled
 non-randomly.
12 In addition, a few observations were excluded because of missing data.
  There is a potential sample selection problem because the frequency of a
  head change may be correlated with he frequency of job and residency
  changes. In addition, sample truncation occurs because the 15 year
  interval is long, but less than an adults active work life. Both biases
  lead to an underestimation of actual mobility.
l3 Job changes include change of employer as well as change of position.
  Depending on year of survey, occupation and industry are identified by a
  PSID-specific 1-, 2-, or 3-digit code, roughly comparable to the SIC code.
  An occupation or industry change is recorded whenever the first digit
  changed. The data quality of labor mobility, industry and occupation is
  not completely satisfactory. In particular, some occupation changes are
  not reported as job changes.
 l4 The sequence of mobility variables is strictly increasing in geographic
  distance. Intercity moves are moves that cross a county border (if rural)
  or a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) border (if urban).
  SMSAs are represented by the counties they are part of according to the
  1982 City and County Data Book.
 l5 The combined mobility measures suffer from the imprecision with which
  dates of job and residency changes are reported.

  of these education levels vis-a-vis individuals with incomplete high
  school.
