                                          ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the nonlinear dynamic response to shocks, relying on a threshold quantile
autoregression (TQAR) model as a flexible representation of stochastic dynamics. The TQAR
model can identify zones of stability/instability and characterize resilience and traps. Resilience
means high odds of escaping from undesirable zones of instability toward zones that are more
desirable and stable. Traps mean low odds of escaping from zones that are both undesirable and
stable. The approach is illustrated in an application to the dynamics of productivity applied to
historical data on wheat yield in Kansas over the period 1885-2012. The dynamics of this
agroecosystem and its response to shocks are of interest as Kansas agriculture faced major
droughts, including the catastrophic Dust Bowl of the 1930’s. The analysis identifies a zone of
instability in the presence of successive adverse shocks. It also finds evidence of resilience. We
associate the resilience with induced innovations in management and policy in response to
adverse shocks.

                 Agro-Ecosystem Productivity and the Dynamic Response to Shocks



1. Introduction

       Dynamics is at the heart of economic development and the search for processes that

contribute to improving human welfare. But dynamic process are typically complex, especially

under nonlinear dynamics. Indeed, nonlinear dynamic systems can exhibit many patterns. For

deterministic systems, this can go from reaching a unique steady state, to having multiple steady

states, to displaying limit cycles, or even to being chaotic (e.g., May, 1976). For stochastic

systems, the complexity increases further, making it challenging to evaluate the dynamic

response to unanticipated shocks. The assessment of such dynamic response is highly relevant in

economics. Some shocks are favorable (e.g., good weather, the discovery of new knowledge)

with positive impacts on welfare both in the short run and the longer run. But other shocks have

a negative impact on human welfare (e.g., drought, disease). The dynamic effects of such shocks

has been of great interest to economists and policy makers. Under some scenarios, their adverse

effects matter in the short run but dissipate in the longer run. But under other scenarios, their

longer term impacts can be sustained and large. An example is the case of poverty traps which

associate poverty with reduced investment and meager prospects for economic growth (e.g.,

Barrett and Carter, 2013; Kraay and McKenzie, 2014). Another example is from ecology: under

some circumstances, an ecosystem may fail to recover under extreme shocks (e.g., Holling,

1973; Common. and Perrings, 1992; Perrings, 1998; Gunderson, 2000; Folke et al., 2004;

Derissen et al., 2011). Other examples include cases of economic collapse with large and lasting

adverse effects on society (e.g., Tainter, 1990; Diamond, 2005). In these examples, the outcomes

are all undesirable. But the assessment of these situations can be challenging for two reasons: 1/



                                                  2
such adverse scenarios may not be very common; and 2/ the dynamics of the underlying process

is often complex and poorly understood. This suggests two useful directions of inquiry. First, we

need to refine our tools used in dynamic analysis. Second, we need to explore applications that

may provide new insights into economic dynamics. These two directions are key motivations for

this paper.

       This paper studies nonlinear dynamics in economics. It makes three contributions. First,

it explores new ways to analyze stochastic dynamics. The focus is on representations of

stochastic dynamics that allow for flexible dynamic response to shocks. The analysis relies on a

threshold quantile autoregression (TQAR) model (Galvao et al., 2011; Chavas and Di Falco,

2016). The TQAR model is empirically tractable. And it is flexible: it allows dynamics to vary

with both current shocks and past states. As such, a TQAR model can be used to assess how

dynamics can differ across situations (as reflected by different shocks and different states). This

makes it particularly appropriate for our purpose.

       A second contribution is to use our proposed approach to identify zones of

stability/instability and to characterize resilience and traps. Resilience means good odds of

escaping from undesirable zones of instability toward zones that are more desirable and stable.

Traps mean low odds of escaping from zones that are both undesirable and stable. As such,

resilience is desirable, but traps are not. We argue that the TQAR model provides a good basis to

evaluate the resilience of a system and the presence of traps.

       A third contribution is to illustrate the usefulness of our approach in an application to the

dynamics of an agro-ecosystem. Our empirical analysis uses historical data on wheat yield in

Kansas during the period 1885-2012. Historically, the Western Great Plains have experienced

many periods of severe drought (Burnette and Stahle, 2013). The worse drought occurred in the



                                                 3
1930’s leading to the Dust Bowl, a major American environmental catastrophe (Hornbeck,

2012). Coupled with intensive land use, the drought led to major crop failure, wind erosion and

dust storms. The impact was particularly severe in Kansas, where land erosion contributed to

significant decrease in land value and agricultural productivity (Hornbeck, 2012). The short run

response to the environmental destruction was mostly population migration away from the

affected areas. But the long run effects were major and lasting. Hornbeck (2012) documents that

soil erosion due to the Dust Bowl contributed to a decline in land value up to 30 percent in the

long term. Wheat being the major crop in Kansas (USDA, 2015), studying Kansas wheat yield

provides a great case study of the dynamic response to environmental shocks. Of special interest

are the effects of extreme shocks both in the short run and in the long run. In the context of

wheat yield, our analysis identifies a zone of instability in the presence of successive adverse

shocks. It also finds evidence of resilience. We associate the resilience with induced innovations

in management and policy in response to adverse shocks. This indicates the importance of

management and policy in the dynamic response to shocks.



2. Dynamics

       Consider a dynamic system evolving according to the state equations

               𝑦𝑡 = ℎ(𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑝 , 𝑧𝑡 ),                                                    (1a)

               𝑧𝑡 = 𝑔(𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑝 ; 𝑧𝑡−1 , … , 𝑧𝑡−𝑝 ),                                       (1b)

where 𝑦𝑡 ∈ ℝ measures payoff at time 𝑡, 𝑧𝑡 is a vector of variables affecting the system with

dynamics given in (1b), and 𝑝 ≥ 1. Equations (1a)-(1b) provide a general representation of

dynamics, allowing for joint dynamics in payoff 𝑦𝑡 and in the state variables 𝑧𝑡 . After successive

substitutions of (1b), note that equation (1a) can be alternatively written as


                                                     4
       𝑦𝑡 = ℎ(𝑦𝑡−1 , 𝑦𝑡−2 , … , 𝑔(𝑦𝑡−1 , 𝑦𝑡−2 , … ; 𝑧𝑡−1 , 𝑧𝑡−2 , … ))

         = ℎ(𝑦𝑡−1 , 𝑦𝑡−2 , … , 𝑔(𝑦𝑡−1 , 𝑦𝑡−2 , … ; 𝑔(𝑦𝑡−2 , … ; 𝑧𝑡−2 , … ), 𝑧𝑡−2 , … ))

         =⋯

         = 𝑓0 (𝑦𝑡−1 , 𝑦𝑡−2 , … ; 𝑦0 , 𝑧0 )                                                      (2)

where (𝑦0 , 𝑧0 ) are initial conditions which we take as given. Assume that the effects of lagged

values of 𝑦𝑡−𝑗 on 𝑦𝑡 in (2) become negligible for all 𝑗 > 𝑚. It follows that equation (2) can be

written as

         𝑦𝑡 = 𝑓(𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 , 𝑒𝑡 ),                                                         (3)

and 𝑒𝑡 is a random variable representing unobservable effects at time 𝑡. We assume that 𝑒𝑡 is

identically and independently distributed1 with a given distribution function.

       Equation (3) is a 𝑚-th order stochastic difference equation representing economic

dynamics under general conditions. Comparing equations (1) and (3), equations (1a)-(1b) are

structural equations describing how the system evolves over time, while equation (3) is a reduced

form equation of the same system. While equation (3) does not reflect structural information

about the system, it has two advantages: 1/ it provides a valid representation of the system

dynamics; and 2/ it does not require information about the variables 𝑧𝑡 . This is significant

advantage when some of the dynamic factors affecting payoff are not observable. For this reason,

our analysis will focus on the reduced form representation (3).

       Note that, equation (3) can be written as the first-order difference equation

                        𝑦𝑡   𝑓(𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 , 𝑒𝑡 )
               𝑤𝑡 ≡ [ ⋮ ] = [          ⋮             ] ≡ 𝐻(𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 )                          (4)
                     𝑦𝑡−𝑚+1       𝑦𝑡−𝑚+1

where 𝑤𝑡 ∈ ℝ𝑚
            + . Equation (4) can be used to characterize the nature of dynamics. Under

differentiability, let 𝐷𝐻 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 ) = 𝜕𝐻(𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 )/𝜕𝑤𝑡−1 be a (𝑚 × 𝑚) matrix. Denote the


                                                      5
characteristic roots of 𝐷𝐻(𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 ) by [𝜆1 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 ), … , 𝜆𝑚 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 )] where |𝜆1 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 )| ≥

⋯ ≥ |𝜆𝑚 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 )|, |𝜆𝑗 | being the modulus of the 𝑗-th root, 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑚, and 𝜆1 being the

dominant root.

        Where equation (3) is linear in (𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 ), the system exhibits linear dynamics. In

this case, the matrix 𝐷𝐻 is constant and so are its roots (𝜆1 , … , 𝜆𝑚 ). Consider for a moment a

situation where 𝑒𝑡 is constant for all 𝑡. Then, under linear dynamics, the system is globally stable

(in the sense that lim 𝑦𝑡 = 𝑦 𝑒 for any initial condition 𝑦0 ) if |𝜆1 | < 1 (Hasselblatt and Katok,
                   𝑡→∞

2003). Alternatively, the system would be unstable if |𝜆1 | > 1. When 𝜆1 is real, the dynamics of

                               exponential              >0
𝑦𝑡 has a forward path that is {             } when 𝜆1 {    }. And when 𝜆1 is complex, then 𝜆1 =
                                oscillatory             <0

𝑎 + 𝑏 √−1 and the system exhibits cyclical dynamics, with a cycle of period [2 𝜋/𝑎𝑟𝑐𝑡𝑔(𝑏/𝑎)].

        In the general case where equation (3) is nonlinear in (𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 ), the system

exhibits nonlinear dynamics. Under nonlinear dynamics, the forward path of 𝑦𝑡 can exhibit a

variety of dynamic patterns. For example, holding 𝑒𝑡 constant for all 𝑡, 𝑦𝑡 can eventually reach a

unique steady state, it can have multiple steady states, it can exhibit limit cycles, or it can be

chaotic (e.g., May, 1976). Situations of multiple steady-state equilibria have been of interest.

Multiple steady-sates (𝑦1𝑒 , … , 𝑦𝑀
                                  𝑒
                                    ) would arise if lim 𝑦𝑡 = 𝑦𝑗𝑒 when 𝑦0 ∈ 𝑆𝑗 , 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑀, where
                                                      𝑡→∞

𝑀 > 1 and (𝑆1 , … . , 𝑆𝑀 ) is a partition of ℝ. In this context, the set 𝑆𝑗 is the attractor of point 𝑦𝑗𝑒 ,

𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑀, as having initial condition 𝑦0 in 𝑆𝑗 eventually leads to 𝑦𝑗𝑒 , 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑀. When a

steady-state 𝑦𝑗𝑒 is identified as being “undesirable”, it means that it is good to avoid being in the

set 𝑆𝑗 . Examples include cases of ecological collapse in ecology (Holling, 1973) and poverty trap

in economics (Barrett and Carter, 2013; Kraay and McKenzie, 2014).




                                                     6
        Under nonlinear dynamics, both 𝐷𝐻(𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 ) and the dominant root 𝜆1 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 )

depend on the evaluation point (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 ). In general, ln(|𝜆1 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 )|) measures the rate of

divergence in 𝑦𝑡 along forward paths in the neighborhood of (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 ) (Hasselblatt and Katok,

2003). In this context, the dynamic properties just discussed still apply but only locally, i.e. in the

neighborhood of (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 ): the dynamics is locally stable if the dominant root satisfies

|𝜆1 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 )| < 1; and it is locally unstable if |𝜆1 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 )| > 1. We will make use of these

local properties in our empirical analysis below.

        The analysis of dynamics becomes more challenging in the stochastic case: the random

vector 𝑒𝑡 in (3) affects the path of 𝑦𝑡 over time. This is relevant when 𝑒𝑡 represents unanticipated

shocks. In this context, a key question is: What is the dynamic response of the system (3) to a

shock 𝑒𝑡 ? This is the essence of the concept of resilience. A resilient system is defined as a

system that can recover quickly from a shock (Holling, 1973;). This gains importance in the

presence of adverse shocks (Di Falco and Chavas, 2008; Chavas and Di Falco, 2016). For

example, in ecology, a resilient system would recover quickly from an adverse shock; but a non-

resilient system may collapse. In economics, a resilient household would recover quickly from

an adverse income shock; but a non-resilient household would not. While adverse shocks always

have negative short term effects, resilience means such effects would eventually disappear in the

longer term. But non-resilient systems would behave differently: they would see persistent

longer term effects.

        The dominant root 𝜆1 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 ) provides useful insights on system dynamics. We discuss

three cases. First, consider the case where 𝜆1 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 ) is close to 0 for all (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 ). This

system would exhibit little dynamics and any shock would have minor or no long term effects. In

a second case, assume that |𝜆1 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 )| is positive but less than 1 for all (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 ). Then, there


                                                     7
would be a dynamic response to any shock. But having |𝜆1 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 )| < 1 means that the impact

of a shock would die down over time and eventually disappear in the long term. In this case, the

magnitude of the dominant root remains useful. Having |𝜆1 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 )| close to 0 (close to 1)

means a rapid (slow) decay of the temporal effects of a shock. In other words, a rise in

|𝜆1 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 )| ∈ (0,1) corresponds to stronger impacts of a shock in the intermediate term.

Third, consider the case where |𝜆1 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 )| is greater than 1 for some (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 ). As discussed

above, this corresponds to local instability in the neighborhood of (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 ). A possible

situation is that this local instability varies with the neighborhood. To illustrate, consider a

system where 𝑁1 , 𝑁2 , 𝑁3 are three different neighborhoods where |𝜆1 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 )| < 1 when

(𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 ) ∈ 𝑁1 ∪ 𝑁3 but |𝜆1 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 )| > 1 when (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 ) ∈ 𝑁2 . This system exhibits local

stability in neighborhoods 𝑁1 and 𝑁3, but local instability in neighborhood 𝑁2. Local instability

in 𝑁2 means that dynamics would tend to move 𝑦𝑡 away from 𝑁2. In situations where 𝑁2 is

surrounded by 𝑁1 and 𝑁3 , this would identify points in 𝑁2 as tipping points, i.e. as points where

𝑦𝑡 would tend to escape from as they move toward locally stable neighborhoods. In this case,

knowing which locally stable neighborhood (𝑁1 or 𝑁3 ) is more likely to be visited would be of

interest. For example, if being in 𝑁1 is seen as being undesirable, then an escape from 𝑁2 to 𝑁3

would be seen as a better scenario than moving from 𝑁2 to 𝑁1.

       These patterns are illustrated in Figure 1 under four scenarios. Figure 1 shows how |𝜆1 |

can vary with 𝑒𝑡 , where higher (lower) values of 𝑒𝑡 are interpreted as favorable (unfavorable)

shocks. The first scenario is the case where 𝜆1 is constant. This occurs when the dynamics is

represented by a linear autoregressive (AR) process, in which case the dynamic response to

shocks does not depend on the situation considered Scenarios 2-4 are associated with nonlinear

dynamics where 𝜆1 is not constant. Scenario 2 exhibits a pattern where |𝜆1 | has an inverted U-


                                                   8
shape with respect to 𝑒𝑡 , with a zone of instability (where |𝜆1 | > 1) surrounded by two zones of

stability (where |𝜆1 | < 1): a favorable zone (where 𝑒𝑡 is high), and an unfavorable zone (where

𝑒𝑡 is low). It means that the forward path of 𝑦𝑡 would tend to escape from the instable zone. And

in the case where there is a low probability of escaping from the unfavorable stable zone, this

would identify this zone as a trap. Scenario 3 shows a situation where there is a zone of

instability but it occurs only for low values of 𝑒𝑡 . This is an example of resilience where the

dynamics would move the system away from unfavorable outcomes. Finally, Scenario 4 shows a

situation where there is zone of instability but it occurs only for high values of 𝑒𝑡 . This represents

a collapse where the dynamics moves the system away from favorable outcomes. These

examples illustrate that many patterns of dynamics are possible.2 Note that the dynamics would

gain additional complexities when we note that |𝜆1 (𝑤𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 )| can vary with both 𝑒𝑡 and 𝑤𝑡−1 .

The empirical challenge to evaluating these complexities is addressed in section 3 below.

       Under stochastic dynamics, a related issue is: What are the implications of dynamics for

the distribution of 𝑦𝑡 in the long run? To address this question, note that the dynamics in (3) can

be alternatively written in terms of a Markov chain (Billingsley, 1961; Meyn and Tweedie,

1993). Consider partitioning the space ℝ into K mutually exclusive intervals {𝑣1 , … , 𝑣𝐾 }. To

illustrate, consider the case where 𝑚 = 1. Letting 𝑀 = {1, … , 𝐾}, we have

               𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝑦𝑡 ∈ 𝑣𝑖 ) = ∑{𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏[𝑦𝑡 ∈ 𝑣𝑖 | 𝑦𝑡 = 𝑓(𝑦𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 ), 𝑦𝑡−1 ∈ 𝑣𝑗 ]
                                   𝑗∈𝑀


                       𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏[𝑦𝑡−1 ∈ 𝑣𝑗 ]}                                                        (5a)

for 𝑖 ∈ 𝑀. Under time invariance, equation (5a) can be written as the Markov chain model

               𝑝𝑡 = 𝐴 𝑝𝑡−1                                                                      (5b)




                                                  9
                            ′
where 𝑝𝑡 = (𝑝𝑡,1 , … , 𝑝𝑡,𝐾 ) is a (𝐾 × 1) vector with 𝑝𝑡,𝑗 = 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝑦𝑡 ∈ 𝑣𝑗 ), 𝑗 ∈ 𝑀, and 𝐴 is a

(𝐾 × 𝐾) matrix of Markov transition probabilities. The Markov matrix 𝐴 has a dominant root

equal to 1. Under time-invariant transition probabilities, when this dominant root is unique, the

dynamic system (5b) has a unique stationary equilibrium given by 𝑝 𝑒 = lim 𝑝𝑡 for all initial
                                                                               𝑡→∞

conditions 𝑝0. This provides a basis to evaluate the long run distribution of 𝑦. This long run

distribution will depend on the underlying dynamics. Again, the long run distribution of 𝑦 can

exhibit many patterns. For example, the long run probability density of 𝑦𝑡 could exhibit a single

peak with little skewness (e.g., under Gaussian shocks and a linear AR process). Alternatively, it

could be skewed when the dynamics implies an escape from low outcomes (under resilience) or

from high outcomes (under collapse). Finally, it could exhibits multiple peaks (e.g., when a

system tends to escape from a zone of instability toward surrounding zones of stability, leading

to a bimodal density in the long run). Again, these examples indicate that many patterns of long

run distribution are possible, stressing the importance of a flexible approach in the empirical

investigation of dynamics.



3. Econometric Analysis

        Consider the case where equation (3) takes the general form 𝑦𝑡 = 𝑓(𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑝 , 𝑥𝑡 , 𝑒𝑡 )

where 𝑥𝑡 is a vector of explanatory variables affecting 𝑦𝑡 at time 𝑡. Define the conditional

distribution function of 𝑦𝑡 as 𝐹 (𝑣 | 𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 , 𝑥𝑡 ) = 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏[𝑦𝑡 ≤ 𝑣 | 𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 , 𝑥𝑡 ] =

𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏[𝑓(𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 , 𝑥𝑡 , 𝑒𝑡 ) ≤ 𝑣]. The distribution function 𝐹 (𝑣 | 𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 , 𝑥𝑡 ) is

conditional on lagged values (𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 ) and on 𝑥𝑡 . Define the associated conditional

quantile function as the inverse function 𝑞(𝑟 |𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 , 𝑥𝑡 ) ≡

𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑣 {𝑣: 𝐹(𝑣 |𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 , 𝑥𝑡 ) ≥ 𝑟} where 𝑟 ∈ (0,1) is the 𝑟 𝑡ℎ quantile. When 𝑟 = 0.5, this

                                                    10
includes as special case the conditional median 𝑞(0.5 |𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 , 𝑥𝑡 ). Both the distribution

function 𝐹 (𝑣 |𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 , 𝑥𝑡 ) and the quantile function 𝑞 (𝑟 |𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 , 𝑥𝑡 ) are generic:

they provide a general characterization of the dynamics of 𝑦. In the rest of the paper, we will

make extensive use of the quantile function 𝑞(𝑟 |𝑦𝑡−1 , … 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 , 𝑥𝑡 ) in the analysis of the

dynamics of 𝑦𝑡 .

        Relying on the conditional quantile function 𝑞(𝑟 |𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 , 𝑥𝑡 ), we focus our

attention on the case where the conditional quantile function takes the form

𝑞(𝑟 |𝑦1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 , 𝑥𝑡 ) = 𝑋(𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 , 𝑥𝑡 ) 𝛽(𝑟), 𝑟  (0, 1), where 𝑋() is a (1 × 𝐾) vector

and 𝛽(𝑟) ∈ ℝ𝐾 is a (𝐾 × 1) vector of parameters. This restricts the analysis to situations where

conditional quantiles are linear in the parameters𝛽(𝑟). This specification allows the parameters

𝛽(𝑟) to vary across quantiles, thus providing a flexible representation of the underlying

distribution function and its dynamics. In addition, the function 𝑋(𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 , 𝑥𝑡 ) can

possibly be nonlinear in (𝑦𝑡−1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 ) thus allowing for nonlinear dynamics.

        In the analysis presented below, we consider an econometric model specification of the

form

                𝑞(𝑟 |𝑦1 , … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑚 , 𝑥𝑡 ) = 𝛽0 (𝑟, 𝑥𝑡 ) + ∑𝑚
                                                           𝑗=1 𝛽𝑗 (𝑟, 𝑥𝑡 ) 𝑦𝑡−𝑗 .                      (6)

        To illustrate the flexibility of this specification, note that it reduces to a standard

autoregressive model of order 𝑚, AR(m) (e.g., see Enders, 2010), when 𝛽𝑗 (𝑟, 𝑥𝑡 ) = 𝛽𝑗 , 𝑗 =

1, … , 𝑚, for all 𝑟 ∈ (0, 1) and all 𝑥𝑡 , i.e. when the autoregression parameters 𝛽𝑗 ’s are constant

and do not vary across quantiles. When the intercept 𝛽0 (𝑟, 𝑥𝑡 ) varies across quantiles 𝑟, this

provide a flexible representation of the distribution function (e.g., it allows for any variance,

skewness and kurtosis). Also, when 𝛽0 (𝑟, 𝑥𝑡 ) varies with 𝑥𝑡 , this allows 𝑥𝑡 to shift the intercept.

But an AR(m) model is restrictive in two important ways: 1/ it is restricted to linear dynamics in

                                                     11
the mean; and 2/ it does not provide a flexible representation of dynamics in variance, skewness

or kurtosis. Such limitations have stimulated more general specifications capturing dynamics in

variance (e.g., the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) model

proposed by Bollerslev (1986)) and non-linear dynamics (e.g., Markov switching models

(Hamilton, 1989), threshold autoregression (TAR) models (Tong, 1990) and smooth transition

autoregressive (STAR) models (Van Dijk et al., 2002)).

       When 𝛽𝑗 (𝑟, 𝑥𝑡 ) = 𝛽𝑗 (𝑟), 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑚, the above specification reduces to the Quantile

Autoregressive model QAR(m) proposed by Koenker and Xiao (2006). Unlike an AR(m), the

QAR(m) model allows the autoregression parameters 𝛽𝑗 (𝑟) to vary across quantiles 𝑟 ∈ (0,1),

thus permitting dynamics to differ in different parts of the distribution. In the more general case,

𝛽𝑗 (𝑟, 𝑥𝑡 ) can vary with the explanatory variables 𝑥𝑡 , allowing economic conditions to affect

dynamics.

       In addition, considering the case where the state space ℝ is partitioned into 𝐾 subsets

                                    1             ∈𝑆
ℝ = {𝑆1, … , 𝑆𝐾 }, define 𝑑𝑘,𝑡−𝑗 = { } when 𝑦𝑡−𝑗 { 𝑘 } , 𝑘 = 1, … , 𝐾, 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑚. Depending
                                    0             ∉ 𝑆𝑘

on the value taken by the lagged variable 𝑦𝑡−𝑗 , this identifies 𝐾 regimes (𝑆1 , … , 𝑆𝐾 ) with the

𝑑𝑘,𝑡−𝑗 ′𝑠 being variables capturing the switching between regimes, 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑚. When 𝑥𝑡 includes

the variables 𝑑𝑘,𝑡−𝑗 ′𝑠, this allows the autoregression parameter 𝛽𝑗 (𝑟, 𝑥𝑡 ) to vary across the

𝐾 regimes, 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑚. The general case corresponds to a Threshold Quantile Autoregressive

(TQAR(m)) model where, for each lag 𝑗, 𝛽𝑗 (𝑟, 𝑥𝑡 ) can vary both across quantiles 𝑟 ∈ (0,1) and

across regimes (Galvao et al., 2011; Chavas and Di Falco, 2016). When 𝛽𝑗 (𝑟, 𝑥𝑡 ) = 𝛽𝑗 (𝑥𝑡 ), 𝑗 =

1, … , 𝑚, (i.e., when the autoregression parameters do not vary across quantiles), a TQAR(m)

reduces to a threshold autoregression (TAR(m)) model (see Tong (1990)). And as noted above, a


                                                  12
TQAR(m) model includes as special cases a QAR(m) model (obtained when 𝛽𝑗 (𝑟, 𝑥𝑡 ) =

𝛽𝑗 (𝑟), 𝑗 = 1, … 𝑚), as well as a AR(m) model (obtained when 𝛽𝑗 (𝑟, 𝑥𝑡 ) = 𝛽𝑗 , 𝑗 = 1, … 𝑚). In

general, a TQAR(m) model is very flexible at representing nonlinear dynamics. Indeed, in a

TQAR(m) model and for each lag 𝑗, the autoregression parameter 𝛽𝑗 (𝑟, 𝑥𝑡 ) can vary with the

value of the current variable 𝑦𝑡 (as captured by the quantile 𝑟), with the value of the lagged

variable 𝑦𝑡−𝑗 (as captured by the regime-switching variables 𝑑𝑘,𝑡−𝑗 ′𝑠), and with the value of

other variables in 𝑥𝑡 . A TQAR(m) model will be used below in our empirical investigation of

dynamics.

       Consider a sample of 𝑛 observations on (𝑦, 𝑋), where 𝑋 is a vector of explanatory

variables and 𝑞(𝑟 | 𝑋) = 𝑋 𝛽(𝑟), 𝑟  (0, 1). Denote the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ observation by (𝑦𝑖 , 𝑋𝑖 ), 𝑖 ∈ 𝑁 ≡

{1, … , 𝑛}. For a given quantile 𝑟 ∈ (0, 1) and following Koenker (2005), the quantile regression

estimate of 𝛽(𝑟) is

               𝛽̂(𝑟) ∈ 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛𝛽 {∑𝑖∈𝑁 𝜌𝑟 (𝑦𝑖 − 𝑋𝑖 𝛽)},                                              (7)

where 𝑟 (𝑤 ) = 𝑤 [𝑟 – 𝐼(𝑤 < 0)] and 𝐼(∙) is the indicator function. As discussed in Koenker

(2005), the quantile estimator 𝛽̂ (𝑟) in (7) is a minimum distance estimator with desirable

statistical properties. The quantile estimator (7) applied to the dynamic specification (6) will

provide the basis for our empirical analysis presented next.



4. An Application to Wheat Productivity

       Our investigation proceeds studying the dynamics of wheat productivity in Kansas. The

analysis involves annual wheat yield in Kansas over the period 1885-2012 (USDA, 2015). This

covers the period of the American Dust Bowl (in the 1930’s) when the US Great Plains were

affected by a major environmental catastrophe. The Dust Bowl was the joint product of adverse

                                                 13
weather shocks (a major drought) and poor agricultural management. The Dust Bowl is

remembered by two of its main features: 1/ severe drought leading to crop failure and triggering

massive migration out of the western Great Plains; and 2/ soil and wind erosion (Hornbeck,

2012). The Dust Bowl had short term effects on agricultural production (as drought generated

crop failure). But it also had longer effects: soil erosion had lasting adverse effects on land

productivity (Hornbeck, 2012). Kansas has been the leading wheat producing state in the US

(USDA, 2015). As noted in the introduction, this makes studying wheat yield dynamics in

Kansas a great case study of the response of productivity to environmental shocks.

       The data on wheat yield (t/ha) in Kansas over the period 1885-2012 were obtained from

USDA (2015). They are presented in Figure 2. Figure 2 shows three interesting features. First, as

expected, the early 1930’s (corresponding to the Dust Bowl) is a period exhibiting low yields.

Second, wheat yields have been trending upward, especially after 1940, indicating the presence

of significant productivity growth and technological progress over the last 70 years. Third, there

is much variability in yield over time, reflecting the impact of various environmental shocks

(including weather shocks).

       Our investigation explores the distribution of wheat yield as if we were farmers. Since

weather shocks are mostly unpredictable, it means that the distribution of yield is evaluated ex

ante at the beginning of the growing season, i.e. before weather shocks become observable. In

the ex-ante assessment, the yield distribution is thus unconditional with respect to all

unobservable factors affecting farm productivity (including weather effects). In this context, the

investigation of dynamic adjustments in Kansas wheat yield is presented next.




                                                 14
5. Preliminary Analysis

          We start with a simple analysis of yield dynamics. With wheat yield 𝑦𝑡 as the dependent

variable, we first estimate simple autoregressive models. Table 1 presents the estimation results

for alternative model specifications. Two time trend variables are included in all models: a

                                                               0
general time trend 𝑡 = 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 − 2000 and a time trend 𝑡1 = {           } when 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 =
                                                          𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 − 1935

    < 1935
{         }, where 𝑡1 captures technological progress after 1935. The models include
    ≥ 1935

autoregressive models of order m, AR(m), with m = 1, 2. The AR(1) model shows that lag-1

coefficient is 0.703 and highly significant. This documents the presence of dynamics in yield

adjustments. The lagged-2 coefficient in the AR(2) model is not statistically significant. A

formal Wald test of the AR(1) model as a null hypothesis against the AR(2) model gave a p-

value of 0.709, indicating that there is no significant dynamics going beyond one-period lag.

          Table 1 also reports threshold autoregressive models (TAR(m) allowing the

autoregression parameters to vary across three regimes (𝑑𝑖 , 𝑑2 , 𝑑3 ). The regimes are defined such

             1            ∈ 𝑆𝑖,𝑡
that 𝑑𝑖,𝑡 = { } when 𝑦𝑡 {        }, 𝑖 = 1,2,3, with 𝑆1,𝑡 = [−∞, 𝑏1,𝑡 ], 𝑆2,𝑡 = (𝑏1,𝑡 , 𝑏3,𝑡 ] and 𝑆3,𝑡 =
             0           ∉ 𝑆𝑖,𝑡

(𝑏3,𝑡 , ∞], 𝑏1,𝑡 and 𝑏3,𝑡 being respectively the 1/3 and 2/3 quantile of the yield distribution

obtained from the AR(1) model reported in Table 1. Thus, regime 1 means that yield is in the 1/3

lower quantile of the yield distribution; and regime 3 means that yield is in the 1/3 upper quantile

of the yield distribution. In this context, having 𝑑1,𝑡−1 = 1 corresponds to situations of low lag-1

yield where 𝑦𝑡−1 is in regime 1. And having 𝑑3,𝑡−1 = 1 corresponds to situations of high lag-1

yield where 𝑦𝑡−1 is in regime 3. In TAR(m) models, the autoregression parameters are allowed

to shift across the three regimes. For a TAR(1), Table 1 shows that the lag-1 coefficient is 0.409

in regime 2, 0.507 in regime 1 and 0.407 in regime 3. Importantly, the difference in coefficients

                                                   15
between regime 1 and regime 2 (0.098) is statistically significant at the 10 percent level. This

provides statistical evidence that yield dynamics differ across regimes. This is our first hint of

nonlinear dynamics. We also estimated a TAR(2) model. As reported in table 1, the lag-2

coefficients of the TAR(2) model are not statistically significant. A formal Wald test of the

TAR(1) model as null hypothesis against a TAR(2) model gave a p-value is 0.959. Again, this

indicates no significant dynamics going beyond one-period lag. On that basis, we continue our

analysis based on autoregressive models of order 1.

       Note that all estimated models reported in Table 1 shows that the overall time trend 𝑡 is

not statistically significant, but the effect of the post-1935 time trend 𝑡1 is always positive and

statistically significant. This reflects the presence of significant improvements in agricultural

technology over the last 70 years.3 Interestingly, the coefficient of the 𝑡1 variable is smaller in

the TAR(1) model (0.017) compared to the AR(1) model (0.023). This indicates that productivity

growth interacts with changing dynamics across regimes.



6. Quantile Dynamics

       Our preliminary analysis found statistical support for a TAR(1) specification. A discussed

in section 3, while a TAR model allows the autoregression parameters to vary across regimes, it

does not allow them to vary across quantiles of the current yield distribution. We now extend the

analysis by considering a threshold quantile autoregression (TQAR) model. As noted, a TQAR

model provides a flexible representation of nonlinear dynamics by allowing autoregression

parameters to change both across regimes and across quantiles. This section focuses on an ax

ante analysis of quantile dynamics. An ex post quantile analysis (conditional on weather shocks)

is presented in the next section.


                                                  16
        Table 2 reports parameter estimates of a TQAR(1) model applied wheat yield for selected

quantiles (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9). The variables are the same as in the TAR(1) model reported in

Table 1. Table 2 shows how the dynamics vary across quantiles. We tested the null hypothesis

that the regression parameters are the same across quantiles (0.1, 0.5, 0.9). With 10 degrees of

freedom, the chi-square test value was 5.703 with a p-value less than 0.01. This implies a strong

rejection of the TAR(1) model in favor of the TQAR(1) model. Thus, we find statistical evidence

that the regression parameters vary across quantiles. Table 2 shows that the lag-1 coefficient

under regime 2 is 0.687 at the 0.1 quantile. This coefficient is larger than for higher quantiles,

indicating the presence of stronger dynamics in the lower tail of the yield distribution. Table 2

also reports that, for the 0.1 quantile, the lag-1 coefficient differs between regime 1 (where

𝑑1,𝑡−1 = 1) and regime 2. The difference is 0.234. Using bootstrapping for hypothesis testing,

we find this difference to be statistically significant at the 1 percent level. This provides evidence

against a QAR model and in favor of a TQAR specification. The lag-1 coefficient for the 0.1

quantile is 0.921 under regime 1 (when lagged yield is low), which is much higher than under the

other regimes. This documents the presence of much stronger dynamics in the lower tail of yield

distribution and when lagged yield is low. This is one of our key findings: dynamic yield

adjustments to shocks become quantitatively very different under repeated adverse shocks. As

we show below, this is a scenario where adjustments also become qualitatively different.

        In addition, Table 2 shows the effects of the 𝑡1 trend variable are much stronger in the

upper tail of the distribution. This indicates that technological progress has contributed to a rapid

increase in the upper tail of the yield distribution. But such effects are weaker in the lower tail of

the distribution. This reflects significant shifts in the shape of the yield distribution over time (as

further discussed below).


                                                  17
       To conduct robustness checks, we explored issues related to the number of lags used in

our dynamic analysis. While Table 2 reports estimates for an TQAR(1) model, we also estimated

a TQAR(2) model. In a way consistent with the results shown in Table 1, we found that none of

the lag-2 coefficients were statistically significant. This indicates that the TQAR(1) model

provides an appropriate representation of dynamics. On that basis, the analysis presented in the

rest of the paper focuses on a model with one-period lag.



7. Implications

       Our estimated TQAR(1) model provides a refined representation of the nonlinear

dynamics of yield. As noted in section 3, it allows for flexible patterns of stability and instability.

To explore in more details the nature and implications of these patterns, we estimate our

TQAR(1) model for all quantiles, thus providing a representation of the whole distribution of

wheat yield and its dynamics.

       First, we use our TQAR(1) model estimated for all quantile to evaluate the distribution

function of wheat yield at selected sample points. The resulting simulated distribution is

presented in Figure 3 for selected years (1950, 1970, 1990, 2010). As expected, over time, the

distribution shifts strongly to the right, reflecting the major effects of technological progress on

agricultural productivity. Interestingly, the yield distribution exhibits greater spread (and thus

greater risk exposure) in 2010 than in previous years, indicating an increase in the magnitude of

unpredictable shocks (possibly due to climate change).

       Next, using equation (4), we examine the dynamic properties of our estimated TQAR(1)

                                         𝜕𝐻
by evaluating the associated root 𝜆 =           . Under nonlinear dynamics, this root varies with the
                                        𝜕𝑦𝑡−1


situation considered. As discussed in section 2, dynamics is locally stable (unstable) at points


                                                    18
where 𝜆 < 1 (> 1). We calculated the root 𝜆 for all quantiles and all three regimes. The results

are reported in Figure 4. Figure 4 document the patterns of nonlinear dynamics associated with

our estimated TQAR(1) model. It shows three important results. First, from Figure 4, the root 𝜆

is similar across all three regimes for quantiles greater than 0.3; but it exhibits different dynamics

for lower quantiles (less than 0.3). More specifically, compared to other regimes, the root 𝜆 is

larger under regime 1 (when lagged yield is low) and in the lower tail of the distribution. This is

consistent with the discussion of Table 2 presented in the previous section.

       Second, Figure 4 shows that the root 𝜆 remains in the unit circle (with |𝜆| < 1) in many

situations, including regimes 2 and 3 (when lagged yield are not low) or the absence of adverse

current shock (for quantiles greater than 0.2). This implies that the system is locally stable in

many situations, especially in situations excluding adverse shocks. This is an important result:

investigating dynamics in situations around or above the median could only uncover evidence of

local stability. As discussed in section 2, this would preclude finding any evidence of traps.

       Third, Figure 4 shows that the root 𝜆 can be larger than 1 but only in situations of

successive adverse shocks, i.e. when both 𝑦𝑡 and 𝑦𝑡−1 are in the lower tail of the yield

distribution. Associating 𝜆 > 1 with local instability, we thus find evidence of local instability in

the presence of adverse shocks. This has several implications. First, we have identified a zone of

local dynamic instability, i.e. a zone of tipping points where the system tends to escape from.

Second, associating a zone of instability with successive adverse shocks is an important finding.

This raises the question: Is the zone of instability associated with resilience? Or is it associated

with a trap or collapse? It depends on the path of escape. As discussed in section 2, if the escape

from the zone of instability is toward more favorable situations, the system would be

characterized as resilient (e.g., as represented by Scenario 3 in Figure 1). Alternatively, if the


                                                  19
escape is toward more unfavorable situations, the system may be experiencing a trap or a

collapse (e.g., Scenario 4 in Figure 1).

       In our case, the zone of instability occurs only under successive unfavorable shocks

generating very low yields. It suggests that starting in this zone, there is only one place to go:

toward higher yields. This suggests that our zone of instability may be associated with a resilient

system that tends to escape from low productivity toward higher productivity under adverse

shocks. Indeed, Figure 4 exhibits patterns that are similar to Scenario 3 in Figure 1. To examine

this issue in more details, we consider the Markov chain representation of our TQAR(1) model,

as given in equations (5a)-(5b). Using 𝐾 = 50 and evaluated under conditions occurring in 1995,

we obtained the Markov matrix 𝐴 in (5b). The matrix 𝐴 has a unique unit root, indicating that the

Markov chain is stationary and has a long run distribution. The second root of 𝐴 has modulus

0.37, indicating a fairly fast adjustment toward the long run distribution. The evolution of the

probability function of wheat yield was simulated from equation (5b), starting from a uniform

distribution over the range of the data. Starting at t = 0, the simulated probabilities are reported in

Figure 5 under three scenarios: in the short run (after 2 periods, t =2), in the intermediate run

(after 4 periods, t = 4) and in the long run (after 200 periods, t =200). Figure 5 shows several

important results. First, the adjustments toward the steady-state probability function occurs fairly

quickly. Second, the simulated probability functions depart from the normal distribution in two

ways: 1/ they exhibit multiple peaks; and 2/ they are skewed, with a left tail that is much longer

than the right tail. Indeed, in all scenarios, Shapiro-Wilk tests of normality have a p-value less

than 0.01, providing strong evidence of departure from normality. Third, Figure 5 shows that the

probability of being in the left tail of the probability function declines fast as one moves forward

in time (as t goes from 2 to 4 to 200). This implies a dynamic escape from unfavorable events


                                                  20
located in the lower tail of the distribution. Since escaping an unfavorable zone is the essence of

resilience, if follows that Figure 5 documents the presence of resilience. In other words, our

estimated TQAR(1) model applied to wheat yield dynamics has two key characteristics: 1/ a

zone of instability occurs in the presence of successive unfavorable shocks; and 2/ resilience

arises as the underlying dynamic process tends to escape from this unfavorable zone. The

significance of these findings is further discussed in section 8 below.

       As discussed in section 2, the TQAR model reported in Table 2 is a reduced form model.

While a reduced form model provides a valid representation of dynamics, it does not provide

structural information on the nature of dynamics. In the Kansas agro-ecosystem, a major source

of shocks comes from the weather. Indeed, the Dust Bowl was the result of a major drought that

hit the Western Great Plains in the 1930’s. This suggests evaluating a structural model where

weather variables are explicit determinants of Kansas wheat yield. On that basis, we also

specified and estimated a dynamic model of wheat yield including the effects of three weather

variables: rainfall in the previous fall 𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑓, rainfall in the spring 𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑠 and average temperature

during the growing season 𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝. Data on these variables were obtained from Burnette et al.

(2010), Burnette and Stahle (2013) and NOAA (2016).4 These weather variables were introduced

in the model both as intercept shifters and as interactions with lagged yield. These interaction

effects allow yield dynamics to vary with weather conditions. Estimates of the associated

quantile regression equation is presented in Table A1 in the Appendix. As expected, Table A1

shows that weather has statistically significant effects on yield. Rainfall in the previous fall has a

positive effect on yield, especially on the lower tail of the distribution. Temperature has a

negative effect on yield through its interaction effect with lagged yield, especially in the upper

tail of the distribution. This documents that both drought and high temperature have adverse


                                                  21
effects on agricultural productivity. Such results are consistent with previous research (e.g., Tack

et al., 2012, 2015). Table A1 also shows the presence of dynamics. Lagged yield has statistically

significant effects on current yield either directly or through its interaction with temperature.

       To evaluate the nature of dynamics in the structural model reported in table A1, we

calculated the root of the estimated dynamic process across quantiles. Interestingly, we found

that the root varies between -0.2 and +0.6 depending on the evaluation point. The root is always

in the unit circle for any quantile or any weather condition within the range of data. This implies

global stability. Thus, the dynamic model reported in Table A1 does not show any evidence of

instability. This contrasts with the reduced form model reported in table 2 (which exhibits local

instability as discussed above).5 While this result is somewhat surprising, it has two important

implications. First, since controlling for weather effects implies the disappearance of instability,

it means that there is close association between instability and weather shocks. In other words,

our reduced-from evidence of instability must be linked with weather shocks. Second, weather

being mostly unpredictable, we do not expect much dynamics in the determination of weather

shocks. This indicates that any linkage between weather and yield dynamics must be because of

the dynamic response of management and policy to weather shocks. We expand on this

interpretation below.



8. Discussion

       From our reduced form model, our first finding is about local dynamic instability arising

but only under unfavorable shocks. This is important. It suggests that a search for local

instability is unlikely to be successful if the analysis focuses on “average conditions”. This can

be problematic in economic research to the extent that most econometric analyses involve



                                                 22
estimating means or conditional means. While studying the properties of means and conditional

means can be interesting, it neglects key information related to events located in the tails of the

distribution. In a stochastic context, our findings indicate a need to expand analyses with a focus

on dynamics associated with rare and unfavorable events. This is a very intuitive argument. On

the positive side, increasing resilience is about improving the odds of escaping the long term

effects of facing adverse shocks. On the negative side, avoiding collapse or traps is about

reducing the odds of facing adverse conditions and increasing the odds of escaping toward better

outcomes. All escape scenarios are about identifying local instability. Our TQAR model provides

a good basis to support such inquiries.

       Our second finding is also very interesting: applied to wheat yield dynamics, our analysis

uncovered evidence of resilience as local instability tends to create an escape away from

unfavorable events toward improved outcomes. But it also raises questions about the process

supporting such dynamics. Below, we reflect on this process and the interpretations and

implications of our findings.

       As noted above, our analysis has relied on an ex ante analysis of yield dynamics and

focused on assessing the distribution of yield based on information available at the beginning of

each growing season. Since weather conditions are mostly unpredictable, we treated the effects

of rainfall and temperature during the growing season as part of the shocks represented by the

yield distribution function. This raises the question: what constitutes an adverse shock? Much

research has examined the determinants of wheat yield (e.g., Olmstead and Rhode, 2011; Tack et

al., 2015). Both rainfall and temperature are major factors affecting wheat yield (e.g., Tack et al.,

2015; Chavas and Di Falco, 2016). In particular, farming in the western Great Plains faces much

rainfall uncertainty as it has experienced repeated periods of severe droughts (Burnette and



                                                 23
Stahle, 2013). One of the most severe drought occurred in the 1930’s: it led massive crop failures

and to the Dust Bowl. Because of the massive soil erosion it generated, the Dust Bowl is often

seen as an environmental catastrophe (Hornbeck, 2012). Yet, our evidence of resilience suggests

a different interpretation.

        First, the Dust Bowl induced significant changes in agricultural management and policy.

A major federal policy change was the creation of the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) in 1935.

The SCS played a major role of reducing the incidence of wind erosion in the Western Great

Plains (Hurt, 1981). The circumstances under which the SCS was created are of interest. Starting

in 1932, severe droughts caused widespread crop failure in the Great Plains, exposing the soil to

blowing winds and generating large dust storms. On March 6 1935 and again on March 21 1935,

dust clouds passed over Washington D.C. and darkened the sky as Congress was having hearings

on soil conservation legislation. This motivated policy maker to act: The Soil Conservation Act

was signed by President Roosevelt on April 27, 1935, creating the Soil Conservation Service

(SCS) in USDA. This was an example of rather fast policy response to a crisis.

        The Dust Bowl also stimulated significant adjustments in agricultural management. The

SCS established demonstration projects to persuade farmers to adopt more sustainable tillage and

cropping practices (including contour plowing, terracing, strip cropping, planting drought

resistant crops and greater reliance on pasture). For participating farmers, the SCS programs

contributed to improving farm practices, increasing land values and boosting farm income (Hurt,

1981). As a result, farmers shifted land from wheat into hay and pasture; and they implemented

new soil conservation techniques (Hornbeck, 2012, p. 1480). Such changes helped mitigate the

adverse effects of severe droughts.




                                               24
       Second, the Dust Bowl did not start a process of desertification of the Western Great

Plains. On the contrary, cultivated farmland increased during the 1930’s and 1940’s (Hornbeck,

2012, 1480-1490). This indicates that the 1930’s droughts stimulated major innovations in

agricultural management and policy. To the extent that these changes reduced the adverse effects

of droughts, they contributed to creating a more resilient agro-ecological system.

       Thus, we associate our evidence of resilience with induced innovations in both policy and

management that followed the Dust Bowl. This interpretation raises the question: What would

have been the effects of the Dust Bowl without such innovations? Of course, this is a

hypothetical scenario that we have not observed. Still, we can hypothesize about what might

have happened. First, our evidence of resilience would likely disappear. For example, without

innovations, continued soil erosion may have led to the desertification of the Western Great

Plains. Under this scenario, the adverse long term effects of the Dust Bowl assessed by Hornbeck

(2012) would have been much worse. The agro-ecosystem of the Western Great Plains may have

collapsed. In this case, the zone of instability identified in Figure 4 would move to the right. In

the context of Figure 1, this would correspond to a move from scenario 3 (resilience) toward

scenario 2 or even toward scenario 4 (collapse). The process of collapse would occur when

adverse shocks put the system in the zone of instability with a tendency to move toward lower

outcomes (e.g., scenario 4 in Figure 1). Figure 5 would also change. Under collapse, the lower

tail of the yield distribution would become much thicker. And the probability function may

exhibit multiple peaks in the lower tail, with a new peak possibly rising in the extreme lower tail

(corresponding to collapse). In this case, a key issue would be whether “valleys” exist in-

between peaks in the probability density function. The presence of valleys would indicate that

there are positive probabilities of escaping the lower tail of the distribution. Alternatively, the



                                                  25
absence of such valleys would mean any collapse obtained under adverse shocks would be

irreversible.

        Of course, these hypothetical scenarios differ from the ones reported in Figure 4 and 5.

Yet, our discussion has three important implications. First, evaluating resilience/collapse/traps

must focus on the nature of dynamics under adverse shocks. As noted above, just knowing what

is happening “on average” is not sufficient. Second, the assessment of local instability is crucial.

Our TQAR approach provides a great analytical framework to conduct this assessment. Third, in

general, the dynamic response to adverse shocks depends on management and policy. Our

discussion has pointed out the role of innovations. On the negative side, collapse/traps are more

likely to arise in the absence of management and policy response to adverse shocks. On the

positive side, induced innovations in management and policy can be a crucial part of designing a

more resilient system. Our analysis indicates the important role played by the induced response

of management and policy to adverse shocks.



9. Conclusion

        This paper has studied the dynamic response to shocks, with an application an agro-

ecosystem productivity. It has proposed a threshold quantile autoregression (TQAR) model as a

flexible representation of stochastic dynamics. It has focused on the identification of zones of

local instability and their usefulness in the characterization of resilience and traps. The

usefulness of the approach was illustrated in an application to the dynamics of wheat yield in

Kansas. The analysis examined the effects of extreme shocks both in the short run and in the

long run. It identified a zone of instability in the presence of successive adverse shocks. It also




                                                 26
finds evidence of resilience. We associate the resilience with induced innovations in

management and policy in response to adverse shocks.

       Our approach is generic and can be applied to the analysis of dynamics in any economic

system. Our empirical analysis focused on a particular agro-ecosystem. Our findings documented

the role of local instability in response adverse shocks. Such findings are expected to vary across

economic situations. This motivates a need to extend our analysis and its applications to other

economic conditions.

      be captured by the dynamic equation for 𝑧𝑡 in (1b).
2   Other possible scenarios (not shown in Figure 1) are when there is a zone of stability
      surrounded by zones of instability, or when instability is global (e.g., under chaos).

      increased use of fertilizer, greater reliance on irrigation, and improved farm management
