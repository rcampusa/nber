How does employer market power affect workers? We compute the concentration of new hires by
occupation and commuting zone in France using linked employer-employee data. Using
instrumental variables with worker and firm fixed effects, we find that a 10% increase in labor
market concentration decreases hires by 12.4% and the wages of new hires by nearly 0.9%, as
hypothesized by monopsony theory. Based on a simple merger simulation, we find that a merger
between the top two employers in the retail industry would be most damaging, with about 24
million euros in annual lost wages for new hires, and an 8000 decrease in annual hires.

1   INTRODUCTION

How does employer market power affect workers? A burgeoning literature has shown that
labor market concentration has a negative impact on wages (Azar et al., 2017; Benmelech
et al., 2018; Hershbein et al., 2018; Rinz, 2018; Lipsius, 2018; Abel et al., 2018; Martins,
2018; Qiu and Sojourner, 2019). From a policy perspective, this suggests that antitrust and
competition authorities should scrutinize prospective mergers between two companies for their
anticompetitive effects in the labor market (Marinescu and Hovenkamp, 2018; Naidu et al.,
2018; Marinescu and Posner, 2019). However, doing so requires the assessment of both wage
and employment effects of consolidations. While prior literature has examined the wage effects
of labor market concentration, it did not examine employment effects. Furthermore, the data
used was often incomplete in terms of industries and occupations covered. Therefore, it was
not possible to assess the size of the expected economy-wide wage and employment losses
resulting from employer consolidation via mergers.

In contrast, we leverage rich administrative data on firms and workers in France to measure
how increases in labor and product market concentration affect both wages and employment.
More specifically, our administrative data from France includes the date, occupation, and lo-
cation of all new hires. We link this data to workers' employment histories and to firm-level
data. We define labor market concentration as the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index for new hires
in an occupation (4-digits), commuting zone, and quarter. We find that the mean labor market
concentration in France is 0.172, considered by the American Department of Justice as a signal
of a moderately concentrated market. In turn, we are able to run regressions controlling for
worker and firm fixed effects, and for firm size and value added per worker. Using our esti-
mate of the wage and employment impacts of labor market concentration, we then simulate
the economy-wide effects of a horizontal merger between the two largest (by employment)
firms in each industry.

Our first finding concerns labor market concentration and its wage and employment impacts.
In our preferred wage specification, we control for market (occupation by commuting zone),
worker and firm fixed effects, and instrument labor market concentration with the inverse num-
ber of employers in other geographic markets for the same quarter and occupation, following
a similar strategy to Azar et al. (2017); Rinz (2018); Qiu and Sojourner (2019). We find that a
10% increase in labor market concentration decreases the wages for new hires by nearly 0.9%.
This negative effect was found to be highly robust across specifications. Furthermore, we find
that effects of labor market concentration are less negative in more unionized industries and
more severe when the worker is employed on a part-time basis. In our preferred specification
to measure the employment effects of concentration, we control for market fixed effects and in-
strument labor market concentration in the same way as before. We find that a 10% increase in
labor market concentration lowers new hires by about 12.4%. That labor market concentration


                                              2
decreases wages and hires is exactly what economic theory would predict in an oligopsonistic
labor market (Manning, 2011; Azar et al., 2019).

Our second finding concerns the impact of product market concentration on wages (Qiu and
Sojourner, 2019) and hires. Product market concentration is calculated at the industry by
commuting zone level. Since labor and product market concentrations are positively correlated,
we add this variable in all our main regressions to limit omitted variable bias. For our preferred
specification for new hires described above, we find that a 10% increase in product market
concentration increases wages by 0.09%, with a larger effect in more unionized industries. This
result is robust across specifications and consistent with rent sharing in unionized industries.
Furthermore, product market concentration decreases hires as predicted by oligopsony theory,
but not always significantly so.

Our third finding sheds new light on the expected impact of mergers and how antitrust au-
thorities could anticipate their effects. We simulate the impact of horizontal mergers between
the two largest employers in each industry by calculating the changes in labor market concen-
tration that such mergers would entail. We then apply our preferred estimate for the impact
of labor market concentration on wages and hires. We find that the economy-wide impact of
the merger varies with initial labor market concentration: mergers seem to be most damaging
for workers in labor markets in low levels of labor market concentration prior to the merger.
Compared to other industries, a merger in retail would be the most damaging: a merger be-
tween the top two employers in the retail industry would be most damaging with 24 million
euros of yearly lost wages for new hires, and about 8000 hires lost annually. These losses to
wages and hires take into account both effects on workers in the retail industry and workers
in other industries that share an occupational labor market with workers in the retail industry
(e.g. stock clerks in the temporary work industry). Effects on workers outside the retail in-
dustry are not negligible since they amount to about 25% of the total effect. After the retail
industry, a merger between the top two employers in the building maintenance industry would
be almost as damaging with annual wage losses of about 18 million euros for new hires, and a
6,000 decrease in yearly hires.

We make three key contributions to the literature. First, we use administrative data to obtain
the most comprehensive dataset to date on the labor market concentration of new hires by
occupation. Relying on hires is more accurate than relying on job postings (Azar et al., 2017,
2018, 2019; Hershbein et al., 2018) because not all companies post their jobs online. Data on
hires is more accurate for measuring current competition in the labor market than data on the
stock of employment, especially when such a stock is based on industries (Benmelech et al.,
2018; Rinz, 2018; Lipsius, 2018; Abel et al., 2018) rather than occupations. Our extensive
data further allows us to control not only for value added and firm fixed effects (Benmelech
et al., 2018) but also for worker fixed effects, thereby reducing the scope of omitted variable



                                                3
bias arising from worker composition effects.

Our data allows us to explore the effect of labor market concentration in the European context
of France: we show that the impact of labor market concentration on wages and employment
is negative even when unions are powerful and labor market regulations are stringent. This
adds to the evidence from Portugal (Martins, 2018), showing a negative impact of labor market
concentration on wages. Our detailed data also allows us to determine which workers suffer
the most from labor market concentration: we show more negative effects from concentra-
tion for vulnerable workers in unstable jobs (workers in part-time, temporary, or on-call work
arrangements) who are less well protected by labor market institutions.

Our second key contribution is to go beyond the wage effects of labor market concentration that
prior literature has estimated to examine the effects of labor and product market concentration
on hires. We find that both labor and product market concentration negatively affect hires, but
the effect is more precisely estimated for labor market concentration.

Our third key contribution is to shed light on how consolidation may affect both wages and
employment by simulating horizontal mergers between the two largest players (by employ-
ment) in each industry, adding to the literature on the effects of mergers (Brown and Medoff,
1987; Shleifer and Summers, 1988; Gokhale et al., 1995; Conyon et al., 2001; Gugler and Yur-
toglu, 2004; Margolis, 2006; Lehto and Böckerman, 2008; Siegel and Simons, 2010; Prager
and Schmitt, 2018). Comprehensive data is critical to measure the full impact of mergers: in
particular, we find that 25% of the impact of mergers affect workers in industries other than
the industry where the merger took place. Through this exercise, we provide a simple method
that can be used in practice by competition authorities to assess the likely impact of a merger.
In particular, we find that in France, mergers in retail and in building maintenance would be
the most damaging in terms of lost wages and jobs.

The paper proceeds as follows. First, Section 2 defines our measure of labor and product market
concentration, introduces the French matched employer-employee dataset, and describes the
statistical relationship between our main variables of interest. Second, Section 3 presents our
main econometric evidence with regards to impact of labor and product market concentration
on wages and employment. Finally, Section 4 presents the counter-factual exercise consisting
in simulating the impact of mergers of the top two employers in each industry on the labor
market using the estimates from the penultimate section.

2     MEASURING LABOR AND PRODUCT MARKET CONCENTRATION

2.1    DATA

Three main data sources are used in this paper. They form what is commonly referred to as
linked employer-employee data. First, the déclaration annuelle de données sociales (DADS) pro-
vides us with individual level data on wages, hours worked, occupation, industry, gender, and
age. Maintained by the French National Institute for Statistical and Economic Studies (INSEE),
this administrative dataset covers all French private and public sector workers. The subfile
fichier salariés allows us to identify individual workers and their primary source of income
(i.e, job providing them with the most income during a given year).Whilst this dataset is not
freely accessible, any researcher can request access to it through the Secure Data Access Centre
(CASD). Further description of this dataset can, for example, be found in Abowd et al. (1999).

Each worker is associated with a firm identifier. This firm identifier (code SIREN ) allows us to
link workers to the characteristics of their respective firms. These characteristics are those pro-
vided in standard financial disclosures at the yearly level. These financial disclosures stem from
the database Système unifié de statistique d'entreprises (SUSE; unified system of firm statistics)
also collected by INSEE. Its main dataset is called the (Fichier complet unifié de SUSE (FICUS;
complete unified file of SUSE). In 2007, it was replaced with Élaboration des Statistiques An-
nuelles d'Entreprise (ESANE). From this database, we get our controls for firm size and value
added per employee.

Finally, the survey on financial links between companies, Enquête sur les liaisons financières
entre sociétés (LIFI), is used to identify the business group to which firms belong. It surveys the
ownership and subsidiaries of companies, identified by the Siren number. Respondents must
identify a subsidiary if the company owns over 30,000 euros of its shares. This allows us to
identify business groups in a comprehensive way. Companies with at least one of the following
are surveyed each year : (a) own over 1.2 million euros of another company's shares, (b)
employ over 500 employees, (c) have a turnover over 60 million euros per year, (d) being
identified as a business group headquarter in the previous year, or (e) be foreign owned in
the previous year (i.e, at least 50% of its shares are owned from a foreign firm). When a firm
had no business group, we assigned its firm identification number (Siren) as its business group
identifier. This dataset has already been used by Cestone et al. (2017) and can be consulted
for further information.

Our sample selection procedure is the following. First, we only keep new hires. Given large
wage rigidities in France, we would expect changes in concentration to impact new hires and
have little effect on continuing workers. Second, we only keep private sector employees. We
also exclude state-sponsored workers, apprentices, and interns. We drop workers below 18
and above 67. Beyond the public sector, we also drop the non-governmental organizations,


                                                5
the art industry, museums, sports clubs, unions, and home production. Our data covers new
employees from 2011 to 2015 included. During these years, the data collection system did not
change, it is both the most recent and complete (in terms of response rate) version of the data1 .


2.2    DEFINITION OF THE HERFINDAHL-HIRSCHMAN INDEX (HHI)

We now define our measures of concentration. Labor Market Concentration is measured through
the Labor Market Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), as in Azar et al. (2017). This index mea-
sures concentration through market shares. Let                     o,m, t     be the set of firms hiring in occupation
o in market location m at time t . The number of workers hired by firm j is denoted                             j ,o,m, t .
The firm's labor market    (s L
                              j ,o,m, t )   share is then:

                                                                   j ,o,m, t
                                             sL
                                              j ,o,m, t =                                                        (2.1)
                                                            k    o,m, t      k,o,m, t



For example, if at a given time and area there is a total of 100 cleaners being hired, a firm
                                                                                    L
hiring 10 of these cleaners would have a 10% market share. The labor market HHI, HHIo ,m, t ,
sums the squares of these market shares:

                                                 L                                  2
                                              HHIo ,m, t =               sL
                                                                          j ,o,m, t                              (2.2)
                                                             j    m, t



One way to interpret the HHI Index is through the 2010 horizontal merger guidelines of the
American Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission. An HHI between 0,15 and
0,25 is indicative of a moderately concentrated market and above 0.25 as highly concentrated.

We also construct a product market HHI. We assign each worker to an industry based on their
employer. We identify the firms that have new hires in that geographic market from that same
industry. We then calculate the product market HHI using the national sales shares for these
firms. If the firms at the local level had the same share of sales as at the national level AND the
product market were local, then this way of calculating would mimic a localized measure of
labor market concentration. We also use an alternative national definition in the appendix: for
each worker, take the national sales concentration of their industry at time t , not taking into
account which firms are recruiting in the worker's local labor market.

Mathematically speaking, let           j,t   be the national revenue of firm j at time t (note that national
revenues are at the yearly level). We can then define the product market revenue share relevant

      Starting in 2009, the whole population in employment is covered by the dataset, commuting zones were
redefined in 2010, and non-response in 4-digit occupation is low and stable starting in 2010.

                                                                     HHIo ,m, t =                         sP

Despite using national sales of a company instead of the more ideal local sales, we believe this
measure to be adequate for large markets. For example, in a market like Paris, most firms in
an industry will likely recruit, and the sales share of each firm in Paris is likely to be similar to
the national share of sales. In a small local market, one firm ­ e.g. a supermarket ­ could be
very dominant, even though its share of national shares is very small. Although our product
market HHI under-estimates the degree of competition when local firms serve a large share of
the market, we believe the number of such markets to be few. Moreover, to the degree that
this error is systematic, our control variables will rely on variation across time rather than in
levels for identification. Finally, in Appendix E and F, we show, respectively, that our baseline
estimates are not affected by the exclusion of firm level controls (including the product market
HHI) and that the use of product market concentration defined using national sales (which we
call the global product market HHI) does not significantly alter our estimates.

For the purposes of calculating labor market concentration, we define a labor market, as an
occupation (at the 4-digit level) by a commuting zone for a given quarter, as in Azar et al.

According to Table 1, providing descriptive statistics for the estimation sample, the average
labor market HHI at the firm level is 0.16 whilst its median nears 0.07. This difference between
the mean and the median reflects the existence of a few markets with high levels of labor
market concentration. This can be seen more clearly by considering Figure 1(a) which depicts
the density of the HHI in the labor market. There appears to be a significant portion of workers
who face a single employer (monopsony). The same can be said based on Figure 1(b) for
the product market having a single seller (monopoly). Looking at Table 8 in Appendix A, this
feature of the distribution in labor and product market concentration appears to extend to the
most common occupations.

Before turning to the econometric evidence, it is important to discuss our measure of labor
market concentration and the way it relates to other measures used across the literature. This
paper measures labor market concentration through employment flows, because this is the
most relevant way of capturing job opportunities for workers looking for a job. Indeed, if
a worker was hired, it manifests that a job was available. By contrast, the total number of
workers is not as direct an indication of the number of available jobs. Prior literature has
used employment stocks to measure labor market concentration, albeit by industry rather than
occupation (Benmelech et al., 2018; Rinz, 2018; Lipsius, 2018; Abel et al., 2018). Therefore,
it is interesting to examine the differences between stock and flow measures of labor market
concentration by occupation. We present in figure 2(a) a binscatter allowing one to convert
flow levels of labor market concentration to stock levels. To construct it, we calculated for each
market (occupation by commuting zone) the average HHI index and provided its best fit line.
Clearly, there is a near linear relationship between labor market concentration based on flows
and on stocks: the R-squared of the superimposed regression line is equal to 43% 2 . The main
regression tables for the wage and employment regressions found in the following section are
also provided in terms of stock level labor market concentration in Appendix D. Figure 2(b)
presents a similar relationship, between our preferred measure of labor market concentration

and the Herfindahl index measured in terms of industry, with stock data. This latter measure
has been used in prior literature, as it is often more easily available. Although the relationship
is weaker, with an R2 of 20%3 , there is nonetheless evidence of a strong correlation between
the two measures.

     Note: These figures were constructed using individual and market level data. That is, we kept the stock of employees
in 2014 and 2015, and computed the stock level of concentration (the same as our measure but with all employees)
and the industry-stock (where the relevant market is an industry by a commuting zone with all employees). These new
measures of concentration are then averaged across our usual market definition (an occupation by a commuting zone) and
matched with the flow level of labor market concentration. The sample was limited to 2014 and 2015 for computational
convenience.

While stock and flow based labor market concentration measures are highly correlated across
markets, their levels are quite different. The figures use vertical and horizontal lines to indicate
thresholds used by the US federal antitrust authorities to gauge levels of concentration. By the
standard of the Department of Justice / Federal Trade Commission 2010 horizontal merger
guidelines, 0.15 is the threshold between low and medium concentration while 0.25 is the
threshold between medium and high concentration. In Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b) , we see
that stock-based measures of concentration show systematically lower levels of concentration
than flow-based measures, which makes sense as not all firms hire in every given quarter. As
a result, the 0.25 threshold for high concentration in the stock measure of labor market con-
centration corresponds to a concentration as high as 0.7 in the flow-based measure of labor
market concentration! Even the threshold of 0.15 for medium concentration in the stock-based
measure of labor market concentration corresponds to a flow-based HHI of about 0.4, which
is way above the high concentration threshold. This shows that measuring labor market con-
centration by stocks severely underestimates the level of concentration among new hires. If

                   3
                          i.e: log(Industrial Stock HHI) = -1.69 + 0.5322log(Flow HHI).

only a stock-based measure of concentration is available, thresholds of about 0.05 and 0.15
correspond to the relevant medium and high concentration thresholds in the flow-based mea-
sure. To the extent that new hires adequately measure available job opportunities for workers,
competition authorities should use the flow based measure, or, if only the stock-based mea-
sure is available, realize that it corresponds to much higher levels of flow-based labor market
concentration.

The existence of business groups may lead to under-estimating labor market concentration to
the extent that firms within a group do not compete for workers. However, this turns out not
to be a big problem empirically: as suggested by Figure 3 below, the two measures are almost
perfectly correlated and estimation results were not found to be sensible to measuring labor
market concentration at the business group versus the individual firm level. Table 1 also shows
that the levels of concentration measured at the firm level or the group level are very similar,
even if concentration is as expected slightly higher at the group level with a mean of 0.172
instead of 0.161 at the firm level.

3     ECONOMETRIC ASSESSMENT OF MONOPSONY

Monopsony Theory (Boal and Ransom, 1997; Manning, 2011; Robinson, 1969) predicts that
both employment and hourly wages should fall as a result of a rise in labor market concen-
tration (Azar et al., 2019). Indeed, the key intuition for monopsony power is by analogy with
monopoly power: profit-maximizing employers with monopsony power keep both wages and
employment below the competitive equilibrium. The presence of concentration in the product
market (monopoly power) reduces output, which should result in fewer workers employed.
On the other hand, the impact of product market concentration on wages is unclear (Qiu and
Sojourner, 2019). In the presence of rent sharing, one would expect greater product market
concentration to increase wages to the extent that profits increase. Table 2 summarizes the
predicted effects.

                                            Employment      Hourly Wage

            Table 2: Expected Effects of Labor and Product Market Concentration



3.1    DESCRIPTIVE EVIDENCE

Our goal is to assess these predicted effects of labor and product market concentration in the
French labor market. Concentration varies systematically across the French territory. Maps
4(a) and 4(b) display the mean labor market and product market HHI per département during
2015. The product market HHI is calculated on the basis of the identity of firms that hire in
a worker's industry in the same geographic market. The labor market HHI is calculated on
the basis of the identity of the firms that hire in the same occupation as the worker and same
geographic market. Even though sales shares come from national sales, this way of calculating
the product and labor market HHIs will yield relatively high levels of concentration in less
populated areas where fewer firms hire, whether that is within an occupation or within an
industry. We see (i) that areas with high product and labor market concentration overlap, (ii)
low population density areas have high concentration market structures, and (iii) given that
low population density areas have low wages, one could be led to believe that the (presumably)
negative impact of labor market concentration on wages dominates the (presumably) positive
impact of product market concentration.

Figure 5(a) depicts the log of the average hourly wage against the log labor market HHI by
commuting zone in 2015. There is a clear negative relationship between hourly wages and
labor market concentration. Figure 5(b) shows a strong negative relationship between market
size (in terms of recruitment flows) and labor market concentration. Both of these observations
are consistent with the core predictions of the monopsony model. Of course, the negative
relationship between concentration and hires is somewhat mechanical since fewer hires also
typically entails fewer firms hiring. Our regression analysis will address this issue by using an
instrument for labor market concentration based on the concentration in other markets.

To test the predictions of the Monopsony Theory, we first estimate two sets of linear regressions.
The first set of regressions concern the log(Hourly Wage) observed at the individual worker
level. The second set aggregates market characteristics and studies their relationship with the
log(Number of Recruited Workers) in a given market.

Regression analysis allows us to better disentangle fixed area effects from evolving market
structure effects. Using a large linked employer-employee dataset, we are able to account for
many potential sources of endogeneity which could threaten identification. This is done by
using a rich set of control variables at the market, firm, and worker level.


3.2                      IMPACT ON HOURLY WAGES

We let workers indexed by i be collected in a set                                              , firms indexed by j in          and the market m
in                       . Time is denoted by t at the quarter level. With the maximal set of controls, we estimate
an equation of the form:

log(w i , j ,o,m, t ) = l log(Labor HHI o,m, t )+ p log(Product HHIo,m, t )+ j +i +X i , j , t +o,m,i + t +i , j ,o,m, t

where w i , j ,o,m, t is the gross hourly wage of worker i in firm j in occupation o, geographic mar-
ket m at quarter t . l is the elasticity of the hourly wage with respect to the labor market
concentration,  p is the elasticity of the hourly wage with respect to the product market con-
centration,  j are firm fixed effects, i are individual fixed effects, the vector X i , j , t collects
control variables such as gender, age, log(average value added per capita in the firm), and the
log(firm size). o,m,i are commuting zone by occupation fixed effects and  t are time fixed
effects. i , j ,o,m, t is an idiosyncratic error term.


                                                                        13
The key threat to identification of the wage effect in our OLS regression is that there is a time-
varying market-specific variable that we did not control for, and that is correlated with HHI
and drives wages. According to search and matching theory, wages are determined by labor
market tightness, productivity and the worker's out-of-work benefit (Rogerson et al., 2005).
We already control for productivity through the value added per worker at the firm level, as
well as firm fixed effects in some specifications. Since unemployment benefits are determined
nationally, we are able to control for workers' out-of-work benefits by controlling for time fixed
effects. Therefore, the main threat to identification is time-varying changes in labor market
tightness at the market level.

To further address the issue of the endogeneity of the HHI, we follow the strategy in Azar et al.
(2017); Martins (2018); Qiu and Sojourner (2019) and instrument the HHI with the average
of log(1/N ) in other commuting zones for the same occupation and time period (where N
refers to the number of firms in the market). That is, for each commuting zone-occupation-
time period combination, we calculate the average of log(1/N ) for the same occupation for
every other commuting zone. This provides us with variation in market concentration that
is driven by national-level changes in the occupation, and not by changes in the occupation
in that particular local market. For example, if the labor market tightness for cleaners (the
most common occupation) falls in the Paris area, this could both decrease wages and increase
concentration, since fewer firms would likely be recruiting. By instrumenting with the number
of firms posting vacancies for cleaners in other areas, we rule out a direct effect of labor market
tightness in Paris on the HHI.

This type of instrumental variables strategy is commonly used in industrial organization to
address the endogeneity of prices in a local product market. For example, Nevo (2001) uses
prices in other geographic markets to instrument for city-level prices of various products in the
ready-to-eat cereal industry.

The main threat to identification for the instrumental variable strategy is that labor market
tightness shocks could be correlated across areas. Therefore, the instrument protects us against
a spurious correlation between concentration and outcomes that is due to local changes in
labor market tightness, but not against national-level changes in labor market tightness (for
an occupation relative to other occupations) that influence both concentration and other labor
market outcomes 4 .

Results for the ordinary least squares estimation are reported in Table 3. Five specifications are
proposed with increasingly demanding fixed effects. The first provides only time and occupa-
tion fixed effects. The second adds commuting zone fixed effects. The third combines the two
previous ones by including market fixed effects (Occupation by Commuting Zone). Finally, the

     The worker fixed effects are estimated using the ident_s variable from the data file Déclaration Annuelle des
Données Sociales (DADS) - fichier salarié. This variable includes significant measurement error. However, the worker
fixed effects estimates are all very similar to those using only firm fixed effects.

      Note: This table presents the regression output from an ordinary least squares regression using the Log(Hourly Wage) as a dependent variable. Each observation is
an employment contract. Log(Labor HHI) is the logarithm of the Herfindahl-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor market is defined
over a commuting zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through time quarters. Log(Product HHI) is the logarithm of the Herfindahl-Hirschman index for the product market. It
is defined as described in equation 2.4. The product market is defined over a commuting zone and at the industry level. There are two individual level control variables:
gender (equal to one if the worker is a man, zero otherwise) and age (in years). There are two firm level control variables: Log(Value Added per Worker) and Log(Number
of Employees). The latter is the number of reported full-time equivalent number of workers in the firm over the year. The former is the log of total value added (revenues
minus intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number of full-time equivalent employees. The gender fixed-effect cannot be identified in specification (v). The log-log
specification was used because the data presents a linear relationship under this form. The log-log specification lends itself to the following interpretation of the main
coefficient of interest in column (v): ceteris paribus, a 10% increase in labor market concentration lowers wages by approximately -0.00309 × 0.01 = 0.03%.

        We find results consistent with monopsony: labor market concentration is negatively associated
        with the wage. Product market concentration is positively associated with the wage. This is true
        across specifications and, although the magnitudes are small, all coefficients are statistically
        significant at the 1% level. The most negative coefficient is in column (1), which controls for
        time and occupation fixed effects: a rise of 10% in labor market concentration lowers hourly
        wages by 0.15%. This suggests that the partial correlation of concentration and wages is fairly
        strong across geographic labor markets: at a given point in time and for a given occupation,
        geographic labor markets with higher concentration have lower wages for new hires. The effect
        is quantitatively weaker when we rely on across time variation by controlling for market fixed
        effects (col. 3). The effect that is closest to zero is in column (5), which includes worker
        and firm fixed effects along with market fixed effects: an increase by 10% in labor market


                                                                             15
         concentration lowers hourly wages by 0.03%. We find that the size of the coefficients falls as
         more rigorous fixed effects are added. On the product market side, estimated effects are also
         small. They range from an estimated elasticity of 0.13% in column (3) to 0.04% in column (4),
         once firm fixed effects are added. Estimates for age and gender appear to be in the usual range,
         providing credence to our analysis. Perhaps more surprising is to find a negative coefficient for
         the value added per worker. Overall, the adjusted R2 stays constant, rising slightly when firm
         fixed effects are introduced.

     Note: This table presents the regression output from a two stage least squares regression using the Log(Hourly Wage) as a dependent variable. The instrument
is described in section 3.2. Each observation is an employment contract. Log(Labor HHI) is the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the labor market, as
described in equation 2.2. A labor market is defined over a commuting zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through time quarters. Log(Product HHI) is the logarithm of the
Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the product market. It is defined as described in equation 2.4. The product market is defined over a commuting zone and through at the
industry level. There are two individual level control variables: gender (equal to one if the worker is a man, zero otherwise) and age (in years). There are two firm level
control variables: Log(Value Added per Worker) and Log(Number of Employees). The latter is the number of reported full-time equivalent number of workers in the firm
over the year. The former is the log of total value added (revenues minus intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number of full-time equivalent employees. The
gender fixed-effect cannot be identified in specification (v). The log-log specification was used because the data presents a linear relationship under this form. The log-log
specification lends itself to the following interpretation of the main coefficient of interest in column (5): ceteris paribus, a 10% increase in labor market concentration lowers
wages by approximately -0.0947 × 0.01 = 0.947%. As the model is just identified ­ with two endogenous variables and two instruments, over-identification tests cannot be
performed.

         Next, we consider the two stage least squares estimates provided in Table 4. We see that
         the signs of the coefficients are in accord with the basic predictions of the monopsony model
         across specifications, the magnitudes have increased compared to the OLS estimates, and all
         coefficients of interest are statistically significant at the 1% level. In terms of labor market
         concentration, at one extreme, one finds that a 10% increase in the HHI index leads to a 1.6%


                                                                                16
fall in hourly wages (column (1)). At the other extreme, in column (4), parameter estimates
suggest that a 10% in labor market concentration lowers hourly wages by 0.8%. Whilst firm
and worker fixed effects appears to lower the magnitude of the coefficient on labor market con-
centration, they seem to enhance the role attributed to product market concentration. Indeed,
column (5) suggests that a 10% increase in the Product HHI would lead to a 0.9% increase in
hourly wages, while this effect is only half as large in column (2). For comparison, in column 5,
a 10% increase in the Labor HHI is associated with a 0.9% decline in hourly wages. Column 5
will be considered as our preferred specification because it is a conservative estimate within the
class of instrumental variables estimates and can be said to be robust to both firm, individual,
and market fixed effects.

Overall, these last two tables provide robust evidence that labor market concentration has
a negative impact on hourly wages. We now run two additional sets of regressions which
will allow us to explore some of the underlying heterogeneity and thereby learn more about
potential mechanisms through which concentration affects wages.

First, we document a relationship between unionization and the impact of labor market con-
centration. We interact our measures for labor and product market concentration with the
industry unionization rate observed in the Enquête Réponse (2011). Results for the second
stage IV specification are provided in Table 5. There appears to be a positive impact of union-
ization on hourly wages, as made clear by the coefficient denoted Industry Unionization Rate
which reports positive coefficients across specifications5 . This is in line with expectations and
the literature on wages and unionization patterns (e.g, Barth et al. (2017)). The interaction
coefficient between labor market concentration and unionization rate is positive and statisti-
cally significant (at the 10% level) across all specifications. To provide interpretation, one may
consider that the average unionization rate is 12%. The impact of labor market concentra-
tion on wages is positive with a unionization rate above 23.7%. Similarly, we find a positive
interaction between product market concentration and unionization, across all specifications.
These results on unionization are consistent with those of Benmelech et al. (2018) and Qiu
and Sojourner (2019). All in all, this suggests that institutional factors moderate the impact of
labor market concentration on wages.

Second, we find that labor market concentration can have very negative effects for workers op-
erating outside standard full-time contracts. In particular, Table 10 in Appendix B.2 documents
a strong negative relationship between labor market concentration and hourly wages for the
subpopulation of workers in part-time, temporary, or on-call work arrangements. Indeed, the
least square estimators are nearly ten times larger than in the overall population. Table B.2
which provides the two stage least squares estimates finds even larger effects. However, the re-
stricted sample size leads to statistically insignificant results. Overall, these results suggest that

       Ordinary Least Squares estimates are available in Appendix B.1.

workers who are less protected by institutions (such as unions) are more likely to be negatively
affected by labor market concentration.

3.3      EMPLOYMENT EFFECTS

We now consider the impact of market structure on employment. We measure employment as
a flow : the number of labor contracts signed in a market (occupation by commuting zone)
during a quarter and denoted by Eo,m, t . This means we estimate equations of the form:
  log( Eo,m, t ) = l log(Labor HHI o,m, t ) +  p log(Product HHIo,m, t ) + X o,m, t  + m +  t + o,m, t

This equation is at the market level rather than at the individual worker level. So, l will be
interpreted as the elasticity of employment with respect to labor market concentration and
 p as the elasticity of employment with respect to the product market concentration. X o,m, t
will now include as control variable the average age and share of men in market o, m, t .

     Note: This table presents the regression output from an ordinary least squares regression using the Log(Number of New Jobs) as a
dependent variable. Each observation corresponds to a market (a time quarter by a commuting zone by an occupation). Mean Log(Labor
HHI) is the mean of the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor market
is defined over a commuting zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through time quarters. Mean Log(Product HHI) is the mean of the logarithm
of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the product market. It is defined as described in equation 2.4. The product market is defined
over a commuting zone and at the industry level. There are two population level control variables: the mean gender (equal to one if
all workers are men, zero if all workers are female) and the mean age (in years). There are two firm population level control variables:
the Mean Log(Value Added per Worker) and the Mean Log(Number of Employees). These variables are constructed by weighting the
characteristics of the recruiting firms by their current labor market share. The log(Number of Employees) is the number of reported full-
time equivalent number of workers in the firm over the year. The Log(Value Added per Worker) is the log of total value added (revenues
minus intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number of full-time equivalent employees. The log-log specification was used
because the data presents a natural linear relationship under this form. The log-log specification lends itself to the following interpretation
of the main coefficient of interest in column (3): ceteris paribus, a 10% increase in labor market concentration lowers new recruits by
approximately 0.666 × 0.01 = 6.66%

In order to weight markets containing more workers with more strength, Appendix C provides
the estimation results for additional regressions where we weight each market according to
(i) the mean number of different firms recruiting in that market and (ii) the mean number
of positions filled in that market across time. Given that the estimated parameters point in
the same direction as those presented in the unweighted case, we focus our analysis on the
unweighted case presented below in Table 6 and Table 7. We provide three specifications.
The first column provides fixed effects for time and occupation, the second column adds a
commuting zone fixed effect, and the last column has a market fixed effect (occupation by
commuting zone).

The results presented in Table 6 are in line with the basic predictions of theory. We find that
both labor market and product market concentration are negatively related with the number
of recruited workers. This can be seen across the three specifications where all relevant coef-
ficients are statistically significant at the 1% level. However, magnitudes vary greatly across
specifications. Column (1) suggests that a 10% increase in labor market concentration would
lead to a 9.6% fall in employment. This effect falls to 6.6% in column (3) where market fixed
effects are included. For the product market, our results suggest that a 10% increase in the
product market can lower employment by up to 1.7% (column 1), or, more conservatively, by
0.2% (column 3). The impact of labor market concentration on employment could be biased
by the mechanical effect that when fewer firms recruit, HHI tends to be higher. This is why it
is especially important to use an instrument to check the validity of these results.

Using instrumental variables confirms the negative effect of labor and product market concen-
tration on employment flows. With instruments (Table 7), the impact of labor market concen-
tration appears to be even greater. Indeed, a 10% increase in labor market concentration leads
to a 27% fall in employment (column (3)). However, the impact of product market concentra-
tion has stayed the same or weakened as evidenced by column (3) which reports a negative
but statistically insignificant coefficient. Overall, this suggests that labor market concentration
has a stronger negative effect on employment than product market concentration. This re-
sult is sensible because the relationship between labor market concentration and employment
is direct, while product market concentration decreases employment indirectly by depressing
output.

       new recruits by approximately -1.278 × 0.01 = 12.78%. As the model is just identified ­ with two endogenous variables

Overall, our analysis shows that wages are lower when labor market concentration increases,
while wages are higher when product market concentration increases. Hires decrease with
labor market concentration, while product market concentration has a negative but not always
significant relationship with new hires.

4   Merger Simulation

In this section, we simulate counter-factual horizontal mergers to identify the workers most vul-
nerable to corporate consolidation. Although a rough approximation of the effect of a merger
on the labor market, we believe this exercise to be informative to the Competition Authority
and provide predictions that can be tested in future research.

To run these counter-factuals horizontal mergers, we assume that, in turn, the two largest firms
in each industry (in terms of headcount) merge6 . We then recalculate our labor market HHI
and predict the wage and hires effects using our prior estimates of the impact of labor market
concentration on wages and employment; the elasticity estimates are found in Table 4 (column
5) and Table 7 (column 3). That is, we calculate the yearly income and employment loss for
newly hired workers by assuming an elasticity of hourly wages and hires with respect to labor
market concentration of, respectively, -0.09 and -1.278.

To do so, we make several assumptions. First, we keep the product market and firm characteris-
tics fixed. Second, we neglect the wage effects for workers who are already in employment. In-
deed, we expect effects on workers already in employment to be small given that French wages
are often considered to be rigid. Third, we also keep levels of product market concentration
constant and thus assume no impact on wages from changes in product market concentration.

We only use the coefficient on labor market HHI for three reasons. First, the product market
HHI is not well measured. Second, the regressions with just the labor market HHI yield es-
sentially the same coefficient as when we also include the product market HHI7 . Third, from
a policy perspective, the potentially positive effects of the product market HHI occur by an
anticompetitive mechanism, so should not be taken into account as offsets.

The annual loss in euros for worker i ,           i,   is imputed as follows8 :


     i   = 1607 × Observed Hourly Wagei × exp(-0.0947 log(New HHI/Observed HHI)) - 1
                                                                                                              (4.1)

For each simulated industry merger, we recalculate the new level of labor market concentration
per market (a quarter by commuting zone by occupation) and calculate the job loss                       m   for each
market according to the change in labor market concentration. The results below will then sum



    6
      This is in contrast to Jarosch et al. (2019) who simulate mergers by selecting the two largest employers within
each of their areas. We take our approach as more indicative of the situation faced by Antitrust Authorities.

      See Appendix for alternative regression specifications which exclude the product market concentration or
include the product market concentration index defined with national sales shares.

      French full-time work is equivalent to 1607 hours of labor per year. The logic behind the formula is this: the
new wage is the old wage times a growth rate. The loss we want is the difference between the new wage and the
old wage. So the loss is the old wage time the growth rate minus one.


                                                          22
the losses across labor markets. We use the following formula :


         m   = Observed Nb. Jobsm × exp(-1.278 log(New HHI/Observed HHI)) - 1                               (4.2)

Table 47 in Appendix G reports descriptive statistics for the simulation. It shows that, after
the merger of the two largest employers in each industry, labor market concentration would
increase on average (weighted by industry employment) by 0.01 percentage points, that is, if
a worker is in industry x, a merger between the top two employers in industry x would modify
the average HHI of workers in industry x by 0.01 percentage points (this includes markets
where the merger did not affect HHI because only one or none of the merging employers was
present).

The distribution of these merger effects on concentration is highly skewed across industries
and geographies. In Figure 6(a), we graph the average change in labor market HHI induced
by the merger in the industry on the workers of that industry. The electricity industry has the
highest mean change in labor market concentration for new hires following a merger of the

top two players. TV and radio has the second highest increase in HHI. Figure 6(b) displays the
geographical location of the most affected workers. Workers most vulnerable to concentration
increases from mergers appear to be in the rather disadvantaged areas of France, in the North
and South of the country.

      Figure 7(a) : Each line represents the sum of annual expected wage loss for workers across France induced from a
merger. It is calculated based on equation 4.1. Industry Total Annual Loss is calculated so as to include the loss to workers
in the industry that merged (i.e, the impact on car repairers of a merger in the car repair industry). So, the merger in the
retail industry would lead to a 18 million euro annual income loss to workers in the retail industry. Broad Total Annual
Loss is calculated so as to include the loss to all workers in the economy, including those in the industry that merged. So,
the merger in the retail industry would lead to 23 million euros in annual income loss across the economy.
Figure 7(b): Each line in light red represents the annual expected new jobs lost for workers in that industry (i.e, a
merger in the Building Maintenance industry would reduce annual recruitment by 4200 jobs in the Building Maintenance
industry). It is calculated based on equation 4.2 and implicitly assumes that the wages of old workers (in the stock) are
not impacted. Each line in dark red represents the annual expected new jobs lost for workers across France induced from
a merger in that industry (i.e, a merger in the Building Maintenance industry would reduce annual recruitment by 5100
jobs across France). It is calculated based on equation 4.2 and implicitly assumes that the wages of incumbent workers
(in the stock) are not impacted.

We now turn to the wage and employment impact of the simulated mergers. Figure 7(a) shows
the loss in income to newly hired workers in the industry that merged (in light red) and across
all industries (in dark red). Mergers in Retail, Building Maintenance, and Computer program-


                                                                        24
ming appear to be most harmful: a merger by the top two players in the retail industry would
lead to a yearly loss of over 15 million euros for workers in the industry, and almost 23 million
euros when workers in all industries are taken into account.

There are also significant employment losses due to increases in labor market concentration
from the horizontal merger of the two top firms in each industry. Figure 7(b) displays the loss
of new hires in a given industry when there is a merger in that industry (e.g. the loss of jobs
in the car repair industry induced by a merger by the car repair industry leaders) in light red.
It also displays the overall loss from a merger in a given industry on all jobs in the economy
(e.g. the loss of jobs induced by a merger in the car repair industry on all jobs in the French
economy) in dark red. Retail and building maintenance appear at top the list, with the largest
job losses, at almost 8,000 and over 6,000 jobs respectively.

How are workers with different occupations affected by employment losses from mergers?
Appendix G Figures 9(a) and 9(b) display the job loss across the economy induced by industry
mergers according to the workers' occupation. Blue collar jobs (i.e, manual and non-manual
workers) are most threatened by a merger in the retail and building maintenance industry.
White collar (i.e, managers) job loss is, as expected, smaller and mainly associated to a merger
in the computer programming and legal industry.

Do these effects correlate with workers in labor markets with high levels of labor market con-
centration? To answer this question, we plotted in Figure 8(a) the total damage to workers
in the merging industry against the mean level of labor market concentration of the workers
in that industry prior to the merger. Figure 8(b) displays the counterpart for industry employ-
ment loss. We let the size of the indicator be proportional to the number of workers hired in
that industry to distinguish size from intensity. These plots reveal that there can be significant
losses for workers operating in areas of low labor market concentration. Industries with work-
ers in highly concentrated labor markets have few hires to start with and, so, an increase in
concentration does not scale up to large aggregate losses. Indeed, the best fit line is downward
sloping, suggesting that losses are more pronounced in industries with workers from less con-
centrated labor markets. This can be explained in light of the log-log regression specification
which emphasizes variations in the markets with initially low levels of labor market concentra-
tion.

While our simulation depends on a number of assumptions that may not always hold, our
results offer a cautionary tale for antitrust enforcers. Once we add up effects in all markets,
mergers in the industries with the highest levels of concentration are not necessarily the most
damaging for workers' wages and for employment.

                                          5    CONCLUSION

                                          What are the labor market effects of labor and product market concentration? We leverage
                                          detailed French administrative data to show that labor market concentration decreases both the
                                          number of hires and the wages of new hires, as hypothesized by Monopsony Theory. Based on
                                          our instrumental variable estimates with worker and firm fixed effects, a 10% increase in labor
                                          market concentration decreases hires by about 12.4% and the wages of new hires by nearly
                                          0.9%, with less negative effects in more unionized industries. A 10% increase in product market
                                          concentration increases wages by 0.9%, with more positive effects in more unionized industries.
                                          The impact of product market concentration on wages is consistent with rent sharing. Product
                                          market concentration also has a negative but not always significant impact on the number of
                                          new hires.

                                          Based on our estimate of the impact of labor market concentration on wages and the number


                                                                                                       26
of new hires, we can simulate the labor market impact of horizontal mergers between the two
largest employers in each industry. We find that a horizontal merger has an impact not only
on workers in the affected industry, but also on workers in other industries that share the same
occupation: for a merger between the top two employers in the retail industry, about 25% of
the impacts affect workers outside the retail industry. Compared to mergers in other industries,
a merger between the top two employers in the retail industry would be the most damaging
overall, with about 24 million annual decrease in the wages of new hires, and about an 8000
decrease in annual hires.

Our comprehensive data allows us to show that employer market power has a substantial effect
on labor market outcomes even in countries like France where union coverage is high and
labor market institutions are protective of workers. Our findings suggest that antitrust and
competition authorities should further scrutinize the effects of competition policy on workers.

over a commuting zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through time quarters. Log(Product HHI) is the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the product market. It
is defined as described in equation 2.4. The product market is defined over a commuting zone and at the industry level. There are two individual level control variables:
gender (equal to one if the worker is a man, zero otherwise) and age (in years). There are two firm level control variables: Log(Value Added per Worker) and Log(Number of
Employees). The latter is the number of reported full-time equivalent number of workers in the firm over the year. The former is the log of total value added (revenues minus
intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number of full-time equivalent employees. The gender fixed-effect cannot be identified in specification (v). Labor and product
market concentration is interacted with the mean industry unionization rate, recovered from the Enquête Réponse, 2011. The Temporary-Employment Industry was dropped
because the reported unionization rate was only relevant to the permanent administrative staff of the temp agencies. The log-log specification was used because the data
presents a linear relationship under this form. The log-log specification lends itself to the following interpretation of the main coefficient of interest in column (5): ceteris
paribus and given a 10% unionization rate, a 10% increase in labor market concentration increases wages by approximately (0.00123 - 0.0000402 × 10) × 0.01 = 0.00828%.

Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor market is defined over a commuting zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through time

described in section 3.2. Each observation is an employment contract. The sample only includes non-permanent workers (Temp workers, part-time work, on-call workers).
Log(Labor HHI) is the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor market is defined over a commuting zone,
a 4-digit occupation, and through time quarters. Log(Product HHI) is the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the product market. It is defined as described
in equation 2.4. The product market is defined over a commuting zone and at the industry level. There are two individual level control variables: gender (equal to one if
the worker is a man, zero otherwise) and age (in years). There are two firm level control variables: Log(Value Added per Worker) and Log(Number of Employees). The
latter is the number of reported full-time equivalent number of workers in the firm over the year. The former is the log of total value added (revenues minus intermediary
costs) over a year divided by the number of full-time equivalent employees. The gender fixed-effect cannot be identified in specification (v).. The log-log specification was
used because the data presents a linear relationship under this form. The log-log specification lends itself to the following interpretation of the main coefficient of interest
in column (5): ceteris paribus, a 10% increase in labor market concentration lowers wages by approximately -0.507 × 0.01 = 5%.

   Note: This table presents the regression output from a weighted ordinary least squares regression using the Log(Number
of New Jobs) as a dependent variable. Each observation corresponds to a market (a time quarter by a commuting zone
by an occupation). Each observation is weighted according to the mean number of workers recruited across time in the
relevant labor market (the commuting zone by an occupation). Mean Log(Labor HHI) is the mean of the logarithm of
the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor market is defined over a
commuting zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through time quarters. Mean Log(Product HHI) is the mean of the logarithm
of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the product market. It is defined as described in equation 2.4. The product
market is defined over a commuting zone and at the industry level. There are two population level control variables: the
mean gender (equal to one if all workers are men, zero if all workers are female) and the mean age (in years). There
are two firm population level control variables: the Mean Log(Value Added per Worker) and the Mean Log(Number of
Employees). These variables are constructed by weighting the characteristics of the recruiting firms by their current labor
market share. The log(Number of Employees) is the number of reported full-time equivalent number of workers in the
firm over the year. The Log(Value Added per Worker) is the log of total value added (revenues minus intermediary costs)
over a year divided by the number of full-time equivalent employees. The log-log specification was used because the data
presents a natural linear relationship under this form. The log-log specification lends itself to the following interpretation
of the main coefficient of interest in column (3): ceteris paribus, a 10% increase in labor market concentration lowers
new recruits by approximately 0.302 × 0.01 = 3.02%

      Note: This table presents the regression output from a weighted ordinary least squares regression using the
Log(Number of New Jobs) as a dependent variable. Each observation corresponds to a market (a time quarter by a
commuting zone by an occupation). Each observation is weighted according to the mean number of different firms re-
cruiting across time in the relevant labor market (the commuting zone by an occupation). Mean Log(Labor HHI) is the
mean of the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor
market is defined over a commuting zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through time quarters. Mean Log(Product HHI) is the
mean of the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the product market. It is defined as described in equation
2.4. The product market is defined over a commuting zone and at the industry level. There are two population level
control variables: the mean gender (equal to one if all workers are men, zero if all workers are female) and the mean age
(in years). There are two firm population level control variables: the Mean Log(Value Added per Worker) and the Mean
Log(Number of Employees). These variables are constructed by weighting the characteristics of the recruiting firms by
their current labor market share. The log(Number of Employees) is the number of reported full-time equivalent number
of workers in the firm over the year. The Log(Value Added per Worker) is the log of total value added (revenues minus
intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number of full-time equivalent employees. The log-log specification was
used because the data presents a natural linear relationship under this form. The log-log specification lends itself to the
following interpretation of the main coefficient of interest in column (3): ceteris paribus, a 10% increase in labor market
concentration lowers new recruits by approximately 0.302 × 0.01 = 3.08%

      Note: This table presents the regression output from an ordinary least squares regression using the Log(Hourly Wage) as a dependent variable. Each observation is
an employment contract. The sample includes all workers employed in 2014 and 2015 on January 1st (i.e, the employment stock). Log(Labor HHI) is the logarithm of the
Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor market is defined over a commuting zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through the
year. Log(Product HHI) is the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the product market. It is defined as described in equation 2.4. The product market is defined
over a commuting zone and at the industry level. There are two individual level control variables: gender (equal to one if the worker is a man, zero otherwise) and age (in
years). There are two firm level control variables: Log(Value Added per Worker) and Log(Number of Employees). The latter is the number of reported full-time equivalent
number of workers in the firm over the year. The former is the log of total value added (revenues minus intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number of full-time
equivalent employees. The gender fixed-effect cannot be identified in specification (v). The log-log specification was used because the data presents a linear relationship
under this form. The log-log specification lends itself to the following interpretation of the main coefficient of interest in column (5): ceteris paribus, a 10% increase in labor
market concentration lowers wages by approximately -0.00329 × 0.01 = 0.03%.

     Note: This table presents the regression output from an ordinary least squares regression using the Log(Hourly Wage) as a dependent variable. Each observation is
an employment contract. The sample includes all workers employed in 2014 and 2015 on January 1st (i.e, the employment stock). Log(Labor HHI) is the logarithm of the
Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor market is here defined over a commuting zone, an industry, and through the year.
Log(Product HHI) is the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the product market. It is defined as described in equation 2.4. The product market is defined
over a commuting zone and at the industry level. There are two individual level control variables: gender (equal to one if the worker is a man, zero otherwise) and age (in
years). There are two firm level control variables: Log(Value Added per Worker) and Log(Number of Employees). The latter is the number of reported full-time equivalent
number of workers in the firm over the year. The former is the log of total value added (revenues minus intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number of full-time
equivalent employees. The gender fixed-effect cannot be identified in specification (v). The log-log specification was used because the data presents a linear relationship
under this form. The log-log specification lends itself to the following interpretation of the main coefficient of interest in column (5): ceteris paribus, a 10% increase in labor
market concentration lowers wages by approximately -0.00924 × 0.01 = 0.009%.

       Note: This table presents the regression output from an ordinary least squares regression using the
Log(Number of Employees) as a dependent variable (i.e, the employment stock) over 2014-2015. Each obser-
vation corresponds to a market (a year by a commuting zone by an occupation). Mean Log(Labor HHI) is the mean
of the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor
market is defined over a commuting zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through a year. Mean Log(Product HHI) is
the mean of the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the product market. It is defined as described
in equation 2.4. The product market is defined over a commuting zone and at the industry level. There are two
population level control variables: the mean gender (equal to one if all workers are men, zero if all workers are
female) and the mean age (in years). There are two firm population level control variables: the Mean Log(Value
Added per Worker) and the Mean Log(Number of Employees). These variables are constructed by weighting the
characteristics of the recruiting firms by their current labor market share. The log(Number of Employees) is the
number of reported full-time equivalent number of workers in the firm over the year. The Log(Value Added per
Worker) is the log of total value added (revenues minus intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number of
full-time equivalent employees. The log-log specification was used because the data presents a natural linear rela-
tionship under this form. The log-log specification lends itself to the following interpretation of the main coefficient
of interest in column (3): ceteris paribus, a 10% increase in labor market concentration lowers new recruits by
approximately 0.370 × 0.01 = 3.70%

      Note: This table presents the regression output from a weighted ordinary least squares regression using the
Log(Number of Employees) as a dependent variable (i.e, the employment stock) over 2014-2015. Each observation
corresponds to a market (a year by a commuting zone by an occupation). Each observation is weighted according to
the mean number of workers recruited across time in the relevant labor market (the commuting zone by an occupation).
Mean Log(Labor HHI) is the mean of the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described
in equation 2.2. A labor market is defined over a commuting zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through a year. Log(Product
HHI) is the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the product market. It is defined as described in equation
2.4. The product market is defined over a commuting zone and at the industry level. There are two population level
control variables: the mean gender (equal to one if all workers are men, zero if all workers are female) and the mean age
(in years). There are two firm population level control variables: the Mean Log(Value Added per Worker) and the Mean
Log(Number of Employees). These variables are constructed by weighting the characteristics of the recruiting firms by
their current labor market share. The log(Number of Employees) is the number of reported full-time equivalent number
of workers in the firm over the year. The Log(Value Added per Worker) is the log of total value added (revenues minus
intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number of full-time equivalent employees. The log-log specification was
used because the data presents a natural linear relationship under this form. The log-log specification lends itself to the
following interpretation of the main coefficient of interest in column (3): ceteris paribus, a 10% increase in labor market
concentration increases new recruits by approximately 0.0448 × 0.01 = 0.0448%

       Note: This table presents the regression output from a two stage least squares regression using the Log(Number
of Employees) as a dependent variable (i.e, the employment stock) over 2014-2015. The instrument is described
in section 3.2. Each observation corresponds to a market (a year by a commuting zone by an occupation) and
is weighted according to the mean number of different firms recruiting across time in the relevant labor market
(the commuting zone by an occupation). Mean Log(Labor HHI) is the mean of the logarithm of the Herfindalh-
Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor market is defined over a commuting
zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through a year. Log(Product HHI) is the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman
index for the product market. It is defined as described in equation 2.4. The product market is defined over a
commuting zone and at the industry level. There are two population level control variables: the mean gender
(equal to one if all workers are men, zero if all workers are female) and the mean age (in years). There are
two firm population level control variables: the Mean Log(Value Added per Worker) and the Mean Log(Number of
Employees). These variables are constructed by weighting the characteristics of the recruiting firms by their current
labor market share. The log(Number of Employees) is the number of reported full-time equivalent number of
workers in the firm over the year. The Log(Value Added per Worker) is the log of total value added (revenues minus
intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number of full-time equivalent employees. The log-log specification
was used because the data presents a natural linear relationship under this form. The log-log specification lends
itself to the following interpretation of the main coefficient of interest in column (3): ceteris paribus, a 10% increase
in labor market concentration increases new recruits by approximately 4.013 × 0.01 = 40.13%.

      Note: This table presents the regression output from the ordinary least squares regression of the log(Labor HHI) on the instrument, to be interpreted as the first stage
of a two stage least squares regression of log(Hourly wages) on log(Labor HHI). The instrument is described in section 3.2. Each observation is an employment contract.
Log(Labor HHI) is the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor market is defined over a commuting zone, a
4-digit occupation, and through time quarters.

       Note: This table presents the regression output from an ordinary least squares regression using the Log(Hourly Wage) as a dependent variable. Each observation is
an employment contract. Log(Labor HHI) is the logarithm of the Herfindahl-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor market is defined
over a commuting zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through time quarters. There are two individual level control variables: gender (equal to one if the worker is a man, zero
otherwise) and age (in years). There are two firm level control variables: Log(Value Added per Worker) and Log(Number of Employees). The latter is the number of reported
full-time equivalent number of workers in the firm over the year. The former is the log of total value added (revenues minus intermediary costs) over a year divided by the
number of full-time equivalent employees. The gender fixed-effect cannot be identified in specification (v). The log-log specification was used because the data presents a
linear relationship under this form. The log-log specification lends itself to the following interpretation of the main coefficient of interest in column (v): ceteris paribus, a
10% increase in labor market concentration lowers wages by approximately -0.00285 × 0.01 = 0.02%.

     Note: This table presents the regression output from a two stage least squares regression using the Log(Hourly Wage) as a dependent variable. The instrument is
described in section 3.2. Each observation is an employment contract. The sample only includes non-permanent workers (Temp workers, part-time work, on-call workers).
Log(Labor HHI) is the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor market is defined over a commuting zone,
a 4-digit occupation, and through time quarters. There are two individual level control variables: gender (equal to one if the worker is a man, zero otherwise) and age (in
years). There are two firm level control variables: Log(Value Added per Worker) and Log(Number of Employees). The latter is the number of reported full-time equivalent
number of workers in the firm over the year. The former is the log of total value added (revenues minus intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number of full-time
equivalent employees. The gender fixed-effect cannot be identified in specification (v). The log-log specification was used because the data presents a linear relationship

      Note: This table presents the regression output from an ordinary least squares regression using the
Log(Number of New Jobs) as a dependent variable. Each observation corresponds to a market (a time quarter
by a commuting zone by an occupation). Mean Log(Labor HHI) is the mean of the logarithm of the Herfindalh-
Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor market is defined over a commuting
zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through time quarters. There are two population level control variables: the mean
gender (equal to one if all workers are men, zero if all workers are female) and the mean age (in years). There are
two firm population level control variables: the Mean Log(Value Added per Worker) and the Mean Log(Number
of Employees). These variables are constructed by weighting the characteristics of the recruiting firms by their
current labor market share. The log(Number of Employees) is the number of reported full-time equivalent number
of workers in the firm over the year. The Log(Value Added per Worker) is the log of total value added (revenues
minus intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number of full-time equivalent employees. The log-log speci-
fication was used because the data presents a natural linear relationship under this form. The log-log specification
lends itself to the following interpretation of the main coefficient of interest in column (3): ceteris paribus, a 10%
increase in labor market concentration lowers new recruits by approximately 0.678 × 0.01 = 6.78%

      Note: This table presents the regression output from a two stage least squares regression using the Log(Number
of New Jobs) as a dependent variable. The instrument is described in section 3.2. Each observation corresponds to a
market (a time quarter by a commuting zone by an occupation) and is weighted according to the mean number of workers
recruited across time in the relevant labor market (the commuting zone by an occupation). Mean Log(Labor HHI) is the
mean of the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor
market is defined over a commuting zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through time quarters.There are two population level
control variables: the mean gender (equal to one if all workers are men, zero if all workers are female) and the mean age
(in years). There are two firm population level control variables: the Mean Log(Value Added per Worker) and the Mean
Log(Number of Employees). These variables are constructed by weighting the characteristics of the recruiting firms by
their current labor market share. The log(Number of Employees) is the number of reported full-time equivalent number
of workers in the firm over the year. The Log(Value Added per Worker) is the log of total value added (revenues minus
intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number of full-time equivalent employees. The log-log specification was
used because the data presents a natural linear relationship under this form. The log-log specification lends itself to the
following interpretation of the main coefficient of interest in column (3): ceteris paribus, a 10% increase in labor market
concentration lowers new recruits by approximately -2.317 × 0.01 = 23.17%.

      Note: This table presents the regression output from an ordinary least squares regression using the Log(Hourly Wage) as a dependent variable. Each observation is
an employment contract. Log(Labor HHI) is the logarithm of the Herfindahl-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor market is defined
over a commuting zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through time quarters. Log(Product HHI (Global)) is the logarithm of the Herfindahl-Hirschman index for the product
market defined at the national level using industry revenues. There are two individual level control variables: gender (equal to one if the worker is a man, zero otherwise)
and age (in years). There are two firm level control variables: Log(Value Added per Worker) and Log(Number of Employees). The latter is the number of reported full-time
equivalent number of workers in the firm over the year. The former is the log of total value added (revenues minus intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number
of full-time equivalent employees. The gender fixed-effect cannot be identified in specification (v). The log-log specification was used because the data presents a linear
relationship under this form. The log-log specification lends itself to the following interpretation of the main coefficient of interest in column (v): ceteris paribus, a 10%
increase in labor market concentration lowers wages by approximately -0.00309 × 0.01 = 0.03%.

     Note: This table presents the regression output from a two stage least squares regression using the Log(Hourly Wage) as a dependent variable. The instrument is

      Note: This table presents the regression output from an ordinary least squares regression using the Log(Hourly Wage) as a dependent variable. Each observation is an
employment contract. Log(Labor HHI) is the logarithm of the Herfindahl-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor market is defined over
a commuting zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through time quarters. Log(Product HHI Revenues (Global)) is the logarithm of the Herfindahl-Hirschman index for the product
market defined at the national level using industry revenues. There are two individual level control variables: gender (equal to one if the worker is a man, zero otherwise)
and age (in years). There are two firm level control variables: Log(Value Added per Worker) and Log(Number of Employees). The latter is the number of reported full-time
equivalent number of workers in the firm over the year. The former is the log of total value added (revenues minus intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number
of full-time equivalent employees. The log-log specification was used because the data presents a linear relationship under this form. The log-log specification lends itself to
the following interpretation of the main coefficient of interest in column (v): ceteris paribus, a 10% increase in labor market concentration lowers wages by approximately
-0.00252 × 0.01 = 0.02%.

     Note: This table presents the regression output from a two stage least squares regression using the Log(Hourly Wage) as a dependent variable. The instrument is
described in section 3.2. Each observation is an employment contract. The sample only includes non-permanent workers (Temp workers, part-time work, on-call workers).
Log(Labor HHI) is the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor market is defined over a commuting zone,
a 4-digit occupation, and through time quarters. Log(Product HHI Revenues (Global)) is the logarithm of the Herfindahl-Hirschman index for the product market defined
at the national level using industry revenues. There are two individual level control variables: gender (equal to one if the worker is a man, zero otherwise) and age (in
years). There are two firm level control variables: Log(Value Added per Worker) and Log(Number of Employees). The latter is the number of reported full-time equivalent
number of workers in the firm over the year. The former is the log of total value added (revenues minus intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number of full-time
equivalent employees. The gender fixed-effect cannot be identified in specification (v). The log-log specification was used because the data presents a linear relationship
under this form. The log-log specification lends itself to the following interpretation of the main coefficient of interest in column (5): ceteris paribus, a 10% increase in labor
market concentration lowers wages by approximately -0.0679 × 0.01 = 0.6%.

               Note: This table presents the regression output from an ordinary least squares regression using the
        Log(Number of New Jobs) as a dependent variable. Each observation corresponds to a market (a time quarter
        by a commuting zone by an occupation). Mean Log(Labor HHI) is the mean of the logarithm of the Herfindalh-
        Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor market is defined over a commuting
        zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through time quarters. Mean Log(Global Product HHI) is the mean of the logarithm
        of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the product market. It is defined over revenues at the industry level. There
        are two population level control variables: the mean gender (equal to one if all workers are men, zero if all workers
        are female) and the mean age (in years). There are two firm population level control variables: the Mean Log(Value
        Added per Worker) and the Mean Log(Number of Employees). These variables are constructed by weighting the
        characteristics of the recruiting firms by their current labor market share. The log(Number of Employees) is the
        number of reported full-time equivalent number of workers in the firm over the year. The Log(Value Added per
        Worker) is the log of total value added (revenues minus intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number of
        full-time equivalent employees. The log-log specification was used because the data presents a natural linear rela-
        tionship under this form. The log-log specification lends itself to the following interpretation of the main coefficient
        of interest in column (3): ceteris paribus, a 10% increase in labor market concentration lowers new recruits by
        approximately 0.677 × 0.01 = 6.77%

  Note: This table presents the regression output from a weighted ordinary least squares regression using the Log(Number
of New Jobs) as a dependent variable. Each observation corresponds to a market (a time quarter by a commuting zone
by an occupation). Each observation is weighted according to the mean number of workers recruited across time in the
relevant labor market (the commuting zone by an occupation). Mean Log(Labor HHI) is the mean of the logarithm of
the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor market is defined over a
commuting zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through time quarters. Mean Log(Global Product HHI) is the mean of the
logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the product market. It is defined over an industry and year. There are
two population level control variables: the mean gender (equal to one if all workers are men, zero if all workers are
female) and the mean age (in years). There are two firm population level control variables: the Mean Log(Value Added
per Worker) and the Mean Log(Number of Employees). These variables are constructed by weighting the characteristics
of the recruiting firms by their current labor market share. The log(Number of Employees) is the number of reported
full-time equivalent number of workers in the firm over the year. The Log(Value Added per Worker) is the log of total
value added (revenues minus intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number of full-time equivalent employees.
The log-log specification was used because the data presents a natural linear relationship under this form. The log-log
specification lends itself to the following interpretation of the main coefficient of interest in column (3): ceteris paribus,
a 10% increase in labor market concentration lowers wages by approximately 0.306 × 0.01 = 3.06%

      Note: This table presents the regression output from a two stage least squares regression using the Log(Number of
New Jobs) as a dependent variable. The instrument is described in section 3.2. Each observation corresponds to a market
(a time quarter by a commuting zone by an occupation) and is weighted according to the mean number of different firms
recruiting across time in the relevant labor market (the commuting zone by an occupation). Mean Log(Labor HHI) is
the mean of the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the labor market, as described in equation 2.2. A labor
market is defined over a commuting zone, a 4-digit occupation, and through time quarters. Mean Log(Global Product
HHI) is the mean of the logarithm of the Herfindalh-Hirschman index for the product market. It is defined an industry
and year. The product market is defined over a commuting zone and at the industry level. There are two population level
control variables: the mean gender (equal to one if all workers are men, zero if all workers are female) and the mean age
(in years). There are two firm population level control variables: the Mean Log(Value Added per Worker) and the Mean
Log(Number of Employees). These variables are constructed by weighting the characteristics of the recruiting firms by
their current labor market share. The log(Number of Employees) is the number of reported full-time equivalent number
of workers in the firm over the year. The Log(Value Added per Worker) is the log of total value added (revenues minus
intermediary costs) over a year divided by the number of full-time equivalent employees. The log-log specification was
used because the data presents a natural linear relationship under this form. The log-log specification lends itself to the
following interpretation of the main coefficient of interest in column (3): ceteris paribus, a 10% increase in labor market
concentration lowers new recruits by approximately -2.047 × 0.01 = 20.47%.

                        Note: The line Original Labor Market HHI presents the descriptive statistics for the observed level of labor market
                  concentration for each individual. The line Post Merger Labor Market HHI presents the descriptive statistics for the level
                  of labor market concentration for a worker after simulating the merger in her own industry (i.e,if a worker is in the car
                  repair industry, then the reported HHI is the one this individual would have after the two largest companies in the car
                  repair industry merge). The line Change in Labor Market HHI concerns the difference between the first two lines. The
                  line Income Loss (in industry) presents the descriptive statistics for the loss of income of workers when there is a merger
                  in their own industry (i.e, when there is a merger in the car repair industry when the worker is employed in the car repair
                  industry).

      Graph 9(a) : Each line represents the annual expected new blue collar jobs lost for workers across France induced
from a merger in that industry (i.e, a merger in the Retail industry would reduce annual recruitment of blue collars by
7500 jobs across France). It is calculated based on equation 4.2 and implicitly assumes that the wages of old workers (in
the stock) are not impacted. A white collar job is defined as having an occupation number starting with 5 and 6 in the
French Professions et catégories socioprofessionnelles occupation classification system.
Graph 9(b): Each line represents the annual expected new white collar jobs lost for workers across France induced from a
merger in that industry (i.e, a merger in the Computer Programming industry would reduce annual recruitment of white
collar workers by 1200 jobs across France). It is calculated based on equation 4.2 and implicitly assumes that the wages
of old workers (in the stock) are not impacted. A white collar job is defined as having an occupation number starting
with 3 in the French Professions et catégories socioprofessionnelles occupation classification system.
