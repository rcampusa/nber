                                           ABSTRACT

In this paper, we review and attempt to explain the changes in business cycle synchronization among
16 industrial countries and the over the past century and a quarter, demarcated into four exchange
rate regimes. We find that there is a secular trend towards increased synchronization for much of the
twentieth century and that it occurs across diverse exchange rate regimes. This finding is in marked
contrast to much of the recent literature, which has focused primarily on the evidence for the past 20
or 30 years and which has produced mixed results. We then examine the role of global shocks and
shock transmission in the trend toward synchronization. Our key finding here is that global (common)
shocks generally are the dominant influence.

                                           I. INTRODUCTION


The synchronized rapid and dramatic decline in output across the globe in the second half of

2008 put an abrupt end to the spreading musings of decoupling in national business cycles that

emerged in early 2007 when the U.S. economy started slowing. In fact, the current global slump

has been a striking reminder of how synchronized national business cycle downturns can be.

This experience is in marked contrast with the experience of the two decades leading up to 2007,

during which it was difficult to find strong evidence of increased or increasing business cycle

linkages among industrial countries. Depending on the sample period, output correlations have

even decreased in recent decades, largely on account of a remarkable cycle de-synchronization

among the major industrial countries in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Helbling and Bayoumi,

2003).1



In this paper, we look at international business cycle synchronization from a historical

perspective. The merit of such an approach is that short sample periods may mask important

trends in synchronization patterns. In the short term, much of the business cycle dynamics

depends on the shock dynamics, which tends to overshadow the effects of integration. Against

this, we review and attempt to explain changes in international business cycle synchronization

over 120 years using a framework in the tradition of the impulse-propagation approach to

business cycles. Specifically, we seek to determine whether synchronization has increased and, if

so, whether the changes in synchronization reflect changes in the nature of the impulses (the

“shocks”) driving the economies, particularly the role of global shocks, changes in the

transmission channels, or both. On the basis of this analysis, we then examine the relationship

between business cycle synchronization and globalization and the role of financial factors in the

dynamics of global output shocks.



From a historical perspective, the evidence in favor of increased business cycle synchronization

is clear-cut. We find a secular trend towards increased synchronization that occurs across

exchange rate regimes. This evidence is rather puzzling, however, considering the usual

explanation for increased synchronization. While there appears to be an almost linear increase in

business cycle synchronization over time, the level of globalization, that is, the degree of cross-

border integration in markets for goods, capital, and labor, has followed a U-shaped pattern

during the same period (Obstfeld and Taylor, 2003, and Bordo, Eichengreen and Irwin, 1999).

Starting from a relatively high degree of globalization during the period of the classical gold

standard, international integration decreased sharply during the interwar period before it began to

rise again, first slowly during the Bretton Woods period and then more rapidly in the current

floating rate period. Recent studies have documented that the degree of globalization prevailing

in the 1880s was only reached again 100 years later (ibid.).



These results are not necessarily surprising from a theoretical perspective since the correlation

between business cycle synchronization and integration is not necessarily positive. For example,

Krugman (1993) noted that stronger trade integration may lead to greater regional specialization,

which can lead to less output synchronization with industry-specific shocks. Relatedly,

Heathcote and Perri (2004) showed how increased financial integration may be an endogenous

reaction to the regionalization of real sector linkages, as the latter allow for gains from the global

diversification of asset portfolios.



For this investigation, we use annual data for 16 countries that cover four distinct eras with

different international monetary regimes. 2 The four eras covered are 1880-1913 when much of

the world adhered to the classical Gold Standard, the interwar period (1920-1938), the Bretton

Woods regime of fixed but adjustable exchange rates (1948-1972), and the modern period of

managed floating among the major currency areas (1973 to 2008). Across the four eras that we

examine, the variation in cross-border integration in the markets for goods, capital and financial

assets has been considerably larger than over the last 20 years while the influence of particular

shock realizations appears arguably to have been somewhat less important. The annual data for

16 industrial countries that we use in this paper come from Mitchell (1998a, 1998b, and 1998c)

and other sources. They were used by Bergman, Bordo, and Jonung (1998) and Bordo and

Jonung (2001).3 Analyzing business cycle features with annual data implies that higher

frequency features are not captured adequately. Nevertheless, we believe that using a much

longer data sample provides a much-needed broader and complementary perspective on business

cycle synchronization despite these problems. Our approach follows Bergman, Bordo and

Jonung (1998) and Backus and Kehoe (1992), who have shown the merit of looking at business

cycle phenomena from a long-term perspective.4



The paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses conceptual issues regarding international

business cycle synchronization and provides the basic stylized facts. The subsequent section

looks at the role that changes in this structure of shocks may have played in the observed

changes in the synchronization of cycles. Section IV considers the role of global shocks and

financial factors in cycle synchronization. Section V analyzes the relationship between business

cycle synchronization and the path of globalization. Section VI concludes.



              II. CROSS-COUNTRY BUSINESS CYCLE SYNCHRONIZATION OVER TIME


The notion of business cycles becoming increasingly synchronized across countries captures the

observation that the timing and magnitudes of major changes in economic activity appear

increasingly similar. For example, in the current slump, output collapsed in all major economies

at about the same time. Despite frequent use, however, definitions of synchronization vary

widely in the literature, As noted by Harding and Pagan (2004), most definitions are not

capturing business cycle synchronization in the tradition of the National Bureau of Economic

Research (NBER) because they are based on other business cycle concepts. In their paper, they

develop a statistical apparatus that allows for measurement and testing of cycle synchronization

in the NBER tradition. Specifically, they consider national business cycles to be synchronized if


4
 Unlike these papers, we focus on international synchronization and devote less attention to the comparison of
national business cycle properties such as output volatility or output-consumption comovements.
                                                       -7-



turning points in the corresponding reference cycles occur roughly at the same points in time. On

this basis, they have derived a statistical measure, the concordance correlation, that allows one to

test whether national cycles are significantly synchronized or not. This approach to measuring

synchronization boils down to national business cycles being in the same phase—expansions and

recessions—at about the same time.



In this paper, we will not follow Harding and Pagan. Analyzing cycles using turning points

would add an unwarranted layer of complexity to the analysis. Ultimately, as Harding and Pagan

(op. cit.) have shown, their measure of cycle synchronization depends on the moments of output

growth. For an analytical understanding of the changes in the synchronization, it is, therefore,

sufficient to focus on the changes in these moments.5 Hence, to establish the stylized facts, we

can use correlations among output growth rates as a measure of the strength of cross-country

linkages in macroeconomic fluctuations. This is also the most widely used measure in the recent

academic literature on the international business cycle.



We will, however, follow Harding and Pagan (2003, 2004), Stock and Watson (1999), and others

by using real gross domestic product—or output in short—as the measure of aggregate economic

activity or the business cycle rather than synthetic reference cycle series based on a number of

series (the NBER approach).




5
 In Bordo and Helbling (2004), measurement issues are discussed in greater depth, and patterns of cycle
synchronization are established using three different measures.

Figure 1 shows the correlation coefficients for log output growth by percentile for the four eras.

The distribution of the correlation coefficients differs substantially from era to era. In particular,

there has been a tendency toward higher, positive output correlations, not just a one-time level

increase in synchronization. During the Gold Standard, about one half of all country pairs were

characterized by negative output correlations and the average output correlation coefficient is

about 0 (Table 1). A first important step toward synchronization occurred during the interwar

period, when the share of negative correlations fell below 30 percent while the average

correlation increased to about 0.15. A subsequent reversal during the Bretton Woods era was

small, and correlations remained, on average, above those found for the Gold Standard era. A

second important increase then occurred during 1973-2008, when less than 10 percent of all

correlations were negative and the average correlation was 0.33.



Many of these changes in correlations across eras are statistically different from zero, on the

basis of both nonparametric and parametric tests.6 The issue of statistical significance is relevant

since the confidence intervals for the bilateral correlation coefficients are relatively wide given

the relatively few observations per era.7



The non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test is a test of the null hypothesis that the location of

the bilateral correlation coefficients (the elements of the population) is identical across eras. As

6
    See Bordo and Helbling (2003) for more details.
7
 The sampling standard deviation of estimated correlation coefficients depends on the size of the estimated
coefficient and the number of observations. Given the former, small samples tend to amplify the sampling
uncertainty greatly. For example, for a correlation coefficient of 0.15—the average for the interwar period—the
standard deviation for a sample of 20 observations is 0.23. With 50 and 100 sample observations, the standard
deviations decline to 0.14 and 0.10, respectively.
                                                -9-



shown in Table 2, the test results suggest that the upward shifts in the distribution of the

correlation coefficients are significant at the 5 percent level for the interwar period (compared to

the Gold Standard era) and for the modern floating era (compared to both the interwar and the

Bretton Woods eras). However, the downward shift in the distribution of correlations from the

interwar to the Bretton Woods eras is not significant.



Parametric tests of the null hypothesis that two correlation matrices are equal, based on the

approach proposed by Jennrich (1970), suggest rejection of the hypothesis that output

correlations in the modern floating era have been equal to those recorded in earlier eras (Table

2). The marked increases in the correlations in the floating era are thus statistically significant.

Among the other eras, however, the null hypothesis of equality between of correlation matrices is

accepted. Overall, these tests support our view that, from a historical perspective, there is strong

evidence of an increase in business cycle synchronization.



So far, we have looked at business cycle synchronization through a global lens, noting the

increased synchronization without consideration for other factors. However, one would expect

that synchronization patterns differ considerably across groups of countries, depending on factors

such as “gravity” or country size. The evidence clearly illustrates that the extent to which gravity

has shaped the synchronization trends depends on the region (see the results in Table 1). For core

European countries (the old “EEC”) and Continental European countries, the increase in business

cycle synchronization was clearly much sharper than the general increase. At the other end of

gravitas, business cycle synchronization between Japan and the other countries in the panel has
                                                   - 10 -



increased by less. In particular, there is no evidence for an increase between the Bretton Woods

era and the modern floating rate period.



The fact that the increase for all Continental European countries was smaller than that for the

Core European countries suggests that the forces of gravity are affected by common policies,

preferential trading agreements, and specific currency arrangements. The increase in correlations

among the Anglo-Saxon countries is also remarkable even though it seems more difficult to

attribute this to forces of gravity.8 While we do not believe that common institutions and heritage

among the Anglo-Saxon countries account directly for the increased synchronization, as Otto et

al. (2001) have argued, they likely have fostered similar patterns in the transmission of shocks

through what appear to be similar, market-based financial systems.



While the regional perspective reinforces the notion of a trend increase, it should be noted that

stark regional differences have only really emerged during the modern floating rate period.

Forces of gravity were not a factor behind business cycle synchronization during the classical

Gold Standard, as differences in correlations among regions were minor, with the high

correlation between Canada and the United States and, to a much lesser extent, among the

Scandinavian countries, being the main exceptions. During the Bretton Woods period, increased

regional synchronization began to emerge in the core European countries. Interestingly, the

increased synchronization during the interwar period was primarily on account of an increased



8
 The emergence of strong business cycle linkages among core European countries and among the Anglo-Saxon
countries was noted, among others, by Helbling and Bayoumi (2003) and Stock and Watson (2005).
                                                     - 11 -



synchronization between the cycles in the United States and other countries, which in turn seems

to reflect the equity boom bust cycle and its effects from the mid-1920s to the mid-1930s.



The experience with synchronized recessions over the past few decades seems to suggest that

downturns tend to be more common than expansions. The historical record shows that greater

output synchronization during downturns is a phenomenon that has emerged with the tendency

toward greater business cycle synchronization more generally. In the gold standard era, the

average correlation coefficient for output growth between two countries when at least one of

them was in recession was only marginally higher than that based on observations for the entire

era (lower panel of Table 1).9 Over time, however, output correlations during recessions have

risen even faster than they have when measured for entire eras. Increased business cycle

synchronization over time, therefore, does not seem driven by the frequency of recessions. In

fact, the average number of countries in recession per year has varied across the four eras

without trend. Starting from 4 during the gold standard era, the number increased to 4.8 during

the interwar period, then fell to less than 1 in the Bretton Woods periods, and finally rose to

about 1.7 in the modern floating rate era.



We also examined whether there were large changes in the magnitudes of correlation coefficients

over the modern floating era, given some recent studies suggesting that there had been a decrease

in output synchronization over the past two decades after 1985 than an increase (e.g., Heathcote

and Perri, 2004). Specifically, we compared output correlations over 1986-2006 with those for

9
 Following the NBER approach, recession periods were identified as those years in which log output growth was
negative.
                                                - 12 -



the entire modern floating era which spans the period 1973-2008. The last column in Table 1

shows that the differences in correlations coefficients are very small. Given the number of

observations, these differences are not statistically significant. We conclude from this exercise

that the secular trend toward increased business synchronization seems to be a robust result.



So far, all the cycle correlations we have studied were based on log first differences of output.

Does the detrending method matter for our findings? Naturally, high frequency noise is not a

great concern, given our panels of annual data, but it is possible that the increases in cycle

correlations from the 19th to the end of the 20th century really reflect changes in trend

comovements. In Bordo and Helbling (2004), we also examined correlation patterns in bandpass-

filtered log output data. The results show that the detrending method makes little difference and

that the same principal changes in the patterns of cycle synchronization are found with bandpass-

filtered output data.



      III. EXPLAINING SYNCHRONIZATION: THE ROLE OF SHOCKS AND TRANSMISSION


Using a standard measure of business cycle synchronization, we found evidence of increased

cross-country business cycle synchronization over time among industrial countries. From an

impulse-propagation perspective, the increased synchronization could reflect changes in the

nature of the impulses (the “shocks”) driving the economies, especially changes in their cross-

country correlations, changes in the transmission channels and mechanisms, resulting inter alia

from increased integration, or, most likely, both.
                                                       - 13 -



Disentangling the relative contributions of the changes in the correlation of shocks and changes

in the transmission channels to the changes in output correlations is difficult, however, as this

would require a comprehensive structural model of the economy that can be estimated

empirically. Such a model, which would need to allow for factors such as changes in trade and

financial integration and a multitude of shocks, seems beyond our reach, given the current state

of the art in multi-country modeling. Financial integration, for example, is not yet satisfactorily

accounted for in any of the leading multi-country models.



Against this background, we will proceed with a more modest research agenda. In this section,

we will focus on deriving measures of the impulses driving each economy and study the changes

in their variance-covariance structure. On this basis, we will then attempt to assess the extent to

which changes in this structure of shocks may help to explain the observed changes in the

synchronization of cycles.



                                         A. Analytical Framework


To structure our discussion, we follow Canova and Dellas (1993) and use the following

canonical, simple model of joint output dynamics in a two-country set up:10



                       y1t   a11     a12   y1t 1    1t 
                                                                                                    (3.1)
                       y2 t   a21    a22   y2 t 1   2 t 


10
  Canova and Dellas (1993) show how a very stylized two-country real business cycle model implies such a bi-
variate vector autoregressive representation. Doyle and Faust (2002) use a simple error-components structure to
illustrate similar issues.
                                                       - 14 -




where yit denotes the log output growth rate in country i. Following Stock and Watson (2005),

the error vector ν is assumed to be determined by the following factor structure:11

                   1t        1t 
                     G t                                                                           (3.2)
                   2t        2 t 



In this factor model of the VAR errors, ζ is a global shock and ηi is a country-specific

idiosyncratic shock. G is a vector of factor loadings. The matrix moving average representation

of the factor VAR (FAVAR) model follows as:


                  Yt  C ( L)G t  C ( L)t ,                                                            (3.1)


The unconditional variance-covariance matrix of the vector yt is given by:


                  E[YtYt ]  C (1)G  G C (1)  C (1) C (1)                                        (3.2)


provided that independence between the global factor ζt and the idiosyncratic errors ηit holds.



What can explain increased output synchronization—as measured by the correlation between

outputs of countries 1 and 2—in this model? General statements are difficult to make since

determination of signs and magnitudes of the partial derivatives of (3.2) depend on multiplicative

terms of the underlying parameters. However, partial derivatives around parameter values that


11
 In contrast, in the standard dynamic factor model, the coefficient matrix A is usually assumed to be zero and the
dynamics arise from the factors, which are modelled as autoregressive processes.
                                                                             - 15 -



are empirically relevant, notably positive first-order autocorrelation coefficients, a11 and a22, and

positive spillover coefficients, a11 and a22, suggest three reasons for increased output

synchronization:12

         Increases in the variance of the global shock relative to the country specific idiosyncratic

          shocks.

         Increases in the size of the “transmission” coefficients a12 and a21, which determine the

          spillover effects that shocks in country 1 have on country 2 and vice versa as well as

          those arising from the effects of global shocks elsewhere.13

         Increases in the size of the “autoregressive” coefficients a11 and a22, as greater persistence

          in a country’s output fluctuation increases the scope for spillovers. Compared to the

          previous two factors, the effect of changes in the autoregressive coefficients on output

          correlations tends to be small.



Extending the model to our 16-country panel leads to the following equation for a country i:

                                                    16
                    yi ,t     i yi ,t 1     
                                                 j 1, j  i
                                                                ij y j ,t 1   i ,t                      (3.3)


and



                     t  G t   t                                                                        (3.4)


12
  The reader should also recall that the idiosyncratic shocks are not correlated by assumption in thes two country
framework. Otherwise, the global shock could not be identified. With a larger cross-country dimension, however,
limited correlation among idiosyncratic shocks becomes possible, as discussed below.
13
  In the simple model of Canova and Dellas (op. cit.), these coefficients follow from the production structure, as
foreign intermediate goods are needed to produce the final consumption goods.

where the vector Nt includes all errors νit and the vector Ht all idiosyncratic shocks ηit (i=1,…,

16). Estimating this general FAVAR model in our sample is difficult. Given few observations for

each era, very few degrees of freedom would be left if the model were estimated even with one

lag. For the interwar era, the number of common observations for all 16 countries is even less

than the number of parameters, so that comparability of the model across eras could not be

ensured. In the circumstances, we imposed a priori restrictions and estimated two more restricted

versions of the general factor VAR model for each era.



        The center country model. In this version, the equation for each country’s real GDP

         growth includes lagged own GDP growth and lagged GDP growth in the center country

         (the United Kingdom in the Gold Standard era and the United States in the other eras). In

         other words, the coefficients δij are assumed to be zero for all j except for the center

         country. The rationale behind this model is that idiosyncratic shocks in the center country

         can be transmitted through the traditional channels while idiosyncratic shocks elsewhere

         have only limited effects on other countries.



        The trade linkages model. In this version, the equation for each country’s real GDP

         growth includes lagged GDP growth and lagged GDP growth in important trading partner

         countries (the ones reported in Mitchell, 1998a, 1998b, and 1998c).14 The rationale

         behind this model is, of course, straightforward.



14
  Mitchell (op. cit.) reports bilateral trade with 5 to 7 important trading partners for the Gold Standard and the
Interwar eras. We used those with entities in our data set only.

We estimated the models with a two-step, semi-parametric procedure, similar to the one used by

Bernanke et al. (2005), for estimating our two factor vector-autoregressive model. In the first

step, we used SURE estimators to obtain the coefficients βi and δij and the residual series νit. In a

second step, we used the nonparametric static approximate factor model of Ng and Bai (2002) to

obtain the global shock ζ and the idiosyncratic shocks ηi from the residual series νit. This model

allows for serial correlation, heteroskedasticity and limited contemporaneous cross-correlation in

the idiosyncratic components. Following standard practice in the literature, we use the first

common factor to measure the common shock driving cross-country business cycle

fluctuations.15 Both models turned out to be roughly similar in terms of information criteria for

all eras, although the restrictions implied by the center model compared to the trade model were

rejected by standard likelihood ratio tests.



                                                   B. Results



Figure 2 summarizes the estimated coefficients in the two models.16 Two features stand out.

First, the average autoregressive parameter (i.e., the coefficient βi) across countries has clearly

increased over time. For both models, the average autoregressive parameter was slightly negative

during the Gold Standard era and positive during the other eras. The minimum, as indicated by

the lower bound, given by the 5 percent percentile, increased over time while the maximum only


15
  Bai and Ng (2002) proposed to use information criteria to determine the appropriate number of factors. However,
their Monte Carlo simulations show that for panel datasets where the cross-sectional and time dimensions are as low
as in ours, the tests are not very reliable and tend to imply too high a number of factors.
16
  The coefficient estimates for the trade model for the interwar period implied unstable dynamics, and we do not
report results for this period for this model.

increased in the case of the trade model.17 Second, the transmission coefficients have changed

surprisingly little. For the center model, there is some evidence that the average transmission

coefficient has increased slightly but the range given the 95 percent confidence interval appears

to have changed only marginally. In contrast, for the trade model, the average hardly changed but

the range, especially in the positive domain, increased.



We now turn to the shocks. Table 3 shows the average standard deviations of the national output

series (log growth rates) and compares them with the estimated variances of the global shock and

the average idiosyncratic shock.18 The standard deviations of both global and idiosyncratic

shocks generally decline over time, as it was to be expected, given the decline in output growth

volatility.19 However, as noted earlier, what matters for the changes in output correlations is the

relative change in the standard deviations of the two types of shocks. While idiosyncratic shocks

were clearly more volatile than global shocks during the Gold Standard, their volatility has, on

average, declined a bit more rapidly than that of the global shock, although after the interwar

period, the differences in the relative decline became small.



17
  Following the stability analysis for the bilateral output correlations discussed in the previous section, we also
examined parameter stability in the modern floating era. Specifically, we tested for the stability of the autoregressive
coefficients, which tend to be sensitive to structural breaks in the data. Likelihood ratio tests comparing
specifications of both kinds of FAVAR models with and without a structural break in the autoregressive parameters
after 1985 suggest acceptance of the null hypothesis that there is no structural break. For the center model, the
likelihood ratio test statistics is 20.55, while for the trade model, it is 8.752 (the 5 percent marginal significance
value for χ2(16) is 26.3).
18
  Naturally, only the product Gζt is identified in this factor model. We normalized the square of the factor loadings,
i.e., G’G/16=1, to identify ζt. We believe this to be the natural normalization, as it allows for comparable variances
between outputs and factors. The alternative would have been be to normalize the factor variance to 1 (Bai and Ng,
2002) and to let the factor loadings adjust to replicate output variances
19
     The general moderation in the amplitude of output fluctuations has been analyzed by Blanchard and Simon (2001).

To examine the combined effects of the changes in parameters and shock properties over time on

business cycle synchronization, we performed two sets of calculations. First, we performed

standard forecast error variance decompositions. Table 4 presents 1 to 4-year ahead forecast error

variance decompositions of the output growth rates, averaged across countries, for the four eras,

distinguishing between the shares of total output variance explained by the global shock, the

idiosyncratic shocks, and transmission. Specifically, the variance decomposition for output

growth in country i was derived as:

                                          h                     h      16                       h           
                Et  h [ yi2,t  h ]   2  C ii2 ( s )   2              C ij2 ( s )   Ci ( s ) Ci ( s )   (3.5)
                                         s 1                  s 1 j 1,i  j               s 1




where C ii ( s ) and C ij ( s ) are elements of the matrix product C(s)G, with C and G defined earlier,

and where Ci ( s ) denotes row i of the matrix C for i=1,...,16. . The first term in this equation

reflects the immediate impact of global shocks on domestic output. In Table 4, it is reported

under the column “Global factor-Own.” The second term captures the transmission of the effects

of the global shock on other countries. The third term is the combined contribution of the

idiosyncratic shocks, encompassing both direct effects and transmission. Given our approximate

factor model formulation for the idiosyncratic errors, the direct effects are of two kinds, namely

the purely country-specific part of the shocks and those arising from the cross-correlation among

the idiosyncratic shocks. In the absence of a structural model, we distinguished the two effects

by first calculating the effects of the conditional idiosyncratic shocks, that is, the effects of the

shocks ηi given the idiosyncratic shocks ηj, (j=1,…16, j≠i), elsewhere, which we then subtracted

from the total effects of idiosyncratic shocks to obtain the effects due to transmission and
                                                            - 20 -



idiosyncratic shock correlation.20 Denoting the variance of the conditional shocks with 2i , the

column “Idiosyncratic factors-own” in Table 4 reflects the direct impact of the purely country-

                                                                                      h

                                                                                     s 1


does not imply causality in the sense of the shocks ηj, (j=1,…,16, j≠i) being exogenous from the

perspective of country i. On the contrary, the causality may well run from country i to the other

countries. The conditional variance simply captures the part of the idiosyncratic shock variance

that is uncorrelated to idiosyncratic shocks elsewhere.



The variance decomposition suggests the following. In general, idiosyncratic shocks have

become less important over time in shaping each country’s output dynamics while global shocks

have become more important. At the same time, the transmission of shocks across borders has

also increased. Within this broad picture, however, the relative importance of these two factors in

explaining the changes in the forecast error variance depends on the model and the eras used in

the comparison. The results for the center model suggest that the increases in the relative

variance of the global shocks account for most of the increase in output variance explained by

the global factor, which itself depends on both the shock variance and transmission. On the other

hand, the trade model suggests that both increases in the relative variance of the global shocks

and the transmission account for the reduction in the variance share of idiosyncratic shocks.

Interestingly, the increased importance of the transmission of shocks in explaining output


20
     For example, the conditional distribution for the first country in the vector yi was calculated as:

     12  221 21 where the matrices 12 ,  22 , and  21 are the relevant partitions of the matrix ˆ  .

synchronization that the trade model indicates stems primarily from the increased transmission of

idiosyncratic shocks. This suggests that it is not transmission from the center country, a channel

that operates in both models, that accounts for the increased variance share of transmission. It is

rather the intra-European or the intra-Anglo-Saxon country transmission that matters with regard

to transmission, a fact that seems consistent with the above average output synchronization

among European countries reported in Table 1. At the global level, on the other hand, it is

primarily the global shocks that matter.



Next, we computed the full variance-covariance matrix of the 4-year ahead forecast errors and

analyzed the changes in the average correlation among the errors. Table 5 shows the changes in

average forecast error correlations over time implied by our two estimated models. It shows both

the overall change and the change implied by the change in one group of parameters only (with

the sum across all parameter groups being equal to a first-order approximation of the change).

Regarding the latter, we distinguish between global shocks and loadings, idiosyncratic shocks

and their correlation, and the VAR coefficients.21 Overall, the implied changes in forecast error

correlations are remarkably close to the actual changes in average output correlations,

particularly for the center model. The implications differ between models. The calculations for

the center model suggest that, on average, the increased business cycle synchronization over the

four eras primarily reflects the increased importance of global shocks. On the other hand, the

trade model suggests that while global shocks have become more important, the increased

transmission accounts for a larger share of changes attributable to one parameter group. Between

the Bretton Woods era and the modern floating era, both models indicate that increases in

transmission have been relatively more important than they were between previous eras.



                                    C. Sensitivity Analysis



Our results imply that the answer to the question about whether the observed changes in business

cycle synchronization can be explained mostly with changes in impulses or transmission depends

on the model. Given obvious limitations to the power of any test with our dataset, we now turn to

sensitivity analysis to examine the robustness of our findings. Given the problems with short data

samples, there is no scope for sensitivity analysis for the VAR parts of the models and we will

focus entirely on the factor structure of the VAR residuals.



A first issue concerns the number of common factors. In line with standards in the literature, we

only used the first common factor as a measure for the common shocks. As shown in Table 6,

this factor always explains more than 20 percent of the residual variation. Nevertheless, the next

two to three common factors also explain more than 10 percent of the residual variation. In the

absence of clear benchmarks and tests, it is not clear what cut-off points should be chosen for the

share of the residual variation explained by important common factors. It has been suggested in

the literature to use common significance levels (Forni and others, 2000) even though we think
                                                     - 23 -



that in a sample like ours, a 20 percent cut-off is a more reasonable minimum for a common

factor. However, as the results in Table 6 show, selecting a 10 percent rather than a 20 percent

cut-off criterion would primarily change the relative shares of global and idiosyncratic shocks in

explaining the residual variance but not the changes over time. Moreover, what has increased

over time is primarily the share of the residual variation explained by the first common factor.

The changes in the share of the variation explained by the second to fourth common factors are

minor. This suggests that our results are quite robust with regard to the changes in business cycle

synchronization on account of changes in the properties of shocks.



A second issue concerns the specification and estimation of the factor model. We used the

nonparametric estimator proposed by Stock and Watson (2002), which is an asymptotic

estimator insofar as it relies on a large cross-sectional dimension for the identification of the

factors. Our cross-country dimension is clearly small, and the estimated common shocks may

include noise from idiosyncratic shocks. We therefore also estimated a parametric version of the

factor model (3.4) using a maximum likelihood procedure. For the identification of the shocks,

we impose the standard restrictions in static parametric factor models. In particular, we assumed

that there is one global shock with variance 1 and that the variance-covariance matrix of the

idiosyncratic shocks, Ση, is a diagonal matrix. Table 7 shows the implications for the shock

variances.22 In general, the estimated variances are very similar to those obtained with the

nonparametric estimator for the interwar and postwar periods. They are quite different for the

gold standard era for the trade model (but not the center model). The variance of global shocks

22
  The average global shock variance is computed as (1/16)G’G, which is equivalent to the computations underlying
the results shown in Table 4.

now exceeds the average of idiosyncratic shocks. Table 8 shows the implications for the implied

correlations among the 4-step ahead forecast errors.



         IV. BUSINESS CYCLE SYNCHRONIZATION, GLOBAL SHOCKS, AND FINANCIAL FACTORS



For a better understanding of the role of global shocks in international business cycle

synchronization, Figure 3 is instructive. Each panel shows the global shocks from the trade

model (solid lines) for an era, supplemented by dotted lines depicting the global shocks from a

simple static approximate factor model for output growth rates (taken from Bordo and Helbling,

2004) and bars showing time dummies—the equivalent of global shocks—from an error

components model that are significant at the 5 percent level.23 We estimated the latter to obtain

another measure for large and important shocks. The global shocks implied by the two factor-

based approaches—the trade model and the simple factor model—are surprisingly similar except

for the interwar period, although the shocks from the trade model are generally smaller in

magnitude. The latter finding is not that surprising since the possibility of transmission implies

lower shock variances with equal output variances. The general picture emerging from Figure 3

is that global shocks appear noticeably important at times of world-wide downturns, suggesting

an asymmetry between downturns and upturns.24


23
     We estimated the following traditional error component model with our panel dataset:

     y   i ,t       t       i ,t   where λt denotes a time dummy taking on the value 1 in time t and ηi,t a shock
specific to country i.
24
 This corroborates Helbling and Bayoumi (2003), who found a similar result for the G-7 countries during 1973-
2001 using quarterly data and a dynamic factor model to isolate common cycles.
                                                        - 25 -



The current global slump has once again illustrated the pivotal role of financial factors in

international business cycle synchronization. To analyze the role of financial factors in global

shocks to output growth, we have sought to relate the global shocks ζt to measures of global

financial conditions. Following English et al. (2005), we constructed a global financial

conditions index based on the first principal component of a cross-section of financial

indicators.25 However, unlike English et al. (op. cit.), the cross-section is not a set of indicators

within a country, but across the countries in our data set. Hence, our index captures common

factors in national financial conditions.26



Unfortunately, the lack of a large cross-section of relevant and comparable financial variables

across countries and time has forced us to consider a relatively limited set of variables only.

Specifically, we constructed two such global financial conditions indices. The first one is based

on real money growth in 11 countries.27 The underlying approach is not one of “global

monetarism.” Instead, real money growth is considered to be a proxy variable for general credit

conditions. The second index is also based on the real money growth rates for the 11 countries,

but it also includes measures of real stock return for 5 countries28, real ex post short-term interest

rates in 4 countries,29 and yield spreads in 4 countries.30

     See also Swiston (2008).

 The first principal component was derived from the residuals of AR(1) regressions of the underlying financial
variables.

As shown in Table 9, correlations between the global output shocks ζt and the two global

financial condition indices generally are not significant.31 However, the charts in Figures 4 and 5

suggest that financial conditions have been important in some business cycle downturns. Time

effects in our cross-section of financial variables were typically significant at times when time

effects in our cross-section of GDP data were also significant. As noted earlier, “global” output

shocks seem more prevalent during downturns than during upswings.



The phenomenon that there appears to be no noticeable correlation between financial

disturbances and reference cycles except occasionally during broader international downturns

has been noted, among others, by Morgenstern (1959, p. 64). Nevertheless, in view of the limited

set of financial variables used to derive common financial disturbances, our results are

preliminary at this point. Further research is needed to establish their robustness.



                     V. BUSINESS CYCLE SYNCHRONIZATION AND GLOBALIZATION


Overall, our results are broadly consistent with globalization. With increased economic and

financial interdependence through trade and financial linkages, the scope for global shocks or the

rapid transmission of shocks in the center countries has clearly increased. In addition, with global

shocks, floating exchange rates do not provide much scope for insulation, since shocks affect all

countries in similar ways. At the same time, business cycle amplitudes have clearly moderated

     France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
31
  This conclusion is robust to various small modifications of the modeling assumptions. In particular, if the global
financial conditions indices are based on residuals from AR(1) regressions that also include lagged GDP growth
rates as regressors, the results are virtually the same.
                                                         - 27 -



during the post-World War II period, reflecting, among other factors, changes in sectoral

structure, automatic stabilizers, the use of lender of last resort operations, and the use of

discretionary counter-cyclical policies.32 In this context, it is interesting to note that the volatility

of idiosyncratic shocks has decreased more than that of global shocks. Among other factors, this

finding is consistent with the notion that the changes in the sectoral structure and the use of

automatic stabilizers as well as other counter-cyclical policies have been fairly similar across the

industrial countries.



Nevertheless, some aspects of our results remain puzzling. The much larger standard deviations

of idiosyncratic shocks during the gold standard may be explained by structural factors, the

conduct of macroeconomic policies, and measurement errors. Clearly, agriculture was much

more important, rendering economies more susceptible to idiosyncratic shocks as weather

conditions. Similarly, the general absence of lender of last resort policies (except mainly in the

core countries) and macroeconomic stabilization policies could also have contributed to

relatively larger idiosyncratic shocks. However, the fact that the transmission of idiosyncratic

shocks played such little role during the classical gold standard remains puzzling for

explanations that rely on globalization as the key driving force behind changes in the factors

driving business synchronization.



In particular, the level of globalization, that is, the degree of cross-border integration in markets

for goods, capital, and labor, has followed a U-shaped pattern during the same period (see Bordo,

32
  See McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000), Blanchard and Simon (2001), IMF (2002), and Stock and Watson (2005)
for recent studies examining the volatility of output fluctuations in industrial countries, especially the United States.
                                                - 28 -



Eichengreen, and Irwin, 1999, and Obstfeld and Taylor, 2004). . In contrast, the time path of

business cycle synchronization has followed a secular increase over time, almost linear if there

were not the interwar period hump. How can we explain this disconnect? Specifically, we will

use the results to explore three hypotheses explaining aspects of the disconnect.


First, we explore what we call the global shock hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, the

above-trend degree of business cycle synchronization during the interwar period—when

integration was lower than during the classical gold standard— is the result of an exceptionally

large adverse global shock. Given that the interwar period was short, with the data only covering

the period 1925-38, this outlier colors the sample statistics of what was really a transitional

period. We found some evidence in favor of this hypothesis. According to both the center

country and the trade linkages models of international business cycle dynamics, the variance of

the global shock increased relative to the idiosyncratic shocks during the interwar period.

Everything else being equal, this explains increased cross-border output comovements. However,

the variance decomposition of the same models suggests that increased transmission accounted

for most of the increased role of external factors in the determination of output variances. This

suggests that despite the on-going disintegration during the interwar period, the forces of

transmission can still be large. Clearly, the transmission of large shocks in the largest country,

the U.S., was, unsurprisingly, a key factor in the worldwide Great Depression.



A second hypothesis is what we call the idiosyncratic shock hypothesis. This hypothesis

postulates that changes in economic structure—especially the declining share of the agricultural

sector in total output and the systematic use of stabilization policies—resulted in a decline in the
                                                - 29 -



size of idiosyncratic shocks relative to global shocks. Everything else being equal, this can

contribute to explaining increased cross-border output comovements. We found evidence in

favor of this hypothesis for the transition from the classical gold standard to the other eras during

which relative shock variances decreased. For other transitions, the changes in relative variances

were, on average, very minor.



A third hypothesis postulates that while seemingly similar, the depth and breadth of cross-border

integration before World War I was different from that in the current era. The two eras of

globalization may thus have been more different than it is sometimes assumed. Bordo,

Eichengreen, and Irwin (1999), for example, argued that global capital market integration today

is broader and deeper, including a larger set of financial instruments, a larger number of more

diverse financial intermediaries operating on a global scale, and a wider range of sectors using

international markets for financial purposes. In addition, there has been a shift from debt to

equity finance at the global level. Similarly, in international trade, the depth or cross-border

integration has increased (e.g., Krugman, 1995). The share of trade in tradables production has

increased with intra-industry trade and the shift toward trade in manufacturing products, and

producers have been able to break production geographically at a much larger scale (“vertical

production linkages”). While we intend to investigate this hypothesis more systematically, we

have been constrained by a lack of data. In particular, we believe that with deeper and broader

increased economic and financial interdependence through trade and financial linkages, the

scope for global shocks has clearly increased and even industry-specific shocks can have global

repercussions with production linkages. In addition, with highly integrated capital markets, it
                                               - 30 -



may be in practice quite difficult to distinguish between true global shocks and what appear to be

global shocks but are really rapidly transmitted shocks in the center countries.



                                    VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS


In this paper, we have documented that there is a secular trend towards increased

synchronization for much of the twentieth century and that it occurs across diverse exchange rate

regimes. This finding is of interest because it is in marked contrast to much of the recent

literature, which has focused primarily on the evidence for the past 20 or 30 years and which has

produced mixed results.



We then considered a number of possible explanations for the observed pattern of increased

synchronization. We first ascertained the role of shocks demarcated into country-specific

(idiosyncratic) and global (common). Our key finding here is that global (common) shocks

generally are the main influence across all regimes and models. We note, however, that with

reduced form models of the kind used in this paper, it remains difficult to distinguish between

“true” global shocks and major shocks in the center country(ies). Nevertheless, financial factors

often seem to be present at times when large global output shocks can be identified.



This finding coupled with earlier evidence produced by ourselves and others that business cycles

since World War II have become less volatile, less frequent and asymmetric with a tendency

towards recoveries exceeding downturns in duration, has some interesting implications. We

suggest that what may be occurring is that the weakening in national business cycles since
                                                        - 31 -



World War II coupled with the diminution of idiosyncratic shocks reflect the forces discussed by

Zarnowitz (1992) and others, such as changes in the composition of output, the advent of

automatic stabilizers, improvements in discretionary monetary and fiscal policy, the

implementation of effective lenders of last resort and a financial safety net, and the proliferation

of private risk sharing instruments.33



At the same time, the increasing importance of global shocks and, to some extent, transmission,

we posit reflects the forces of globalization, especially the integration of goods and services

through international trade (Findlay and O’Rourke 2003) and the integration of financial markets

(Obstfeld and Taylor 2003). Elsewhere, we have presented evidence showing a modest role for

increasing bilateral trade in explaining synchronization, with stronger evidence for regional

integration in Europe and North America (Bordo and Helbling, 2004). Evidence for the role of

financial integration proxied by the removal of capital controls is inconclusive.



We also did some exploratory work on the role of the policy regime in explaining the pattern of

synchronization. We found little evidence for the prediction that adhering to fixed exchange rates

fosters synchronization except in the period since 1973, and these results appear driven largely

by the process of European Monetary Union. Clearly, further research is needed.

  We would like to emphasize that the decrease in idiosyncratic shock volatility does not necessarily imply that it is
the volatility of the underlying “deep structural” shocks (e.g., a widespread drought) that we are measuring. Given
that we derive the shocks on the basis of GDP series alone, it means that the effects of these deep shocks on output
have diminished. There is, however, some evidence that shocks that are widely perceived as being exogenous may
have an endogenous component. Barsky and Kilian (2001), for example, argue that the sharp increase in real oil
prices in the 1970s was in part a reaction to the earlier massive expansion of the world money supply.
