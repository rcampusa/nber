                                         ABSTRACT

Physicians, acting in their role as experts, are often faced with situations where they must trade
off personal and patient welfare. Physicians’ incentives vary based on the organizational
environment in which they practice. We use the publication of a major clinical trial, which found
that a common knee operation does not improve outcomes for patients with osteoarthritis, as an
“informational shock” to gauge the impact of physicians’ agency relationships on treatment
decisions. Using a 100% sample of procedures in Florida from 1998 to 2010, we find that
publication of the trial reduced procedure volume, but the magnitude of the decline was smaller
in physician-owned surgery centers. Incentives affected physicians’ reactions to evidence.

I. INTRODUCTION


       Vertical integration between physicians and others types of health care providers can
facilitate care coordination but, under the prevailing fee-for-service reimbursement regime, may
present physicians with incentives to refer patients for costly care. Physician ownership
arrangements are of special concern. Historically physicians owned the offices in which they
provided primary care and basic exams but maintained arms-length relationships with hospitals,
imaging centers, surgery centers, and other facilities. Beginning in the 1990s and continuing
throughout the 2000s, many physicians assumed ownership stakes in non-office facilities. Based
on concerns that ownership encourages physicians to recommend high cost, low value services,
the US Department of Health and Human Services restricts physician ownership of health care
facilities. Some types of physician ownership arrangements are prohibited outright. Others are
permitted as long as they adhere to a number of regulatory “safe harbors”.
       Research on physician ownership of surgery centers (Hollenbeck et al. 2010;
Hollingsworth et al. 2010a; 2010b; 2011; Mitchell 2010), cardiac hospitals (Barro et al. 2006;
Mitchell 2005; 2008, Nallamothu et al. 2007), imaging centers (Baker 2010; Shreibati and Baker
2012) and pharmacy services (Iizuka 2007; 2012) has generally confirmed the hypothesis that
ownership is associated with increased use of health care services. A limitation of most of these
studies is that, in the absence of a benchmark for the optimal level of use, it is impossible to
assess the impact of alternative practice arrangements on consumer welfare. Physicians in
physician-owned facilities provide more care, but we do not know if they provide too much.
       In 2002 the New England Journal of Medicine published the results of a trial (hereafter,
the “Moseley trial”) showing that arthroscopic surgery for patients with osteoarthritis of the
knee, a widely used procedure at the time, does not improve patient outcomes (Moseley et al.
2002). Physicians perform arthroscopic surgery in hospital-based surgery centers or freestanding
centers, most of which are physician-owned. We use the trial as an “informational shock” to
compare physicians’ treatment decisions in hospital-based and physician-owned ambulatory
surgery centers. We find that the Moseley trial affected practice patterns, but the magnitude of
the effect was smaller in freestanding centers. The Moseley trial identified a clinical scenario
where physicians’ financial interests and the interests of their patients diverge. Faced with the



                                                  3
same set of scientific facts, physicians in hospital-based and freestanding surgery centers
responded differently.


II. PHYSICIAN OWNERSHIP AND TREATMENT INCENTIVES


       For every surgery, insurers pay a professional services fee to the surgeon for their labor
and a facility fee (or “technical” fee) to the hospital or surgery center to cover the cost of
supplies, non-physician labor, and capital. Physician-owners split the profits generated from
facility fees based on their ownership shares, providing an extra incentive to induce demand. 1 (It
would be illegal under federal anti-kickback laws for a facility to pay a physician based on the
profits generated from directly from his own surgeries.) Physician-owned facilities can also
incentivize physicians by tying ownership shares to productivity. Reallocating ownership shares
on a predetermined schedule based on each owner’s procedure volume is illegal. However,
reallocating shares during times of transition – when owners bring in a new partner or when an
existing partner retires – is legal as long as shares are exchanged at fair market value.
       Managers in physician-owned facilities may be better than managers in other types of
facilities at eliciting high levels of physician effort (and inducement). Hospitals are large,
bureaucratic, multi-product firms. The residual claimants (e.g., shareholders, non-clinical
administrators) are far-removed from the delivery of care. By contrast, groups of surgeon-owners
face stronger incentives to monitor each others’ case volumes, face lower monitoring costs, and
have greater ability to reward high-volume surgeons and punish shirkers.


III. CLINICAL BACKGROUND


       Arthroscopic surgery is a minimally invasive procedure to treat damage to the soft tissue
of the knee. A patient undergoing arthroscopic surgery receives several small incisions in the
knee. The surgeon inserts a camera (the arthroscope) to inspect the bone, cartilage, and soft
tissue in the joint. After validating the initial diagnosis, the surgeon may perform lavage
(irrigation of the joint to remove particles that cause inflammation), debridement (to remove


1
 Income effects may offset the direct incentives presented by ownership. If ownership increases
physicians’ income, they may reduce labor supply and/or efforts to induce demand (McGuire 2000).

                                                  4
damaged tissue), and/or a menisectomy (to remove damaged meniscal tissue). In 2002 the New
England Journal of Medicine published a trial evaluating arthroscopic surgery for patients with
osteoarthritis (Moseley et al. 2002). Patients in the control arm were anestisized and underwent
sham surgery. The trial found that patients did not benefit from surgery. There were no
differences in pain and functioning between the treatment arms. Because the trial was published
in one of the most prominent medical journals, resulted in the publication of a number of
commentaries in other journals, and was covered in the popular press (e.g., Kolata 2002),
knowledge of the trial among physicians should have been widespread.
       Some orthopedic surgeons questioned the external generalizability of the Moseley trial,
as is typical following the release of trials that challenge established practices. Medicare and
major private insurers accepted the findings and withdrew coverage of arthroscopic surgery for
patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis (CMS 2003; 2004; Aetna 2003). As we describe
in section X, it is difficult for insurers to enforce non-coverage policies because insurance claims
for knee arthroscopy do not report whether surgery is being performed primarily to treat
osteoarthritis or other types of knee problems. While this feature complicates the task of
measuring the impact of the trial, it ensures that surgeons retain a great deal of discretion in how
they treat patients presenting with knee pain. Since 2002, two additional trials (Kirkley et al.
2008; Katz et al. 2013) have confirmed the finding of the Moseley trial.


IV. INCENTIVES AND DEMAND INDUCEMENT


       We hypothesize that surgeons practicing in freestanding centers, who face stronger
financial incentives to perform surgery, were less likely to stop performing knee arthroscopy in
patients with osteoarthritis compared to surgeons in hospital-based centers. Prior to publication
of the Moseley trial, surgeons could have reasonably believed that all patients with osteoarthritis
of the knee would benefit from knee arthroscopy. There was no conflict between physician
welfare and physicians’ perceptions of patient welfare. After publication, physicians’ incentives
and patients’ interests diverged. Physicians who recommended knee arthroscopy to patients with
osteoarthritis were “inducing” demand by encouraging patients to consume unnecessary services
(McGuire 2000).



                                                  5
V. DATA AND IDENTIFICATION OF PROCEDURES


       We measured trends in arthroscopic knee surgery volume among patients age 18 and
older using Florida’s State Ambulatory Surgery Database for the period 1998 to 2010. The data
capture 100% of outpatient surgeries in Florida and include the information typically found on
insurance claims, including basic patient demographics and diagnosis and procedure codes. The
data are collected by the state’s Agency for Health Care Administration. We identified
procedures using Current Procedural Terminology and International Classification of Diseases
version 9 (ICD-9) codes (see the appendix for a list of codes). The data include an identifier for
the facility where the surgery was performed and whether the facility was a hospital-based or a
freestanding ambulatory surgery center.
       Osteoarthritis is inconsistently and infrequently recorded as a diagnosis on claims, and so
we do not limit the sample to patients with osteoarthritis. Instead, claims typically include codes
for “Internal derangement of knee” (ICD-9 code 717.X). We analyze facility-level procedure
volumes that reflect the use of surgery in patients with osteoarthritis and patients with other types
of knee problems.
       We identified 522,635 arthroscopic knee surgeries, of which 233,321 (44%) were
performed in freestanding centers. Patients treated in freestanding centers were slightly older (52
versus 50) than patients treated in hospital-based centers. The distribution of insurance type
(60% male, about 20% Medicare) was very similar.


VI. IDENTIFICATION OF THE IMPACT OF PHYSICIAN-OWNERSHIP


       We compare changes in the volume of arthroscopic knee surgeries between hospital-
based and freestanding surgery centers following publication of the Moseley trial. As with many
previous studies of physician ownership (e.g., Hollingsworth et al. 2010a; Mitchell 2005), we
only observe patients who received surgery. We do not observe patients who were evaluated for
but did not receive arthroscopic surgery. Comparisons of surgery volume trends between
hospital-based and freestanding centers may be biased by secular trends in patient demand.
       Our main identification strategy is to evaluate trends in the volume of arthroscopic knee
surgeries relative to trends in the volume of arthroscopic shoulder surgeries. Arthroscopic


                                                 6
shoulder surgery shares many of the characteristics of arthroscopic knee surgery: it is a
minimally invasive, outpatient surgery used to treat a variety of conditions, including arthritis.
All of the centers in our sample performed arthroscopic shoulder procedures in addition to
arthroscopic knee surgery. The intuition behind our approach is that the secular trends that
affected the demand for knee surgery over the study period – e.g., the growth of the freestanding
surgery center industry, changes in local population demographics – should be captured by
trends in the volume of arthroscopic shoulder procedures. Under a fairly innocuous set of
assumptions, we can identify the number of knee surgeries that would have been avoided if
physicians in freestanding centers behaved like physicians in hospital-based centers post-
Moseley.
       A simple model is useful for formalizing this argument and the identifying assumptions.
For the sake of simplicity, assume there is a single hospital-based center and a single
freestanding center. Let    k Ht represent   the number of knee surgeries in the hospital-based center in

period t (1 or 2, corresponding to pre- and post-Mosely periods). Let K Ht represent patient

demand in the hospital-based center (i.e., the number of patients with knee problems evaluated
for surgery). Let sHt and S Ht represent the volume and demand for shoulder surgeries in the

hospital-based center. The quantities for the freestanding center are defined analogously ( k Ft ,

K Ft , s Ft , S Ft ). The treatment rate is the number of patients who received surgery divided by the
number evaluated for surgery. The treatment rate for patients with knee pain in the hospital-
based center is


        k Ht                                                        [1]
        K Ht



The number of surgeries that could be avoided in period 2 if the treatment rate in the
freestanding center was the same as the treatment rate in hospital-based centers is


                 kH 2                                               [2]
        kF 2 −        KF2
                 KH2




                                                        7
The first term is the actual number of knee surgeries in the freestanding center, and the second is
the number that would occur if the freestanding center had the same treatment rate as the
hospital-based center ( k H 2 / K H 2 ). We can estimate [2] without data on patient demand (K or S)
using data on the number of shoulder surgeries,


                                      kH 2
                  kH 2                s     k
         kF 2   −      K F 2 = k F 2 − H 2 F 1 sF 2 ,                [3]
                  KH 2                k H 1 sF 1
                                       sH 1



under three assumptions. 2


Assumption 1: Within facility types (hospital-based versus freestanding), there is a constant
relationship between the number of patients evaluated for knee surgery and the number evaluated
for shoulder surgery. For every K patients with knee problems, there are δK with shoulder

problems:   δ H K Ht = S Ht   and   δ F K Ft = S Ft .3


Assumption 2: The shoulder surgery treatment rate has not changed over time (but it can differ
between hospital-based and freestanding centers):
sH 1 sH 2           s    s
    =     = α H and F 1 = F 2 = α F .
SH 1 SH 2           SF1 SF 2


Assumption 3: The knee surgery treatment rate was similar in hospital-based and freestanding
                            kH 1 kF1
centers pre-Moseley:             =     .
                            K H 1 K F1




2
  The equality holds if we apply assumptions 1 and 2 (substitute sHt = α H δ H K Ht and sFt = α F δ F K Ft ),
cancel out the α H δ H ’s and α F δ F ’s, and then apply assumption 3.
3
  The claim also holds under an alternative version of the assumption: δ1K H 1 = S H 1 , δ1K F 1 = S F 1 ,
δ 2 K H 2 = S H 2 , and δ 2 K F 2 = S F 2 . In this version, the relationship between the demand for knee and
shoulder procedures is allowed to vary over time but not across providers.

                                                         8
       Assumption 1 would be violated if the number of patients experiencing knee problems
increased at a different rate than the number of patients experiencing shoulder problems. Using
the 2002 and 2008 National Health Interview Surveys, nationally-representative surveys
conducted by the US Department of Health and Human Services, we estimated that the
proportion of adults who experienced “pain, aching, stiffness or swelling” in or around one of
their knee joints in the past 30 days increased from 16.4% (16.0% to 17.0%) in 2002 to 19.0%
(95% CI: 18.3% to 19.7%) in 2008. The comparable figures for the shoulder joints are 8.6%
(95% CI: 8.2% to 9.1%) and 9.3% (95% CI: 8.8% to 9.8%).4 These imply that the value of δ
(the ratio of shoulder to knee patients) was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.47 to 0.58) in 2002 and 0.49 (0.42 to
0.56) in 2008. The difference is qualitatively small and statistically insignificant, supporting the
validity of the assumption.
       Assumption 2 would be violated if the criteria for determining whether patients with
shoulder problems are good candidates for surgery changed over time. There were no major
changes in evidence about the effectiveness of shoulder surgery over the period covered by our
study. Reflecting the lack of evidence on the effectiveness of shoulder arthroscopy, the American
Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons stated in its 2010 treatment guideline for osteoarthritis of the
shoulder (Izquierdo et al. 2010), “We are unable to recommend for or against the use of
arthroscopic treatments for patients with glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis.”
       Based on our review of the medical literature, we believe it is unlikely that the
publication of the Moseley trial affected physicians’ beliefs about the effectiveness of shoulder
arthroscopy. Only two of the 599 articles that have cited the Moseley trial according to the New
England Journal of Medicine website were on the subject of shoulder arthroscopy (Beard et al.
2015; Judge et al. 2014). Both cited the Moseley trial as an example of the type of trial (placebo-
controlled) that should be conducted on shoulder surgery, not as a trial that provides evidence
about shoulder surgery. Neither the systematic review on the effectiveness of surgery for
shoulder osteoarthritis conducted by the well-respected Cochrane group (Singh et al. 2011) nor
the shoulder osteoarthritis clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Orthopedic
Surgeons (Izquierdo et al. 2010) cite the Moseley trial.


4
  Respondents self-reported shoulder and knee problems. Estimates are weighted and standard errors
adjusted for the complex survey design. We used Monte Carlo simulation to calculate confidence
intervals for ratios.

                                                   9
        Conceivably, surgeons who reduced the number of knee surgeries they performed after
the publication of the Moseley trial may have performed more shoulder surgeries, making it
difficult to interpret changes in the ratio of knee to shoulder surgeries over time. However,
orthopedic surgeons could offset decreases in the volume of knee surgeries by performing other
types of orthopedic surgeries (e.g., hip replacements), not just shoulder surgeries. Any
substitution between knee and shoulder surgeries is probably a small, second-order effect.
        Assumption 3 would be violated if patients with knee pain were treated differently at
hospital-based and freestanding centers prior to the publication of the Moseley trial. Before
2002, several small randomized trials of debridement (Merchan et al. 1993) and lavage (Ike et al.
1992) found that these therapies reduced knee pain. Knee arthroscopy was a well-accepted,
established therapy for osteoarthritis, and orthopedic surgeons in both hospital-based and
freestanding centers could have reasonably believed that their interests were aligned with the
interests of their patients (Chandra and Skinner 2012).


VII. TRENDS IN PROCEDURE VOLUME


        Figure 1 displays trends in the quarterly volume of arthroscopic knee surgeries, overall
and, separately, in the 161 hospital-based and 70 freestanding centers that operated continuously
between 1998 and 2010 and performed an average of 20 knee arthroscopies annually. These
facilities accounted for 73 percent of the arthroscopic knee surgeries in Florida over the study
period. Many freestanding surgery centers opened in Florida between 1998 and 2010 and are
thus excluded. The figure indicates the date of publication of the Moseley and Kirkley trials and
the release of the CMS Decision Memo (2003) indicating that Medicare would withdraw
coverage of arthroscopic surgery for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.
        Annual arthroscopic surgery volume in Florida increased from 41 thousand procedures in
1998 to 63 thousand in 2007 before declining to 59 thousand in 2010. The prevalence of
symptomatic knee osteoarthritis was increasing over this period (Nguyen et al. 2011). There was
a sharp decline in volume in hospital-based centers following publication of the Moseley trial.
Most of the post-Moseley decline in procedure volume preceded changes in insurers’ coverage
policies.



                                                10
        Table 1 displays annual procedure counts for surgeons who performed at least 20 knee
arthroscopies annually. Over the period 1998 to 2001, there were 301 surgeons who performed
most of their procedures at hospitals. Surgeons in freestanding centers performed over 92% of
their surgeries at their most frequently used freestanding center. The vast majority (>95%) would
be classified as owners using the criteria employed by Hollingsworth et al. (2010a) to distinguish
between owners and non-owners. The data include surgeon identifiers, but these cannot be linked
over time, hence our focus on facility-level analyses.
        Figure 2 shows trends in facility-level procedure volumes. Average volume grew rapidly
in freestanding centers prior to the publication of the Moseley trial, particularly in 1998 and
1999. Some or many of the freestanding centers in the sample may have opened just prior to
1998, and so the trends in volume probably reflect the volume growth typical for new entrants.
        The left panel of Figure 2 shows trends in quarterly, facility-level arthroscopic shoulder
surgery volumes. Procedure volume did not decline following publication of the Moseley trial,
consistent with the idea that the Moseley trial did not affect physicians’ or patients’ perceptions
of the benefits of shoulder surgery.


VIII. THE IMPACT OF THE MOSELEY TRIAL


VIII.A. Difference-in-difference-in-difference estimate


        Before presenting our preferred specification, which examines changes in the ratio of
knee to shoulder surgeries, we present the traditional triple difference estimator. Table 2 shows
average quarterly procedure volume among the 161 hospital-based and 70 freestanding centers
before and after publication of the Moseley trial. The first panel displays arthroscopic knee
procedures. We drew 1,000 bootstrap samples, with sampling at the level of the surgery center,
to obtain standard errors and confidence intervals. Average volume decreased in hospital-based
centers and increased in freestanding centers. The difference-in-difference estimate of the impact
of the Moseley trial on quarterly knee arthroscopy volume is -16.9 [95% CI: -27.6, -6.3]
procedures (= [32.6 – 38.9] – [68.0 – 57.3]). 5


5
 If we had observations for all patients with knee pain, not just those who had surgery, we could proceed
with a standard regression-based difference-in-difference estimate that includes controls for patient

                                                   11
        The bottom panel of Table 2 repeats the difference-in-difference analysis for arthroscopic
shoulder procedures. The difference-in-difference estimate is -9.0 [95% CI: -14.9, -3.1]
procedures, reflecting the secular shift in volume from hospital-based to freestanding centers.
The difference-in-difference-in-difference estimate is -8.0 [95% CI: -15.5, -0.4] procedures per
quarter (= -16.9 - [-9]). The interpretation is that the Moseley trial reduced the volume of
arthroscopic knee procedures in hospital-based centers by 8 procedures relative to trends in
freestanding centers.


VIII.B. Preferred specification


        The difference-in-difference-in-difference estimator imposes an additivity assumption
that may be problematic in our case. It assumes that, in the absence of an effect, the difference-
in-difference estimator for shoulder surgery would be of the same magnitude as the difference-
in-difference estimator for knee surgery. This assumption seems inconsistent with the
observation that the number of knee surgeries is greater than the number of shoulder surgeries at
any point in time. Trends in knee and shoulder surgery volumes operate on different scales and
from much different baseline levels. As an alternative to the standard difference-in-difference-in-
difference estimator, we estimate a model that examines trends in the ratio of knee to shoulder
surgeries. The model is


        yit = α 0 + α1 H i + α 2 sit + α 3 H i sit + α 4 M tpost sit + α 5 H i M tpost sit + ui + ε it .       [6]



This model is our preferred specification. Here                 yit is the number of arthrosopic knee procedures
in center i in quarter t and sit is the number of arthrosopic shoulder procedures. H i is an
                                                                     post
indicator for whether a center is hospital-based, M t                       is an indicator for the post-Moseley




characteristics. However, we only observe the characteristics of patients who had surgery. These may
have changed over time in direct response to the Moseley trial (for example, if older patients were more
likely to abstain from surgery post-Moseley), and so it does not make sense to include them in a
regression model.

                                                                12
period, and µi is a center-level random effect. The coefficient on the interaction of the hospital-

based center and post-period indicators, α 5 , is of interest.
         The model can also be written as


yit = β 0 + β1H i + β 2 H i M tpre sit + β 3 H i M tpost sit + β 4 Fi M tpre sit + β 5 Fi M tpost sit + µi + ε it ,   [7]


where Fi = 1 − H i is an indicator for freestanding centers and M tpre = 1 − M tpost is an indicator for

the pre-Moseley period. This form has an intuitive interpretation. The parameter β 2 represents
the number of knee surgeries per shoulder surgery in hospital-based centers pre-Moseley (e.g.,
k H 1 / sH 1 ). The parameter β 3 represents the number of knee surgeries per shoulder surgery in

hospital-based centers post-Moseley (e.g., k H 2 sH 2 ). The parameters β 4 and β 5 are defined
analogously for freestanding centers. The difference-in-difference estimator is
θ = α5 = (β3 − β 2 ) − (β5 − β 4 ) .
         We estimated the model via least squares. Quarterly arthroscopic knee surgery procedure
counts are skewed, but counts of shoulder surgery procedures are also skewed and correlated
with knee surgery procedure counts. The skew in the residual from the regression is much lower
than the skew in the raw procedure counts and the distribution is bell-shaped, though a Shapiro-
Wilk test rejects the null that the residual is normally distributed (p < 0.001). In the baseline
specification we treat µi as a random effect. We do not require fixed effects for purposes of
identification because provider type is a time-invariant clinic characteristic. Standard errors are
clustered at the facility level. The sample size is 12,012 facility-quarter observations (231
facilities × 4 quarters × 13 years).
         Column A in Table 3 displays estimates from the model described by equation [7].
Freestanding centers performed 1.78 and hospitals 1.76 arthroscopic knee procedures per
arthroscopic shoulder procedure before the publication of the Moseley trial. Practice patterns
were similar. Following publication of the Moseley trial, freestanding centers performed 1.25
and hospitals 0.94 arthroscopic knee procedures per arthroscopic shoulder procedure.




                                                                 13
       We estimate θ = −0.33 = (0.94 − 1.78) − (1.25 − 1.76) . The p-value is 0.027 based
on a Wald test. The interpretation is that the publication of the Moseley trial had a stronger
influence on practice patterns in hospital-based centers.
       Using the estimated parameters, we constructed the right-hand side of equation [3]. We
estimate that freestanding centers would have performed 3,000 fewer arthroscopic knee
procedures annually (95% confidence interval: 2,133 to 3,866) over the period 2003 to 2007
(from a base of about 34,000 procedures) if the post-Moseley treatment rate in freestanding
centers was the same as the treatment rate in hospital-based centers.
       Figure 3 shows estimates of θ from alternative specifications of the model described by
equation [6]. Model 1 is the baseline model. Model 2 omits the hospital indicator. Models 3 and
4 treat µi as a fixed effect. Model 4 weights the regressions by pre-2002 surgery volume. Model

5 includes all facilities, including those that entered after 1998. Model 6 omits 1998 and 1999
from the analysis. Model 7 omits 2009 and 2010, where procedure volume was subject to the
influence of the Kirkley trial and the recession.
       Models 8-10 examine procedure counts within age groups. These results indicate that the
baseline estimate is not driven by differences in the age composition of patients treated in
hospital-based versus freestanding centers. Overall, the results show that the estimate of θ is
insensitive to alternative model specifications.
       Models 11 and 12 stratify the analysis by insurance type: private versus other. About half
of patients in the other category have Medicare, and about one-third have Medicaid. The results
indicate that after the Moseley trial, freestanding centers were more likely to perform
arthroscopy in privately insured patients than hospital-based centers. However, practice patterns
were similar for patients with other types of insurance. One explanation is that physicians face
stronger incentives to induce demand for privately-insured patients because private insurers pay
more than Medicare and Medicaid. 6

 Across all services, Medicare payments to physicians are 79% of the payments made by preferred
provider organizations, the most common form of private insurance (MEDPAC 2015).

X. SURGERY RATES BY PROCEDURE TYPE


       There are two broad categories of arthroscopic knee surgery: debridement and
menisectomy. Examining trends by procedure type provides an additional source of
identification. Insurers’ costs of monitoring appropriateness are much lower for debridement
compared to menisectomy. Thus, we expect that physicians would focus their inducement efforts
on menisectomy.
       Figure 4 depicts a stylized treatment pathway for patients with knee pain who are
evaluated for arthroscopic surgery. Consider a patient with knee pain where the surgeon suspects
the pain is due to arthritis (A). The surgeon recommends that the patient undergo an arthroscopy
(B). During surgery, the physician determines if the patient has damaged meniscal tissue (C).
The mensci are cartilaginous disks that cushion the knee joint. If so, he performs a
“meniscectomy” to remove torn tissue (E). Otherwise, he performs a debridement procedure (D).
A meniscectomy was performed on 81 percent of the patients randomized to arthroscopic
surgery in the Kirkley trial.
       Now consider a patient where the surgeon suspects pain is caused by a torn meniscus (F).
Typically, the surgeon will order a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) (G) to confirm the
results of the physical examination. If the MRI shows a torn meniscus (H), he performs a
menisectomy (E).
       Following arthroscopic surgery, the surgeon submits an insurance claim for a
debridement procedure or a menisectomy. Post-Moseley, insurers scrutinize claims for
debridement procedures closely. However, when an insurer receives a bill for a menisectomy,
there is no information on the claim that permits the insurer to determine whether the patient was
originally treated for osteoarthritis (pathway A-B-C-E), in which case the procedure is not
covered, or a torn meniscus (pathway F-G-H-E).
       Some insurers require documentation that the patient has a torn meniscus before
authorizing payment for arthroscopic surgery. Surgeons may order an MRI (G) for a patient who
is a candidate for surgery (A) to document meniscal damage. Many older patients have
asymptomatic meniscal tears (Englund et al. 2008). For this reason, surgeons are advised not to
rely exclusively on radiological evidence when deciding whether to perform a menisectomy.
Nevertheless, surgeons can use imaging studies to justify performing a menisectomy (E) on a


                                                15
patient with arthritis. Based on the information included on insurance claims, insurers cannot
distinguish between treatment pathways A-G-H-E and F-G-H-E. They must pay the claim or risk
denying payment for medically appropriate care.
        Figure 5 depicts trends in debridement procedures and menisectomies. Use of
debridement declined steeply following publication of the Moseley trial in both hospital-based
and freestanding centers. Use was declining in hospital-based centers prior to the Moseley trial.
The trendline for freestanding centers displays two notable trend breaks. The first occurs
immediately following publication of the Moseley trial. The second occurs after CMS issued a
decision memo stating its intent to discontinue coverage for arthroscopic surgery for patients
with severe osteoarthritis. It appears surgeons in freestanding centers reacted to changes in
coverage policy. Use of meniscectomy declined following publication of the Moseley trial in
hospital-based and freestanding centers. However, by 2004 procedure volume had rebounded to
pre-Moseley levels in freestanding centers.
        Model [B] in Table 3 re-estimates equation [7] for debridement procedures only. Pre-
Moseley, hospital-based and freestanding centers performed 0.26 and 0.25 debridement
procedures per arthroscopic shoulder procedure, respectively. Post-Moseley, the comparable
figures are 0.05 and 0.06. The differential decline in hospital-based centers is insignificant ( θ =
-0.029, p = 0.39).
        Model [C] in Table 3 re-estimates equation [7] for menisectomies only. Pre-Moseley,
hospital-based and freestanding centers performed 1.53 and 1.51 debridement procedures per
arthroscopic shoulder procedure. Post-Moseley, the comparable figures are 0.9 and 1.19. The
differential decline is significant ( θ = -0.31, p = 0.02).
        The results are consistent with the hypothesis that surgeons in freestanding centers
decreased use of the procedure (debridement) where insurers’ monitoring costs are low, but
continued to perform the procedure (menisectomy) for which it is relatively difficult for insurers
to determine medical appropriateness.


XI. THE KIRKLEY TRIAL


        In 2008 the New England Journal of Medicine published the results from a trial that
randomized patients with osteoarthritis to arthroscopic surgery plus physical and medical therapy

                                                  16
or physical and medical therapy alone (Kirkley et al. 2008). The Kirkley trial concluded
“surgery…provides no additional benefit to optimized physical and medical therapy.” Compared
to the Moseley trial, the Kirkley trial had broader enrollment criteria, including females and
patients with mild osteoarthritis, and procedures were performed by multiple surgeons.
       The left panel of Figure 2 shows that procedure volume declined around 2008, but the
size of the decline was larger in freestanding surgery centers. Model [D] in Table 3 tests the
impact of the Kirkley trial on center-level volume. We restrict the analysis to the period 2004 to
2010. We selected 2004 because it appears that results from the Moseley trial were fully
incorporated into practice by this time.
       If surgeons fully adjusted practice patterns following publication of the Moseley trial,
then the 2008 Kirkley trial should have had no impact on practice patterns. If physicians
continued to recommend knee surgery for patients with osteoarthritis, then we would expect that
procedure volume would decline following publication of the Kirkley trial. The results indicate
that hospital-based centers performed 0.74 arthroscopic knee surgeries per shoulder surgery pre-
Kirkley and 0.64 post-Kirkley. Freestanding centers performed 1.22 arthroscopic knee surgeries
per shoulder surgery pre-Kirkley and 1.0 post-Kirkley. The differential change is θ = 0.11 (p =
0.116), indicating that there was a larger, though non-significant, relative decline in knee surgery
volume in freestanding centers. Results from the other specifications described in Figure 3 are
similar. Given the non-significance of the result, we cannot draw too much from this analysis.
However, the sign of θ is consistent with the idea that, having induced demand at higher rates
following publication of the Moseley trial, surgeons in freestanding centers shifted toward the
more conservative practice patterns of their hospital-based peers. Publication of the Kirkley trial
would have made it increasingly difficult for physicians to cling to their beliefs in the
effectiveness of surgery. Physicians who continued to recommend surgery would face an even
higher utility penalty for inducing demand.


XII. CONCLUSIONS


       Publication of a trial that found that arthroscopic knee surgery does not benefit patients
with osteoarthritis affected practice patterns. However, the magnitude of the effect was smaller
in freestanding ambulatory surgery centers, where surgeons face stronger incentives to induce

                                                 17
demand and greater peer monitoring of effort. In contrast to prior studies on physician
ownership, we are able to tie differences in practice patterns to evidenced-based medical
practices.
        Estimates of the impact of ownership on practice patterns must be interpreted in light of
the fact that surgeons are not randomly assigned to work in hospital-based or physician-owned
surgery centers. Physician-owned centers may differentially attract older doctors who are less
likely to change practices in response to new evidence or “greedy” doctors, i.e., doctors who are
more willing to sacrifice patient welfare for their own financial gain. Some studies circumvent
this problem by examining how entry by physician-owned facilities affects market-level volume
(Barro et al. 2006; Hollenbeck et al. 2011; Hollingsworth et al. 2010b; 2011). These studies
suggest that ownership has a casual impact on practice patterns. Market-level surgery rates
increase following entry and are higher in markets where physician-owned facilities perform a
larger share of procedures.7
        Many medical procedures diffuse into clinical practice without having been subject to
rigorous testing. Clinical trials of established medical procedures can identify therapies that are
no better than less expensive alternatives. However, even well-done studies are open to differing
interpretations. Our results indicate that the organizational environment in which physicians
practice affects how they react to new evidence.

  We cannot separately identify the impact of selection effects versus other channels through which
ownership affects treatment decisions. However, while selection effects and reimbursement incentives
may appear to be distinct theories of physician behavior, they are closely related. Analogous to genotype-
environment interactions in biology, physician “greed” is a genotype that manifests itself under
reimbursement schemes that require physicians to trade off patient and personal welfare.
