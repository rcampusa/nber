                            PRICE VERSUS QUANT~Y:            MARKET
                               CLEARING MECHANISMS WHEN
                                SELLERS DIFFER IN QUALITY



                                           ABSTRACT



       High-quality producers in a vertically differentiated market can reap superior profits by

charging higher prices, selling greater quantities, or both. If qualities are known by consumers and

production costs are constant, then having a higher quality secures the producer both higher price

and higher quantity; if marginal costs are rising, having a higher quality assures only higher price.

If only some consumers can discern quality but others cannot, then high- and low-quality producers

may set a common price, but the high-quality producer will sell more. In this context, quality begets

quantity. Empirical analyses suggest that in both the mutual fund and automobile industries, high-

quality producers sell more units than their low-quality competitors, but at no higher price (or

markup) per unit.

 1.     Introduction

      You need an electrician.     If you Me fortunate,        you are a well-informed          consumer and you

know who is good,        and who is not.        A less-informed       consumer,     perhaps with no recourse

 beyond the Yellow Pages, is more likely to end up with a low-quality                     electrician.

      Markets of this type are common.           They are found with professionals               such as caterers,

doctors,    and movers, with services such as mutual funds, airlines, and resorts, and with

consumer     durables    such as automobiles,          dishwashers     and VCRs.        Though     quality     differs

significant ly among providers, many consumers do not know which ones are of high quality.

    In such markets, casual observation          suggests, suppliers whose qualities differ may charge

similm prices; that is, firms compete           on quality within a tight price range.              For example,

numerous     magazine     and newspaper        articles analyze the quality of similmly-priced                 goods

such as “n~load”      mutual funds and “economy”             cars; if some goods are found to have higher

quality by many sources, would their producers                earn their superior rents by raising prices

or by selling more units?         In both the mutual fund and automobile                  industries,    the latter

mechanism seems to apply:          the quantity sold by a firm is positively related to its product’s

perceived quality, while the price markup over cost has little or no relat ionship with quality. 1

We refer to this phenomenon          as “quantity clearing the market”.2

   In this paper, we =k:       “Under what conditions          would a ‘high-quality’       producer     choose to

reap its rents through greater quantity rather than higher price?”                    We focus on a duopoly

where the sellers differ in quality. 3 Markets where products               differ in characteristics        that can

be strictly ordered in terms of desirability           are called vertically      differentiated    markets.      We

use this bamework       to study the role of costs and imperfect             information     on relative market

shares, and we identify subtle and powerful mechanisms that allow different quantities sold,




1 See section 5.
2 This idea was inspired by the experience of prof-ional  bridge players, who are hired by customers to
play on teams in tournaments.  Casual observation suggests that prices per tournament tend to be close
across quality levels, but that the top profmsionals    tend to have jobs for a subst ant iall y greater proportion
of tournaments   than their lower-ranked   brethren,   Thus, the rents to quality   are raped    primarily    through
the mechanism of quantity, not price.
3 Market outcomes with many sellers are discused         in the Appendix.

 rather than different prices, to be the primmy mechanism                       that clears the market.4

     The notion       that product       dtierentiation     can soften price competition               has a long and

 distinguished      history. Chamberlain         (1933) first suggested a model of product                 differentiation

 as a means to avoid Bertrand’s              (1883) zero-profit    duopoly       result and to more realistically

 model monopolist ic competition.             For almost 50 years after that, the focus was on horizontal

dfierentiation,       with “location”      the best-studied     example.      In the late 1970s and early 1980s,

several economists         began to study vertically differentiated            markets, The early literature on

this subject focused on the properties of equilibria and tried to find general conditions                           under

which such industries would have a limited number of firms in equilibrium.5                                  Researchers

subsequent ly combined          models of vertical and horizontal different iat ion to study a range of

topics.6    However, there has been relatively little work on the relationship                         between quality

and market share, because even simple models can yield conflicting                          answers. 7 In this paper,

we make no claims of having rmolved these conflicts; rather, we aim to identify the strategic

incentives that can lead to large differences               in quantities      in the presence of small (or no)

differences in prices.

    Section      2 presents our basic model of a vertically                differentiated      duopoly      with perfect

information        and no costs of production,         a setup similm to that chosen by earlier authors.

Section 3 extends the model to allow for convex costs. We find that the relationships                              among

qualities and quantities            found in a model without         costs no longer apply when costs are

included.

    Section 4 presents the main result of the paper.                      Here, we add a class of imperfectly

informed consumers to the zero-cost model of section 2. We find that under some reasonable



4   In our paper, quantity    means “actual quantity sold”.    Thus, we are not pr=enting        a model of equilibrium
queue and explaining why some r=taurants,      movie,  etc. have persistent exe-    demand. This famous
problem is outside our current scope, See Becker (1991) for a model of this phenomenon.

(1995).
7 Sutton (1986) points out that the literature on vertical differentiation can give no general r=ults about
the relationship    between quality and market share. one attempt         to focus on this relationship     is Gabszewicz
et. al (1981),   but their r=ults   are for a specific type of consumer    utility function.   Rosen   (1981) studies the
 “superstar” phenomenon.  Many of his insights are also applicable          to our problem,     although    his superstars
tend to supply higher quantitie and charge higher prices.

 conditions,    both firms would prefer to post the same price (pooling)                rather than post different

 prices (separating).        Compared    tot he separating equilibrium,           pooling reduces both efficiency

 and the total number of consumers who are served; the imperfect information                           allows the firms

 to relax their price competition         in a tacit but effective manner, leading to an equilibrium                     in

 which the two firms may serve significantly              dflerent    numbers of consumers.

     Section 5 presents two empirical studies that address the relationships                          among quantity,

price markups, and quality in the mutual fund and automobile                          industries, and find results

consistent with the model of section 4, Section 6 concludes.                     An Appendix       provides detailed

solutions for the models studied in sections 3 and 4, as well as a many-firm extension of the

model presented in section 2.8



2.     A Basic           Model          of Vertically                Differentiated                   Duopoly

     Our basic model assumes that there are no costs of production                      and that both consumers

and producers       have perfect information.         We work in a partial equilibrium                 framework,    fo-

cusing on a single consumption            good,     There are two producers            of this good,       indexed   by

m: a high-quality       producer,    m = H, with quality dH, and a low-quality                   producer,     m = L,

with quality d~. We assume that O < OL < OH < 1, and we define a as the ratio between

the qualities of L and H: a = &,             hence O < a < 1. For semantic ease, we will use female

pronouns      for H and male pronouns          for L. In equilibrium,           our producers     will earn profits,

but entry will not occur because (by assumption)                our industry is made up of producers with

scarce skills, which can earn rents. For example, high-quality                   electricians,   mutual funds, and

automobile      producers     earn rents, and these rents will not be dissipated by entry as long as

the underlying     high capability      cannot quickly be reproduced.             When quality takes the form

of an innate talent or a skill that is difficult to acquire, then this assumption                      is reasonable.g

Once we can safely ignore entry, our task is to model the market for different fixed numbers

of producers.     Duopoly      is the logical first step. The Appendix              sketches the solution to the

model with multiple firms, and gives an illustration for a special case of a 5-firm industry.

quality seller sets price first are available from the authors.

and very costly to reproduce in the long run.

     Let a consumer’s      “valuation”    for the consumption    good be denoted by u. Each consumer

 can buy either zero or one unit of the good.              There is a continuum           of consumers,    indexed

 by their valuation, v, on the interval [0, I]. The benefit to a consumer from purchasing                       one

 unit from producer m is vO~; the cost is the price, Pm. Thus, the specific realization                      of the

 utility function is



                                             u(e, v) = Vom – Pm                                                  (1)


 if the consumer buys one unit of the good from producer                m, and



                                                  U(e, v) = o                                                    (2)

 otherwise.    We assume that consumers           always have enough money to buy one unit of the

 good if it is optimal to do so. We also assume that when a consumer is indifferent betwwn

 buying and not buying, he buys, and when he is indifferent between buying the two types of

 goods, he buys horn H. The utility function used here is similar to the one chosen by earlier

 writers on vertical different iat ion. 10 If there were only one quality available, then this model

 of consumption       would imply a linear market demand curve where the fraction of consumers

 willing to buy a good of quality Om at any price P would be equal to 1 – ~.

     The sequence of events is

     (1) H chooses her price, PH.

     (2) L chooses his price, PL.

     (3) Each consumer      can: (A) purchase one unit horn H, (B) purchase one unit from L, or

 (C) make no purchase.

     This sequential price-setting       rule differs from the rule used in most of the previous liter-

ature on vertical differentiation,        where firms generally set prices simult anmusly.                We have

H set her price first because it is the simplest way to model imperfect                     information    (which

we do in section 4). For now, we still assume that consumers can costlessly                       determine the

quality of both producers.

10   See Gabszewicz   and Thisse   (1979, 1980) and Shaked and Sutton   (1982,   1983).    To generate the market
segmentation between dfierent qualitim, the utility functions used by these authors use different=        in income
rather than differences in valuations. In fact, the two approach=  are isomorphic.


                                                       4
     We solve the game backwards                to find the equilibrium              level of prices,     quantities,     and

 purchase decisions.          First, a consumer will

 A) buy the high-quality          good if

      (1) vo~ – P~ > ve~ – P~ + u > ~:::

     and

      (2)voH–       PH20+v2~;

 B) buy the low-quality          good if

     (1) vo~ – P~ > vo~ – P~ + v < ~:::

     and

     (2)vO~–P~~O+v>~;and

 C) otherwise,      a consumer will not buy.

     We next turn to L’s price-setting            problem.          L knows the distribution        of consumers         and

 their opt imal conditions.         Production         is costless. 11 The sellers maximize             profit, m, which

 absent costs is simply price times quantity.                   Thus, L seeks to maximize



                                                       TL   =    QLPL,                                                    (3)

 where QL is L’s quantity.          Using conditions            B. 1 and B.2, we can see that the quantity                for

 this producer      will be



                                                                                                                          (4)

Therefore,      L’s profit function     can be written as




                                           ‘L=    (
                                                       PH – PL

                                                                       —
                                                                       PL

                                                                       )      l’L.                                        (5)


The first-order condition         for L is



                                                                                                                          (6)


11   This no-cost   assumption   is a normalization,     and all the r=ults    of this section   would be identical      if we
used a constant marginal-cost production   function             as long w the continuum     of consumer     valuations    had
some mass above the level of marginal costs.


                                                                5
We can then solve for PL as


                                                      O~P~
                                               P~=—                                                    (7)
                                                         2eH

So L’s price will always be proportional       to H’s price, with a proportion    equal to &,    one-half

the ratio between the two quality levels.

   Finally, we turn to H’s price-setting     problem.     From (7) it can be verified that ~:~      > ~

for all optimal choices of PL by L. Thus, for any level of P~ that could be set in equilibrium,




Replacing

                                                (I–:”: ).
            PL by its optimal value, we can write H’s profits as

   Figure 1 plots PH and PL against 6L for the case of d“ = 1. At 8L = O, H effectively

possesses a monopoly,       and thus sets the monopoly          price, PH = .5.   As OL rises, H faces

increming   competition,     and her optimal     price falls.   Two counteracting    factors affect the

level of PL as @L rises: first, increases in 6L raise the ratio of equilibrium      prices ~;    second,

increases in dL cause PH to fall. As long as PH is high enough,            the first effect dominates,

and PL increases with f3~. When PH falls low enough so that increases in the ratio are not

sufficient to offset decre~es    in the level of PH, the second effect dominates,    and PL decreases

with 19L.

quality closes in on H’s, the price competition                             becomes so intense that PH and PL both fall

to low levels, making n~ diminish.                        As 6L +       1 = 19~, prices and profits go to zero for both

   A major focus of this paper is the relative market shares of high- and low-quality                                                       sellers.

What will be the equilibrium                       ratio of sales for H and L? We denote this ratio as ~, where

   Substituting             our equilibrium          values for PH and PL yields

       Thus, (16) reveals that the ratio of L’s and H’s market sh~es                       is a function    of the ratio

 of their qualities, with an upper bound of 1 (when a = 1) and a lower bound of ~ (when

 a = O). Two main results follow directly from (16).

      Result 1: H always has a greater market share than L: r <1, VQ.

      Result 2: The ratio of the market shares increases                    with the ratio of the qualities:        ~     =

           >0.

      These two results serve as simple benchmarks                     for the analyses that follow.



 3.       Convex             Costs       of Production

      We now bring costs into the basic model, employing                       a simple formulation        for the cost

 function,        F (Q~),   of



                                                     F(Qm)     = ~,                                                  (17)


 which implies muginal            costs for each firm of



                                                     F’(Qm)       = cQm.                                             (18)


      A price-taking        firm with this total cost function           would have a linear supply curve with

slope = c. Overall, a market composed                   of a fixed number of such firms with some quality

level d~ and the continuum               of consumers       with the preferences          given in section     2 would

generate linear supply and demand curves. 12

      The inclusion of costs does not alter the consumers’                  problem;    their optimal decision rules

are the same as in section 2. As before, H sets her price first by m=imizing




12    Solutions    to a model with difFerent marginal    costs for each firm and to a model       with linear total costs
are available      from the authors.   Rmults   for these models are qualitatively     similar to those d=cribed   in this
section.

     The main results here can be stated analogously                     to those of section 2.

     Result l’:   L can have a larger market share than H: r > 1 for some values of c, OH, and

 @L.

     Interest ingly, once we add even a small level of convex costs, it is sometimes                                               optimal for

 H to set a high price, attract            a small number of high-value                            customers,                and let L t~e      a

 majority of the market. This result is depicted graphically                            in Figure 3, which plots r against

 8L for the case where c = .1, @H = 1.




     This figure demonstrates           the dangers of ready conjectures                      about the relationship                  between

 mmket     share and quality.           Even in this simple example,                         the high-quality                   producer   will

sometimes sell more and sometimes                  less than the low-quality                      producer.             It is important       to

remember      here that the consumer            valuations          are uniformly                 distributed;               the result is not

driven by H’s d~ire to capture a slender tail of high-value consumers.                                            As costs rise, both H

and L select higher prices, resulting in lower quantities, but H raises price at a faster rate.

     Result 2’: The ratio of the market shares increases with ~L and decreases with OH: &                                                  >0

     This is analogous to Result 2 horn the previous section, although now we can no longer

 express r purely in terms of a. Figure 3 shows the typical relationship:14                                     r st=ts     off very

 low when d~ is low, and then rises monotonically                        with ~~, passing through                    r = 1. That

 is, the market shares of both firms are increasing                      in their own quality.                 This is a logical

 comparative          static r=ult      to expect,   but it must be considered           carefully in light of Result 1’.

 Together, the two results show that if a firm increases its quality, then its market share will

 also increase, but the higher-quality               firm will not necessarily have the great er market share.



     Figure 4 plots r for the case of 19~ = 1, 19~ = .5.                         As can be seen from the figure, r

first increases with c and then decreases.                    In the limit, as c goes to infinity, r converges

to a = &,             which is equal to .5 in this case.            Since r is a continuous                function       of c, it is

remnable          to abstract      from costs with at least some confidence                     that any specific solution

to the game will not be made unstable by small perturbations                                   in costs.       Nevertheless,     the

results of this section teach us to be wary of broad conjectures                               about the set of all equilibria

based on no-cost            models.           With these caveats in mind, the next section presents a model

with imperfect information                    and no costs of production.




4.       Imperfect                   Information

     For many goods            and services, it is dficult               or impossible        for some consumers            to know

the true quality of an item before purchase.                      For example, a consumer would not necessmily

be able to ~certain             the quality of the wiring installed by an electrician                            until some time

passed after the job was completed.                      This section uses a very simple information                       structure

for consumers who are trying to distinguish between H and L; we separate consumers                                                 into

two types, connoisseurs                   and dilettantes.      A connoisseur          can always tell producers                 apart;



                                                                   12
 that is, a connoisseur         will always know the type of producer               that he or she is buying from.

 A dilettante     can only tell producers           apart if they are charging different prices.           If the two

 producers      are charging the same price, then the dilettante                  will be unable to distinguish      H

 from L, at least until after the purchase.              Our model allows dilettantes to deduce information

 when different prices are charged since quality may be learned much more easily in markets

 where prices convey information.               Thus, if quality were either positively       or negatively related

 to price we assume that this fact would invariably                    be known.      When    prices are the same,

 additional work is required to determine who is high quality and who is low. Dilettantes are

 capable of restlessly using price-dependent                 information,       such as that “the noload       mutual

 funds have the highest returns”,               but unable (except      at prohibitive     cost) to use non-price-

 dependent      information,      such as that “mutual funds that invest primarily in stocks with low

 price-to-earnings     ratios have the highest returns”.             There is nothing about this information

 structure     that is inconsistent       with dilettantes        being rational     utility maximizers,      and we

 model them as such.

    We denote the fraction of dilettantes                by A, where dilettantes       are drawn uniformly       from

 all consumers.’5     Since connoisseurs          can always tell the producers          apart, the conditions     for

 their purchase decision are the same as in section 2. If the producers                        set different prices,

 then dilettantes can tell them apart as well, and their purchase decisions will be the same

as those of the connoisseurs.           However, if producers set the same price, then a dilettante will

have to randomly        choose a producer           (one-half    chance of each), and will only purchase the

good if his expected           utility of this random       purchase is nonnegative.         More formally, when

facing a single price, P, a dilettante will



    (1) buy    if (’~~d~)      v z P; and
   (2) otherwise not buy.



   When it is L’s turn to set prices, he knows that he can choose either a pooling equilibrium

15 This assumption     seems most re=onable   for markets such as automobil=,     where both dilettante  and
connoisseurs    may care equally about quality f~tors like safety and reliability, even though connoisseurs
would be better    informed,     Neverthele~,    relaxing this assumption   and drawing    connoisseurs   more heavily
from “high v“ consumers        would not qualitatively    change the results.

 (same price as H), or a separating      equilibrium        (different price).   If he chooses a separating

 equilibrium,   then all consumers will be able to tell the producers            apart, and his profits will

 be the same as they were in the model studied in section 2. Let the superscripts                   p and s

 indicate pooling    and separating,   respectively.      Then L’s profits are



                                                                                                         (22)


Profits will be maximized      here by a choice of P~ of

variables here of

enables us to write our results more concisely,            For example,    optimal   separating   profits for

L will be given by



                                                                                                        (24)


   If L chooses a pooling price, PL = ~H, then his profits will be



                                                                                                        (25)


   There is no maximization       here, since there is only one price, PL = PH, at which there

will be pooling.     If L selects the pooling     price, he will only sell to dilettantes      who have a

positive expected     value of purchasing   the good.        Half of these dilettantes    (by chance)   will

choose H, and half will choose L. This process will be familim to tourists who have tried to

pick a Broadway      show from the listings in the New York Times.

   L’s decision, then, is whether to choose the separating profits given in (24) or the pooling

profits given in (25). He will choose the separating profits, and a sepmating             equilibrium will

result if m: ~ x:.    This condition   implies that

        That is, there will be a cutoff level for P~, above which L will always prefer to separate;

 below the cutoff level L will prefer to pool; and at the cutoff level he will be indifferent.                                                           The

 intuition for this is straightforward:                         L’s optimal separating                 price is always a proportion                        of

 P~, so when P~ is low, L’s sepmating                                profits will be low as well.

Notes:       T;   is L’s   profit if he chooses the optimal separating price          to ~L     (eq.   24),   T;    is L’s profit       if he chooses     to

pool     by choosing         PL = PH (~.        25). The   profits    curves   are drawn   for the case ~      =    .5,   OH    =       1 and   @L   =    .5

        Figure 5 shows the optimal separating profits compared                                    to pooling           profits as a function

of PH for the special case of A = .5, t’H = 1 and 13~= .5 (i. e., a = ~ = .5).                                                          As PH rises,

separating profits rise monotonically,                       while pooling profits first rise and then fall as is typical

for a monopoly.                   Pooling profits reach their maximum when demand for the pooled product

low levels of PH, L is better off pooling,      because the low price set by H does not leave much

room for L to earn profits by attracting         low u customers with a still lower price.

   The next step is to solve for H’s optimal              PH, given L’s known optimal         response.      H

knows that she can bring about either a pooling              or separating   equilibrium,     depending     on

her choice of PH. We find her optimal price by solving for her maximum               profits in each type

of equilibrium,   and then comparing      the two.

   To choose a separating equilibrium,          H must mwimize

The constraint    must be included     because     if H chooses      a PH that is too low, then L will

choose to pool.

The first term in the profit equation      derives from the demand           by connoisseurs.     Since all

connoisseurs   who choose    to purchase    the good will do so from H, the lower bound               for ~’

buying high-quality    goods will be ~,     instead of ‘H~P~ , as it was in sections 2 and 3. The

second term comes from the demand            by dilettantes.       Finally, the constraint    ensures that

H chooses a price low enough that L will actually choose to pool.                We say that a pooling

[sepmating]    equilibrium   is “constrained”     if H’s profits cannot      be pushed      higher without

inducing L to separate [pool].

  If H’s separating profits (solution to (27)) are higher than her pooling           profits (solution to

(28)), than she will choose the higher price in a separating equilibrium.           If separating profits

are lower, then she will choose a pooling equilibrium,            and quality will beget quantity.

      Proposition     f: If quality levels are sufficiently        close and dilettantes    comprise    a suficient

proportion     of consumers,         then only pooling equilibria will exist.         Su&cient      conditions     here




    Proof:    See Appendix.


   Whenever         the duopolists     have qualities that are relatively close, we may be confident of

a pooling     equilibrium.       The intuition      is simple:    as qualities converge     — as a gets higher

    competition       becomes     more intense in the separating equilibrium             as both firms set prices

lower, and profits fall for both. In the limit, profits will be zero, in effect due to a sequential-

choice variant of Bertrand            compet ition.     Thus, H has an incentive           to try to reduce this

competition     by avoiding        the low-profit     separating     equilibrium.     She does this by holding

prices so low that L might as well engage in a pooling equilibrium.

   Graphical        depictions    are useful in reinforcing       the intuition     supporting   the proposition.

Figures 6 and 7 show separating profits, mfi (Tfi when constrained)                     and pooling     profits, m;

(TZ when constrained)            as a function of ~.



   In Figure 6, OL = .75, and thus a = .75 and @ = .25. This is the typical case for the

range of parameters         used in Proposition       1. In both Figures 6 and 7, separating            profits are

constrained     afler the point of tangency           between T;      and m;; before that point, separating

profits are equal to m&, and after that point they are equal to r~.                    Pooling   profits, however,

are constrained       before the tangency      point of nfi and n~; before that point, pooling               profits

are n~, and after that point they are equal to m~. In Figure 6, this latter tangency                             does

not occur until A is approximately           equal to 1, so pooling        profits are constrained      for almost

the entire range.

   In Figure 6, H’s pooling           profits, Tg, become        greater than separating profits at ~ C .2,

and stay greater than separating            profits for the rest of the range.         Therefore,    only pooling

equilibria will exist for all A > .2, Strikingly, with a sufficient proportion                   of dilettantes,    H

sets a price low enough to induce L to pool.               Yet L’s market share can be very low in the

pooling   equilibrium.      For example,     when dilettantes and connoisseurs             are equal in number,

A =     .5, L gets only one-qumter          of the market, r =           .25, as he will get one-half        of the

    Figure 7 shows the necessity of the lower bound on a in Proposition                                                                         1. Here, OL = .5

(and, thus, a = ~ = .5). In this case, m~ becomes greater than n~ after about A = .9, even

though pooling                profits are unconstrained                          and separating profits are constrained.                                         For these

pmameter            values, we see a separating equilibrium                                      at low levels of J, a pooling                              equilibrium

born about .2 to .9, and then a separating equilibrium once again at the top of the range.

   Surprisingly,                a separating              equilibrium             exists when almost all the consumers                                           are dilet-

tantes. In the figure, H’s profits in the pooling equilibrium                                                   fall faster with the proportion                                     of

dilettantes than they do in the constrained                                           separating equilibrium.                   (This can be seen in the

figure by comparing                     the slopes of n-j and m;.)                          When the proportion                   of dilettantes becomes

very high (A = .9 in Figure 7), it is no longer worthwhile                                                     for H to allow pooling,                           since she


                                                                                       19
gets only slightly more than half the total consumers.                Instead, she sets a price sufficiently

high that L does even better by separating.            This outcome       is not possible when the qualities

become too close, because H no longer does well enough in the separating equilibrium.

     We present the analogues to Results 1 and 2 from section 2. Both follow as corollaries of

Proposition       1.

     Result 1“: L can have a larger market share than H: r >1                 for some values of A, 8~, and

o~

     This can occur when H is at a constrained               separating   equilibrium.    For example,   in the

case of a = .5, A = 1, H will choose a separating equilibrium and will obtain only one-quarter

of the market; that is, r = 3. See the Appendix               for details of this calculation.

     Result 2“:        The ratio of the market shares can decrease when the ratio of the qualities

increases:     r (al) > r (az), az > al, for some values of A.

     This will occur when an increase in a causes H to change to a pooling                  from a separating

equilibrium.      At this point, r(a)     will not be dflerentiable.        One simple example       of such a

change would be an increwe            in a from .5 to .6 when A = 1. When                a = .5, H chooses to

separate and (as in Result l“)          r = 3; for a = .6, the conditions         of Proposition    1 are met

and we obtain a pooling equilibrium            with r = 1.

     Results    1“ and 2“ are quite dfierent        than Wsults       1 and 2 of section      2; allowing   for

imperfect      information     can radically   change equilibria     in models of vertical differentiation.

Even our stylized type of imperfect            information     can provide rich results and insights into

mechanisms        that allow markets to clear with sellers providing             vastly dfierent    quantities

than they would under perfect information.



5.     Two Empirical                   Examples:              Mutual          Funds and
       Automobiles

     Our theory predicts that when significant numbers of consumers have difficulty discerning

quality, goods of dfierent        qualities but similar production        costs may be offered at the same

price in a market. The higher quality goods will sell more, since knowledgeable                    consumers,



                                                       20

 our connoisseurs,        me able to discern differences.          This theory would be reinforced          if we could

     identify markets where goods of dflerent           quality sell at the same price and the high-quality

 goods sell higher quantiti~.

       We examined        two major U.S. industries – equity mutual funds and automobiles                           – and

 analyzed cross-sectional            relationships   among proxies for price, quantity,              and quality.    The

 results of this section provide empirical motivation                    and support for the model presented in

 sect ion 4.

 5.1        Mutual        Funds

       The oldest qu=tion       in the academic literature on equity mutual funds, still hotly debated,

 concerns      the ability of funds and fund managers                    to earn consistent       excess risk-adjusted

 returns. 16 If such excess returns relative to the market are possible,                          then fund “quality”

 would be a valuable construct;             if not, then the search for quality is fruitless. In any event,

 both consumers        and funds pay enormous                attention    to performance      measures and quality

 rankings, 17 and at least until the academic debate is settled, such ratings are likely to play a

 large role in funds’ and consumers’            behavior.      Therefore,    we take performance        measures as a

 proxy for quality, be it real or imagined.           Our goal is not to add anything to the debate about

 the usefulness of three proxies, but simply to estimate their effects on price and quantity.

       The universe of funds for our study consists of the 982 U.S. domestic                        diversified equity

 mutual funds for which data on all the following variabla                     is available: 1s

       Price – Mutual funds can charge a price in different ways.                      To assure consideration         of

 each possibility, we employ three dfierent              proxies for price.

       (A) The percentage       “load”,    or charge, paid to the fund. The load is calculated               and paid

either on the original investment ( “front load”) or on the asset value when the investor exits

 the fund ( “deferred load”).           These loads may sometimes             be reduced      for large or long-term

 investors; we use the figures published in the funds’ prospectuses.

16 See Hendricks, Patel, and Zeckhauser (1993), Brown and Goetzman                (1995),   and Malkiel (1995) for some
recent work on this question. Th=e excms returns may be m~ured          relative to the market as a whole or
relative to the universe of mutual funds. In either case, it is the persistence   and predictability of excess
ret urns that mat ters.
17    For evidence on the attention    paid to performance     measures, see Chevalier and Ellison (1995) and Brown,
 Harlow and Starks (1996).
18 All data was obtained from the Morningstar          Inc. Ascent and Principia      databas~.


                                                              21
      (B) The mmketing/administrative                ( “12b-1”)   fee paid annually by all fund investors. This

  fee is capped by law at a maximum of 1 percent.

      (C) The funds’ total expense ratio - total expenses divided by wsets under management.

  Tot al expenses include the 12b-1 fee, but not brokerage (transaction)                          costs. Total expenses

  sometimes include incentive bonuses to the fund’s management                            for meeting certain targets.

 We can think of these expenses m more than simply covering basic costs.

      Quantity - Quantity         is represented      by net inflows into the fund from January 31, 1996,

 to April 30, 1996. These inflows are calculated                  as



                                           N12 = AaPril,i– Ajo~,i(l + R,),                                                (29)

 where Nli = net inflows into fund z from January 31 to April 30, 1996, Aop~il,i = total assets

 under management           for fund i as of April 30,1996, Aja~,i = total assets under management

 for fund i as of January 31, 1996, and & = 3-month return from January 31 to April 30,

 1996.19

     QuccZZty- 3-year annualized            return, January 31, 1993, to January 31, 1996. This is the

 actual return that investors received;              it is net of expenses.           We discuss below the effect of

 adding back expenses and using gross returns as the quality variable.

     The dependent         variables we explore          are the load,      L; the 12b-1 fee, 12bl;          the expense

 ratio, ER;     and net inflows, N1.           The three-year        annualized return, R3, is an independent

 variable. Table 1 summarizes             the results.

     Regressions 1A, lB, and lC show the results of regressing price on quality (i.e., three-year

 return) for our three different price proxies. In the following discussions,                       “significant”      always

 means “statistically       different from zero at the five-percent             level”, unless otherwise noted. In

 regression #lA,        load is regressed on quality. The coefficient on quality is not significant .20

 Regression     lB, with the 12b-1 fee = the price vmiable,                   has the same result, When we use

 expense rat io as the price proxy in regression 1C, we find the coefficient                         on quality to be

19 Note that this net inflow calculation will undermtimate “true” inflows (= puchas= - redemptions) because
 any dividends paid out by the fund, and not immediately reinv~td,       will appear to be an outflow in our
 calculation.   We cannot    correct   for this, unfortunately,   because   data on dividends      (or true inflows)    is not
 readily available,   This omission,   and the bias it introduces,     is discussed   below.   In any case, the bias should
 be very small, bmause our sample period do= not include either the year-end or mid-year dividends.
20 The same r~ult occurs for front load by itself or deferred load by itself as the the price variable.

 negative and significant. 21 In none of these cases is there an indication                          that funds with

     superior three-year performances                 set higher prices than other funds. The results are sim-

 ilm for other performance               measures; for on-year,          fiveyear,     or ten-year annualized returns,

 there is no significant relationship                between price and quality for proxies (A) and (B), and

 there is a significant negative relationship                 for proxy (C).

     The results of regression 2 show a clear positive relationship                       between quantity and qual-

 ity. The coefficient       on quality is positive and signticant.                   The point estimate implies $9.23

 million in inflows for an additional                one percentage       point of three-yem          annualized        returns.

 This would seem to be economically                   significant as well. Similar results are found using one-,

 five-, and ten-year returns as the quality variable.                   Our calculation      of net inflows understates

 true inflows (purchases          less redemptions)          by the amount of nonreinvmted                 dividends;         since

 such dividends are likely to be positively                 correlated with returns, the effect of this underes-

 timate should be to bias downward                   the coefficient on returns; adjusting            for this bias would

 strengthen     our results.      As a further test, we reestimated                  regression    2 excluding         all funds

 that have the investment            objective       of “income”       or “growth      and income”         – the objectives

 most likely to have high dividends.                 The results were similar.

    Regression        3 investigates      the relationship       between price and quantity.              If some aspect of

 quality has not been captured               by our performance          measures, and this quality is positively

 correlated with both price and quantity, then we should be able to see evidence of this in re-

 gression 3, which regresses quantity on quality and all three of our price proxies.                            The results

 confirm the positive relationship              between quantity and quality, and indicate no significant

 relationship    between quantity and any of the price proxies. 22

    Overall, the market for diversified domestic equity mutual funds displays a positive rela-

 tionship between quantity               (as measured by net inflows), and quality (as measured by past

 returns. ) There is no signticant            positive relationship        between price (as measured by several

21 The quality variable is annualizedreturns, which is net of expenses.                If we add back expenses       so that the
quality   variable equals gross returns,      we find the same results, including       the significant   negative     coefficient
 when the expense      ratio is regressed on returns.       We do not have data on the breakdown            of these expenses
between    advisory    and nonadvisory      expensm,     but rm=rchers     working     with more complete     data sets have
 not found statistically   significant    positive   relationships   between   either type of fee and gross returns,          This
 is particularly surprising since advisory fms for some funds are directly linked to past returns.                   See Malkiel
 (1995).
22 This result also occurs if we include the three price proxi~ separately (results not reported                     here).


                                                                24
  proxies) and quality or price and quantity.              This would certainly suggest that the predomi-

  nant response of firms facing an increase in demand is not to raise their prices, but rather

  to sell more of their product.

     Similar results have been found             in other studies of financial           services,     Tufano     (1989)

 finds that investment banks that create innovative products                     do not subsequently       raise their

 prices, but rather capture a larger share of the underwriting                     market.      Gompers   and Lerner

  (1996) show that firm age and reputation               explain large dflerences       in size but only small and

 economically     insignificant      differences in price. Finally, Hulbert            (1996) finds that price and

 past performance        are uncorrelated      for investment advisory newsletters.

 5.2      Automobiles

    With the automobile            industry, as in the study of mutual funds, we seek only to identi&

 simple relationships       among prices, quantities,           and quality. 23 We study cars from the 1994

 model-year.     The      “model”     is the level of a~egation           used throughout.        For example,       our

 data source listed six dfierent          versions of the Ford Escort in 1994, a,s well as many option

 packages that could be attached to each version.                  We simply consider the “Ford Escort”, 24

 This aggregation        is necessmy     given our data constraints.          We use the following proxies:

    Price – Automobile            sales in the United States can be divided into wholesale and ret ail

 markets. First, manufacturers            sell to dealers, who are by law independent                of the manufac-

 turers. The price charged to dealers is the “dealer cost” of an automobile,                         and is publicly

 available.    Next, dealers sell to consumers.            Manufacturer’s       publish a “su~ested”           price for

 these retail transactions,        but the majority of purchases are the result of bargaining between

 dealer and consumer with a final price somewhere between the dealer cost and the manufac-

 turer’s suggested retail price.         One can think of the retail automobile              market as segmented

 by dealer cost, with cars competing             within, but not between,           cost segments,      Within     each

 segment, dealers compete by negotiating             “prices” that are actually markups over dealer cost.


23 Among the recent academic         works on the automobile      industry   are Berry, Levinsohn,   and Pakm (1995)
and Goldberg    (1995,   1996).   Bresnahan   and Rei=    (1985) study dealer markups      in the automobile     market;
 this is probably the most comparable      study to ours.
24 The six versions of the Ford ficort     are the 2-door hatchbwk,      LX 2-door hatchback,    LX 4-door hatchback,
GT 2-door hatchback, LX 4-door sedan, and LX 4door              wagon.   We describe   below our method    of choming
a single version to reprment the model.

     Since dealer cost is common                     knowledge,       it is best to use the markup as the relevant price

 variable. Then, dealer cost can be used as a proxy for the market segment. 25

       An optimal data set would include transaction prices for every vehicle, but such a data set

 was not available to us. Instead, we use published estimates of “target prices” calculated                                           by

     The Complete           Car Cost Guide (1994).                  These target prices are designed to give consumers

 an estimate of the price that they would actually have to pay for the cm. It is based on a

 proprietary            formula that takes into account typical dealer practices and supply and demand

 conditions            in the market. 26

       The two price proxies that we use are mmkup variables derived from the published target

 prices and dealer costs.

       (A) The target markup, M,, given by



                                                              Mi = TPi – DCa,                                                       (30)

 where Mi = the markup on model z, TPi is the target prim for model i, as given by The

 Complete          Car Cost Guide, DCi is the dealer cost for model i (from the same source);                                      and

       (B) The target markup ratio, MRi, given by


                                                                                Mi
                                                                M&           = ~.                                                   (31)

       The costs and target prices we use are those for the least expensive car of its model type.

 This is not a terribly restrictive method;                          although markups do differ across versions of the

 same model, the markup rat io is relatively constant. 27

 Yearbook 1994-95                  (1994)).

       Quality - Ratings from Auto Test (1994).                              Total ratings (out of a m=imum                of 190) are

 the sum of individual                 ratings in nineteen categories,                   each of which is ~aded         from one to

 about one to two percent             of the dealer cost.      Unfortunately,        the rebates may vary throughout       the year, and
 we do not have reliable data on them for our sample.                        We discuss below the po~ible    bias from this omission.
26 Private communication     with the publisher.
27    For   the   s~    versions    of the    Ford   &cofi,   the   dealer    cost   ranges from $8,465 to $11,436,    the target Price
 from $9,000 to $12,172,             the markup       from $535 to $736, and the markup             ratio from .063 to .064.     In each
 case, the lower bound             is given by the 2-door hatchback           (the version that we use to represent the model)      and
the upper bound            is given by the GT 2-door hatchback.


                                                                         26
     ten 26 These ratings and their index are subjective                   and cert airily imperfect,       but they were

     the best data we could find for our purposes.

        As we did for mutual funds, we attempt to uncover the cross-sectional                       relationships among

  the variables.      In addition     to the variables discussed above, we also include dealer cost as a

 right-hand side variable in each of our regressions.                    The aim is to capture any quality effects

     afler controlling    for the mrrect cost segment of the market.                   (This was not an issue in our

 analysis of mutual funds. ) Otherwise,                the tests we do are direct analogues to those of the

 previous section.

       Table 2 summarizes the findings of regressions 4A, 4B, 5, and 6. 4A and 4B regress the

 two price proxies (the markup in 4A and the markup ratio in 4B) on the quality ratings and

 dealer cost. In neither case is the coefficient on quality significant.                      In 4A, the coefficient on

 cost is positive and significant.           4B reinforces the evidence of a linear relationship                   between

 dealer cost and markup; it shows that the markup ratio (markup divided by dealer cost) is

 not a function        of dealer cost. If there is any relationship               between quality and the markup

 or markup ratio, then it is not captured               by our quality proxy, 29

       Quantity is regressed on quality and dealer cost in regression 5. The coefficient on quality

 is positive and significant.          The point estimate is economically                significant:     a one-point     in-

 crease in the quality rating is associated with an increase of 3,410 in cars sold – this implies

 that more than 30,000 extra cars are sold for a one-standard                      deviation increase in the quality

 variable.     By comparison,       the median level of sales for our sample was 74,857. As we found

 for mutual funds, quantity and quality seem positively correlated.30




28 The categories are acceleration,   transmission, braking,            steering, ride, handling, driveability, fuel econ-
 omy, comfort/convenience,  interior room, driving position,            instrumentation,   controls, visibility, entry/exit,
quietness,    cargo space/ leftover, exterior   workmanship     and interior workmanship,        Auto Test (1994) also in-
 cludes a category of “value”, but we exclude it from our total due to its reliance on price. Thus, the original
 ranking are out of a maximum of 200, and ours are out of a maximum of 190.
29 one weakn~s of using ~timated         target pricm rather than real transaction data is that we are unable
 to maure     the effect of stronger (or weaker) than expected sales on actual pric~.     On average, however,
we would hope that salm forcasts          and target   prices   are corrmt,     so that our r~ults      reflect the planned
price-quantity strateg of dealers,
30     Of course, since these quality ratings are subj~tive,        we cannot be sure that they have not been influenced
by the level of sales. In that case, as long as sal~       were autocorrelated,       then simultaneous     equations’   bias
would affect our r~ults.

   Notes: Table 2 reports the results of OLS regressions involving price, quantity and quality
proxies. The sample includes 1994 model-year data for the 60 different models for which
complete data was available. Hence, there are 60 observations in each regression.        Cars
classified as “sports” (as identified by Auto Test (1994)) and “luxury” (cars with DC >
$25, 000) are excluded.    Column (1) gives the regression # as it is referred to in the text
of the paper. Column (2) gives the dependent variable for each regression. Columns (3)-
(6) report the coefficients on each included independent variable; standard errors for these
estimates are given in parentheses.     RA is the rating, out of 190, for each car (Source:
Auto Test; p = 148,0 = 9); DC is the cost paid by dealers to manufacturers for each
car, in dollars (Source: The Complete Car Cost Guide (1994), p = 14859, is = 4657); M
is the “target” markup over cost, in dollus, according to The Contplet e Car Cost Guide
(p = 946, a = 378); MR is the markup ratio, % ( p = .063, a = .011); SALES are the
tot al sales in the U.S. for each model, in thousands (Source: Ward’s Automotive  Yearbook
1994-95 (1994); p = 100, a = 91). Please refer to the text of the paper for discussions of
these variables. Column (7) reports the constant and Column (8) reports the R2 for each
regression.




                                                28
      We add both price proxies to the right-hand                  side of regression 6; regressing quantity on

  quality, dealer cost, mmkup,            and the markup ratio (the analogue of regression                       3 in table

  1). The coefficients on the markup ratio and on quality are negative and significant and the

 coefficient on the markup is positive and significant.                 If either of the two markup variables is

 dropped from the regression (results not reported here), then the coefficient on the remaining

 vmiable is positive and significant.           This pattern would be expected             if there were some aspect

 of quality not captured by our rating, but correlated positively with both price and quantity.

  “Brand-power”,       for example,      would not necessarily show up in even a perfect measure of

 quality, but muld easily lead to both higher prices and higher quantities .31

      Overall, we find no relationship          between price and our measure of quality (regressions 4A

 and 4B). There is some evidence               suggesting      that our price proxies are correlated              with the

 quantity sold, and perhaps also with an expanded                      concept     of “quality”     (regression     6). We

 find stronger evidence       of a positive relationship            between quantity       and quality (regressions

 5 and 6). Whether        or not one controls for markup, quantity                   is signticantly      and positively

 related to our quality variable, RA.

      The evidence for the mutual fund and automobile                    industries suggests that firms in these

 industries reap the rents from being high-quality                     producers     primarily     by enjoying      higher

 sales rather than by ch~ging           higher prices (mutual funds) or dealer markups (automobiles).

 These industries illustrate well our “quantity versus price” finding for our theoretical                            model

 of the imperfect information          case.



 6.     Conclusion

      The models in this paper address the question:                “What role does quantity play, as opposed

 to price, in clearing a maket         whose sellers differ in quality?”         The model of section 2 provided

 a benchmmk      case yielding some straightforward                results: the market share of the low-quality



31 Another possibility is that the omission of dealer rebates, discussed in footnote 25, could cause this rmult.
 We would expmt dealer rebat= to be higher for slow-selling cars; in this case, markups for slow-selling cars
 would be biased downward     in our sample (compared         to the true markups,    which should include the rebate),
 and bias us towards    finding   a positive   relationship   betw=n    price and quantity.      This   would   also bias us
towards finding a positive univariate correlation between price and quality,            so evidence     for the absence   of
such a relationship in regr~ions   4A and 4B is strengthened.


                                                              29
seller increased with its own quality, but was always lower than the market share of the high-

quality seller. Section 3 added convex costs of production           into the model and found that the

high-quality   seller sometimes chooses to accept a smaller market share than its counterpart

in order to set a far higher price. We also found that the ratio of the market shares was a

smooth function     of costs.    Section 4 introduced    imperfect    information   into the model and

showed how strategic      considerations    could cause sellers to set identical     prices, effectively

softening   price competition.     Particularly   when qualities are close, prices will be identical

yet relative market shares will be very far apart. Section 5 presented empirical evidence from

two industries, mutual funds and automobiles,           that appear to illustrate the phenomenon      of

“quantity clearing the market”.       In both cases, proxies for quality are highly correlated with

the quantity sold, and show little relation with proxies for the price or markup.

8.1       Solution with Many Firms:                     Extension        to Section 2

      For the case of perfect information     and no costs of production,           consider an industry with

M firms, indexed by their respective         qualities 0~. We arbitrarily order these qualities from

highest to lowest as @l, 02, .... 13~, and we assume that this ordering is strict. Firms set prices

sequent ially in order of quality, so that the highest-quality           firm sets its price first and the

lowest-quality     firm sets its price last. Consumers’      preferences         are distributed   as in section

2.

     We solve the model      backwmds,      beginning    with the consumer’s          problem.     The optimal

decision rule for the consumer will be

      (A) Buy from firm m if

       (l)~~v-     Pm ~ Omv- P. for alln=        1,... rrk- 1;

       (2)@~v–P~      > O.V–   P. for alln=m+l,...A4;            and

       (3)1. + emu – Pm >1..

     (B) Do not buy if JV+Onv–       P~ < IV for allm=           I,... )M,

     Conditions    (A. 1) and (A. 2) ensure that a consumer who is indifferent between two prod-

ucts always buys the one of higher quality. This optimal decision rule will lead to a segmented

mmket.     To see why, consider two consumers           indexed by their valuations          of v and w, with

w > v. One can easily verify that if u buys from firm m, then w would never buy from any

firm n < m. This greatly simplifies our problem,            as each firm (except          for firms 1 and M)

will have a demand interval of


                                            Pm-l – Pm       Pm – Pm+~
                                Qm=(                                         )                             (32)
                                            om_~ – em –     6’* – em+l

     It follows that each firm will have positive market share in equilibrium.                As long as firm

m does not set a price of O, firm m + 1 could also guarantee itself a positive market share

and thus posit ive profits.    Therefore,    no firm would ever set a price of O, and the positive



                                                    33
 market share equilibrium     is established.   We are now ready to solve the game.

    The profit function for firm M is



                                   n~=(
                                           p~.1   – PM
                                            6M.~ – 6~
                                                         -    ~)pM.                                     (33)


Maimizing      these profits with respect to PM, we can obtain an optimal solution of


                                                   e~pM-~
                                           PM =                                                         (34)
                                                    20M_ ~ “

   This optimal    solution   can then be substituted        into the profit function    of firm M – 1,

which is then solved and substituted      into the profit function of firms M — 2,.... The general

form of the profit function                          M – 1 is
                               for firm ?n, m = 2,.,.,


                                     Pm. ~ – Pm
                              7rm=(@_l_@m       - :’”:         ;~+’     )Pm.                            (35)
                                       m             m           m+ 1

   The profit of firm 1 is written the same as in the duopoly            case:



                                                                                                        (36)


where P2 would be a function of @l, 62, ...dM.

   Computing     the equilibrium   is tedious but not difficult.      The results yield similar intuition

to the duopoly case. We solved a 5-firm game as an example.              Figure 8 shows the equilibrium

quantities of this game as a function      of OS, the parameter         allowed to vary, drawn for the

special case of 191= 1, 02 = .8, 04 = .4, and 135= .2. The range for 03 is between                .4 and .8,

the levels of 64 and 02, respectively.    When 03 = .4, then firm 3 will be engaged in ruinous

competition    with firm 4, driving both their prices and profits down to zero.             In this case,

firm 5 would also be driven out of business in the limit.              As OS rises, firm 3 increases its

market share at the expense of its two closest neighbors,             Finally, as 03 approaches     ,8, firm

3 begins to engage in more ruinous competition         with firm 2; in the limit, both firms’ prices

and profits fall to zero, and they split all the market not taken by firm 1. At this limit, firms

4 and 5 are driven from the market.

   Result 2’ of section 3 is that &       > 0 and ~      < 0. We can confirm      these results by

directly evaluating the derivatives:

8.3     Solution with Imperfect             Information:       Proof of Proposition            1
from Section 4

   To prove this proposition,   as well as to draw the figures of section 4, we first need to solve


                                                36
for five expressions:

(1) Tfi - Separating profits for H if we ignore the constraint            in (27).

(2) n:   - Separating profits for H when the constraint           in (27) binds exactly.

(3) As - The minimum level of A for which the constraint              in (27) holds.

(4) mfi - Pooling profits for H if we ignore the constraint           in (28).

(5) &    - Pooling profits for H when the constraint          in (28) binds exactly.

   After solving for these five expressions, we are able to compare H’s pooling and separating

   Separating     Equilibrium

   The problem is to maximize

   Comparing          Separating        and Pooling                     Profits

   We need to show that pooling                  profits are always larger than separating                            profits whenever

we have both Q ~ .55 and A > ~.                        Since A = ~                  is exactly the point at which separating

profits become       constrained,      and since n~ ~ Ti,                     it will suffice to show that n~ > T;              for the

seta~.55rl       A>*.            From (46) and (52), we have TZ > n}                                     if and only if

   A@(a+l)(2a2+2a+     4A–9Aa+3Aa2     –4A2+8A2a–4A2a2                       2A~(a+l)      a2+a+2A–5Aa+Aa2
                                                                   )>
                      (a2+a+4A-4A@)2                                                    (a2+a+4a-4Aa)2            “


This condition       reduces to



                                                                        38

                                               4–8a+4a2”

This will hold for ~ ~ 1 (and, thus, for all possible A) when


                                    a+az        >1-      a >.54327.                            (54)
                                4–8a+4a2

   Thus, whenever     a > .54327, we will haver~         > ~~ Y ~, and, a fortiori   V ~ > ~.

(Thus, ourcondition    intheproof    that a>.55is
                                            —           slightly stronger than wenwd.)    ■

   Section 4 contains several figures that can help give some intuition for this result.

   We can also use this result to verify Result 2“. At a = .5, A = 1, we have the constraint

bind for sepaating    profits, and th~e   constrained   separating profits ae larger than pooling

profits: n~ = Tk > x%. Thus, we have a separating equilibrium           at this point, with prices

(calculated   born (23) and (26)) of P~ = .54545 and P~ = .13636.       Solving for the quantities

sold by each firm yields T = 3.
