          This paper documents the fimdamental role played by factor accumulation in explaining
the extraoixlinary postwar growth of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.
Participation rates, educational levels and (with the exception of Hong Kong) investment rates
have risen rapidly in all four economies. In addition, there have been large intersectoral
reallocations of labour, with (again, excepting Hong Kong) non-agricultural and manufacturing
employment growing one and a half to two times as fast as the aggregate working population.
Thus, while the growth of output per capita in these economies has averaged 6% to 7% per
annum over the past two and a half decades, the growth of output per effective worker in the
non-agricultural sector of these economies has been only 3% to 4% per annum. If one then
allows for the doubling, tripling and even quadrupling of the investment to GDP ratio in these
economies, one arrives at total factor productivity growth rates, both for the non-agricultural
economy and for manufacturing in particular, which are well within the bounds of those
experienced by the OECD and Latin American economies over equally long periods of time.
While the growth of output and manufacturing exports in the newly industrializing economies
of East Asia is virtually unprecedented, the growth of total factor productivity in these economies
is not.

I. Introduction
      This is a fairly boring and tedious paper, and is intentionally so. This paper provides no
new interpretations of the East Asian experience to interest the historian, derives no new
theoretical implications of the forces behind the East Asian growth process to motivate the
theorist, and draws no new policy implications from the subtleties of East Asian government
intervention to excite the policy activist. Instead, this paper concentrates its energies on
providing a careful analysis of the historical patterns of output growth, factor accumulation and

productivity growth in the Newly Industrializing Countries of East Asia, i.e. Hong Kong,
Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.
      Tables 1-1 and 1-2 and figure 1 below present some basic information on growth in the
NICs, drawn from national accounts and census sources.' As seen in table 1-1, the

extraordinarily rapid and sustained growth of output per capita in all four economies, averaging
some 6% to 7% per annum for two and a half decades, is trnly remarkable. It is this record of
growth, along with its apparent association with the rapid growth of manufactured exports, that
has led most economists to believe that productivity growth in these economies must be

extraordinarily high, particularly in their manufacturing sectors. This view, however, ignores an
equally remarkable record of factor accumulation.
      As table 1-1 shows, one important area of factor accumulation has been labour input. The
rapid post-war decline in birth rates (changing dependency ratios) and rising rates of female
labour force participation have led to a substantial rise in the aggregate participation rate in each




      'The appendix provides a full description of sources. All growth rates reported in this
paper are logarithmic, rather than geometric, growth rates. The labour force estimates for Korea
and Taiwan exclude their large (predominantly conscript) armies, whose measured output (in the
form of wages) is comparatively small. Section VI below examines the sensitivity of the results
reported in this paper to the inclusion/exclusion of military personnel.

 of the NICs.2 In moving to measures of output per worker, rising participation rates remove an
 average of 1% per annum from the per capita growth rate of Hong Kong. 1.2% and 1.3% per
 annum from Korea and Taiwan, respectively, and a stunning 2.6% per annum (for 24 years!)
 from the growth rate of Singapore. Interscctoral transfers of labour have also beenextremely
 important Thus, removing agriculture from the analysis lowers the growth rate of outputper
 worker in Taiwan and South Korea by .6% and .7% per annum, respectively, reflecting the rapid

 decline in the share of agricultural employment in total employment in both economies.3

 Although the growth of manufacturing output has been unusually rapid in these economies, so
 has the growth of manufacturing employment Once one accounts for the transfer of labour into
 manufacturing one finds, surprisingly, that, as regards labour productivity growth, manufacturing
in both Singapore and Taiwan actually underperformed the aggregate economy.

       Capital input has also grown rapidly in the NICs. As shown in figure 1. although the
investment to GD? ratio has remained roughly constant in Hong Kong, in the other NICs it has

risen substantially over time. In Singapore, the constant price investment to GD? ratio, at 11%
in 1960 had reached 38% by 1980 and an extraordinary 47% by 1984, after which it declined

substantially, only to begin another rise in the late 1980s. In South Korea, investmentrates,
which were around 5% (in constant prices) in the early 1950s, exploded upto 20% in the

mid-60s, reached 30% in the early 1980s, and were approaching 40% by 1991. Finally, in

Taiwan, the constant price investment to GD? ratio, at around 10% in the early 1950s, grew
steadily to a high of 27% in 1975, after which it fluctuated around a value of 20%.



        2Changes in age specific male participation rates are minimal in all four economies, while,
with the exception of Hong Kong (where they fell), reported hours of work have remained
roughly constant. This suggests that the increase in participation is genuine, and not some
statistical artifact.

       31'his intersectoral transfer was strongest in Taiwan during the 1970s, when the difference
in the growth of output per worker was 2.2% (5.7% vs. 3.5%), and in Korea during the 1980s,
when the difference in growth rates was 1.6% (6.7% vs. 5.1%).

      Human capital accumulation in the East Asian NICs has also been quite rapid. As shown

in table 1.2 above, over the past two and a half decades the proportion of the working population
with a secondary education or more doubled in Hong Kong and Taiwan, tripled in Korea and
quadrupled in Singapore. By 1990/1991, some 18% to 20% of the working population in each

economy had some tertiary education.4 In weighting labour input by sex, age and educational
characteristics (discussed further below), I have found that the improving educational attainment

of the workforce contributes to about 1% per annum additional growth in labour input in each of

these economies.

      All of the influences noted above, rising participation rates, intersectoral transfers of
labour, improving levels of education, and expanding investment rates, serve to chip away at the
productivity performance of the East Asian NICs, drawing them from the top of Mount Olympus
down to the plains of Thessaly. In a companion paper (Young 1993), I use simple back of the
envelope calculations and large international data sets to show that, as regards productivity
growth in the aggregate economy and in manufacturing in particular, the NICs cannot be
considered to be strong outliers in the post-war world economy. This paper concentrates on a
more careful analysis of these four economies, making use of the extensive statistical record
embodied in their national accounts, population censuses, and sectoral, wage and labour force

surveys.
      The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II presents a short review of

methodology. Sections ilI-VI then provide a country by country analysis of aggregate and
sectoral total factor productivity growth. Section VII contrasts this research with earlier work on

provides a description of sources and some of the problems encountered in linking different data
series.

IL Methodology
      The Translog Index of Total Factor Productivity Growth
      Consider the translogarithniic value added production function:

       (2.1) Q =exp[cz0+ aKlnK +alnL + a,t +fB,(lnK)2

                         + B(lnK)(lnL) + B inK.: +B(lnL)2 + B, lnL . t +Bt2J

where K, L and t denote capital input, labour input and time, and where, under the assumption of
constant returns to scale, the parameters cc and Bg satisfy the restrictions:

      (2.2) a + cz =1 B + B = B + BA = B4 + B,, = 0
First differencing the logarithm of the production function provides a measure of the causes of
growth across discrete time periods:


      (2.3) i( Q(T_1)) =           b{Ti )        +
                                                                   J
                                                                       + TFP,..1,.


                    where O = e1(T)+e(T—1)
                                          2

and where the 01's denote the share of each factor in total factor payments. The translog index

of TFP growth (TFP.1) provides a measure of the amount the log of output would have
increased had all inputs remained constant between twO discrete time periods. In essence, the
translog production function provides a theoretical justification for the use of average factor
shares and log differences as a means of extending the continuous time Divisia analysis of




                                                  6
 productivity growth to data based upon discrete time periods.

       To allow consideration of more fmely differentiated inputs, one can assume that aggregate
 capital and labour input are, in turn, constant returns to scale translog indices of sub-inputs:5

       (2.4) K=exp[alnKi+c4lnx2+...+cxKl
                        + B(lnK1)2 + B(lnK1) (inK2) +... + B(lnK,j2]

               L = exp[c4 lnL-f c4 lnL2 + ...   + lnL

                        +   B1(lnL1)2 + Bt2(lnL1) (lnL2) + ... + B..,(lnL.,)2]


First differencing the logarithms of these translog indices provides a measure of the growth of

aggregate capital and labour input as weighted averages of the growth rates of their sub-inputs:

       (2.5)   1
                    K(T)                ( K,(T) )        ( L(T)                  ( L1(T)
                IK(T-1))_ k 'K(T-l))                      iL(T-1)) 'iL(T-1)
                    where 0 = 0(T)+O(T—1)
                            —

                                         2

and where the 0's denote the share of each sub-input in total payments to its aggregate factor. In

a manner analogous to the continuous time Divisia analysis, these indices adjust for

improvements in the "quality" of aggregate capital and labour input by, to a first order
approximation, weighting the growth of each sub-input by its average marginal product.
      The appropriate measure of capital and labour input is the flow of services emanating from
those inputs. For labour, one can reasonably assume that the flow of services is proportional to
total hours of work, i.e. L1(T) =
                                    H1(T), with:

       Measuring Factor Supplies
       My analysis focuses on two aggregate inputs, capital and labour, subdivided into finer

sub-input categories. In general, I divide capital input into five categories: residential buildings,
non-residential buildings, other durable structures, transport equipment and machinery. With the
exception of my analysis of Singaporean manufacturing, I do not include land input, which is
difficult to measure. To minimize any error, I focus my analysis of Taiwan and Korea on the
non-agricultural economy, where land input accounts for only a small percentage of total
payments to factors of production.' Labour is distinguished on the basis of sex (two categories),

age (nine to eleven categories, depending upon the country and time period under consideration),
and education (two to seven categories).
       The stock of each capital input is measured using the perpetual inventory method with




      6For example, Kim & Park (1985, table 5-13) estimate that during the 1960s and 1970s
land input accounted for only about 4% of Korean non-agricultural non-residential income.
      'I also do not include inventories. I have found that the "changes in stocks" series
published by most of the NICS are either (i) outright gross fabrications used to conceal large
discrepancies between the production and expenditure accounts; and/or (ii) based upon the
flimsiest of data. In Young (1992)1 made use of unpublished stocks data provided to me by the
Singaporean and Hong Kong governments. Problems with the existence of accurate stocks data
for the other economies, combined with a growin suspicion as to the accuracy of the Hong
Kong numbers, have led to me to drop consideration of stocks from the analysis.

 geometric depreciation, where I initialize the capital stock by assuming that the growth rate of
 investment in the first five years of the investment series is representative of the growth of

 investment prior to the beginning of the series.9"0 Given positive rates of depreciation and a
 sufficiently long investment series prior to the first date of the analysis, the perpetual inventory

 approach is fairly insensitive to the level of capital used to initialize the series. For Hong Kong,
 the published investment series begins in 1961. I use my own estimates of capital formation,

 which mimic the methodology of the Hong Kong government, to extend the series on all asset
types back to 1947. For Singapore the published investment series begins in 1960. I use data on

the construction of one-family equivalent residential units and retained imports of cement" to
extend the residential and non-residential durable structures investment series back to 1947,12For




       'The depreciation rates are based upon the Hulten-Wykoff estimates of geometric
depreciation rates for detailed asset types. I derive the depreciation rate for each of the five
broad asset types used in my analysis as the unweighted average of the depreciation rates of the
detailed asset types likely to be found in each industry. This approach is crude, but the results
are, in any case, not sensitive to moderate adjustments in the depreciation rates (see, for example,
Young 1992).

where I is the first year of investment data for assctj, 8,, is the depreciation rate for assetj, and

            exception is Singaporean manufacturing, where, because of a lack of lengthy (and
consistent) historical series, I use the Net Fixed Assets reported in the Census of Industrial of
Production to initialize the capital stock in 1969.

      "Singapore did not produce cement prior to 1961. See the Malavan Digest of Statistics.
       '2The estimates using retained imports of cement are, admittedly, rather crude. These data,
however, suggest a large surge in construction activity in the mid-1950s (which I have not been
able to corroborate), with the real value of investment in durable structures in the mid-1950s
exceeding the levels recorded in the early-1960s. Although! feel these data are suspect,! make
use of them in order to bias the results in favour of Singapore.

Taiwan the published investment series begins in 1951 and for South Korea in j953•13

general, I focus my analysis on the post-1966 period, allowing each economy 13 or more years
of investment data to establish the capital stock.'4
      Turning now to the measurement of labour inputs, my task is to estimate the working

population, cross-classified by up to seven attributes, i.e., industry, sex, age, education, income,
hours of work, and class of worker. Census and survey data frequently contain information on
row and column sums in lower dimensions. Under the assumption that there are no interactions
across attributes other than those present in the available sub-dimensional tables, I derive an
approximation of the maximum likelihood estimate of each cell using the iterative proportional

fitting technique suggested by Bishop, Fienberg and Holland (1975). In general, I make use of
the information provided by additional worker characteristics, e.g. occupation, which, in their
cross-tabulation with attributes of interest to me provide additional information. Thus, for

example, I actually estimate the 1990 Singaporean working population cross-classified by
industry x occupation x class of worker x sex x age x education x income, using all available
census tabulations. For my TFP estimates, I then sum across occupational categories to derive
a reduced six-dimensional table of the variables of interest to me.

      All four economies conduct occasional censuses and, on a more regular annual basis,




      131 have found extensive Japanese data on pre-war investment in Korea and Taiwan. I
have yet to find, however, an appropriate deflator with which to link the pre and post-war series,
as well as a means of adjusting for wartime damage in Korea.
       '4To analyze the sensitivity of the results to the value of capital used to initialize the series,
I also tried initial values of (I) zero capital and (ii) double the capital implied by the procedure
described above. The impact of these (substantial) adjustments on average total factor
productivity growth during the 1966-1990 period was (-.1%,+.1%) per annum in Hong Kong and
Taiwan, (-.1%,+.2%) per annum in Singapore, and (-.4%,+.3%) per annum in Korea (where the

      '
pre-1966 investment series is shorter).

 surveys of labour force conditions. The labour force surveys are, however, subject to an
enormous margin of error. Thus, for example, the 1989 Singaporean Labour Force Survey
estimated the working population at 1,277,254, with 51.2% having completed a secondary

education or more. The 1990 Census, however, found that the actual working population
numbered 1,537,011 (i.e 20% more than reported in the previous survey), with 66.3% having
completed a secondary education or more. Similarly, the 1980 Korean Economically Active

Population Survey estimated the non-agricultural working population at 9,048,000, whereas the
1980 Census put the number at 7,887,308, or 13% less. Aside from their small sample sizes,16

the principal problem underlying the inaccuracy of the labour force surveys is the fact that their
scaling factors are drawn from the previous census. Since these economies are experiencing
rapid transformation, these scaling factors tend to be grossly inaccurate. As the surveys are
updated with the new census scaling factors, their estimates become consistent with the most
recent census results. Thus, for example, the 1991 Singaporean Labour Force Survey estimated
the working population at 1,524,315. In the estimates below, I confine myself to census years,
treating the census results as the appropriate measure of the "population" and the survey results
as a "sample", making use of these, when they contain cross-tabulations which are unavailable in
the census, by conforming the survey row and column totals to those given by the census. Since,
over the long run, the labour force surveys track (with large variance) the census, the long-term
average rates of productivity growth reported below are not dependent on this choice of




      16
            example, 25000 housing units in the case of the 1989 Singaporean labour force
survey and less than 15000 households in the case of the 1980 Korean economically active
population survey.

sources.'7

      Finally, I should note that to improve the accuracy of my labour foite estimates I have
acquired thousands of pages of unpublished census tabulations from the governments of Hong
Kong and Singapore, while, in the case of Taiwan, I have made use of the Chinese language area
and district census tabulations, which contain additional tabulations over and beyond those

reported in the summary English language volumes. These additional tabulations provide

valuable information. Thus, for example, unpublished Hong Kong tabulations relate income by
class of worker (e.g. self-employed, employee, etc.) cross tabulated by attributes such as age, sex
and education. In contrast, the published tabulations rarely cross tabulate income with class of
worker. Consequently, relying on the published tabulations alone pollutes one's estimates of the
returns to different types of labour input with non-labour capital income.
      Measuring Factor Shares
      In order to estimate the share of labour and capital in total payments to factors of
production, it is necessary to measure value added from the point of view of the producer. This
requires removing all indirect business taxes on the value of output (including all sales and
excise taxes), while retaining all subsidies and taxes on factors of production (such as license
fees and profits taxes), a concept of value added midway between GDP at factor cost and GD? at
market prices. In the case of Hong Kong and Singapore, where indirect and sales taxes are
minimal, I simply take as my measure of output the national accounts estimates of GD? at
current factor cost. In Korea and Taiwan, however, "indirect taxes", as reported in the national
accounts, are enormous and defined in an extraordinarily broad manner, including items such as




           fact, during the period emphasized in this paper (1966-1990) the labour force surveys
actually imply faster growth in the non-agricultural working population in both South Korea and
Taiwan (the labour force surveys for Hong Kong and Singapore began in the mid to late 1970s
and hence do not cover the entire period of analysis).



                                                 12
taxes on the monopoly profits of producers of ginseng and cigarettes and land and building
property taxes. In these cases I use government financial statistics and unpublished data
provided to me by statistical authorities to separate out the "admissable" indirect taxes, i.e. those
which are part of the value of output from the point of view of the producer, and allocate them to
the different economic sectors. Of these adjustments, the principal one is the allocation of
monopoly profits taxes to value added in the manufacturing sector, so that the reader who makes
this adjustment (to GDP at factor cost) will arrive at estimates of value added from the point of
view of the producer close to those used in the analysis below.
      To estimate the share of labour in total factor payments, I begin by constructing estimates

of the hourly incomes of employees cross-tabulated by industry, sex, age and education. I then
use these compensation data, and my estimates of hours of work cross-tabulated by industiy, sex,
age, education and class of worker, to estimate the incomes of employees and the implicit labour
income of employers, unpaid family workers and the self-employed. To determine the share of
labour in each sector, I then multiply the sectoral compensation of employees data reported in the
national accounts by one plus my sectoral estimates of the ratio of implicit to explicit labour

income.18 Combining my measures of implicit and explicit income provides an estimate of
sectoral labour income cross-classified by the sex, age and educational characteristics of workers
and, hence, an estimate of the share of each labour sub-input in total payments to labour by
sector.

      Turning to capital input, under the assumption of perfect competition and constant returns




      '1This rescaling using the national accounts data corrects for underreporting of income on
the part of workers and, also, adjusts for labour taxes and non-monctazy compensation, all of
which form a part of cost of labour input from the point of view of the producer.



                                                 13
to scale, I take the aggregate share of capital by sector to be simply one minus the estimated
share of labour. To allocate capital income by asset type, I note that with geometric

depreciation, and perfect foresight, the rental price of a capital good k1 is given by:'9

      (2.8) Pk(T) = P,(T — 1 )r(T) + 8P,(T) — [P1(T) — P,(T — I)]

where P, denotes the investment price of capital good i and r(T) is the nominal rate of return

between periods T- 1 and T. Under the assumption that all assets earn the same nominal rate of

return, I vary r(T) until total payments to capital equal my estimate of the aggregate share of
capital. This yields estimates of the rental price of each asset category and, by extension, its
share of payments to capital.




       t9This equation can be modified to take into account taxes and depreciation allowances.

Ifl. Hong Kong
      Table 3-1 below presents estimates of total factor productivity growth in Hong Kong.
With the exception of the 1981-1986 period, when business activity was depressed by the
Anglo-Chinese negotiations over the future of the colony, Hong Kong sustained total factor
productivity growth rates of 2% or more in each of the five year periods, averaging 2.3% over
the 1966-1991 period as a whole. As one would expect, given the constancy of the post-1966
investment to GD? ratio, there is little evidence of capital-deepening, with weighted capital input

growing only .7% faster per annum than output during the 1966-1991 period. Surprisingly, the
weighting of capital and labour input has little effect on the estimates of the growth of these
factors of production, with the growth rate of the "raw" inputs (the simple sum of the

sub-components) closely approximating that of the weighted inputs (weighting each
sub-component by its average factor share). In the case of labour input, this is simply due to the
fortuitous cancelling of various effects, with adjustments for sex, hours of work and age (prior to

1976) lowering the growth rate of labour input, and adjustments for education and age (after
1976) raising the growth rate of labour input. The net effect is, however, important in individual
sub-periods and, in particular, is substantially positive during the late 1980s, when the

stabilization of female participation rates, ageing of the labour force, and rising educational
attainment, all served to increase measured labour input. This pattern is repeated in the other
economies and, for reasons of space, will, in general, not be commented upon further.20

 IV. Singapore
       Table 4-1 below presents estimates of total factor productivity growth in Singapore.
 Although the late I 960s appear to have been a period of rapid productivity growth, these gains
 were lost (and then some) during the 1970s and 1980s. With weighted capital input growing an

 average of 3.0% per annum faster than output and output per unit of effective labour input
 growing only 2.8% per annum, the total factor productivity residual for the aggregate economy
 averages an extraordinaiy -0.3% per annum over a twenty-four year period, a virtually

 unprecedented record of productivity regress.2' Interestingly, although the growth of capital
 input has slowed down over time (as the investment rate has stabilized around 40% of GDP), the
growth of human capital has accelerated. While weighted labour input grew 2.1% slower than
raw labour in the late 1960s, it rose 3.0% faster in the 1980s (due to large increases in the age

and educational attainment of the workforce). The changing role of physical and human capital
accumulation in sustaining growth is reflected in the decline in the growth ofoutput per effective
worker, which went from 9.2% in the late 1960s, to 2.7% in the 1970s, to .2% in the 1980s.




     21j should emphasize to the reader that, as noted in section II above, I use data on cement
imports to estimate extremely high levels of investment in durable structures during the 1950s
(estimates which I have not been able to corrobate using other sources). If anything, the total
factor productivity growth rates presented in table 4-1 are likely to be overestimates.

   (*) Only covering firms recorded in the Census of Industrial Production.



      Although the Singaporean national accounts do not estimate capital formation by sector, it

is possible to make use of the annual Census of Industrial Production (CIP), which contains data

on fixed assets, capital formation, employment, value added, output and production costs, to
derive total factor productivity growth estimates for the manufacturing sector. The CIP is the

principal source of information on Singaporean manufacturing and, along with departmental data
on prices, forms the basis of Singapore's Index of Industrial Production (lIP), which in turn is the

basis of the national accounts estimates of the constant price growth of manufacturing value
added. I regret to inform the reader, however, that (i) 40% or more of the output recorded in the

LIP is w?deflated, i.e. for many manufacturing sub-sectors the "index" is simply the growth of
nominal output; and (ii) the Singaporean national accounts use this undeflated output index as
their measure of the constant price growth of manufacturing value added. Following the lead of
the Singaporean statistical authorities, I use the UP as my measure of the growth of value added




                                                         18
in the CIP firms.
      As shown in table 4-1, over the 1970 to 1990 period as a whole total factor productivity

growth in Singaporean manufacturing averaged -1.0% per annum, a performance approximately
equal to that of the aggregate economy during the same period. As in the case of the aggregate
economy, the principal source of low productivity growth in Singaporean manufacturing is the
combination of a slow growth of output per weighted worker (1.6% per annum) and a rapid fall

in output per unit of capital input (-2.7% per annum). Given the liP's questionable (i.e.
non-existent) deflators, these estimates are clearly grossly inaccurate and are simply meant to
show what can be accomplished at the sectoral level given the current state of Singaporean data.




        Although much of manufacturing output is undeflated, the reader should not jump to the
conclusion that the lIP overstates the growth of the manufacturing sector. While the undeflated
items include many products whose prices have probably been increasing (e.g. printing and
transport equipment), they also include many electronics products, whose prices have
undoubtably been declining. Interestingly, at one point the Singaporean statistical authorities,
who were concerned about their methodology, sought the assistance of the Japanese on this
issue, but were assured that non-deflation of manufacturing output was also common practice in
that economy (I)
         Since the CIP does not contain any information on the age or educational characteristics
of the workers in the firms surveyed, I use census data to adjust for the age and educational
characteristics of the workforce under the assumption that the workers in the CIP shared the
same age and education characteristics as similar sex persons reported as manufacturing workers
in the census.

V. South Korea
      Table 5-1 below presents total factor productivity growth estimates for South Korea.
Although South Korea exhibits even more capital deepening than Singapore, with output per unit
of effective capital input failing 3.3% per annum, the larger labour share and faster growth of
output per worker (4.0%) combine to give the economy a considerably larger total factor

productivity residual (1.6%). Productivity growth in the Korean economy appears to have
improved over time, with the average 2.5% growth of the 1980s well above the .8% and 1%

growth experienced during the 1960s and 1970s, respectively. Turning to the industry level
analysis?' we see that manufacturing has had the highest average level of productivity growth.

Productivity growth in manufacturing fluctuates dramatically from period to period, but averages
2% to 3% per decade. Productivity growth in other industry and services, while also volatile, has
improved on a decade by decade basis, with, in particular, a dramatic rise in other industry from
-2.2% in the 1960s to 1.9% in the 1970s and 4.0% in the 1980s. Although the results are not
reported in the table, I should note that I have estimated productivity growth in the subsectors of

other industry and set-vices, finding average total factor productivity growth rates (during the
1966-1990 period) of -1.1% in mining, 5.1% in electricity, gas & water, 2.1% in construction,

3.3% in transport, storage & communications, and -0.1% in finance, insurance, real estate &
business services (1970-1990).




       24The Korean national accounts include data on capital formation by asset type and by
industry, but not by asset type and industry. Consequently, my industry level estimates are based
upon an aggregate (unweighted) capital input, undifferentiated by asset type, with depreciation
rates based upon the average non-residential depreciation rate in the non-agricultural economy.

VI. Taiwan
      Table 6-1 below presents total factor productivity growth estimates for Taiwan. With

output per unit of capital input falling 2.7% per annum, but output per effective worker rising
4.5% per annum (the fastest growth in this sample of four economies, Taiwan exhibits an

average rate of productivity growth comparable to that of Hong Kong (2.4%). As table 6-1
shows, the sectoral pattern of productivity growth in Taiwan is markedly different from that in

Korea. In the Taiwanese economy manufacturing and other industry appear to be productivity

laggards (with average growth rates of 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively), while services seems to
have played the role of the productivity powerhouse (with an average growth of 3.4% per
annum). Strong differences in the performance of Taiwan and Korea are also apparent within the
more detailed sectors of 'other industry". Thus, over the 1966-1990 period total factor

productivity rose 3.7% per annum in Taiwanesc mining (as compared with a decline of -1.1%
per annum in Korea) and fell -0.3% per annum in Taiwanese electricity, gas & water (as

compared with rapid growth of 5.1% per annum in Korea). Elsewhere, the performance of the
two economies was more similar, with productivity in Taiwan rising 1.2% per annum in
construction (2.1 % Korea), 4.5% per annum in transport, storage & communications (3.3%
Korea), and .1% per annum in finance, insurance, real estate & business services (-.1% Korea).

     It is important to note that part of the extraordinary performance of Taiwanese services is
due to the unusual approach taken by the Taiwanese national accounts to the measurement of
public sector output. Whereas most national accounts authorities deflate public sector output by

the wages of different types of public sector employees, leading to an approximately zero growth
in output per effective worker, the Taiwanese national accounts incorporate a "quality

adjustment", allowing for the growing (unmeasurable) productivity of public sector employees.
According to my estimates, between 1966 and 1990 output per effective worker in the Taiwanese

public sector grew 4.4% per annum (6.5% per annum if one includes military personnel in the

denominator).'
     Table 6-2 provides additional total factor productivity measures for Taiwan, where I have
adjusted the national accounts measure of public sector output to conform to the more standard

(zero growth) deflation technique. As the reader can see, this adjustment has a large impact on

the aggregate non-agricultural economy, where productivity growth falls to an average of 1.9%,
and an even stronger impact on services, where productivity growth now appears to have
averaged 2.5% (which nevertheless remains higher than manufacturing and other industry).

Table 6-2 also presents estimates for the non-public sector non-agricultural Taiwanese economy,




       27 The reason the Taiwanese national accounts make this adjustment is fairly obvious.
With public sector employment stagnating and output per worker in all other sectors of the
economy growing rapidly, backward extrapolation (at constant prices of the mid-1980s) using
the standard deflation technique implies that the share of government in total output was about
50% in 1966. A similar problem exists in the U.S. national accounts, but is ameliorated by the
fact that public sector employment is expanding rapidly, while the growth of the other sectors of
the economy is more gradual than in Taiwan. The solution I employ (in table 6-2), is to estimate
the growth of aggregate output as a Tornqvist index of the growth of the one-digit ISIC sectors
(plus the public sector), with the (chain-linked) current price share of each sector taken as its
weight. This approach is analogous to that used by Griliches and Jorgenson (1967) for the
measurement of the output of the U.S. economy.


                                               24
which side-steps these measurement issues by excluding the public sector from consideration2 I

find that total factor productivity growth in the non-agricultural private sector Taiwanese
economy averaged 2.1% per annum between 1966 and 1990. Interestingly both sets of estimates
for the aggregate economy in table 6-2, both with and without the public sector, show a

substantial improvement in productivity growth during the 1980s, which is reminiscent of the

results for Korea.




      This approach is not entirely satisfactory either, since the public sector provides many
unpriced services (e.g. roads & bridges) to the private sector. Variations across economies and
across time in the quantity of capital and labour services provided (free of charge) by the public
sector could potentially bias estimates of private sector productivity.

      Finally, I remind the reader that in the results reported above I have excluded the large

conscript armies of Korea and Taiwan in measuring the growth of labour input in these
economies on the grounds that the measured output of these military personnel (i.e. their wages)
is a negligible proportion of total output. In the case of Taiwan, census sources provide

information on the sex, age and educational characteristics of military personnel. To analyze the
sensitivity of my results I make use of this information to incorporate military personnel into my

estimates. As shown in table 6-3, including military personnel raises the rate of total factor
productivity growth in the aggregate economy by .4%, to an average of 2.8% per annum."
However, if one considers military personnel as part of public sector employment, then the
"quality adjustment" of public sector output in the Taiwanese national accounts appears to be

even more exaggerated. Adjusting public sector output to standard deflation techniques yields an
average total factor productivity growth rate of 2.1% (table 6-3), i.e. only .2% higher than that
reported earlier (excluding military personnel) in table 6-2. Similiar estimates for services yield
average rates of productivity growth of 3.7% and 2.3%, which are only .3% greater and .2% less,
respectively, than the comparable figures reported earlier above. In sum, the estimates for
Taiwan are not extremely sensitive to the inclusion of military personnel, particularly once one
adjusts the growth of public sector output to international norms. The impact of military
personnel in Korea, where they constitute a much smaller percentage of the working population.
should be even smaller.




      "The reader may note that including military personnel lowers slightly the estimated share
of labour. This follows from the fact that including the military lowers the ratio of the
self-employed to the employed in the economy, implying (for a given aggregate wage bill) a
lower implicit wage for the self-employed.

VII. Comparison with Earlier Research
      Several total factor productivity studies of the East Asian NICs, some of them quite

rigorous, have preceeded this one. Tsao's (1982) detailed study of Singapore has generally been
ignored or dismissed as unbelievable. The methodology used in this paper is similar to hers, as

are the results. Tsao estimates a total factor productivity growth rate for the economy as a whole

of -.3% per annum for the 1966-1980 period and an average rate of -1.2% per annum for
twenty-eight manufacturing industries between 1970-1979.° With regards to Singapore, this
paper's principal contribution is to extend Tsao's analysis to the 1980s.

      Turning to Korea, Kim and Park's (1985) study provides an impressively cataloged
analysis of total factor productivity growth in Korea, estimating average annual rates, for the
entire economy, of 4.03% during 1963-72 and 1.47% during 1972-1982.' Similarly,
Christensen and Cummings (1981) estimate an annual economywide total factor productivity
growth rate of 4.1% for the 1960-1973 period. Both studies fail to separate out the agricultural
sector. Table 7-1 below reproduces the capital stock estimates used by Christensen and
Cummings. As can be seen, land input (most of which was in agriculture) and agricultural
inventories accounted for 68% of their measured capital stock in 1959, but only 45% in 1973.

Thus, while their aggregate capital stock was growing by only 3.4% per. annum, the components
of greatest importance to the non-agricultural economy, i.e. non-residential structures and
equipment, were growing at rates well in excess of ten percent per annum. Similarly, for 1961




      30Tsao (1982), pp. 91 & 149.

      31Kim & Park (1985), p. 62.
         I have serious doubts about their measures of non-farm inventories. According to their
estimates, the ratio of non-farm inventories to value added in manufacturing and wholesale &
retail trade (at constant prices) fell from 1.23 in 1959 to .35 in 1973. As noted earlier. I have
found the inventory series published by these economies to be largely fictional.


                                                 29
Kim & Park allocate land a share of onà-half of all capital income, with inventories receiving an
additional quarter,33 and structures and equipment, which were growing at an explosive rate,
receiving only one quarter of capital income, or 9% of national income.3' And yet, Kim and
Park's study contains several tables indicating the small share of land in non-agricultural assets
and factor income. In sum, it is probably fair to say that the work of Kim and Park and

Christenson and Cummings, if disaggregated, would indicate extraordinary productivity growth
in agriculture, with low productivity growth in the non-agricultural sectors of the economy.




     33Kim & Park's inventory series is also suspicious, with the inventory to GDP ratio (in

      '
manufacturing and wholesale & retail trade) falling from 4.17 in 1961 to .50 in 1981.

        By the early 1 980s, however, they allocate over half of capital income to structures &
equipment, as the growth of these inputs leads them to dominate their capital stock measures.
This is why Kim & Park have lower estimated productivity growth rates for 1972-1982.

      Finally, I turn to a recent study by Dollar and Sokoloff (1990), which found total factor
productivity growth rates in Korean manufacturing between 1963 and 1979 of 6.1% per annum.
This study does not make the best use of the available data, relying on the United Nations'
Yearbook of Industrial Statistics for its estimates of output and labour input and on the Economic
Planning Board and the Bank of Korea for its capital stock estimates and output deflators, while
estimating the share of labour using regression techniques. The most severe problem with Dollar
and Sokoloffs study, however, is that their measure of manufacturing output grows 3.5% faster
per annum for 16 years than the measure of manufacturing output reported by the Korean
national accounts!33 If one subtracts three and a half percent excess (overestimated) output
growth per annum from their series, one arrives, immediately, at an estimated total factor
productivity growth rate of around two and a half percent per annum, which is close to that

reported in this paper.




       The origin of the problem seems to be the output data taken from the UN Yearbook of
Industrial Statistics. These data are drawn from Korea's annual Survey of Mining and
Manufacturing. The output of the firms covered by this survey does, indeed, grow some 3.5%
faster than the national accounts. I have repeatedly questioned the Korean national accounts
authorities on this issue and they steadfastly maintain that the Survey is not representative of the
entire manufacturing sector. Apparently their adjustment of the survey data, using alternative
sources, leads to a considerably lower estimate of the growth of the manufacturing sector.

VIII. Summary and Conclusions
      Underlying the pervasive influence of the East Asian NICs on both theoretical and policy

oriented research in the economics profession lies a common premise: that productivity growth

in these economies, particularly in their manufacturing sectors, has been extraordinarily high.
The results of this paper, as summarized in table 8-1, suggest that this premise is largely

incorrect. Over the past two and a half decades, productivity growth in the aggregate
non-agricultural economy of the NICs ranges from a low of -0.3% in Singapore to a high of
2.3% in Hong Kong, whereas in manufacturing productivity growth ranges from a low of -1.0%
in Singapore to a high of 2.9% in South Korea. For the purposes of comparison, table 8-2
reproduces the results of two detailed cross-country studies of productivity growth, with
methodologies similar to that used in this paper. As the reader can see, it is not particularly
difficult to find either developed or less developed economies whose productivity perfomiance,
over time periods spanning two decades or more, has matched or rivaled that of the NICs.
Although, with the possible exception of Singapore, productivity growth in the NICs is not

particularly low, it is also, by post-war standards, not particularly high.TM
      The results of this paper should be heartening to economists and policy makers alike, If
the remarkable post-war rise in East Asian living standards is primarily the result of one-shot

increases in output brought about by the rise in participation rates, investment to GDP ratios, and
educational standards and the intersectoral transfer of labour from agriculture to other sectors

(e.g. manufacturing) with higher value added per worker, then economic theory is admirably
well-equipped to explain the East Asian experience. Neo-classical growth theory, with its




     TMIn this regard it is interesting to note that Lau and Kim (1992), using an econometric
approach to the study of productivity growth, find that productivity growth in the NICs in the
1970s and 1980s was not significantly different from zero.

most, if not all, of the difference between the performance of the NICs and that of other post-war

provided data on GDP and GFCF by asset type at current and constant 1980 market prices for the
period 196l-199l? Estimates of 1947-1960 investment by asset type were derived from data on

retained imports of machinery and equipment, private construction expenditures and government

capital expenditure published in Hong Kong Statistics 1947-1967, deflated to 1961 prices using
the non-food retail price index (the only price index available) and then linked to 1980 prices
using the 61/80 deflators by asset type from the national accounts. Compensation of employees
as a percentage of GDP for all years except 1966 were taken from current and historical issues
of Estimates of Gross Domestic Product, data provided by the Hong Kong government, and the

Kong).
      Estimates of the working population cross-tabulated by class of worker, sex, age,

earliest dates for which detailed data of each type were available.

capital formation, they unfortunately follow the 1968 SNA in classifying capital formation by
industry of ownership, rather than industry of use (as was the case in the Old System accounts,
which followed the 1953 SNA). Provided the ratio of ownership to use remains roughly constant
over time, the New System accounts still provide a reasonable measure of the growth of capital

input by industry. A problem arises, however, in linking the Old and New System accounts,
when the change in definition induces a dramatic change in measured capital input by sector. To
ameliorate this problem, I use the Old System accounts to measure the growth of capital and
output by industry for the 1960-1975 period and the New System accounts (initializing the
capital stock with the 1969 Old System values) for the period 1975199O.42 Measures of indirect
taxes, and their distribution by type, were taken from the national accounts sources and the
annual issues of the Economic Statistics Yearbook. Data on compensation of employees by
economic sector are provided in National Accounts 1990. Since the Old System accounts do not
provide data with similar detail, I assume that the share of labour by sector in 1960 and 1966
equalled the ratio estimated for 1970.

      Estimates of the working population cross-tabulated by class of worker, sex, age, and
education were derived from published census tabulations, supplemented with data from the
Economically Active Population Survey (where this contained tabulations unavailable in the
census). Incomes and hours of work by worker characteristic were estimated from the published
tabulations of the Occupational Wage Survey for the period 1971-1990. For earlier years hours
of work and relative income's by worker characteristic were assumed to be constant at the levels



      42
            the analysis of the aggregate non-agricultural economy, where the distinction
between user and owner is less significant, I use the Old System for 1960-1970 and the New
System (initialized with the Old System values of 1969) for 1970-1990.

      Taiwan: Unpublished data provided by the Taiwanese government included information
on capital formation and output in current and constant 1986 prices, as well compensation of

employees and indirect taxes. The publication National Income in Taiwan Area of the Republic
of China 1991 summarizes much of these data. Estimates of the working population by class of

worker, industry, sex, age and education were derived from English and Chinese language
census sources." Employee incomes by worker characteristic for the years 1976, 1980 and 1990
were estimated from the data tapes of the Survey of Personal Income Distribution (summarized
in the publication of the same name), with labour force estimates prior to 1976 weighted with the

relative wages of that year.43




      43Both the Economically Active Population Survey and the Monthly Wage Survey
(reported in the Yearbook of Labour Statistics) contain data on hours of work (in theformer case
extending back to the early 1960s). The hours of work data reported by both sources, however,
are uncorrelated with movements in output (and with each other), which is not the case with the
occupational wage survey, which also provides considerably greater detail. In any case, no
source shows any substantial trend in non-agricultural hours of work.
      "Since the national accounts data cover only the "Taiwan Area", I excluded those listed as
 working in Fujian province from my estimates of the working population.
             this time, I have not made any adjustment for hours of work for Taiwan. The
 employee earnings survey (most recently reported in the Yearbook of Earnings and Productivity
 Statistics) provides data on monthly hours of work, but these series have historically been subject
 to enormous revisions. I am currently trying to a compile a consistent historical series onhours
 of work from the labour force survey (most recently reported in the Yearbook of Manpower
 Survey Statistics), which I hope to make use of in a later draft.
