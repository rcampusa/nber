Racial Bias in Motor Vehicle Searches: Theory and Evidence

NBER Working Paper No. 7449

                                           ABSTRACT

      African-American motorists in the United States are much more likely than white motorists
to have their cars searched by police checking for illegal drugs and other contraband. The courts are
faced with the task of deciding on the basis of traffic-search data whether police behavior reflects a
racial bias. We discuss why a simple test for racial bias commonly applied by the courts is inadequate
and develop a model of law enforcement that suggests an alternative test.
      The model assumes a population with two racial types who also differ along other dimensions
relevant to criminal behavior. Using the model, we construct a test for whether racial disparities
in motor vehicle searches reflect racial prejudice, or instead are consistent with the behavior of
non-prejudiced police maximizing drug interdiction. The test is valid even when the set of
characteristics observed by the police is only partially observable by the econometrician. We
apply the test to traffic-search data from Maryland and find the observed black-white disparities in
search rates to be consistent with the hypothesis of no racial prejudice.
     Finally, we present a simple analysis of the tradeoff between efficiency of drug interdiction and
racial fairness in policing. We show that in some circumstances there is no trade-off; constraining
the police to be color-blind may achieve greater efficiency in drug interdiction.
