                  PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF NARXET TIMERS


                                 ABSTRACT




   Previous investigators have shown that the Sharpe measure

of the performance of a managed portfolio may be flawed when

the portfolio manager has market timing ability.
   We develop the exact conditions under which the Sharpe

measure will completely and correctly order market timers

according to ability.       The derived conditions are necessary,

sufficient, and observable.       We compare them to empirical

estimates of actual market conditions, and find that the

circumstances which can lead to a failure of the Sharpe

measure do in fact occur.       We show, however, that such

failures can be greatly reduced by more frequent sampling.

               PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF MARKET TIMERS*




I.    INTRODUCTION
     Admati and Ross       [1J,      Dybvig and Ross   [3],   and Grant   [4]

demonstrate that the portfolio of a market timer having

superior information can appear mean—variance inefficient to
an outside observer.             In particular, they find that the

Sharpe      [10]   measure of the performance of a portfolio

managed by         a skilled   market timer can indicate performance

which is inferior to that of the market.                We consider here

whether such         a measurement      error is likely to occur in

practice by developing the exact condition under which the

Sharpe measure will fail to order timers according to
ability.       We re-examine the condition specified by Dybvig
and Ross, and derive one which is both necessary and
sufficient.         We then test that requirement against data

presented by Nerton            [8]   and show that the Sharpe measure is

in fact likely to be deficient under actual market

conditions given the current industry practice of using

quarterly data.

portfolio composition   that result in a nonnormal unconditional        distribution    of

returns.    See Dybvig-Ross.     If information on portfolio shifts is available

then it can be used to measure performance.         (An interesting technology   for

using portfolio   shifts has been developed and ised by Merton [9], Henriksson

and Merton [61, Henriksson [1, and Cheng and Lewellen         [21 to test market

timing ability and by Kane, Lee, and Marks [7] to test yield curve

prediction.)    Unfortunately,   information on portfolio composition      is

infrequently disclosed.    The Sharpe measure remains the industry standard for

portfolio   performance measurement.     Even though our results show that the

Sharpe measure calculated on quarterly data        is deficient   under actual market

conditions, we also conclude that more frequent        (e.g. monthly or daily)

sampling greatly mitigates     the problem.     That is, with more frequent sampling

the Sharpe measure will correctly      order timers according     to ability, even in

the absence of information on portfolio composition.

    Dybvig and Ross [3] posit an environment in which there are two assets.

One is riskless with return                 r.   The other is the market portfolio


which is risky with return               x =      r       +       +         +   where      ir       is    the market risk

premium,    5     is   the signal     observed by the portfolio manager but not by an

outside observer, and                 is noise.               For convenience, the risk-free rate, is

assumed to be zero and s and                     are assumed to be independent normally
                                                                            2


                                                                            .
distributed with zero means and variances                                       and             .        Uninformed investors

estimate the variance of x to be                      2       =         +         The manager invests a unit

amount under a constant absolute risk aversion utility function U() =

-exp[—Afl with P          > 0.      Dybvig-Ross assume that the manager maximizes client

utility, i.e., that there are no principal—agent problems.                                                    We make this

assumption as well

    Both Grant and Dybvig-Ross compare a market-timer to                                                  a   nontimer.   Our

interest is to compare timers to each other in order to rank them according to

ability.        We assume that manager                i       does not observe s directly but receives a

signal,            that is conditionally normally distributed with mean s and
           z1.,

                                            —                                                             2

We, however, will allow                 to take on                all       positive values.                   In this way,

we will he able to rank timers; good timers will have lower

case considered by Dybvig-Ross.

    Grant and Dybvig-Ross show that, from the viewpoint of an outside

observer,    a   market-timer may appear mean—variance inefficient.                            That is, a

naive investor would expect to obtain the same mean and a lower variance in

his or her portfolio by taking a fixed position in the risky and risk-free

assets.     Equivalently, the unconditional Sharpe [10] measure S for the fund

(defined as the risk premium over the standard deviation) may be lower for a

timer with        >   0   than for the market.       Consider the square of the Sharpe

which is the result found by both Grant and Dybvig-Ross.                           Unfortunately,

be satisfied if       ir   >        +   a    which guarantees that the first term of the

inequality dominates the others.                     The sum              +   a of course               is just

the observable market variance, which we denote by                                        .         Thus, we have an
observable condition                >   a2      which, if satisfied, implies that                                 a   timer

will be mean-variance inferior to a nontiiner (have a lower Sharpe measure).

However, this observable condition, while being sufficient, is not necessary.

That    is, even if         <   2   it is possible for a timer to appear

mean—variance inferior to a nontimer.                         In addition, it is possible for


superior timers to appear mean-variance inferior to inferior timers.

       We may then determine the conditions under which                                           Sharpe measure will

provide a complete correct ordering of timers according to ability, and the

conditions under which it will fail.                         That is, we may compare managers of

different abilities.            The derivative of S2(2') with respect to ability,

and from this expression we can obtain several important results.




Proposition 1:    Greater ability will yield a higher Sharpe measure than lesser

ability for all p2ctO,1i if and only if
                                                              a + a2          >   32               For the

proof, see the Appendix.
       This guarantees that S2(p2) will be monotoriically increasing in                               p2

for all p2 > 0 if and only if                     >   32       and thereby that the Sharpe

measure will correctly order ability through the whole range of abilities.

The condition for a complete inverse ordering is given by:




Proposition 2.        Greater ability will yield a lower Sharpe measure than lesser

ability for all p2c[0,1] if

contained in the Appendix.



       It is interesting to note that the condition ,2                            <   2   not only implies

a complete inverse ordering of performance.                                Such an ordering is of course

just as useful as a complete correct ordering in the absence of principal-

agent problems.        From these two propositions, we can divide market conditions

into three ir, regions, as depicted in Figure 1.




                                             Figure        1   Goes Here



In region A, utility maximizing managers will be ordered in exactly the wrong

way.     In region C,       ability will      be ordered exactly correctly by the Sharpe

measure.        In region    B   there will always be misordering over some range of

ability.        It should be noted that the condition for a complete and correct

ordering of ability by the Sharpe measure (a2 > 312) is both strong (i.e.,

necessary and sufficient) and observable.                                We may also use the estimates
supplied by tIerton [8] to consider whether this condition has been violated in

the past.




lit.    Empirical Estimates

     The problem with using the Sharpe measure to order timers               is that although


x is normally distributed, the unconditional distribution of the timers

portfolio returns, [i(Z'lX,          is   nonnormal (it has a chi—square element [3]),

Nevertheless, from Proposition 1 we know that mean and variance will order

timers correctly if and only if           ir/a   <   .577 where r and   are stated in terms

of the observation interval.

     The usual practice in portfolio performance measurement is to use

quarterly data.       Therefore we will assess the viabiflty of the Sharpe measure

assuming a quarterly measurement interval for measuring fund performance.                 The

most comprehensive estimates of the mean return on a market index are given by

Merton [8].   Merton uses a Bayesian prior of a positive


risk premium to estimate V1          /a (see his model        2) from monthly data where a

is   the market risk premium and a          is   the market standard deviation.   We add the

subscript M to Mertons notation to indicate that it is a monthly estimate.

     We will apply the condition on the Sharpe measure with quarterly data.

Since all rates are continuously compounded, we may convert Mertons monthly


estimates of ?    into    quarterly estimates (regardless of the level of the

risk-free rate) by noting that


                 1r0=   taM_    i
                                 =
                 a0


where t   is the number        of months in a quarter and thus that

                                                     -10-
            =


where the subscripts Q and M refer to quarterly and monthly rates respectively.

    Table   1   presents ilertons data for thirteen four year sampling periods

covering the years 1P26-197.       The last column, T, lists the longest

corresponding observation interval (in months) for which the Sharpe measure

would not fail given liertons estimates.         This     break-even   period is

determined by

                                  Table   1   Goes Here


    As Dybvig-Ross noted, mismeasurement        using Sharpe measure has its cause in

the nonnormality of the unconditional distribution of returns.             The above

indicates that for short intervals this nonnormal element is not large enough

to affect the validity of the Sharpe measure.           As the interval gets longer we

reach a point (T) where reversals begin to occur.

    It is fascinating that, even though the source of nonnormality is shifts

in portfolio composition, the point at which reversals occur (T) does not

depend on A in equation (1).      (A can be considered to be a shift parameter.




                                          —11—
Lower values result in greater shifts.)               Rather, 1 depends only on market


conditions as given by ?,       the   Sharpe measure of the market.        The above result


states that the higher the Sharpe measure of the market, the greater the

degree of nonnormality and the more difficult it is for timers to distinguish

themselves from the market and from each other.              That is, reversals occur at

smaller interval 5.

    From Table   1,   we see that in six of the 13 subperiods, the Sharpe measure

would either fail            0.577 or T   <   3)   or come close to failing for a
                      (YQ>

quarterly observation interval (1=3).              Merton also estimated      over 52 1-year


intervals and found the average monthly estimate to be .3719.               This results in


                 = .6441


which is again over the threshold of .577.              Thus, the conditions for the Sharpe

measure to order timers incorrectly according to ability do seem to occur

frequently.   The table also suggests that monthly observations would greatly

mitigate, if not eliminate, the problem.

IV     CONCLUSIONS

       Grant   [4],   Dybvig-Ross [31 and Admati-oss      El] have shown that the Sharpe

[10] measure of the performance of the portfolio of            a   market timer having

superior information can he inferior to that of a passive portfolio.               Herein

we developed the exact conditions under which the Sharpe measure will

completely     and correctly order market timers according to ahility.           The

condition derived is necessary, sufficient, and observable.               We compared this

requirement to the empirical estimates of market conditions reported by Merton

[8].     We found that the conditions for     a     failure of the Sharpe measure have in

fact occurred.         Nevertheless, we show that such failures can be greatly

reduced by more frequent sampling.

                         9
positive      for    p           >   0.    This completes the                                       if          part of the proof.             The 'only
