                                          ABSTRACT

This paper estimates the impact on consumer behavior of a firm's voluntary disclosure of
information. Specifically, we study the impact of Starbucks' disclosure of calorie information on
its menu boards in June 2013. Using data on over 250,000 consumers' visits to specific restaurant
chains, we estimate difference-in-difference models that compare the change in the probability
that consumers recently visited Starbucks to the change in the probability that they recently
visited a similar chain that did not voluntarily disclose: Dunkin Donuts. Estimates from
difference-in-differences models indicate that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that Starbucks'
disclosure of calorie information had no impact on the probability that consumers patronized
Starbucks in the past month. However, we find evidence of a transitory negative impact on the
probability of visits the first year after disclosure, and evidence that disclosure reduced the
probability of visits by men. These results are useful for understanding how consumers respond to
the voluntary disclosure of information, a decision faced by many firms.

Introduction

       Economists have long studied how the disclosure of information affects consumer

choices (e.g., Stigler, 1961; Arrow, 1963; Pauly, 1968; Akerlof, 1970; Spence, 1973). There is

particular interest in how consumers respond to new information concerning health (e.g.,

Cawley, Susskind, and Willage, 2020; Kim et al., 2019; Bedard and Kuhn, 2015; Handel and

Kolstad, 2015; Prina and Royer, 2014; Kolstad, 2013; Bollinger et al., 2011; Dupas, 2011;

Wisdom et al., 2010; Pope, 2009; Jin and Leslie, 2009; Variyam, 2008; Dranove et al., 2003;

Mathios, 2000).

       One area of particular interest is how consumers respond when restaurants disclose

calorie and other nutrition information. This is due in part to the tripling in the prevalence of

obesity in the U.S., from 13.4% in 1960-62 to 42.4% in 2017-18 (Fryar, Carroll, and Ogden,

2016; Hales et al., 2020). There are many proposed explanations for the rise in obesity (Cawley,

2015), and one possible contributor is increased consumption of restaurant food. The percentage

of calories that Americans consume as food away from home has nearly doubled, from 17.8% in

1977-78 to 33.7% in 2013-14 (Guthrie et al., 2018). This is relevant because consumers tend to

substantially underestimate the calorie content of restaurant food (see, e.g., Cawley, Willage, and

Susskind, 2021; Block et al., 2013; Backstrand et al, 1997) and thus may end up consuming more

than they would if they had perfect information. To address this information gap, organizations

including the American Heart Association (2009) and the Institute of Medicine (2005, 2012)

have recommended listing calorie counts on restaurant menus.

       Between 2008 and 2018, calorie labels on restaurant menus in the U.S. went from

virtually nonexistent to ubiquitous, due to three factors. First, certain cities and counties passed

laws requiring chain restaurants in their jurisdiction to disclose calorie information; this occurred



                                                  2
in, e.g., New York City (2008), King County, Washington, which includes Seattle (2009), and

Philadelphia (2010); see Courtemanche et al. (2020). Second, some restaurant chains decided to

voluntarily post calorie labels, including: Panera (2010); Yum Brands (2011), which includes

Pizza Hut, KFC, and Taco Bell; McDonalds (2012); Chik-fil-A (2013); and Starbucks (2013).

Third, a national menu label law that was included in the Affordable Care Act took effect on

May 7, 2018. After that date, all chain restaurants (20 or more locations operating under the

same name) in the U.S. were required to post calorie counts on their menus and/or menu boards.

       In this paper, we study the consequences of voluntary disclosure of information by a firm.

In such a case, the disclosing firm continues to compete with local rivals which have not

disclosed, which makes it a notably different situation than a firm disclosing in response to a

legal requirement that also applies to its competitors. For a firm to voluntarily disclose, it would

have to perceive that disclosure is in its interest. Firms selling high-quality goods might choose

to disclose because they expect that it would lead to higher sales. Under certain conditions such

as costless disclosure, complete unraveling may occur, in which the firms with the highest-

quality goods disclose their information, putting pressure on firms with the next-best quality

goods to also disclose, lest consumers assume that they have the worst-quality goods, until all

firms have disclosed except those of the very lowest quality (Viscusi, 1978; Grossman and Hart,

1980; Grossman, 1981). In practice, however, unraveling tends to be incomplete, meaning that a

substantial fraction of firms, which are selling goods of varying quality, do not voluntarily

disclose (Jin et al., 2021; Bederson et al., 2018; Luca and Smith, 2015; Mathios, 2000).

       A firm might choose to voluntarily disclose because it lowers their costs; e.g. a restaurant

chain facing some local disclosure laws might decide to disclose everywhere so it can use a

single set of menus and menu boards nationwide. In the case of menus labels, firms knew from



                                                  3
2010 to 2018 that the U.S. had passed, but not yet implemented, a nationwide menu label law, so

they may have opted to simply begin the process of compliance early. In this paper, we do not

study the decision of a firm to disclose, but rather how consumers respond when a firm

voluntarily discloses.

       Our research question is: does voluntary provision of information by a firm make

consumers more or less likely to patronize the firm? More specifically, does a restaurant chain's

decision to voluntarily implement calorie labeling make consumers more or less likely to visit

the chain?

       It is unclear whether voluntary information disclosure would affect the probability that

consumers patronize a firm, and if so, in which direction. Disclosure could attract patrons if

consumers assume that disclosing firms must have better quality products than those that refuse

to disclose. It could also attract consumers if the items turned out to be lower-calorie than

consumers believed, raising consumers' expected marginal utility from the items. Alternatively,

information disclosure could deter patrons if they are surprised by how high the calorie counts

are; for example, if they have optimism bias (Sharot, 2011; Miles and Scaife, 2003) then they

may believe that rival chains that did not disclose have lower-calorie items than those that did

disclose. Consumers might also be put off by disclosure if they enjoy their meal more if they do

not know its calorie content, a phenomenon known as information aversion (Andries and

Haddad, 2020) or strategic self-ignorance (Thunstrom et al., 2016). Sunstein (2021) argues that,

for those who do not want to change their behavior, disclosure of calorie information can serve

as an unpleasant reminder and thus a hedonic tax. Consumers may seek to avoid that by

patronizing competing chains that do not disclose. Finally, disclosure could have no impact at all

on consumer visits. This might be the case for several reasons: if consumer choice of chain is not



                                                 4
meaningfully affected by calorie counts; if they didn't notice the disclosed information because it

wasn't salient (e.g., Bordalo et al., 2013); if consumers were unable, due to bounded rationality,

to effectively comprehend or use the disclosed information (e.g., Rice, 2013; Simon, 1955); or if

they already had accurate information about the calorie content of menu items.

        Previous research provides some information regarding the plausibility of those

scenarios. There is some evidence that a firm's reputation can be enhanced by voluntary

disclosure. Berry, Burton and Howlett (2018) find that voluntary, as opposed to mandatory,

calorie labeling can increase perceived concern for customer well-being which in turn increases

patronage intentions. As previously mentioned, numerous studies have found that, in the absence

of calorie disclosure, consumers do not have accurate information about the calories in restaurant

food, and that specifically they tend to greatly underestimate them. Previous studies have not

found evidence of information aversion or strategic self-ignorance concerning calorie labels. In a

randomized experiment of restaurant menu calorie labels, Cawley, Susskind and Willage (2020)

found that over 70% of both the treatment and control groups reported that they support having

calorie labels on menus, and that exposure to the randomized treatment of calorie labels

increased by 9.6% the probability that the respondent supported having them on menus.

However, a national poll of U.S. adults in 2017 found that the public was equally split (49% to

49%) in whether they favored or opposed the government requiring chain restaurants to post

calorie counts (Politico/Harvard Public Health Poll, 2017); the lower support found in the

national poll may be due to it asking about a government requirement as opposed to a voluntary

decision by restaurants. 2




2
  In an Amazon Turk survey of 400 Americans by Sunstein (2021), less than half (43%) wanted calorie labels in
restaurants.

                                                        5
         Regarding the salience of the information, evidence indicates that not all patrons see

calorie labels. Four weeks after the New York City menu labeling law took effect, Elbel et al.

(2009) found that 46% of New York City respondents (all of whom had just exited a fast food

restaurant) reported that they had not noticed calorie information in the establishment. In a

randomized experiment, Cawley, Susskind, and Willage (2020) found that 21.1% of patrons in

the treatment group reported that they had not seen the calorie labels that were on their menus.

One explanation for the difference in the estimates of the two studies is that the former

concerned menu boards while the latter concerned hand-held menus, and it may be harder to see

information on a menu board.

         There is also evidence that consumers have bounded rationality; even with disclosure,

patrons continue to significantly underestimate the number of calories they have ordered.

Cawley, Susskind, and Willage (2021) find that the probability of underestimating the number of

calories in one's dinner by 25% or more, on a post-meal survey, is 44.6% in the control group

not given calorie labels and 36.8% in the treatment group whose menus had calorie labels. Thus,

calorie labels improved knowledge of the number of calories in foods but considerable error

remains. In summary, there are many reasons that information disclosure may attract or deter

patrons, and the overall effect is difficult to predict.

         In this paper we examine the voluntary disclosure of calorie information by Starbucks,

which voluntarily posted calorie counts on its menu boards on June 25, 2013, nearly five years

before the U.S. law required chains to disclose this information. 3 The comparison firm is

Dunkin Donuts, which did not voluntarily disclose calorie counts prior to the nationwide


3
 Prior to Starbucks posting calorie counts on its menu boards, the calorie information was available online or in
printed brochures. However, the information is presumably much more salient when posted on the menu board.
Several studies have found that salience increases consumer response to information, taxes, and prices (e.g. Bordalo,
2013; Chetty, Looney, & Kroft, 2009; Blake et al., 2018).

                                                         6
requirement in 2018. We estimate difference-in-difference models that compare the change in

the probability that consumers visit Starbucks after it disclosed calorie information to the change

in the probability that consumers visit Dunkin Donuts over the same period. We exclude the

handful of areas where local laws required all restaurant chains ­ including both Starbucks and

Dunkin Donuts ­ to disclose their calorie counts, and thus examine the vast majority of the

country where Starbucks began voluntarily disclosing calorie information and Dunkin Donuts

did not.

        Dunkin Donuts is a suitable comparison firm for Starbucks because Starbucks and

Dunkin Donuts are the #1 and #2 coffee chains in the U.S. Although some might think of Dunkin

Donuts as primarily a donut store (which is understandable given its name), Dunkin Donuts has

positioned itself as a national coffee chain. Delventhal (2020) writes: "Dunkin' Donuts markets

itself primarily as a coffee seller that also offers donuts and food, a fact made apparent by a

coffee cup prominently featured on the company's logo and executive management's explicit

assertion that Dunkin' Donuts is a beverage company." As an example of the latter, David

Hoffman, the CEO of Dunkin' Brands, has said: "Brands that stay narrow in their lane do their

best...On the Dunkin' side, that is great coffee, fast. It's our sweet spot." (Anderson, 2018).

Further evidence of this is that, in 2019, the word `Donuts' was removed from the chain's name

and it is now simply named `Dunkin" to reflect the that the company is "beverage-led" (Dunkin',

2018). 4 Dunkin Donuts has previously been used as a comparison firm for Starbucks in an

economic study of calorie labels (Bollinger et al., 2011).

  Although Dunkin Donuts changed its name to Dunkin in 2019, for the sake of consistency and clarity we will refer
to it as Dunkin Donuts throughout this paper.

         To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the impact of voluntary calorie

labeling by a chain on the probability that consumers patronize the chain. 5 Most of the related

previous research has examined the impact of city and county laws that required calorie labels on

restaurant menus (e.g., Todd et al., 2021; Courtemanche et al., 2020; Restrepo, 2017; Cantor et

al., 2015; Auchincloss et al., 2013; Bollinger et al., 2011; Finkelstein et al., 2011; Elbel et al.,

2009). Notably, Bollinger et al. (2011) use data from Starbucks to estimate the effect of a 2008

New York City law mandating calorie counts be posted on restaurant menus. They find that the

average number of calories ordered fell by 6%.

         A smaller number of studies have examined the impact of voluntary disclosure of calorie

information in individual restaurants on what consumers ordered during their visit (e.g., Cawley,

Willage, and Susskind, 2020, 2021; Bedard and Kuhn, 2015; Pulos and Leng, 2010), but these

studies were not, given their data, able to estimate the impact on the probability that consumers

visit in the first place.

         There are relatively few studies of the effects of chain-wide voluntary adoption of calorie

labels prior to the nationwide law. This is of particular interest because problems of asymmetric

information are ubiquitous, and many firms may be considering voluntarily disclosing

information to consumers. Two previous studies examined restaurant chains' decisions to

voluntarily post calorie labels, although they examined a different outcome: the food items on

the menus. Specifically, Bleich et al. (2015) and Theis and Adams (2019) found that the average

calorie content of menu items was lower in chains which had voluntarily posted menu labels than

in chains which did not; these were cross-sectional comparisons after the information had been

Swartz et al. (2011).

disclosed - neither study was able to examine the change in calorie content from before to after

the labels were posted.

        Another contribution of our study is that it examines an outcome important for firms ­

the probability that consumers patronize the chain. Virtually all previous research on menu labels

has focused on consumer outcomes such as the number of calories ordered and BMI. One

previous study that did examine firm outcomes found, in a randomized experiment of calorie

labels, that the disclosed information had no detectable impact on revenue per patron or profit

per patron (Cawley, Susskind, and Willage, 2021). However, this study was not able to examine

the impact of menu labeling on the probability that a consumer visits in the first place. The

present study contributes to the literature by examining an outcome that was missing in previous

studies: the probability that patrons visit the chain.

        More generally, this study sheds light on whether firms are likely to find voluntary

disclosure of information to be advantageous. This is an important contribution, as there are

many cases in which firms face decisions about whether to disclose (see, e.g., Dranove and Jin,

2010; Loewenstein, Sunstein, and Golman, 2014). This study contributes to the economic

literature on the voluntary disclosure of the following types of information: restaurants posting

hygiene report cards (Bederson et al., 2018), manufacturers' labeling of the fat content in salad

dressing (Mathios, 2000), business schools posting their rankings (Luca and Smith, 2015),

colleges releasing the SAT scores of admitted students (Conlin et al., 2013), HMOs voluntarily

seeking external accreditation to signal quality (Jin, 2005), publicly traded companies releasing

financial information to investors (Suijs, 2007), sellers of used cars disclosing private quality

information (Lewis, 2011; Akerlof, 1970), and job applicants signaling their abilities (Spence,




                                                   9
1973). Given the wide range of contexts in which firms decide whether to disclose information to

consumers, the findings of this paper are widely useful and applicable.



Data: Simmons National Consumer Survey (NCS)

        We examine data from the Simmons National Consumer Survey (NCS), which is

uniquely well-suited for our purpose because it is a nationwide survey that includes information

from a large number of adult respondents (over 250,000), contains information on their visits to

specific branded chain restaurants (including Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts), and was conducted

in several years both before and after Starbucks voluntarily disclosed calorie information in

2013.

        The Simmons NCS is a proprietary nationally representative repeated cross-sectional

survey. For each survey wave (of which there are 2 to 4 per year), the survey is administered to

an independently-drawn multi-stage stratified probability sample of individuals. The response

rate for the NCS during these years of data averaged 19%. The NCS data include an intentional

over-representation of higher-income households because the survey is intended to be useful for

informing marketing decisions. Overall, the weighted NCS sample is comparable to U.S. Census

data in terms of as age, gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, income, and health care insurance

coverage (See Appendix Table 1).

        From the NCS, we obtain information on each individual's demographic characteristics,

such as age, race, ethnicity, gender, education, household income, location of residence

(designated marketing area (DMA), marital status, employment characteristics, household

income number of members in the household, hours worked, and health insurance status.




                                                 10
         We have data from Fall 2003 through Fall 2016, with wave 39 from Fall 2004 dropped

due to data corruption. We combine waves into calendar years. We drop the small number of

observations (N=11) which are missing demographic information. Our final sample consists of

257,493 adults. 6 Each of those individuals appears twice in the data ­ once regarding their visits

to Starbucks and once regarding their visits to Dunkin Donuts ­ so our total sample size is

514,986. A strength of using the NCS is that it provides a large sample size and thus substantial

statistical power to detect even modest effects.

         The NCS questionnaires ask consumers the number of times they visited specific

restaurant chains in the past 30 days, with the possible answers recorded in bins, such as 0, 1-2,

and 3-5. 7 Our primary outcome is the extensive margin of visits: whether the consumer reported

visiting that chain in the past 30 days. There is some difficulty in examining changes on the

intensive margin of visits when the number of visits is reported categorically and those

categories change over time 8, but we are able to consistently classify the intensive margin of

visits in the last 30 days as low (1-5 visits) or high (6 or more visits). We estimate secondary

models examining the intensive margin of visits using this binary (high vs low) dependent

variable.

         The NCS contains information about the respondent's Designated Marketing Area

(DMA), which is the media market in which they live. Identification of location is important



6
  The NCS surveys each person in the household. We study adults (aged 18 years and older), but not youths because
they were not consistently asked about visits to Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts. Specifically, kids (aged 6-11) were
not asked about Starbucks in any wave, and teens (aged 12-17) ceased to be asked about Starbucks in only one
survey wave after Starbucks began posting calorie counts.
7
  Specifically, respondents are first asked whether they go to fast food and drive-in restaurants. If they respond yes,
then they are asked to mark the number of times, in the last 30 days, they visited each of a list of chain restaurants,
which includes Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts.
8
  The categories concerning number of times visited in the last 30 days are not consistent across wave; for example,
in some waves the categories include 3-5 and 6-9, in other waves it is 6-13, in still other waves it is 6 or more.
However, across all waves we are able to consistently categorize people as having 0, 1-5, or 6 or more visits.

                                                          11
because in some years there were local menu labeling laws that required both Starbucks and

Dunkin Donuts to disclose their calorie counts. The boundaries of DMAs are much larger than

those of cities or counties; for example, while we know that someone lives in the Seattle-Tacoma

DMA we do not know whether they live in King County, WA, which had a menu label law, or

Pierce County, WA, which did not have a menu label law. Lacking more specific residential

information than DMA, we drop all observations in DMAs in which any subset of the DMA has

a menu label law. 9



Methods

        We estimate differences-in-differences (DiD) models, in which we compare the change

over time in the probability that consumers patronize the chain that began voluntarily disclosing

calorie information (Starbucks), relative to the change over time in the probability that

consumers patronize the chain that did not disclose calorie information (Dunkin Donuts). The

data are at the level of individual-chain-year; thus, each individual appears as two observations

in the sample, once regarding their visits to Starbucks and once regarding their visits to Dunkin

Donuts. The Simmons NCS is a repeated cross-section, so each individual appears in one year of

data. Specifically, we estimate the following difference-in-differences (DiD) models:

      = 0 + 1  + 2  + 3    + 4  + 5  + 

        Where Yicdy is our outcome of interest, for example a binary indicator of whether

individual i living in designated marketing area (DMA) d and observed in year y visited

restaurant chain c in the previous 30 days. TREAT is an indicator variable that equals one if the

  Specifically, the DMAs that were dropped are: Albany, NY; Burlington, VT; New York, NY; Philadelphia, PA;
and Seattle, WA. In total we drop 88,268 individuals (14.6% of the sample) who live in one of those DMAs. Two-
thirds of those individuals live in the New York, NY DMA.

observation concerns Starbucks and equals zero if it concerns Dunkin Donuts. YEAR is a vector

of indicator variables for year. POSTy is an indicator set equal to one if Starbucks had

implemented menu labels by year y, and zero otherwise; thus it equals zero for 2003 to 2012, and

equals one for 2013 to 2016. We drop one partially treated wave of the Simmons NCS that spans

the period during which Starbucks implemented its policy in June 2013. DMA is a vector of

indicator variables for DMA of residence d, and it also includes an indicator variable for those

living outside a DMA or if their DMA of residence is missing; indicator variables for region are

included as well because this information is known even for those outside of DMAs or when

DMA is missing. The vector Xi includes a vector of characteristics of individual i that may be

associated with the dependent variable: gender, age, race, educational attainment, employment

status, marital status, household income, household size, and season of interview.

       As previously mentioned, we drop observations for those living in DMAs which

implemented local laws requiring calorie labels on menus during the years covered by our

analysis. Our model also controls for an indicator variable for whether any part of the DMA had

passed but not yet implemented a menu label law. Dates of the passage and implementation of

local menu label laws are taken from Courtemanche et al. (2020).

       Standard errors  were clustered at the DMA level d in recognition of the fact that errors

may be correlated within DMAs due to, e.g., the number of locations each chain has in that

DMA, local advertising by chains in each DMA, weather, and other correlates of demand that

vary with local characteristics. This is more conservative (i.e. results in larger standard errors)

than clustering at the household level.

       Our parameter of interest is 3, which is the difference-in-differences estimate ­ how the

probability of people visiting Starbucks changed after it adopted menu labels, relative to the



                                                  13
change in the probability that people visited Dunkin Donuts, which did not adopt menu labels. In

contrast to other situations in which researchers wish to measure the change in outcomes for a

treatment group relative to a control group which is completely unaffected, in this case we wish

to measure how the firm that voluntarily discloses information fares relative to a competitor that

does not disclose. The identifying assumption is the standard one in difference-in-differences

models ­ that the treatment and comparison chains would have experienced the same time trends

in the absence of the treatment, something which we investigate by conducting an event study in

order to test for parallel trends prior to the treatment.

        The outcomes Y examined in the model above include both the extensive margin of visits

in the last 30 days, and the intensive margin of visits conditional on at least 1 visit (measured by

an indicator variable for a high frequency of visits, defined as 6 or more, versus a low frequency

of visits, defined as 1 to 5 in the last 30 days).

        We also examine whether there may exist heterogeneous treatment effects. One important

characteristic that may moderate the influence of calorie information is the consumer's level of

education. On the one hand, patrons with higher education may assign greater value to, or be

better able to use, health-related information (Grossman, 1972), and thus we might expect to see

better educated consumers particularly attracted to chains that voluntarily disclose calorie

information. On the other hand, highly-educated consumers may already be well-informed about

the calorie content of food and thus calorie labels may provide less new information for them,

and thus there could be a smaller response by them. To investigate this, we estimate our models

separately for those with and without a college degree.

        We also test for heterogeneous treatment effects on two other dimensions. First, those

with a high body mass index (BMI) may find disclosure of calorie information more or less



                                                     14
appealing than others. Attempts to lose weight are, not surprisingly, more common among those

with a higher BMI (see, e.g., Ruhm, 2012), and those with high BMI may be more likely to

patronize firms that disclose calorie information if they are interested in using it to manage their

weight. On the other hand, those with high BMI may be particularly likely to be information

averse in this context, and thus they may avoid places with calorie counts. To investigate

heterogeneous effects by BMI we estimate our models separately by whether the respondent's

BMI is in the overweight or obese range (i.e. if BMI >=25). 10

        Another potentially relevant characteristic is sex. Women are more likely than men to

report dissatisfaction with their weight, and are more likely to attempt to lose weight, controlling

for BMI. For example, in the nationally representative National Health and Nutrition

Examination Survey (NHANES) data for 1999-2006, 77.7% of women reported that their

preferred weight was less than their current weight, compared to 57.6% of men (Ruhm, 2012).

Also, a majority of women (56.1%) reported attempting to lose weight in the past year, compared

to roughly a third of men (35.9%); see Ruhm (2012). To investigate heterogeneous effects by sex

we estimate our models separately for women and men.



Empirical Results

Summary Statistics

        Table 1 presents summary statistics for the sample. The percentage of the sample that

visited each chain in the past 30 days was 12.3% for Starbucks and 9.3% for Dunkin Donuts. The

sample is 56.2% female, 78.4% white, and 29.7% have a college degree or higher education.

Testing the Parallel Trends Assumption


10
  Body mass index is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. See Burkhauser and
Cawley (2008) for a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of BMI as a measure of fatness.

                                                       15
       Figure 1 graphs the unconditional percentage of the sample that reports having patronized

Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts in the past 30 days. The unconditional trends prior to Starbucks

implementing menu labeling in June 2013 (indicated with a vertical line) seem to track each

other quite closely.

       We also conduct an event study to better test the identifying assumption of parallel

trends. The event study model is similar to the difference-in-differences model, but in place of

the POST*TREAT indicator variable, the indicator for Starbucks is interacted with indicator

variables for individual years (with 2012, the year immediately prior to treatment, excluded).

Table 2 presents the coefficients from the event study. Prior to Starbucks' voluntary disclosure in

2013, there is no significant difference in the time trend in visits to Starbucks relative to Dunkin

Donuts. Of the coefficients on eight pre-treatment event time periods, none are statistically

significant at the 10% level. A test of joint significance for all such interactions prior to the

treatment has an F-statistic of 4.24, which is statistically significant given our large sample size

of over half a million observations, but the pattern of individual coefficients is consistent with

the identifying assumption of parallel trends prior to the treatment.

       The coefficients from the event study, along with their 95% confidence intervals, are

graphed in Figure 2. The figure indicates that, prior to Starbucks' disclosure in 2013, there is no

individual year in which the trend for Starbucks differed from that from Dunkin Donuts. The

individual point estimates are small, and there is no consistent trend in a single direction prior to

the event; the point estimates hover closely around either side of zero. This is consistent with the

identifying assumption.

Results of Difference-in-Difference Regressions




                                                  16
       Table 3 presents results of our difference-in-difference regressions, and the first row

presents results for the full sample. Starbucks' voluntarily disclosing calorie information is

estimated to have reduced the probability that consumers visit in the past month by 0.5

percentage points (4.3%), which is not statistically significant. The estimate is relatively precise;

based on the 95% confidence interval, we can rule out that the impact of calorie disclosure was

to increase the probability of visiting Starbucks by 0.7 percentage points or lower it by 1.6

percentage points. The lack of a detectable impact after disclosure is consistent with the

unconditional trends in Figure 1, which show little change in the probability of patronizing

Starbucks relative to Dunkin Donuts, from before disclosure to after disclosure.

       The event study provides more granular results. Table 2 provides evidence of a transitory

negative impact. The first year after disclosure (2013), the probability of visits fell by 0.8

percentage points (6.8%), which is statistically significant at the 5% level. However, in

subsequent years (2014 and 2015), the point estimates fall in absolute value (to -0.7 and then -0.4

percentage points) and are not statistically significant. In the final year (2016), the point estimate

is larger in absolute value than that in 2014 (-0.9 ppts versus -0.7 ppts) but is less precise and so

is statistically significant at the 10% but not 5% level. These event study coefficients are plotted

in Figure 2. In summary, while we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no effect over the entire

post-disclosure period, there is evidence of a transitory negative impact the first year after

disclosure.

Testing for Heterogeneous Effects

       We test for heterogeneity in effects by estimating DiD models separately by education,

sex, and BMI; these results are presented in subsequent rows of Table 3. Among those with a

college degree, disclosure of calorie information by Starbucks was followed by a decrease of 0.4



                                                  17
percentage points in the probability of visiting a Starbucks in the last 30 days. Among those

without a college degree, the decrease is 0.7 percentage points. Neither the individual point

estimates nor the difference between them is statistically significant.

       We next test for differences by sex. We find that information disclosure by Starbucks led

to virtually no change in the probability that women visited Starbucks: an increase of 0.1

percentage point, which is not statistically significant. However, after disclosure, the probability

that men visited Starbucks fell by 1.4 percentage points (15.2%), which is statistically

significant. The difference in the point estimates for men and women is statistically significant at

the 5% level.

       We next investigate the possibility of heterogeneous treatment effects by consumer

weight classification. Those whose BMI is below the overweight range are 0.1 percentage point

less likely to visit Starbucks, and those whose BMI is at or above the overweight range are 1.0

percentage point less likely to visit Starbucks. Neither the individual point estimates nor the

difference between them is statistically significant.

Intensive Margin of Visits

       In Table 4 we present results for the intensive margin of visits; that is, among those who

do visit the chain in the last 30 days, how often do they visit: with low frequency (1-5 times) or

with high frequency (6 or more times). The first row, which corresponds to the entire sample,

indicates that there is no statistically significant change in the intensive margin of Starbucks

visits after information disclosure; the point estimate is consistent with a 1.9 percentage point

increase in the probability that patrons visit with high as opposed to low frequency, but the

estimate is imprecise.




                                                 18
       We again test for the possibility of heterogeneous effects. Subsequent rows of the table

show that the probability of being a high frequency visitor increases by 2.4 percentage points

(9.1%) among those without a college degree, which is greater than the estimate among those

with a college degree (0.8 percentage points), which is not statistically significant. However, the

difference in estimates across the two education groups is not statistically significant.

Subsequent rows of Table 4 indicate that there is no significant difference in the impact of

information disclosure on the intensive margin of visits across sex or BMI category.



Discussion

       There has long been interest in economics in how consumers respond to information,

particularly as relates to health. In this paper we examine how consumers responded to the

voluntary disclosure of calorie information by the Starbucks chain in 2013. We find that, overall,

disclosure had no detectable impact on the probability that consumers patronized Starbucks in

the past month relative to the probability that they patronized a rival chain, Dunkin Donuts.

Specifically, we find that disclosure was followed by a 0.5 percentage point reduction in the

probability that consumers visited Starbucks in the last 30 days, a change that is not statistically

significant. The estimate is relatively precise; based on the 95% confidence interval, we can rule

out that the impact of calorie disclosure was to increase the probability of visiting Starbucks by

0.7 percentage points or lower it by 1.6 percentage points.

       There is some evidence of a transitory negative impact. The event study indicates that the

first year after disclosure, the probability of patronizing Dunkin fell by a statistically significant

0.8 percentage points (6.8%), but in subsequent years the estimated effects were smaller in

absolute magnitude.



                                                  19
        We test for heterogeneity in these effects by education, sex, and BMI. We find evidence

of heterogeneity by sex; there is no change in the probability of a visit to Starbucks by women

after disclosure, but the probability that men visit falls by 1.4 percentage points (15.2%). The

difference between men and women is statistically significant. The difference by sex could be

due to several factors; for example, men may have had less accurate calorie information than

women prior to disclosure, and may have previously underestimated the calories in Starbucks

items. Men may be more likely to exhibit information aversion (Andries and Haddad, 2020) or

strategic self-ignorance (Thunstrom et al., 2016), preferring not to know the number of calories

they are consuming, or may experience the reminder of calorie content as a hedonic tax

(Sunstein, 2021).

       In contrast to the significant difference in impacts between men and women, we cannot

reject the null hypothesis that the treatment effect is the same by education or BMI.

       On the intensive margin, we find that information disclosure raised the probability that

patrons without a college degree were high frequency (6 or more visits per month) versus low

frequency visitors (1-5 visits per month) by 2.4 percentage points (9.1%); however, the

difference in estimates between those with and without a college degree was not statistically

significant. There were no significant differences in this effect by sex or BMI.

       The findings of this paper have several implications. Although some restaurants have

been concerned that posting calorie counts could hurt their business (e.g. Kruse, 2019), we find,

overall, no detectable impact of disclosure on the probability of customer visits. This suggests

that, at least for that outcome, voluntary information disclosure did not result in a competitive

disadvantage for the disclosing firm. However, it is important to keep in mind that there was a




                                                 20
significant reduction in visits the first year after disclosure, and among men in general during the

post-disclosure period.

        A novel contribution of this paper is that we are able to study an outcome that previous

studies could not: the probability that consumers visit the chain. This complements the previous

research which has studied how disclosure of calorie information affects what people order when

they do visit restaurants (e.g. Cawley, Susskind, and Willage, 2020, 2021; Bleich et al., 2017;

Cantor et al., 2015; Bollinger et al., 2011; Elbel et al., 2009).

        An important comparison is Bollinger et al. (2011), which examined detailed internal

transaction data from Starbucks as a means of evaluating the New York City menu label law that

applied to all chains. Bollinger et al. (2011) compare transactions at Starbucks in New York City

(the treated city) versus Boston and Philadelphia (the comparison cities) and estimate that

calories per transaction fell 6%, with all of the decrease coming in food, not beverages. Note that

both Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts had to disclose calorie counts under the New York City law,

so Dunkin Donuts is not a comparison firm in their context. Bollinger et al. (2011) also estimate

that the New York City menu labeling law increased daily transactions at New York City

Starbucks by 1.4%. However, when they analyze a smaller sample of loyalty card holders'

purchases, they find no detectable impact of the New York City law on the frequency of

cardholders' purchases in New York City relative to the comparison cities. Bollinger et al.

(2011) stress that their findings concern a mandatory disclosure law, and they emphasize that

voluntary posting by a single chain could result in substantially different outcomes, especially

with respect to competitive effects (Bollinger et al., 2011, p. 93). Our paper, which studies

voluntary disclosure by the same firm, thus complements their work.




                                                  21
       This paper also complements the broader literature on how disclosure of calorie

information affects what consumers order at restaurants. Several studies of the New York City

menu label law found no detectable change in the number of calories ordered by consumers at

fast food restaurants (Elbel et al., 2009; Cantor et al., 2015). In full-service restaurants with

hand-held menus, Cawley, Susskind, and Willage (2020) found in a randomized experiment that

calorie labels reduced the number of calories ordered at dinner by 3%, with no significant

difference by sex. Because they have menu boards rather than hand-held menus, Starbucks and

Dunkin Donuts may be more similar to the fast food restaurants studied by Elbel et al. (2009)

and Cantor et al. (2015) than the full-service restaurants studied by Cawley et al. (2020).

       More generally, this paper contributes to the economic literature on the effects of

information disclosure relating to health (e.g. Bederson et al., 2018; Bedard and Kuhn, 2015;

Dupas, 2011; Wisdom et al., 2010; Jin & Leslie, 2009; Variyam, 2008; Jin, 2005; Dranove et al.,

2003; Mathios, 2000). Even more broadly, this paper contributes to the economic literature on

how consumers respond to information disclosure even unrelated to health (e.g. Luca and Smith,

2015; Conlin et al., 2013; Lewis, 2011; Suijs, 2007; Akerlof, 1970).

       Limitations of this paper include that our data provide no information about what items

people ordered when they visit, although previously-mentioned studies have already examined

that as an outcome. We study a single pair of disclosing and non-disclosing firms, which may

limit generalizability. However, much can be learned from studying one or two firms (e.g.,

Charness & Gneezy, 2009; Finkelstein & Poterba, 2004; Royer, Stehr, & Sydnor, 2015;

Bollinger et al., 2010; Bedard and Kuhn, 2015). An important direction for future research is to

examine how consumers have responded in other cases in which firms have voluntarily disclosed

important information.

Data are from 2004-2016. Starbucks is the treatment firm and Dunkin Donuts is the control firm. The data are unique at the
Person ID-Firm level, with one observation per person, per firm. N listed (514,986) is for the extensive margin of visits; the N
for the intensive margin (high or low frequency of visits) is N=55,843. When sample is divided by BMI category, the sample
size is smaller due to non-response to the questions about weight and height; N=474,730 for the extensive margin of visits and
N=52,542 for the intensive margin of visits.
