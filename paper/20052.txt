                                         ABSTRACT

For years, online retailers have maintained a price advantage over brick-and-mortar retailers by
not collecting sales tax at the time of sale. Recently, several states have required that online
retailer Amazon collect sales tax during checkout. Using transaction-level data, we document that
households living in these states reduced Amazon purchases by 9.4% after sales tax laws were
implemented, implying elasticities ranging from –1.2 to –1.4. The effect is more pronounced for
large purchases, for which we estimate a reduction of 29.1% in purchases, corresponding to an
elasticity of –3.9. Studying competitors in the electronics field, we detect some evidence of
substitution toward competing retailers.

1         Introduction

          Over the past decade, online retail transactions have increased dramatically in volume.

According to the U.S. Census, online sales constituted 2.5% of retail sales in 2006 and 7.7% of

retail sales in 2016 (corresponding to $354 billion over the four quarters from 2015Q2 to

2016Q1). 1 Many factors have contributed to the growth in online sales, one of which is that out-

of-state online retailers do not charge sales tax, which has generally given them a price

advantage over retailers with a presence in the state. This sales tax collection loophole has not

gone unnoticed by state governments or by competing retailers. State governments are concerned

that these online sales depress local employment and erode tax revenues. Over the last decade,

many states responded by requiring that Amazon, the largest online retailer, begin to collect sales

tax at checkout. Collectively, these laws are called the “Amazon Tax.” Despite the importance of

understanding the effects of imposing sales tax on online commerce, only a few studies have

explored how the imposition of sales tax affects consumer behavior and online and brick-and-

mortar retailers. In addition, no previous systematic study has looked at the Amazon Tax.

          This study fills this gap in the literature by examining how collecting sales taxes on

online transactions affects consumers’ purchasing decisions. Online retailers that are not required

to collect sales tax, including Amazon, enjoy a price advantage. Thus, we hypothesize that the

introduction of the Amazon Tax will lead to a decline in Amazon’s sales and substitution to

alternative retailers. With effective sales tax rates as high as 10% in some jurisdictions (after

accounting for state, county, and city taxes), this price advantage can be sizable. Gene DeFelice,

vice president of Barnes and Noble, the largest book retailer in the United States, summarized

the issue succinctly: “We are at a serious competitive disadvantage against out-of-state, online

                                                 1
retailers who pay no taxes.” 2 An additional factor that is likely to facilitate customer migration

from Amazon to alternative outlets is the low search cost of online shopping.

       State governments have begun paying increased attention to the issue of sales tax

collection in light of the Great Recession and the recent growth in online retail volume. General

sales taxes represent an important part of state revenue: For example, in 2011, general sales tax

constituted 10.4% of revenues. Figure 1 shows that the importance of this tax varies considerably

by state, ranging from 0% of revenues in states without sales tax (such as Oregon and Alaska) to

as high as 21.0% of state revenues for Washington. 3 Recently, the issue has also received federal

attention. The Marketplace Fairness Acts of 2013 and 2015 were attempts by lawmakers to

enable all states to force retailers to collect sales tax on purchases made by out-of-state

customers, but neither act has been adopted into law. 4 Proponents of such online sales tax

collection bills often tout the elimination of the Internet retailer sales tax advantage as “leveling

the playing field” and helping to restore business and jobs to local economies.

       A recent trend in state legislatures is to enforce the collection of sales tax on Internet

retailers, particularly on Amazon, the largest online retailer. To date, there has been little

evaluation of far-reaching and permanent sales tax policies on retail, competition, and

consumers. Between 2012 and 2015, 19 states began implementing laws requiring Amazon.com

to collect sales tax from its customers. These laws provide an ideal setting for examining the

effects of sales tax collection on consumer behavior and the consequences to related firms.

       Our analysis of the effects of the Amazon Tax on purchasing behavior uses data from an

online financial account aggregator. This financial service enables subscribers to concentrate all

of their accounts in one place for viewing and monitoring purposes. Our base dataset includes

information on 2.7 million households and contains transaction-level entries similar to what is

found on bank and credit card statements. Due to the nature of this dataset, our sample contains

households that are likely to be younger and more urban than the general population. Though this

limits the external validity of our results, the sample represents a subset of the population that is

growing rapidly and are relevant to the overall economy.

       We begin our analysis by using a traditional difference-in-differences (diff-in-diff)

methodology to test whether households decreased their Amazon purchases following the

introduction of the law. Each state that adopted the Amazon Tax during our sample period is

considered “treated” following the adoption, and other states are considered “controls.” Our

results show that the introduction of the Amazon Tax resulted in a persistent decline of 9.4% in

the amount spent on products (net of sales tax, which we hereafter refer to as the tax-exclusive

price) through Amazon, corresponding to an average elasticity of –1.2. In an alternative

specification, we find that a one percentage point increase in sales tax leads to a $0.54 reduction

in tax-exclusive Amazon spending, corresponding to an elasticity of –1.4. We also test whether

these effects are more sensitive to households in high-tax jurisdictions and find that indeed these

consumers have higher elasticities.

       We find that low-income households reduced their tax-exclusive spending on Amazon

more than high-income households (9.9% versus 7.0%, respectively). Further, the percent

reduction in spending on Amazon was slightly higher among heavy Amazon customers. The

highest tercile of Amazon spending in 2011 reduced Amazon purchases by $6.22, corresponding

to a 9.4% reduction, whereas the lowest tercile of Amazon shoppers reduced expenditures by

$1.65, corresponding to an 8.0% reduction.



                                                 3
       Consistent with the idea that consumers trade off sales tax with search costs, we find that

the decline in Amazon purchases is more pronounced for larger purchases, as consumers would

receive the greatest savings by avoiding tax on such purchases. We document strong evidence

that the effect of the Amazon Tax increases with the size of the purchase, suggesting that

households are particularly likely to engage in Internet shopping to avoid sales tax for large

purchases. Consumers decrease their spending by 29.1% on transactions of at least $250,

implying an elasticity of –3.9. In a more refined analysis into smaller transaction amount bins,

we show that the elasticity is increasing in the transaction amount.

       Finally, we study substitution effects. Because many of Amazon’s large competitors are

companies with a larger scope of products than that of Amazon (e.g., groceries at Walmart,

Costco), we focus on a particular industry: electronics retailers. We find that Newegg, one of

Amazon’s direct competitors, experienced an increase in sales thanks to the implementation of

the Amazon Tax. On average, Newegg’s sales increased by 13.0%. We also observe that the

share of retail purchases coming from Amazon decreased for treated households and that this

effect was primarily driven by heavy Amazon shoppers.

       Our work relates to two recent strands of the literature. First, several empirical studies

have documented that consumers are price and tax sensitive, and thus attempt to avoid sales

taxes. Poterba (1996) and Besley and Rosen (1998) find that price levels in locations with high

sales tax are lower than those in locations with lower sales tax. Agarwal, Chomsisengphet, Ho,

and Qian (2013) find that consumers who live near state borders often shop in the neighboring

state when there are positive sales tax differences. Agarwal, Marwell, and McGranahan (2017)

show that consumers increase their purchases during sales tax holidays. Chetty, Looney, and




                                                 4
Kroft (2009) use an experimental setting to show that when sales tax is salient to consumers, the

demand for the product declines.

       Second, several studies explore the sensitivity to sales tax in the specific context of online

retail. The closest study to ours in this body of work is Einav, Knoepfle, Levin, and Sundaresan

(2014, EKLS). These researchers document a strong preference among eBay customers for out-

of-state sellers, for whom sales taxes do not apply. They observe eBay shoppers’ reactions when

they discover that the seller is from the same state, which requires them to pay sales tax. EKLS

document that eBay shoppers are indeed sensitive to sales tax and thus less likely to buy from

sellers who reside in the same state. In this setting, they estimate an elasticity –1.7.

       Our research contributes to the literature beyond EKLS on multiple accounts. First, our

paper directly studies the effects of a permanent change in sales tax for the largest Internet

retailer in the world. We rely on state-level implementation of laws; consequently, our results

directly measure the effect of these laws on Amazon and on Amazon’s competitors. While the

results of EKLS indicate that online shoppers are sensitive to taxes, their evidence does not

translate directly to the effect of the tax implementation and thus is less conducive to measuring

the policy impact. Second, we are able to study how the imposition of the Amazon Tax affects

the sales of competitors. Third, our empirical setting is different from that of EKLS, validating

both sets of results. The EKLS study is based on a limited sample of transactions (about

270,000). Conversely, our analysis is based on millions of transactions made by a sample of

more than 460,000 households in our broadest regressions. In addition, Amazon is larger than

eBay: As of 2014, Amazon’s revenues were five times larger. Finally, the time periods of the

studies are distinct, although chronologically close. EKLS use a sample from 2010; our data are




                                                   5
from 2011–2015. Given the speed at which online commerce is evolving, it important to monitor

the persistence of effects over time.

        Several additional studies examine the intersection of online sales and sales tax. Goolsbee

(2000a, 2000b) uses survey data to estimate that the number of online shoppers would drop by

24% if the tax-advantaged status of Internet retailers were removed. Alm and Melnik (2005),

Ballard and Lee (2007), and Scanlan (2007) address this question as well, though they find

smaller magnitudes for the effect. Goolsbee, Lovenheim, and Slemrod (2010) ascertain that the

penetration of the Internet is correlated with lower sensitivity of cigarette sales to local taxes,

suggesting that smokers use the Internet to purchase tax-free cigarettes. Ellison and Ellison

(2009) explore the price elasticity of memory modules sold by a particular retailer and determine

that consumers are price sensitive both to tax-exclusive prices and to state taxes. Anderson,

Fong, Simester, and Tucker (2010) show that when retail chains open their first store in a new

state, they experience a decline in their Internet sales shipped to that state because of the sales

tax, but the researchers find no similar effect on catalog sales. Finally, Hoopes, Thornock, and

Williams (2016) find that Internet retailers exhibit negative stock market returns following

legislative proposals to collect sales tax from customers, such as the Marketplace Fairness Act of

2013.



2       Background and Empirical Setting

        Sales tax is not collected on purchases from online retailers due to the Commerce Clause

in the U.S. Constitution. Current interpretation of the law, which has been consistently upheld by

the U.S. Supreme Court, is that online retailers must only collect sales tax on out-of-state

purchases if the retailer has a nexus (or a substantial physical presence) in the state. Due to the



                                                 6
nature of their business structure, online retailers have a physical presence in very few states.

Ten years ago, Amazon was only required to collect sales taxes in states in which it had a nexus

(for example, where it was headquartered or had fulfillment centers).

        In recent years, states have attempted to collect sales taxes by broadening the definition

of a nexus. Legislation by these states has defined the presence of affiliate programs or

subsidiaries as constituting a nexus. 5 Even when this legislation has been ruled constitutional by

state courts, the effectiveness of this method of tax collection has been mixed. Overstock.com,

for example, has responded to these laws by simply dropping its affiliates in these states.

Amazon has acted similarly in some states but in other states has chosen to accede to the

Amazon Tax laws due to various political and operational issues.

        As of February 2015, Amazon was collecting sales tax in 24 states, comprising more than

half of the U.S. population. Over our sample period, 19 states implemented Amazon Tax laws,

resulting in the beginning of sales tax collection on well-defined dates for each of these states. 6

Our diff-in-diff study relies on this change in tax policy over time for these states, relative to a

control group of other states that did not change their tax policy contemporaneously.

        Our study investigates the impact of the Amazon Tax in 19 states in which Amazon

started collecting sales taxes between 2012 and 2014. These states are Texas (7/1/2012),

Pennsylvania (9/1/2012), California (9/16/2012), Arizona (2/1/2013), New Jersey (7/1/2013),

Virginia (9/1/2013), Georgia (9/1/2013), West Virginia (10/1/2013), Connecticut (11/1/2013),

Massachusetts (11/1/2013), Wisconsin (11/1/2013), Indiana (1/1/2014), Nevada (1/1/2014),

5
  Online retailers such as Amazon and Overstock will often advertise on websites such as blogs. If a website reader
clicks on the advertisement and subsequently purchases the Amazon product, the website owner will receive a
commission on the sale. These website owners who allow Amazon to advertise on their websites are referred to as
affiliates.
6
  Before our sample period begins, five states collected sales tax from Amazon, including Washington where
Amazon is headquartered. After our sample period ends, more states already have or will shortly begin collecting
sales tax on Amazon purchases.


                                                        7
Tennessee (1/1/2014), North Carolina (2/1/2014), Florida (5/1/2014), Maryland (10/1/2014),

Minnesota (10/1/2014), and Illinois (2/1/2015).

         One concern with our setting is that many states require that households pay sales taxes

that are not collected at the time of purchase. These taxes are referred to as “use taxes” and are

collected by states annually at the time of tax filing. However, compliance with this use tax has

been abysmal. Manzi (2012) finds that only 22 states have “use tax” provisions in their state

income tax forms and that the vast majority of households residing in these states do not report

any “use tax” liability. For example, only 0.2% of households in Rhode Island report any use

taxes, and only 0.3% of households in California and New Jersey report use taxes. However,

some states have higher participation rates, such as Vermont and Maine, with 7.9% and 9.8% of

households in each state reporting use taxes, respectively. Unlike income tax reporting, systems

for tracking and enforcing collection of these sales taxes are weak. 7 Note that these figures do

not necessarily represent the percentage of compliance with the law. In particular, the quoted

numbers do not account for underreporting of use taxes conditional on reporting a use tax

liability.



3        Data

         The data we use were provided by an online account aggregator. This service allows

subscribers to pool their various financial information in one place, enabling households to view

spending by category, monitor investments, etc. Households join the service for free and provide



7
 For example, Colorado’s version of the Amazon Tax legislation tried to force online retailers to report to both
customers and the state tax authority summaries of use tax incurred, but it was later declared unconstitutional by the
District Court. However, Amazon makes annual spending reports available to residents of South Carolina and
Tennessee to aid households in tax filing, though this information is not reported to state tax authorities by Amazon.


                                                          8
their username and passwords to various financial institutions so that the service can

automatically extract relevant bank and credit card information.

       The information we use consists of daily transactions for 2.7 million households from

January 2011 to May 2015, and includes both banking (i.e., checking, savings, and debit card)

and credit card transactions. We observe the date, amount, and description of each transaction.

Thus, our dataset contains transaction-level data similar to those typically found on monthly

bank or credit card statements. Because each household is assigned a unique identifier, we are

able to follow each household through time.

       Identifying the state of residence of the household is integral to our analysis, because this

allows us to determine whether the household lived in one of the 19 treatment states affected by

an Amazon Tax. We use the fact that for most purchase-related transactions in the data, there are

geographic identifiers at the end of the transaction description that show where the transaction

took place.

       For each household, we collect the transactions with geographic identifiers and identify

the state of residence for that household by requiring that at least 75% of the transactions occur

within a single state. Next, for each household we assign the most commonly observed city in the

state of residence identified in the prior step as the city of residence of the household. Our results

are also robust to alternative methods of identifying the city of residence of the household as

described in Section A1 of the Appendix.

       Because we are primarily interested in how Amazon customers respond after the

implementation of the Amazon Tax, we focus our analysis on households who made some

purchases on Amazon prior to implementation. We include households that spent more than

$200 on Amazon during 2011, though the results are robust to using alternative spending



                                                  9
thresholds, as demonstrated in Section A2 of the Appendix. After applying these two filters, our

sample size is reduced to 275,437 households, 180,330 of which live in one of the 19 states that

implemented the Amazon Tax during our sample period.

        The unit of observation in our analyses is the household-month. For each household-

month, we sum all Amazon expenditures. For all transactions in our database, we adjust by the

households’ sales tax to determine the tax-exclusive amount spent on goods purchased. For

Amazon purchases by households in the 19 states that implemented an Amazon Tax, we only

adjust transactions after the law has been implemented. 8 All variables are winsorized at the 99th

percentile.

        Table 1 shows the geographic distribution of households in our sample relative to the

2010 U.S. Census. Our sample is quite geographically diverse and maps fairly well to the U.S.

Census data. Our sample does contain more California and New York residents than the general

population, potentially raising the concern that our results are attenuated to reflect the behavior

of households in these states. However, New York implemented an Amazon Tax law prior to the

study data period (2008), and thus is always in the control sample. California implemented the

law during the study period. To ensure that the results are not driven by California-specific

behavior, we rerun our main analyses excluding California, and find that the results remain

virtually unchanged.

        Figure 2 shows annual income of households in our sample and in U.S. Census data. Our

dataset maps fairly well to the U.S. Census, with a few caveats. The income we observe flows

through to a household’s checking or savings account. Thus, it will be equal to gross income

minus the sum of withholdings (payroll tax, state tax, federal tax, healthcare contributions,

8
 For two states (Pennsylvania and California), the implementation of the Amazon tax took place at the middle of the
month. In these cases, we removed the household-month observations from the transition month.


                                                        10
retirement contributions, etc.). Consequently, a household’s gross income will be higher than

what we directly observe. Nonetheless, the data are well dispersed across income groups and

seem to be reasonably representative of the U.S. income distribution. A notable difference

between our dataset and the Census are households with incomes lower than $10,000. These

households are over-represented in our sample compared to the population. Aside from the

possibility that our sample may contain a larger fraction of households that have lower incomes

than the population, it may also be attributed to households that did not link their income-related

bank accounts to the data provider.

          Compared to the Census, households in our sample are likely to be younger and more

urban. Though this limits the external validity of the results, our sample still represents an

important and growing share of the U.S. population. According to some estimates, Amazon’s

direct and indirect involvement in U.S. e-commerce reached over 30% in 2016. 9 The results of

our paper are relevant for understanding the online purchasing behavior of these households.

          Table 2 shows the average tax-exclusive Amazon spending three months before and three

months after the Amazon Tax implementation of each state. In this table, the tax-exclusive

spending for a particular state is reported along with that of the control states. We find that

treated states reduce tax-exclusive spending at Amazon relative to control states. We analyze this

formally in the subsequent sections.



4         States Implementing the Amazon Tax

          States that decide to implement the Amazon Tax are, of course, not drawn randomly.

This fact raises the concern that the decline in Amazon sales that we document occurs due to an


9
    www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/10/20/amazon-online-sales-bigger-larger/92419572/


                                                       11
unobservable confounding factor that pushes states to embrace the Amazon Tax and at the same

time causes a decline in Amazon sales. Perhaps the most obvious potential latent factor is a state-

level economic weakness that leads states to adopt the Amazon Tax in order to increase

revenues, and that at the same time causes a decline in consumption.

       We address this concern in four ways. First, we explore whether states that implement the

Amazon Tax during our sample period experience significantly different gross domestic product

(GDP) growth around the implementation of the tax than states that did not implement the tax.

We collect five-year GDP growth data around the implementation year and test whether the

average GDP growth is different for state-quarters following the implementation of the Amazon

Tax. We present the results in Table 3, Columns (1) and (2). The regressions indicate no

significant difference in state-level GDP following the Amazon Tax implementation.

       Second, we test whether households’ income changed around the implementation of the

tax using household-month data. To test whether this is the case, we extract household income

from the transaction data and regress household income on dummies surrounding the

implementation of the Amazon Tax. The results, found in Columns (3) and (4) of Table 3, show

that households did not experience a meaningful change in income around the implementation of

the tax. Hence, it is not likely that our main results are due to changes in the purchasing power of

households.

       Third, because a state-level slowdown typically is accompanied by a general decline in

consumption, we examine whether the pattern of purchasing at electronics retailers changed after

the tax’s implementation (Section 5.4). We find no such decline in consumption.

       Fourth, we conduct an event study in which we examine the change in Amazon sales

month by month around the implementation of the law. Figure 4, which is discussed later in



                                                12
Section 5.1, shows a sharp decline in Amazon sales around the month of implementation of the

law, leaving little doubt that the Amazon law is behind the reduction in sales.

        In sum, we conclude that our results are not likely to be driven by a state-level economic

weakness that caused states to implement the Amazon Tax and that at the same time caused a

slowdown in consumption.



5       The Effect of the Amazon Tax on Amazon Sales

        In this section, we examine how Amazon’s sales in the treated states changed after

implementation of the tax and compare these results to Amazon’s sales in states that did not

change their laws. We perform this analysis using the tax-exclusive price. Then, we explore how

different types of households might react to the new tax differently. Thus, we repeat our analysis

but split our sample into terciles based first on household income and then on Amazon historical

spending intensity. Finally, we examine the tax’s effect on large purchases exclusively.

        We use a diff-in-diff methodology in which we measure the consumption effects after

states started imposing sales tax on Amazon purchases. Our basic empirical specification is

       𝑌𝑌ℎ,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 × 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑒𝑒ℎ × 𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡 ≥ 𝑄𝑄)ℎ,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽2 × 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡

where 𝑌𝑌ℎ,𝑡𝑡 is the dependent variable of interest and takes on the value of Amazon expenditures of

household ℎ in month 𝑡𝑡 (tax-exclusive spending on Amazon). 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑒𝑒ℎ × 𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡 ≥ 𝑄𝑄)ℎ,𝑡𝑡 is

an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for treated households after implementation of the

Amazon Tax, and 0 otherwise. In a slightly modified empirical specification, we split the

𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑒𝑒ℎ × 𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡 ≥ 𝑄𝑄)ℎ,𝑡𝑡 term into a more granular interactive term to investigate short-

versus long-term responses to the treatment at a quarterly frequency. To account for regional


                                                                  13
differences in cost of living that vary over time, we introduce a time-varying cost of living index

at the city-month level, denoted 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 . This index is computed by calculating

the mean expenditures in the categories of gas, restaurants, groceries, and retail (excluding

Amazon purchases) for each city-month.



5.1      Consumer Response to Tax Implementation

         We begin our analysis by examining whether the average monthly amount that

households spend on Amazon purchases changes as a result of the new sales tax. For each

household in the sample, we aggregate the dollar amount spent on Amazon products within each

month. Because we are interested in the impact of the sales tax on Amazon’s sales and the value

of items purchased by households, we create the tax-exclusive price by dividing by one plus the

local tax rate.

         Table 4 presents the results of this analysis. Column (1) shows the change in average

monthly Amazon spending after the tax was implemented. The results indicate that consumers in

affected states reduced their average monthly purchases on Amazon by $3.65, a 9.4% (–

3.65/39.00) reduction in purchases relative to mean monthly spending among the treated states

before the tax was implemented. 10 This result is statistically and economically significant and

corresponds to an elasticity of –1.2. 11 Because these values are tax-exclusive, the drop in

spending reflects a drop in Amazon’s revenues in the affected states.

         In Column (2), we examine the timing of the Amazon purchases in the quarter preceding

and in the quarters following the tax implementation. 𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡 = 𝑄𝑄−1 )ℎ,𝑡𝑡 , 𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡 = 𝑄𝑄0 )ℎ,𝑡𝑡 , and 𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡 =


10
   Note that the mean of spending by the pre-event treatment is different than what is reported in Table 2 since here
we restrict the sample window around the Amazon Tax event.
11
   (–$3.65 / $39.00) / 7.5% = –1.24.


                                                          14
𝑄𝑄+1 )ℎ,𝑡𝑡 are indicator variables for the quarter(s) before, quarter after, and quarters following the

tax implementation, respectively. We find some evidence of a buildup in purchases before the

Amazon Tax was implemented, corresponding to an increase of 3.6% (1.42/39.00).

           In the quarter immediately following the sales tax implementation, consumers in the

affected states reduced their monthly Amazon purchases by $3.29, corresponding to an 8.4% (–

3.29/39.00) reduction from the mean. In subsequent quarters, the reduction of Amazon purchases

is $3.21, corresponding to an 8.2% (–3.21/39.00) reduction from the mean. The results are highly

statistically significant.

           In Column (3), we interact our 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑒𝑒ℎ × 𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡 ≥ 𝑄𝑄)ℎ,𝑡𝑡 term with the local tax

rate of each household to examine whether the households that lived in localities with a high

sales tax were more sensitive to the implementation of an Amazon Tax. Indeed, we find that a

1% increase in sales taxes leads to a $0.54 reduction in monthly Amazon spending,

corresponding to an elasticity of –1.4. 12

           In Section A3 of the Appendix, we repeat the above analysis using the tax-inclusive

Amazon expenditures as the dependent variable instead of the tax-exclusive Amazon

expenditures. We find a reduction in the tax-inclusive spending at Amazon, but we present the

results in the Appendix for two reasons. First, our main analysis is consistent with the standard

approach used in the literature to calculate tax-exclusive elasticities. Second, the relationship

between tax-inclusive and tax-exclusive elasticities is largely mechanical and can largely be

inferred from the tax-exclusive elasticities.

           We also provide an alternative measure of elasticity in Appendix A4. In a nutshell, we

log the dependent variable and rerun the main specification. The resultant elasticity of–0.83 is

12
     (–$54.32 / $39.00) = –1.39.


                                                       15
lower than that in our main analysis. The reason for a lower elasticity is that log specification

compresses large values and gives more weight to smaller purchase values. As discussed later in

Section 5.3, Amazon customers exhibit higher elasticity for large purchases, and hence a log-

specification tones down that end of the spectrum.

       To better understand the persistence of these effects, we plot the coefficients for the

regression in Figure 4, Panel A, using month dummies instead of quarter dummies. We see a

slight buildup in purchases in the quarter prior to the Amazon Tax taking effect, after which

there is a large and persistent reduction in Amazon purchases.



5.2    The Cross-Section of Households

       Different households may react to the inclusion of sales tax differently. For example,

households with low income may be closer to their budget constraint and thus change their tax-

exclusive Amazon spending due to the implementation of sales taxes. Households with high

income may also change their tax-exclusive Amazon spending, but at a proportionally smaller

rate relative to their average spending at Amazon. Similarly, households that purchase large

amounts at Amazon may find that they can no longer buy the same quantity of goods as before

after the implementation of sales taxes. The following analysis explores these dimensions.

       We first split the sample into terciles based on observable household income and perform

our main specification for each tercile. The results are presented in Table 5. Columns (1) to (3)

indicate that low-income households are the most sensitive to the Amazon Tax, reducing

Amazon purchases by $3.04 per month, corresponding to a 9.9% reduction in spending relative

to mean and an elasticity of –1.3. High-income households reduce their purchases by $3.76,

corresponding to a 7.0% reduction in spending and an elasticity of –1.0. These results are



                                               16
consistent with low-income households being more price sensitive than high-income households.

Further, the results are also consistent with lower income households having lower opportunity

costs and being willing to bear search costs to substitute to alternative retailers.

        We also split households into terciles by the total amount of Amazon purchases in 2011

to explore how past Amazon shopping intensity might affect a household’s response to the new

tax. Columns (4) through (6) of Table 5 present the results. We find that households with high

Amazon spending in 2011 exhibited the biggest dollar decline in spending. Such households

reduced Amazon purchases by $6.22, corresponding to a 9.4% reduction in Amazon purchases

and an elasticity of –1.3. This coefficient is highly statistically significant. In contrast,

households with low Amazon spending in 2011 exhibited the lowest decline in spending. Such

households reduced Amazon purchases by $1.65, which corresponds to an 8.0% reduction and an

elasticity of –1.1.



5.3     Large Purchases

        Given that the amount of sales tax charged on an item is proportional to its price, we

expect households to be more sensitive to sales taxes as the size of the purchase increases,

especially when assuming some sort of fixed search costs. For example, assume a household has

a sales tax rate of 10%. If the household were to purchase a $10 item at a local brick-and-mortar

retailer, it would result in a $1 sales tax charge. However, for a purchase of $1,000, the sales tax

due would amount to $100. When there is a fixed search cost associated with finding the tax

savings, this household would be more likely to purchase the $1,000 item online as opposed to

the $10 item. However, after implementation of the Amazon Tax, the tax avoidance incentive to




                                                  17
make large purchases through Amazon is removed, and any observed change in behavior

surrounding this event could be attributed to the Amazon Tax.

       We test this prediction in Table 6, which repeats the base regressions (from Table 4) with

a new dependent variable consisting of transactions of at least $250. Specifically, for each

household in the sample, we include only Amazon transactions of at least $250 using tax-

exclusive prices. Transactions below these amounts are set to zero. Then, we aggregate the large

transactions at the household-month level.

       The results show that the effects are substantially stronger for large purchases. Column

(1) shows the average decline in Amazon sales is 29.1% (–2.25/7.73), corresponding to an

elasticity of –3.9. In the more granular specification, Column (2) shows that there was some

buildup in purchases before the tax took effect and that the decline in purchases following the tax

implementation is persistent at a rate of –27.6% (–2.13/7.73). Column (3) shows that the

reduction in large purchases increases with the tax rate of the household: A 1% increase in sales

tax results in a $0.32 reduction in large purchases, corresponding to an elasticity of –4.1 for large

purchases.

       In Table 7, we expand on the analysis performed in Table 6. We create more refined bins

of Amazon purchases in $100 intervals. Column (1) in Table 7 corresponds to Amazon purchase

sizes of $0.01-$99.99, Column (2) corresponds to Amazon purchase sizes of $100.00-$199.99,

and so forth. Elasticities are computed in the bottom row and also plotted in Figure 3. Overall,

the results in Table 7 and Figure 3 convincingly illustrate that consumers are sensitive to the

amount of taxes owed, not just the tax rate. For relatively small purchases, consumers are

relatively inelastic. However, for large purchases, consumers are highly elastic. For the last

category that we consider (purchase ≥ $700), the elasticity is as large as –6.8.



                                                 18
        We repeat the month-by-month graphical analysis for the subset of large purchases and

present it in Figure 4, Panel B. The chart shows that the conclusion about the permanency of the

decline in Amazon sales documented earlier in Figure 4, Panel A, is applicable also to the subset

of large purchases.

        We also conduct an additional analysis that assesses the probability of purchasing from

Amazon in a given month. The analysis is presented in detail in Appendix A5. Consistent with

the analysis above, we find a 15.5% reduction in the likelihood of spending at least $250 (tax-

exclusive) at Amazon in a given month. This result is statistically insignificant for purchases less

than $250.

        In Table 8, we further examine the relation between large purchases and the tax increase,

by subpopulations. As before, we split the sample by income and by historical Amazon

purchases in 2011. We detect similar patterns to those found in Table 5. Column (3) shows that

low-income households reduce their large purchases at Amazon by 34.3% after implementation

of the Amazon Tax, corresponding to an elasticity of –4.5. In contrast, Column (1) shows that

high-income households reduce their large purchases only by 24.8%, corresponding to an

elasticity of –3.3.

        Column (4) shows that those with high past Amazon expenditures reduce tax-exclusive

spending by 30.1% (implying an elasticity of –4.0), while Column (6) shows that those with low

past Amazon expenditures reduce spending by 26.0% (implying an elasticity of –3.5).



5.4     Substitution to Competing Retailers and Income Effect

        We are interested in whether the forgone sales of Amazon went to competing firms and

whether these firms are brick-and-mortar stores or other online retailers. Previous studies have



                                                19
found that the imposition of sales tax pushes consumers to look for alternative sellers who do not

collect sales tax. For example, evidence of cross-border shopping (e.g., Ballard, and Lee, 2007;

Agarwal, Chomsisengphet, Ho, and Qian, 2013) indicates substitution in the physical sphere. In

the online arena, EKLS find that eBay customers back out of transactions once they find that

they need to pay sales tax and that they are more likely to instead buy another item from an out-

of-state seller who does not collect sales tax. Ellison and Ellison (2009) use Pricewatch data to

document that buyers of memory modules choose to purchase from sellers who do not collect

sales tax. The substitution observed in these studies of online retailers is performed on the same

platform (either eBay or Pricewatch, respectively), making it is easy for the consumer to

substitute within the platform and for researchers to identify the effect. In the case of Amazon,

substitution may be costlier for customers and is more difficult for researchers to detect.

       In our tests of substitution, we face a data issue. While we observe transaction amounts at

Amazon and the competing firms, we do not know what products were purchased. Furthermore,

if there is substitution to other retailers, it is likely spread among several competitors rather than

one retailer. Finally, it is empirically difficult to detect an increase in sales in giant competitors

like Walmart, Costco, or Target that sell a wide array of products including some that are not

usually offered by Amazon (e.g., groceries).

       Nevertheless, we can provide some evidence about substitution in specific areas. In this

section, we investigate electronics retailers as well as broad Internet merchants. We focus on

electronics products for several reasons. First, these are often large purchases, making it worth

the shopper’s time to find a good deal. Second, these products are easily identifiable by brand

and model; hence, shoppers can easily compare prices across outlets. Third, competing retailers

in the electronics space specialize in electronics only, sharpening the empirical test. We,



                                                 20
therefore, look at the largest competing electronics stores: Best Buy and Newegg. Best Buy is the

largest electronics retailer in the United States, and Newegg is the second largest online-only

retailer after Amazon. Best Buy has a physical presence in most states and thus collects sales tax

both for physical and online sales. Newegg, however, is headquartered in California and has

limited operations in two other states, so it is only required to collect sales tax from purchases in

three states. 13 To gain more insight into household behavior, we split Best Buy transactions into

brick-and-mortar and online purchases.

           Next, we identify transactions through eBay, which is a viable competitor to Amazon,

selling a wide variety of products in its online marketplace. Unfortunately, there is no easy way

to identify eBay transactions in our dataset because the majority of these transactions occur

through PayPal payments directly to eBay sellers. 14 The portion of these transactions that contain

the keyword “eBay” we unambiguously classify as eBay transactions. All other PayPal

transactions we leave in their own PayPal category, with the understanding that this is an

imperfect proxy for eBay transactions. Next, in an attempt to capture a wide breadth of online

retailers, we identify all other Internet merchants by searching for the keyword “.com” for all

retail transactions not previously classified into the other categories.

           To test for the possibility that competing electronics retailers benefited from some of

Amazon’s forgone sales, we regress total spending of the competing retailer’s sales on the

𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑒𝑒ℎ × 𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡 ≥ 𝑄𝑄)ℎ,𝑡𝑡 variable introduced earlier. As with the previous regressions, we

also include household and month fixed effects. The results of the substitution analysis are

presented in Panel A of Table 9. We find no significant results for Best Buy in Columns (1) and

(2). However, we find evidence of substitution toward Newegg in Column (3). On average,

13
     https://kb.newegg.com/search/getsearch/12/3?text=*&catid=1011
14
     Paypal, owned by eBay, is the primary payment system on the eBay platform.


                                                         21
households increase their purchases at Newegg by $0.25 per month, corresponding to a 13.0%

increase in expenditures. The result is highly statistically significant and could be attributable to

the fact that it retains its tax advantage over Amazon and Best Buy. In Columns (4) and (5), we

find no significant results for eBay or PayPal, respectively. Likewise, Column (6) indicates no

evidence of substitution toward other retailers captured with the “.com” retail query.

       In Panel B of Table 9, we look at substitution using an alternative approach. In this panel,

we explore whether the ratio of Amazon purchases to total retail purchases (including Amazon)

changes as a result of the Amazon Tax. In Column (1), we find that treated households reduce

the share of Amazon purchases by 0.5 percentage points. In Columns (2) to (4), we divide the

sample into terciles based on Amazon spending as in Table 5 and Table 8. We find that this

substitution to other retailers is larger for heavy Amazon shoppers, who reduce the share of

Amazon purchases by 0.7 percentage points. In comparison, light Amazon shoppers only

reduced their share of Amazon purchases by 0.3 percentage points.

       We also examine whether households altered their consumption package in other

domains as the Amazon Tax effectively lowers their disposable income. In the analysis presented

in Appendix A6, we test whether the spending on restaurants, groceries, and entertainment,

where households are grouped by their Amazon shopping intensity. The results show no

meaningful effect, suggesting that households decreased their spending in other consumption

categories.



5.5    Substitution to Amazon Marketplace

       We also analyze potential substitution of Amazon customers to Amazon Marketplace.

Amazon Marketplace is a platform that allows third-party sellers to sell products directly on



                                                 22
Amazon’s website. Many products on Amazon are sold by both Amazon.com and Amazon

Marketplace within a single product page. Amazon handles the billing and often the shipping of

these orders, so Amazon Marketplace sellers are an almost perfect substitute for Amazon.

Because these third-party Amazon Marketplace sellers have limited geographical footprints and

are not subject to the Amazon Tax laws, products sold by these sellers are not generally taxed.

However, the sales tax advantage of these Marketplace sellers may not be immediately evident to

the casual shopper who mistakenly assumes that the Amazon Tax laws apply to both Amazon

and Amazon Marketplace transactions.

       We test the effect of the Amazon Tax on Marketplace sales in Column (7) of Table 9,

Panel A, and find a marginally significant negative coefficient on the variable, corresponding to

a 2.3% reduction in Amazon Marketplace expenditures among treated households. This

surprising result could stem from treated Amazon shoppers not knowing that Amazon

Marketplace transactions allow them to avoid paying sales tax. Thus, any positive effects from

the more attractive treatment of sales tax of Marketplace transactions appear to be offset by the

negative effects of the perceived increases in taxes by the casual Amazon shopper.



6      Conclusion

       Taxes affect not only business decisions by managers, but also purchasing decisions by

customers. In the aggregate, purchasing decisions have significant effects on corporations. In this

study, we analyze the effects of implementing the Amazon Tax law in various states. The law

requires Amazon to collect sales tax, which in turn makes Amazon’s products less competitive.

       Using transaction-level data of 275,437 households in our main specifications, we

examine the effects of the Amazon Tax on the purchasing behavior of residents living in 19



                                                23
states that adopted such laws during the 2012–2015 period. We find that Amazon sales fall by

9.4% after implementation of an Amazon Tax, corresponding to an elasticity of –1.2. We further

find that a one percentage point increase in the tax rate of the household leads to a $0.54

reduction in tax-exclusive Amazon spending, corresponding to an elasticity of –1.4. We find the

effect to be concentrated among large purchases of at least $250. For this subset of purchases, we

find that Amazon sales fall by 29.1% after implementation of the Amazon Tax, corresponding to

an elasticity of –3.9.

        To understand whether Amazon’s competitors benefit from the law, we examine the sales

of the online retailer’s competitors in the electronics industry. We find no evidence of

substitution toward Best Buy, Amazon’s largest competitor in the electronics space, but our

results indicate some substitution to Newegg, an online electronics retailer.

Table 2. Average Monthly Tax-Exclusive Expenditures Before and After Sales Tax Change
This summary table presents average tax-exclusive spending at Amazon in the ±3-month window before and after
implementation of Amazon Tax laws. We include only households that spent over $200 on Amazon during 2011. If an Amazon
transaction occurs after the tax law changes and the household resides in one of the 19 affected states, we adjust the post-
implementation transactions by dividing by one plus the local sales tax rate to create the tax-exclusive amount. Control states are
the 31 states that do not change their Amazon tax status during our sample period.

 Table 3. State GDP Growth and Household Income Around Amazon Tax Implementation
This table explores whether states that implemented the Amazon Tax experienced a different GDP growth (Columns (1) and (2))
or a change in household income (Columns (3) and (4)) than states that did not implement the tax. All regressions are ordinary
least squares (OLS) regressions and include time and state fixed effects. The unit of observation in Columns (1) and (2) is the
state- quarter. The regression in Column (1) is weighted by the GDP of the each state. The regression in Column (2) is weighted
by the relative number of households in each state in the sample. The unit of observation in Columns (3) and (4) is the household
month. Column (3) looks at household income after the tax implementation in the treated states. Column (4) looks at the short-
term and long-term changes in household income after the tax implementation in the treated states. Standard errors are clustered
by state and time. Treated State is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for states that implemented an Amazon Tax during
our sample period. I(t ≥ Q) is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for all months after implementation of the Amazon Tax.
I(t = Q-1), I(t = Q0) and I(t ≥ Q+1) are indicator variables for the quarter(s) before, quarter after, and subsequent quarters following
the tax implementation, respectively. t-statistics are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the
1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

       Table 4. Effect of Amazon Tax on Tax-Exclusive Monthly Amazon Expenditures
This table explores the effect of the Amazon Tax on tax-exclusive Amazon expenditures. The unit of observation is the
household month, and the dependent variable is the sum of monthly Amazon transactions per household. Treated State is an
indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for states that implemented an Amazon Tax during our sample period. I(t ≥ Q) is an
indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for all months after implementation of an Amazon Tax. I(t = Q-1), I(t = Q0), and I(t ≥
Q+1) are indicator variables for the quarter(s) before, quarter after, and subsequent quarters following the tax implementation,
respectively. Tax Rate is the household’s sales tax rate. To account for regional differences in cost of living that vary over time,
we introduce a time-varying cost of living index at the city-month level, denoted Cost of Living Index. This index is computed by
calculating the mean expenditures in the categories of gas, restaurants, groceries, and retail (excluding Amazon purchases) for
each city-month. All regressions are ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions and include household and year-month fixed
effects. Standard errors are clustered by state and time. t-statistics are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote statistical
significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

                   Table 5. Effect of Amazon Tax on Different Types of Households
This table explores the effect of the Amazon Tax on different types of households. The unit of observation is the household
month, and the dependent variable is the tax-exclusive sum of monthly Amazon transactions per household. Households are
divided into three groups depending on their monthly income and total Amazon spending in 2011. Treated State is an indicator
variable that takes a value of 1 for states that implemented an Amazon Tax during our sample period. I(t ≥ Q) is an indicator

                    Table 6. Effect of Amazon Tax on Large Amazon Expenditures
This table explores the effect of the Amazon Tax on tax-exclusive large Amazon expenditures. The unit of observation is the
household month, and the dependent variable is the sum of monthly Amazon transactions per household that are at least $250.
Treated State is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for states that implemented an Amazon Tax during our sample period.
I(t ≥ Q) is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for all months after implementation of the Amazon Tax. I(t = Q-1), I(t =
Q0), and I(t ≥ Q+1) are indicator variables for the quarter(s) before, quarter after, and subsequent quarters following the tax
implementation, respectively. Tax Rate is the household’s sales tax rate. To account for regional differences in cost of living that
vary over time, we introduce a time-varying cost of living index at the city-month level, denoted Cost of Living Index This index
is computed by calculating the mean expenditures in the categories of gas, restaurants, groceries, and retail (excluding Amazon
purchases) for each city-month. All regressions are ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions and include household and year-
month fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by state and time. t-statistics are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote

This table explores how elasticity varies with purchase size. The dependent variable in Column (1) is the tax-exclusive sum of
monthly Amazon transactions per household. The dependent variable in Columns (1) through (8) is the sum of tax-exclusive
monthly Amazon transactions for various sized bins. Column (1) corresponds to purchases with tax-exclusive prices of $0.01-
$99.99, Column (2) corresponds to purchases with tax-exclusive prices of $100.00-$199.99, and so on. Treated State is an
indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for states that implemented an Amazon Tax during our sample period. I(t ≥ Q) is an
indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for all months after implementation of the Amazon Tax. To account for regional
differences in cost of living that vary over time, we introduce a time-varying cost of living index at the city-month level, denoted
Cost of Living Index. This index is computed by calculating the mean expenditures in the categories of gas, restaurants, groceries,

The income observed in our data is that which arrives in households’ checking and savings accounts. Therefore, it

retirement contributions, etc.). These omissions will result in a gross income that is higher than what we directly
observe.

coefficients of regressions of Amazon purchase amounts on an indicator of treatment state and post-tax. The dependent variable

A1     Alternative Methods of Identifying City of Residence

       Because the observed reduction in Amazon demand is dependent on the correct

calculation of tax-exclusive Amazon expenditures, it is important that the correct sales tax value

is used. If we use an incorrect sales tax rate, then the inferred tax-exclusive Amazon

expenditures will be incorrect, leading to a potential overstatement (understatement) of the

results in the event that the actual sales tax of the household is lower (higher) than the sales tax

we assign to the household.

       As mentioned in the Section 3, we identify the state of residence of households in our

dataset by requiring that 75% of transactions occur within a given state. We then assign the most

common city as the city of residence of the household.

       In this section, we provide results for two alternative methods of identifying city of

residence, both of which are straightforward. The first method simply takes the second-most

common city where transactions occur and assigns the corresponding tax rate to this household.

If, for example, an individual works in downtown Chicago and frequently gets coffee or lunch,

we will mistakenly assign the city of residence of the household as Chicago, IL, rather than its

actual hometown of Naperville, IL. Because Chicago has a higher sales tax rate than Naperville

(10.25% vs. 7.25% at the time of this writing), this would lead to an overstatement of our results.

       The second method is the most conservative. It takes the minimum sales tax of the first-

and second-most common cities observed. Continuing from the example above, we would

conservatively assume that the household resided in Naperville, IL and assign the more

conservative 7.25% sales tax rate to the household. This lower sales tax rate would lead to a




                                                41
higher value for tax-exclusive Amazon purchases, and would thus reduce the magnitude of our

main results.

       The results from these alternative methods are presented in Table A1. The results are

statistically indistinguishable from those in the Table 4. The main coefficient in Column (1) is –

3.735 and is highly statistically significant, corresponding to an elasticity of –1.3. The coefficient

is larger in magnitude than the coefficient of –3.648 found in Column (1) of Table 4. Similar

results hold in Columns (2) through (3). When we repeat the activity using the second alternative

method, the observed magnitude is –3.617 in Column (4) (corresponding to an elasticity of –1.2),

which is only slightly lower in magnitude than the initial value. Similar results hold for Columns

(5) and (6).

       As a result, it does not appear that misclassification of city of residence is driving the

results. Even when using the most conservative of the three methods, the results are still highly

statistically and economically significant.



A2     Removal of the $200 Amazon Spending Filter in 2011

       As explained in Section 3, we are primarily interested in how Amazon customers respond

after the implementation of the Amazon Tax. As a result, our main results focus on households

that spent at least $200 on Amazon during 2011, prior to any of the tax law changes exploited in

the paper. In this section, we relax this filter and instead include any household that had non-zero

spending on Amazon during 2011. Doing so increases our sample size from 275,437 households

(180,330 of which are in the treatment group) to 460,983 households (301,830 of which are in

the sample group).




                                                 42
        The results hold for this broader group as shown in Table A2. The main coefficient in

Column (1) indicates a $2.67 per month reduction in spending at Amazon and is highly

significant. Note that this sample has lower mean monthly spending on Amazon of $28.78 per

month as opposed to $39.00 in the main body of the paper. This reduction in mean spending is a

natural result of the entry of households who spent less than $200 in 2011 and thus are likely less

frequent Amazon shoppers. When our main coefficient in Table A2 is normalized by the mean

spending, it shows a reduction in spending of 9.3% (–2.67/28.78), which is very close to that

found in the main body of the paper of 9.4%. As a result, the implied elasticities are nearly

equivalent with either method (–1.23 using the whole sample vs. –1.24 using the restricted

sample).



A3      The Effect of Amazon Tax on Amazon Sales (Tax-Inclusive Price)

        In this section, we assess whether households changed their overall expenditure on

Amazon (tax-inclusive price, which includes the effect of sales tax on price). We rerun our

analysis from the previous section but use the tax-inclusive price. This analysis examines

whether households spend less money overall on Amazon when the Amazon Tax is in effect. It

is difficult to predict ex-ante the direction of the results in this analysis because households may

increase their overall expenditure, keep it the same, or even decrease it in the wake of the new

sales tax.

        In Table A3, we replicate Table 4 with tax-inclusive Amazon expenditures as the

dependent variable. The coefficient in Column (1) is –1.21, corresponding to a 3.0% (–

1.21/40.73) reduction in tax-inclusive Amazon expenditures after implementation of the Amazon

Tax. However, this coefficient is only marginally significant. Column (2) confirms a run-up in



                                                43
spending in the quarter prior to treatment but shows no significant change in tax-inclusive

Amazon spending in subsequent quarters. Finally, Column (3) confirms that tax-inclusive

Amazon spending is sensitive to the sales tax rate of the household. Treated households reduce

Amazon spending, inclusive of tax, by $0.21 per month for every 1% increase in sales tax,

corresponding to an elasticity of –0.5.



A4     Alternative Calculation of Elasticity

       In the main body of the text, we estimate elasticity in two straightforward ways. First, we

use our difference-in-difference framework to estimate the change in the level of tax-exclusive

Amazon spending among treated households. We then divide the level change by the mean

Amazon spending of treated households to arrive at the percent reduction in tax-exclusive

spending. We next divide by the sales tax rate to arrive at the elasticity.

       The second way we estimate elasticities is by using the same difference-in-difference

framework to estimate the dollar change in tax-exclusive Amazon spending for a one percentage

point increase in the sales tax. We then normalize by the mean spending to arrive at the

elasticity. For comparison purposes, our main estimations of elasticity shown in Table 4 are

reproduced in Columns (1) and (2) of Table A4.

       An alternative approach is to log the dependent variable and directly observe the

elasticity from the regression coefficient. We do so in Column (3) of Table A4. In this

regression, the dependent variable is the log of (1 + tax-exclusive Amazon spending). The

regression coefficient, and elasticity, is –0.834 and highly statistically significant. However, the

magnitude of the coefficient is smaller than that estimated in the main specifications as

reproduced in Columns (1) and (2).



                                                  44
       Taking into account the results in Table 7 and Figure 3, it is easy to understand why the

estimated elasticity in Column (3) of Table A4 is smaller in magnitude than the elasticity

estimates elsewhere in the paper, as the higher elasticities resulting from the bigger purchases are

muted from the log transformation.



A5     Probability of Amazon Purchases

       In the main body of the text, we estimate the dollar reduction in tax-exclusive Amazon

spending following the introduction of the Amazon Tax. In this section, we explore how the

probability of shopping at Amazon changes after implementation of the Amazon Tax. The results

of our logit specification are found in Table A5. Columns (1) and (2) show that households do

not reduce the likelihood of shopping at Amazon during a given month after implementation of

the Amazon Tax for all purchases and purchases under $250, respectively. Finally, Column (3)

shows that households reduce the likelihood of making purchases over $250. The coefficient of –

0.0023 corresponds to a 16% reduction in the probability of making a purchase of at least $250

after implementation of the Amazon Tax.



A6     Income Effects

       We explore the income effects resulting from implementation of the Amazon Tax. It is

reasonable to assume that those who were the heaviest Amazon spenders would be most

impacted by the implementation of the Amazon Tax. We formally test this assumption in Table

A6.

       We divide households into terciles based on their Amazon spending in 2011, then

perform separate regressions of expenditure on different consumption categories on the main



                                                45
variable of interest: 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑒𝑒ℎ × 𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡 ≥ 𝑄𝑄)ℎ,𝑡𝑡 . The categories of consumption we analyze

constitute a large share of a typical household’s spending: restaurants ($253/month), groceries

($315/month), and entertainment ($35/month).

        Regression results are shown in Columns (1) through (9) of Table A6. We do not find

evidence supporting an income effect from the implementation of the Amazon Tax. It is possible

that the data limitations discussed in Section 5.4 (i.e., the signal to noise ratio being too low) also

apply to the income analysis.

    Table A1. Effect of Amazon Tax on Monthly Amazon Expenditures Using Alternative
              Methods of Identifying City of Residence (Replication of Table 4)
This table explores the effect of the Amazon Tax on Amazon expenditures for any household that shopped at Amazon at any
point in our sample. (The tables in the main body require that the household spent at least $200 at Amazon in 2011.) The unit of
observation is the household month, and the dependent variable is the sum of monthly Amazon transactions per household.
Columns (1) through (3) evaluate tax-exclusive expenditures using the sales tax rate from the second-most common city, as
described in Appendix A1, and Columns (4) through (6) evaluate tax-exclusive expenditures using the minimum sales tax rate of
the first two most-common cities, as described in Appendix A1. Treated State is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for
states that implemented an Amazon Tax during our sample period. I(t ≥ Q) is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for all
months after implementation of the Amazon Tax. I(t = Q-1), I(t = Q0), and I(t ≥ Q+1) are indicator variables for the quarter(s)
before, quarter after, and subsequent quarters following the tax implementation, respectively. Tax Rate is the household’s sales
tax rate. To account for regional differences in cost of living that vary over time, we introduce a time-varying cost of living index
at the city-month level, denoted Cost of Living Index. This index is computed by calculating the mean expenditures in the
categories of gas, restaurants, groceries, and retail (excluding Amazon purchases) for each city-month. All regressions are
ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions and include household and year-month fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by
state and time. t-statistics are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10%
levels, respectively.

     Table A2. Effect of Amazon Tax on Monthly Amazon Expenditures for unrestricted
                              sample (Replication of Table 4)
This table explores the effect of the Amazon Tax on Amazon expenditures for any household who spent any non-zero amount at
Amazon during 2011. The tables in the main body require that the household spent at least $200 at Amazon in 2011. The unit of
observation is the household month, and the dependent variable is the sum of monthly Amazon transactions per household.
Columns (1) through (3) evaluate tax-exclusive expenditures. Treated State is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for
states that implemented an Amazon Tax during our sample period. I(t ≥ Q) is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for all
months after implementation of the Amazon Tax. I(t = Q-1), I(t = Q0), and I(t ≥ Q+1) are indicator variables for the quarter(s)
before, quarter after, and subsequent quarters following the tax implementation, respectively. Tax Rate is the household’s sales
tax rate. To account for regional differences in cost of living that vary over time, we introduce a time-varying cost of living index
at the city-month level, denoted Cost of Living Index. This index is computed by calculating the mean expenditures in the
categories of gas, restaurants, groceries, and retail (excluding Amazon purchases) for each city-month. All regressions are
ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions and include household and year-month fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by
state and time. t-statistics are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10%
levels, respectively.

This table explores an alternative method of estimating the elasticities driven by the Amazon Tax. The unit of observation is the
household month. The dependent variable in Columns (1) and (2) is the tax-exclusive sum of monthly Amazon transactions per
household. The dependent variable in Column (3) is the log of 1 plus the tax-exclusive sum of monthly Amazon transactions.
Treated State is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for states that implemented an Amazon Tax during our sample period.
I(t ≥ Q) is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for all months after implementation of the Amazon Tax. Tax Rate is the
household’s sales tax rate. To account for regional differences in cost of living that vary over time, we introduce a time-varying
cost of living index at the city-month level, denoted Cost of Living Index. This index is computed by calculating the mean
expenditures in the categories of gas, restaurants, groceries, and retail (excluding Amazon purchases) for each city-month. All
regressions are OLS regressions and include household and year-month fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by state and
time. t-statistics are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels,

        Table A5. Effect of the Amazon Tax on the Probability of Amazon Expenditures
This table explores the effect of the Amazon Tax on the probability of Amazon expenditures. The unit of observation is the
household month, and the dependent variable is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 if the household has purchased from
Amazon in a given month. Column (1) explores the probability of any Amazon expenditure. Column (2) explores the probability
of any Amazon expenditure less than $250. Column (3) explores the probability of any Amazon expenditure of at least $250.
Treated State is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for states that implemented an Amazon Tax during our sample period.
I(t ≥ Q) is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for all months after implementation of the Amazon Tax. The regression is a
logit specification, and standard errors are clustered by state and time. t-statistics are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and *
denote statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

                                    Table A6. Income Effects from the Amazon Tax
This table investigates the income effects following implementation of the Amazon Tax by exploring expenditures in the
categories of restaurants, groceries, and entertainment. The unit of observation is the household month, and the dependent
variable is the tax-inclusive expenditures for the given spending category. We include households that spent at least $200 on
Amazon during 2011. Treated State is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for states that implemented an Amazon Tax
during our sample period. I(t ≥ Q) is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for all months after implementation of the
Amazon Tax. Households are divided into three groups depending on their total Amazon spending in 2011. To account for
regional differences in cost of living that vary over time, we introduce a time-varying cost of living index at the city-month level,
denoted Cost of Living Index. This index is computed by calculating the mean expenditures in the categories of gas, restaurants,
groceries, and retail (excluding Amazon purchases) for each city-month. All regressions are ordinary least squares (OLS)
regressions and include household and year-month fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by state and time. t-statistics are
reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.
