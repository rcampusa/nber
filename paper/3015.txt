           RISK NEUTRALITY       AND THE TWO-TIER FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET:

                                            ABSTRACT



Most of the literature on two-tier exchange markets is built around models in which domestic policy

can exert a powerful influence on the spread between the current account exchange rate and the

capital account exchange rate. We show that if optimizing agents are risk neua1, domestic policy

has no significant influence on the spread. Our work with Belgian data suggests that a nsk neuual
specification for Belgian residents acting in the two-tier market is hard to reject, and we also find

evidence that domestic variables do not affect the Belgian spread.

      Many countries have experimented with separate exchange markets for

current account and capital account transactions as a way to deal with

possibly volatile capital flows and to insulate goods-market transactions

from capital-market disturbances.     Such a regime, knowrL as a dual, or two-

tier, exchange market, has been in place in the Belgium-Luxembourg

Economic Union since 1956 and was adopted in modified form by France and

Italy during the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system.     The strategy of

separating exchange market transactions by type of transaction has also

been tried periodically by other developed countries and has been recently

used by several Latin American countries. j/

      There have been many theoretical studies of two-tier markets.     These

range from Fleming's (1971) seminal piece to more recent work that

examines the two-tier market within an explicit utility-maximizing

framework. 2/   Yet there have been practically no rigorous tests of the

theories. 3/

      One reason for the absence of empirical work is the transitional

nature of most two-tier regimes.     Most data sets are either too short for

time-series econometric procedures or agents' beliefs about the

temporariness of the regime build into the data elements that are very

difficult to model either in time series or in cross section.     A second

recently adopted regimes.

(1988).
                                   -2-

reason is that the countries adopting two-tier markets are seldom among

the more sophisticated in data collection.

     Belgium, however, presents neither problem.     It has been operating

its two-tier exchange market for over 30 years and it has a well

developed data base.   To begin checking our theories for consistency with

the data, we start by looking at the Belgian experience.     While Belgium's

long and continuous experience with two-tier exchange rates may also be

contaminated by agents' beliefs in the temporariness of the regime,

particularly after the commitment to create a single European market by

1992, our a priori belief is that the level of such contamination is less

serious in a longer experience than in shorter ones.

     The paper will proceed as follows.     In Section II we develop an

explicit utility-maximizing model of the two-tier market.     In Section III

we use Hansen's (1982) General Method of Moments estimator to explore the

adequacy of a risk neutral utility function for modeling agent's choices

in the Belgian data.   In Section IV we impose theoretical restrictions on

the agent's Euler equation in light of our empirical findings.     After some

simple manipulations of the amended Euler equation, the theory yields a

powerful prediction.   For a small country, the spread should be invariant

with respect to domestic exogenous variables. Many standard explanatory

variables in previous theoretical work, such as Belgian fiscal, monetary

or output variables, should have no impact on the spread.     Section V

compares the model's predictions with the evidence.    We find empirical

support for the proposition that domestic policy and nonpolicy variables

are unimportant in explaining the spread.    Section VI contains some

theoretical extensions and conclusions.

                                            II.   The Model

          Consider a representative agent living in a country that operates a

two-tier exchange market.                 In order to purchase a security denominated in

foreign currency, the agent abstains from consumption today, using the

freed resources to purchase the security at its world price converted to

domestic currency units at the capital account exchange rate.                   After

holding the security for one period, the interest is repatriated at the

current account rate and the principal at the capital account rate.                     Both

of these elements of return enable the agent to augment consumption next

period or in some future period.                  The agents welfare is maximized when

the marginal disutility from foregoing current consumption is equal to the

expected present value of the marginal utility of the future consumption

the agent may enjoy as a result of his asset purchase.

          Let us place the agent in a very simple setting in which              there is a

single composite consumption good and no cross-market foreignexchange

leakages.             In that setting, the representative agent maximizes an

intertemporal utility function subject to a sequence of budget

constraints:

where U(.) is the period utility function, ct is consumption in period t,

p is the subjective discount factor, and        is the mathematical

expectation operator conditional on full information at time t.         In

addition, 8t represents net domestic holdings of foreign currency

denominated bonds at the start of period t      and X and S are respectively

the exchange rates for capital and current account transactions (domestic

currency/foreign currency).      There is no a priori assumption about whether

the current account rate is pegged or not.      Finally, y is domestic output,

P is the domestic price level, and i* is the nominal interest rate on

foreign currency denominated bonds.      The home country is small so that it

takes the foreign interest rate as exogenous.

     In each period the agent purchases an amount of bonds that will

maximize his utility.    The agent's first order condition relating time t

to time t+l is: /

                         {U'(cl)         + i*tst+l]}
    U'(c)     =     PE                                            (1)


                          III.    Specification Tests

     In this section, we conjecture that Belgian agents are risk neutral

and we use Belgian data in an attempt to reject this hypothesis.        Note

that if Belgian residents are risk neutral, the marginal utility of

consumption is constant across time and is known to all agents.         Hence,

the marginal utility terms divide out of each side of equation (1) to

yield, with some rearrangement:




  J There may be other assets in the agent's portfolio, but it would not
alter the form of equation (1).

where ut+l cannot be predicted by using any variable in the agent's

information set at time t under the hypothesis of rational expectations.

Hence the covariance between ut+l and any variable in the time t

information set is zero.               Using equation (3) in equation (2) gives:


                                   1                                       (4)

We shall test how well equation (4) holds for Belgian annual, quarterly,

and monthly data.              Our test is a test of the joint null hypothesis that

agents are risk neutral and form their expectations rationally.

          We estimate equation (4) with Hansen's Generalized Method of Moments

(CMM), an instrumental variable technique that delivers overidentifying

restrictions when the number of instrumental variables exceeds the number

of parameters to be estimated.               The data we use come from the IMF's

International Financial Statistics tape dated September 1988.                   Annual

observations run from 1955 through 1987, quarterly observations go from

1957 through 1988 and monthly observations run from mid-1964 through the
                                         -6-


end of 1987.        The exchange rates (francs per dollar) and interest rates

(percent) are period averages the price level, which is measured by the

Belgian consumer price index,        is constructed using some intertemporal

averaging. .j/       Since the model is not specific about the currency

denomination of the foreign security, we let any "foreign" variables be

proxied by U.S. variables.           Hence the foreign interest rate is

represented by the U.S. T-bill rate.

       We follow convention and generally choose as instrumental variables a

constant and a lagged value of the return variable or components of the

lagged return since values dated t and earlier are not correlated with the

disturbance under the null hypothesis.         Precise instrument sets differ

across regressions and are reported in detail in the tables below.

       Table I shows the results for the Euler equation of the risk neutral

utility function using annual data.        The Euler equation is estimated for

adjacent periods.         In specification (I), a constant, the lagged nominal

return and the lagged price ratio are chosen as instruments.         We find that

the discount factor, p, is precisely and plausibly estimated.         The

estimated value is 0.9986 with a standard error of 0.01130.         The

chi-square statistic that tests the overidentifying restrictions lends

support to the risk-neutral specification.         The test statistic is

x2   (2)   —    3.1786 with a probability that the overidentifying restrictions


  1/       It
          makes little difference to our results if end-of-period data is
substituted for period averages where available. Since end-of-period data
is not available for all series, however, we confine our report to period-
average data.
  2.1  In addition we tried letting the "foreign" country be Germany, the
U.K., or France.   Treating the U.S. as the foreign country was more
favorable to one of our results and did not influence other results.    We
will discuss this issue later.

are not rejected of 0.3243.     Consequently, the risk neutral specification

tested in (1) seems to work well.

     Specification (2) reports results when the lagged percentage change

in real government spending is added as an instrument.       Here the estimated

discount factor is 1.0072 and the x2 (3) statistic is 8.13 with a

probability of nonrejection of 0.105.

     Suspecting that the discussions about 1992 may have altered the

perceptions of Belgian agents about the permanence of the two-tier market,

and hence contaminated some of the later observations, we truncated the

sample, making the year 1982 our last observation.       Specification (3)

reports these results.     The discount factor is once again precisely and

plausibly estimated.     Its value is 0.9983 and its standard error is

00088.    The chi-square statistic for three degrees of freedom is 6.60373,

with the probability that the risk neutral specification is unrejected at

0.1661.

     We then proceeded to test the risk neutral specification using

quarterly data.    The results are reported in Table 2.     Because of the

additional observations obtained by moving from annual to quarterly data

we expanded the instrument set as reported in the table.       The discount

factor is estimated precisely and reasonably.     The estimated value is

0.9971 with a standard error of 00022.      Moreover, the quarterly data does

not lead to rejection of the null hypothesis.     The x2(6) — 8.49887,   with a

probability of nonrejection of 0.1825.

     We also tested the risk neutral specification in equation 4 using

monthly data.     The results are reported in Table 3.    Specification (1)

includes observations for the 1980s whereas specification (2) does not.
                                     -8-

In both runs the discount factor is precisely estimated.         It is also

moderately plausible.     The estimated discount factor should be close to

the inverse of the average real return on holding U.S. assets over the

estimation period, and over the 1964-87 period Belgian residents earned

an cx post average real rate of return of 1.000 (see Chart 1 and

Figure 1).    Neither run using monthly data leads to rejection of the null

hypothesis.    Specification (1) indicates a probability of nonrejection of

0.1477 while specification (2) assigns a probability of 0.1034. /


        IV.   A Theory of the Two-Tter Exchange Under Risk Neutrality

       Since we are unable to reject the hypothesis that Belgian agents are

risk neutral, we make the representative agent's first order condition

consistent with this hypothesis.     We also proceed with three simplifying

assumptions which will be relaxed later:

       (Al)   There are no inter-market foreign exchange leakages.

       (A2)   The two-tier regime is expected to be permanent.

       (A3)   Purchasing power parity (PPP) holds at the current account

rate    implying t     5tP where P* is the foreign price level.       Under

these assumptions, the first order condition in equation (1.) becomes



  1/  While the risk neutral specification works well for Belgian data, a
natural question is how well a nonlinear period utility function can
explain the data.   We examined a popul.ar nonlinear utility function,
constant relative risk aversion.    The results of the investigation are
presented in the Appendix.   Three points about the results are noteworthy.
First, the discount factor in each case is estimated precisely and
reasonably.  Second, the test of the overidentifying restrictions
indicates that the probability of nonrejection of a nonlinear utility
function is between 0.18 and 0.36, so that the nonlinear specification
cannot be rejected.   Third, the a parameter in the utility function is
imprecisely estimated in each case, and its point estimate is outside of
the region that implies a concave utility function.    In our view, then,
the risk neutral specification is the preferred one.

where inverse lag operator L1 is understood to operate on variables but

not on the information set dating on the expectation operator.      We then

use (A3) again and invert (I   -   Lp)   as in Sargent (1979) to obtain a

measure of the spread (actually one plus the spread) between the capital

account exchange rate and the current account exchange rate:



                                                                  (6)




We observe that the spread depends only on foreign variables and not on

any domestic variables.    Moreover, this proposition is invariant to fixing

or floating the current account rate.

     According to equation (I) and (Al)-(A3), domestic variables affect

the spread through their influence on the expected product of

U'(ct+l)/U'(ct), the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution in

consumption, and the return to domestic agents from holding foreign

currency denominated securities.     When we assume that agents are risk

neutral, we make the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution a

policy-invariant constant (unity) and remove the predictions of systematic

correlations between the domestic policy variables and the spread.      The

theoretical work to date on two-tier markets brings domestic policy

variables to bear on the spread implicitly by influencing the above

correlation.

       The analysis is even more stark--and more clear--when we assume in

addition that agents in the rest of the world are risk neutral as well.

Suppose foreign agents solve

                                                                               t+j -1
                                                                                        ;

Assuming that these foreign agents are risk neutral, the familiar first

order condition at time t may be rearranged as:


               (1    -       L1p*)       p*E(1*/P*1)                                             (7)


Now divide equation (5) by equation (7) and rearrange to obtain:



               -     (1       -   p*)p
                                                                                                 (8)
               —     (1      -    p)p*
•      St


       Equation (8) reveals the two-tier market at its most basic level.

The spread acts as a wedge, filling any taste-determined zap between the

domestic and foreign discount rates.                        If these discount rates are time

invariant, then so is the spread.                      If these discount rates are identical,

then the two exchange rates will be identical also.                                     Note that a narrow

spread between the two exchange rates need not imply that the authorities

have been unsuccessful in partitioning the foreign exchange market.

Contrary to popular belief, a narrow spread can persist even when there

are no leakages across markets.                    Note also that a small difference tn
                                      -   11   -




rates    of time preference across countries can generate large spreads.      For

example, if p — 0.95 and       =   0.9 then X/S — 2.111.

        Before examining how well the model predicts the determinants of the

spread, it would be useful to address the appropriateness of the three

assumptions (Al)-(A3).

        Predictions were derived assuming no cross-market foreign exchange

leakages (Al).     In practice, however, some purchases and sales of foreign

bonds may be conducted using the current account exchange rate and some

repatriation of interest income may be made using the capital account

rate.     Such leakages may be officially sanctioned or fraudulently

undertaken.     We tried to estimate a modified Euler equation with leakages

parameterized linearly (i.e., only some fraction of the flow goes through

the appropriate exchange market).         Unfortunately, we were unable to find

precise and plausible estimates for the leakage parameters and so decided

to abandon the strategy.     Leakages can provide an alternative explanation

for a narrow spread.     It may well be the case that intermarket leakages

are so fast and so strong that any spreads that do develop are usually

corrected by the end of the month.         However, the data is not sampled

finely enough to test this alternative explanation. 1/

        The predictions were also generated assuming that agents expect the

two-tier exchange market to be permanent (A2).         Since the Belgian two-tier

market has been in operation for over 30 years, this assumption seems

plausible.     However, there is no easy way to test whether such an

finely than monthly is that goods prices, which enter the Euler equation,
are only sampled monthly.

assumption is warranted.     In Section VI, we investigate theoretically the

implications for the spread when agents believe that the two-tier market

is temporary.

     Finally, the predictions about the spread were generated by invoking

purchasing power parity (A3).     We decided to introduce PPP into the

estimates of the Euler equation to check how well this assumption held up

for Belgian data.     Table 4 reports the results.     Unless otherwise

indicated, the U.S. consumer price index was used for the foreign price

variable.

     Specification (1) in Table 4 reports the results using annual data.

The discount factor is precisely and plausibly estimated, with p          0.9890

and the standard error at 0.0076.       The chi-square statistic for three

degrees of freedom is 5.8407, indicating the probability of not rejecting

the null is 0.20241.     When the sample is truncated somewhat

(specification (2)) ,   the results are even better.    The discount factor is

still precisely and plausibly estimated and the probability of

nonrejection rises to 0.30721.     We conclude that the PPP assumption is not

unreasonable for the annual data.

     Next we investigated the realism of the PPP assumption using

quarterly data.     Specifications (3)-(ll) report the results.    The PPP

assumption turns out to be quite unrealistic when the sample period runs

through 1988 IV.    Specification (3) shows that the discount factor is

precisely and plausibly estimated, but a x2() of 19.9990 indicates only

a 0.0043 probability that the null cannot be rejected.       Believing that PPP

may have been more reasonable over the Bretton Woods period of fixed

exchange rates, we chose to cut the sample off at 1971 IV.        Our prior-was
                                      -   13   -




confirmed.      Specification (4) shows that the chi square statistic is now

much lower.      The probability of nonrejection has increased to 0.2155.

Specifications (5)-(l0) show what happens when the sample period is

extended beyond the Bretton Woods era.             The chi square statistic increases

and the probability of nonrejection declines.

     To make sure that the rising chi-squares were due to the breakdown of

PPP and not to increased sample size, the Euler equation was reestimated

with more recent observations but a sample size no different from that in

specification (4)      which was based on observations during the Bretton

Woods era.      In specification (11) the chi square statistic again jumps up

to x2(5)        12.65809 and the probability of nonrejection falls to 0.0540.

We conclude that the quarterly data does not support the assumption of PPP

over the entire observation period.

     Finally we reestimated the Euler equation under the assumption of PPP

using monthly data.      Much to our surprise, we could not reject the null.

In specification (12)       the chi square statistic for five degrees of

freedom was 9.19642.       The probability of nonrejection was 0.1373.

     Since we are not entirely comfortable with the FF1' assumption, we

decided to pursue a different route.           Suppose that instead of a single

composite consumption good there are many categories of goods.             If we

assume that the period utility function is additively separable in these

categories, then the agent's problem becomes:

Now if the marginal utility of consuming an additional unit of category 1

goods is constant (risk neutrality) and if commodity arbitrage holds for

category 1 goods, so that P =                                          then equation (9) can be

manipulated into yielding an expression for the spread that is identical

to equation (6) except that now the foreign price term is the foreign

price of category 1 goods.                         Again we find that the spread should depend

only on foreign variables.


                                                   V.   The Evidence

        In this section we investigate empirically whether the model captures

characteristics of the Belgian spread.                                     Recall the model's basic

prediction:                 the spread will be influenced only by foreign factors.

        We examine the determinants of the Belgian spread by regressing the

spread on a set of commonly suggested Belgian policy and nonpolicy

variables as well as on the foreign variables suggested by our model.                                   The

regression is based on quarterly data since some variables are not
                                        -   15    -




available   on a more frequent basis.            The estimation period runs from

1963 I   to 1988 I.    Before estimating, we made stationary transformations

of the explanatory variables by putting them in one-plus-growth-rate form.

The idea was to have relatively stationary processes explaining a

relatively stationary spread.        Table 5 reports the results.

     Specification ()       in   Table S shows the regression of the spread on a

constant, one plus the growth rate of real Belgian government spending,

one plus the growth rate of real Belgian output, the U.S. interest rate,

one pl.us the U.S.    inflation    rate, and one plus the rate of growth of the

Belgian money supply.      The regression gives support to the model.            None

of the Belgian variables is significant, whereas the U.S. interest rate

is significant and has the expected sign.              An increase in the U.S.

interest rate leads to an increase in the spread. 1/

     Since we were concerned that the regression might be capturing a few

big changes in the U.S. interest rate in the 1980s, we decided to rerun

the regression with observations running only to 1972 I.              Equation (2)

indicates that the U.S. interest rate is still a significant explanatory

variable.

     Several aspects of the regressions deserve additional comment.

First, the U.S. interest rate and U.S. price term are added separately

since there is no reason to believe that they are driven by the same time-

series process.       Second, we settled on using the U.S. whol.esale price




  j/ The U.S. was chosen as the foreign country because the U.S. T-bill
rate was significant and had the expected sign in the Table S regressions.
As mentioned earlier, we also tried German, U.K. , and French variables in
place of the U.S. variables but we found no significant effects of these
variables on the spread.

index in the regressions instead of a U.S. price for a more finely
disaggregated category of traded goods since the IFS tape does not provide

the latter and our belief was that commodity arbitrage might hold up

better for the WPI than for the GPI.         Perhaps the U.S. price term might

have been significant had we used a better proxy.        Third, Belgian

industrial production rather than Belgian CNP was used as an explanatory

variable since quarterly GNP figures were not available on the IFS tape.

Finally, Belgian money rather than Belgian domestic credit was used as an

independent variable because there is reason to think that domestic credit

was not an exogenous variable during the sample period.         The Belgian

monetary authority may have been sterilizing reserve movements during the

sample period.

Inter-Market Leakages

       It is widely acknowledged that it is virtually impossible to maintain

complete separation of the two exchange markets depending on the source or

use of the foreign exchange.    Nevertheless, because of analytical

complexities, the number of studies that incorporate leakages has been

quite small. j/    The purpose of this extension is to investigate the

effects of intermarket leakages on the simplicity of our results.

       With leakages, the agent's budget constraint needs to be modified to:

                                                                  t+l


We retain the condition t —                                                       Equation (10) is now a first order

nonlinear stochastic difference equation in Xt/St, with only foreign

variables forcing the equilibrium.                                                (Unless A — 0, an explicit solution

requires solving a stochastic nonlinear difference equation, which we

avoid.)             Therefore, for constant 6, A, and a the ratio Xt/St will depend

only on foreign variables but possibly in a complicated way.

       Next assume that the leakage parameters depend only on the spread.

The basic point remains.                                         Domestic variables do not affect the spread.                 OE

course, domestic variables could matter if they somehow influence the rate
                                        -   18   -




of    leakage.     Our point is not to prove that domestic variables cannot

matter.        Rather it is to see how much of a two-tier market theory we can

build without attaching importance to domestic variables.

           The leakages we have considered seem broad enough to encompass most

two-tier regimes in practice.         For example, a regime in which all interest

income is repatriated through the capital account is obtained by setting

9 =    A    — a — 1.   This particular regime is of interest because it is often

analyzed jJ and because either it must leak or it must be temporary.                   The

logic of this claim is straightforward.                If such a regime were without

leaks and agents believed it to be a permanent arrangement, then the

agents would realize that they would never be allowed to consume the

interest earning on their foreign assets.               The agents would not pay a

positive amount for assets with a zero return and they would not price

capital account foreign exchange.

Regime Temporariness

           All exchange rate regimes, indeed all government policies, are

expected by agents living under the regime to be abandoned some day when

circumstances dictate that government attention be otherwise directed.

Let us suppose that agents living under a two-tier market anticipate the

possible future demise of the regime.                Suppose further, for concreteness,

that they anticipate that if the two-tier regime is abandoned the

government will adopt a uniform float.                The expected return to holding

foreign-denominated assets becomes a probability-weighted average of the

two-tier market expected return and the uniform float expected return.



     / See Dornbusch (1986) and Frenkel and Razin (1986).
                                    -   19   -




The important point is that the return now contains the time-varying

probability of regime demise.    This probability can depend on any domestic

or foreign aspects of the state.        Only if the probability of a regime

switch does not depend on the domestic state will domestic variables be

unimportant in explaining the spread.            Treating seriously the transitory

nature of two-tier regimes established in the l9BOs will require taking a

stand on the determinants of such probabilities.

Concluding Remarks

     Most of the two-tier market literature is built around models in

which domestic policy can exert a powerful influence on the spread between

the current account exchange rate and the capital account exchange rate.

However, if optimizing agents are risk neutral (or if government policy

does not much influence the consumption stream) , domestic policy has no

significant influence on the spread.         Our work with Belgian data suggests

that a risk neutral specification for Belgian residents acting in the two-

tier market is hard to reject.     We further find some supporting evidence

for risk neutrality when we examine the implication of risk neutrality,

namely that domestic variables should not influence the spread.

     We are aware of the assertion (Cros (19BB)) that realignments of the

Belgian current account franc within the European Monetary System have had

an impact on the Belgian spread.        An alternative explanation, consistent

with our work, is that these realignments were correlated with changes in

the 11.5. interest rate, and it was really the latter that influenced the

spread.

     We also offer a word of caution.            The Belgian experience does not

necessarily carry over to other countries, particularly developing
                                   -   20   -




countries,   thst impose two-tier exchsnge msrkets.   We hsve no evidence on

the appropriate utility function for agents operating in these countries.

Moreover, factors such as regime temporariness, the inflation tax and

controlled access to one or both foreign exchange markets may be important

in explaining the spread in these other two-tier exchange markets.

     Notes:   Numbers in parentheses are T-statistics.
              The price ratio in the regression is the inverse of the price ratio in
              the euler equation, so we would expect a negative coefficient in the
              regression.
              Both regressions have been corrected for first order seriel
              correlation.
