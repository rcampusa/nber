Measuring the Impact of Health Insurance on Levels and Trends in Inequality

                                              ABSTRACT

A substantial part of the inequality literature in the United States has focused on yearly levels and
trends in income and its distribution over time. Recent findings in that literature show that median
income appears to be stagnating with income growth primarily coming at higher income levels. But
the value of health insurance is an important and growing source of economic well being for American
households that is missed by focusing solely on income. In this paper we take estimates of the value
of different types of health insurance received by households and add them to usual pre tax post transfer
measures of income from the Current Population Survey's March Annual Demographic Supplement
for income years 1995-2008 to investigate their impact on levels and trends in measured inequality.
We show that ignoring the value of health insurance coverage will substantially understate the level
of economic well being of Americans and its upward trend and overstate the level of inequality and
its upward trend. As an application of our fuller measure of income, we consider how two provisions
of current health reform proposals to expand health insurance affect the level and distribution of economic
well being.

Introduction

       The most commonly used data set to capture yearly levels and trends in United States

income and its distribution is the public use version of the March Current Population Survey

(CPS). Each year the Census Bureau reports (U.S. Census Bureau, various years) the previous

year’s median household pre-tax cash income (from both public and private sources) and how

this household size-adjusted pre tax post cash transfer income is distributed across all people in

the United States. Most researchers outside of the Census Bureau who use the CPS also focused

on this cash income measure of income. (See: Atkinson and Brandolini 2001, and Gottschalk

and Smeeding 1997, for reviews of this literature.) With few exceptions these studies have not

considered the importance of non-wage compensation on such measures of economic well being.

       A parallel literature has also used the CPS to measure levels and trends in wages and

wage earnings inequality. (See Acemoglu 2003, and Gottschalk and Smeeding 1997, for reviews

of this literature.) But the earnings inequality literature, because it has focused primarily on

returns to different types of workers in the marketplace—that is, to the level of compensation and

its spread for different skill levels or occupations or demographic groups—has compared these

differences looking solely at individual earnings and has not been concerned with the earnings of

others in that individual’s household. Unlike the income inequality literature, a small but

important literature has developed within this wage earnings inequality literature that has

recognized that focusing solely on wage compensation will not only underestimate the

compensation paid to individuals but also affect its trends and distribution over time. (See for

example, Pierce 2001, 2007.)

       Here we bring the insights gained in the earnings inequality literature to the income

inequality literature by focusing on the single most important component of voluntary non wage



                                                  2
compensation—employers’ contributions to health insurance—which accounts for 32 percent of

voluntary non-wage compensation and 22 percent of all non-wage compensation (Pierce, 2001)

and like other types of compensation of value to a family or household can be assumed to be

“directly” consumed in any given year.

       To be consistent in our efforts to show the importance of health insurance on household

resources, we consider both the importance of employer provided health insurance and the value

of government provided health insurance via Medicare and Medicaid on measured levels of

household income and its distribution over time.

       We do so by:

1. Estimating a broader measure of household income that adds employer health insurance

contributions to the traditional measure of household economic well being (pre tax post transfer

in-cash size-adjusted household income). Importantly, we use the ex ante cost of this insurance

to employers as our measure of value to the household, not the health care payments made ex

post to households that used insured health services.

2. Showing the sensitivity of traditional measures of the level and distribution of income to the

addition of the “equivalent income value” of non-wage compensation. Our focus throughout

(except in Figure 1 and Appendix Table 1) is on size-adjusted household income of individuals.

We examine the U.S. population in its entirety, as well as subgroups based on age. In order to

examine how the addition of health insurance changes trends in inequality by age, we split the

population into four age categories: individuals aged 0-17 (children), those aged 18 to 24 (young

adults), those aged 25-61 (working age), and those aged 62 and over (retirement age).

Americans to the addition of the “equivalent income value” of ex ante health insurance transfers

from government (Medicaid and Medicare).

4. Examining how inequality in economic well being (pre tax post transfer size-adjusted

household income of individuals) has changed over the period 1995-2008 based on this broader

measure (including employer contributions to health insurance as well as ex ante health

insurance transfers from government).

5. Using our measure to consider the impact of key provisions of proposed health care reform

legislation—the expansion in Medicaid provision to those with incomes below 133 percent of the

poverty line and publicly funded subsidies to low income families for purchasing private

coverage—on the level and distribution of income.



Related Studies

       Several papers have recognized the importance of including fringe benefits in measures

of work compensation. Pierce (2001, 2007) used the Employment Cost Index (ECI) data to

consider how levels and trends in the compensation of labor change when employer

contributions to fringe benefits (including health insurance) are included. Chung (2003) extends

this insight by merging data from the ECI into the CPS. Levy (2006) shows the sensitivity of

measured wage differentials by gender and race to the inclusion of health insurance—gender

wage differentials shrink, but the race wage gap is not changed substantially. Each of these

papers focuses on employer compensation to individual workers and hence does not show how

including such compensation to earnings impacts the overall income distribution. Because

workers live and share their wages with those living with them (e.g. family or household



                                                 4
members), to show how the inclusion of non-wage compensation affects the overall income

distribution, it is necessary to determine the composition of these larger sharing unit and then

gauge how employer or government provided health insurance impacts on them.

       While few researchers have included the value of either employer health insurance or

Medicare or Medicaid in their measures of income, the Census Bureau has estimated these

values for individuals for use in their estimates of alternative measures of U.S. poverty rates and

these values have been made available in the public use CPS since 1995. (U.S. Census Bureau

various years) While the Census Bureau estimates the ex ante insurance value of employer health

insurance they measure the “fungible” insurance value of Medicare and Medicaid. Unlike the

case for employer provided health insurance, they only count part of the ex ante insurance value

of Medicare and Medicaid for low income families.

       Burtless and Svaton (2009a) offer yet another alternative measure of the value of health

insurance to families. They measure the ex post cost of the health care actually used by

households in a given year rather than the ex ante value of health insurance provided to

households in a given year. Most recently Burtless and Svaton (2009b) use both Census Bureau

estimates to measure the ex ante insurance value of employer health insurance and the fungible

insurance value of Medicare and Medicaid and their ex post cost of health care consumed by

households to measures levels and trends in income and consumption.

       Our measure attempts to capture the costs to employers of providing health insurance to

their workers and their households as well as the federal and state government costs of providing

Medicare and Medicaid to qualified beneficiaries. This measure is more in keeping with the

concept of these programs as insurance against health related expenses. We assign this ex ante

value to all those covered in a given year rather than, for instance, assigning a zero value to



                                                  5
individuals who are covered by employer or government provided health insurance but who ex

post do not receive any health care in that year. Or a zero value to low income households who

are provided with health insurance via Medicare or Medicaid.

           There are several analyses of potential impacts of specific health care reform proposals

(Affordable Health Care for America Act (H.R. 3962) and the Patient Protection and Affordable

Care Act (H.R. 3590), although none has considered how reform may affect the distribution of a

fuller measure of income. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated over a 10 year

horizon the number of Americans likely to be covered by specific bills, and well as the cost of

the provisions. They are estimated to bring coverage to between 92 percent to 94% of all non-

elderly (CBO 2009a, CBO 2009b) through a combination of carrots and sticks. The CBO has not

yet issued an estimate from the Obama administration’s health care proposal.1



Method and Data

           The most commonly used data set for measuring levels and trends in income and its

distribution in the United States is the public use Current Population Survey (CPS). This is the

data set we use here. With it we are not only able to measure the pre tax post in-cash transfer

size-adjusted household income of all Americans but we are also able to determine the type of

employer and government provided health insurance coverage they have. (See Burkhauser and

Simon 2007, for a fuller discussion of the issues related to using the CPS for this purpose.)

However for confidentiality reasons these income data have been top coded over time and if

these inconsistently applied top codes are not accounted for, one will confuse an improvement in

the measure of income with a real increase in income, especially at the top of the distribution.

Larrimore et al. (2008) have developed methods to provide public users with instructions and

                                                    6
additional data needed to correctly account for top coding in the public use CPS. Their work

produced a consistent set of cell means for all topcodes in the public use CPS that when used

with existing public use CPS data provide a comparable data series from 1967 to the present. We

use these cell means in our analysis.

       While the CPS data provide information on health insurance coverage, we must impute

the ex ante value of employer contributions to health insurance and the value of public health

insurance from outside sources. After doing so we merge these values to the CPS data using a set

of characteristics that are in both data sets. The value of employer contributions for health

insurance comes from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Insurance Component (MEPSIC).

This survey is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau and funded by the Agency for Healthcare

Research and Quality (AHRQ). It has been conducted every year since 1996, and the most recent

data available include 2008. These data sets are confidential Census Bureau micro data which

involve lengthy periods of applications for use. Fortunately, the cell means are released publicly,

and are available currently for 1996-2008. This includes the employer contribution for single and

family plans, by state, by year and by firm size.2

       We assign values to these non-cash benefits which are equal to the private costs paid by

employers (this explicitly values non-wage compensation at its market price not the value that

individuals would pay for it.) We then consider the impact of including public sector provision of

non-cash transfers in the form of health insurance through Medicaid and Medicare for a more

complete picture. For the analysis adding Medicaid or Medicare to household income, we value

it at the average administrative cost reported per person. Data Appendix A explains how we

created our health insurance values database. Note however we consistently value Medicare and

                                                 7
Medicaid at its insurance value not its fungible insurance value. Data Appendix B explains how

we created our underlying CPS database. In the appendix we report insurance prevalence rates

(for example the fraction of individuals in the US with their own employer provided health

insurance). Our estimates are identical to those released by the Census Bureau, as we have used

the same algorithm that they do (see Appendix B). Studies of income inequality usually focus on

the entire age distribution, so in our main analysis we will also do so. But since most of the

impact of the inclusion of employer provided non-wage compensation and the value of non-cash

transfers to the poor via Medicaid affect the working age population and their children while

Medicare mostly affects the older population, we will separately show the effect of their

inclusion in household income on children, young adults, the working and older age populations.

That is, we will look at the household size-adjusted income of working-age people separately

from the household size-adjusted income of older persons, and so on.

       To illustrate the usefulness of our method, we draw on the current debate in Congress on

health care reform. Our intention is not to provide a comprehensive forecast of the impact of

specific bills or to recommend a particular policy, but to show the practical relevance of using

the broader measure of income developed here to current policy debates. There are 46.3 million

uninsured Americans in 2008, according to the latest Census Bureau estimates (US Census

Bureau, 2009). But because Census Bureau measures of pre tax post transfer cash income do not

include the value of health insurance this absence of health insurance coverage is not recognized

in their measure of economic well being; it is also not useful for evaluating efforts to improve

health care coverage. Hence while the health care reform legislation currently being considered

in Congress is expected to reduce the number of uninsured by almost 30 million (CBO, 2009a,b),

changes in economic well being cannot be picked up by a traditional income measure..



                                                 8
         While many studies have modeled the coverage impacts of various reform bills, we know

of no other estimates of how these provisions would affect distributional outcomes using broader

measures of well being. Here we will use our measure to show how two key provisions of the

bills—the expansion of Medicaid to those with incomes below 133 percent of the poverty line

and the provision of publicly funded subsidies for health insurance purchasing to those uninsured

between 133 and 400 percent of the poverty line. We make no assumptions here about the

sources of revenue for the expansions; a more complete analysis beyond the scope of this paper

would also consider the distributional consequences of different financing methods.

         We first identify individuals who are currently uninsured, but who would be covered by

the Medicaid expansions (in families with incomes under 133 percent of the FPL.) assuming a

take-up rate of 70 percent.34 We assign the average value of current Medicaid services to these

individuals as is done in the baseline model. Note that this also assumes no behavioral changes

(such as moves away from jobs with health insurance to accept Medicaid coverage, which could

thus lead to higher wages). We also do not model the extent to which individuals with private

coverage who are under the new Medicaid threshold may take-up public coverage instead. To

model the effects of the subsidies for coverage, we first identify families whose incomes are

under 400 but above 133 percent of the poverty line. In these families, we identify individuals

who are uninsured, and add to them the statutory subsidy amounts assuming 70 percent take-up

rates (with calculations also performed under a 50 percent take-up rate). In terms of the

categories we follow, we add these subsidy amounts to the public insurance category. We use the


3
  Past studies of take-up of public insurance by the uninsured (from prior Medicaid expansions for children) place
the range at 50 to 70 percent (Remler and Glied, 2003). We use a 70 percent value because unlike past expansions,
future reforms are likely to be accompanied by fines for being uninsured, but we also redo our calculations using a
50 percent take-up rate.

  Note that up til now, our analysis has referred to households, not families. We will continue to conduct our analysis
at the level of the household to follow the inequality literature, but we note that the health reform proposals refer to
family income relative to the federal poverty level when defining subsidies.

Results

         Each year the Census Bureau publishes median household income figures for the

previous year based on the March CPS data. (U.S. Census Bureau 2008). Figure 1 reproduces

these values for income years 1995-2008 below.6 Note that median income grew during the

growth years of the 1990s, hitting a peak in 2000 and then falling to a 2004 low before once

again rising through 2007. Note however that by 2007, median pre tax post in-cash transfer

income had not returned to its 2000 business cycle peak high. When we redo these calculations

but include our estimated health insurance values, not surprisingly, median income is higher in

all years. More surprisingly, because these contributions were rising in value over this period

they offset to some degree the fall in earnings. While past studies have shown that the prevalence

of any health insurance (and employer health insurance in particular) has been falling over these

years, Figure 1 and Appendix Table 1 shows that for the median American household income,

inclusive of health insurance, has been rising and rising sufficiently so that in 2008 median

  http://healthreform.kff.org/SubsidyCalculator.aspx allows one to choose the President's plan, House or Senate
versions, then enter the age and income of the person. We used the subsidy amounts for a single person, with no
employer coverage available, within a medium cost area. Although there are some exceptions, in general those with
existing employer coverage would not qualify for the subsidies. Since the subsidy calculator shows amounts that are
for people of ages 20,30,40,50 and 60 years, we grouped those up to age 24 into the first category, 25-34 into the
second, 35-44 into the third, 45-54 into the fourth, and 55-64 years into the fifth category. These are meant to be
illustrative numbers, rather than precise estimates of what any proposal would do. Please see the web link provided
for additional details about the assumptions made in the calculator. Since these numbers are in 2009 terms, we adjust
them to 2008 terms using the July 2008 to July 2009 CPI.

   We are unable to exactly match reported CPS figures (http://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/p60-235.pdf). We
suspect that the difference may occur because we report the median value while the Census Bureau uses a linear
interpolation procedure for calculating median incomes to account for clustering of responses at round-numbers.


                                                         10
household income, inclusive of health insurance, was greater than was the case in 2000. (See

Appendix Table 1 for all values reported in this figure.)

         Figure 1 shows how the inclusion of the value of health insurance impacts the average

American household. In the next series of tables we show how health insurance impacts

individual Americans across the size-adjusted household income distribution.7 Table 1 reports

how income was distributed across all Americans in 2008 by assigning them to deciles based on

their pre tax post in-cash transfer size-adjusted household income. The last row then reports

values for all Americans. As can be seen in column 1 mean income varies from a highest decile

$136,103 to a lowest decile mean income value of $5,637. The mean income for the entire

population is $44,616. In the next four columns we show the mean value of employer provided

health insurance, Medicaid, Medicare and their sums respectively by decile. The last two

columns show the mean value of income plus health insurance and the share of the total coming

from health insurance respectively. While health insurance makes up only 9.93 percent of all

household size-adjusted income in the United States, it is by far a more important share of the

income of the lower deciles of the distribution.

         To provide some sense of how income has grown across the income distribution in the

United States over time and how much including the value of health insurance matters in such

calculation, Table 2a first reports how income was distributed across all Americans in the first

year of our data 1995 (column 1) and repeats those values for 2008 (column 2), the most recent

year of our data. Like Table 1 this is done by assigning them to deciles based on their pre tax

post in-cash transfer size-adjusted household income and in the last row reporting the mean for


7
  In Figure 1 and Appendix Table 1, the observation is a household, and all CPS households are included. In the
remainder of the Tables, the observation is an individual in a household (excluding those living in group quarters
and those households containing members of the armed forces), and the income measure used is household size
adjusted income.

                                                         11
all Americans. Column 3 then shows how much mean income has grown by decile. This

traditional measure of decile growth shows relatively even increases in income growth across all

deciles except for the lowest decile which lagged behind the others. The next three columns

repeat this exercise but for income plus the value of health insurance. The results are quite

different. This fuller measure of income clearly shows the bottom three deciles grew faster than

the rest of the distribution. The final two columns show that as a result of major increases in the

value of employer and government provided health insurance, which has been relatively equally

distributed across the population, health insurance has grown dramatically as part of the portfolio

of incomes held by the bottom deciles of the income distribution. When properly measured Table

2a shows that the increasing value of their health insurance is the reason for their relative

improvement in economic well being relative to the rest of the population. Table 2b shows the

percentile ratios for the changes show in Table 2a.

       In Table 3 we focus on the importance of including the value of health insurance income

in measures of change in economic well being across the distribution by once again showing the

percentage change in income and total income (including the value of health insurance) across

deciles for the entire population but then showing these increases by age group. In all four age

groups including the value of health insurance increases overall growth (see the row of means).

And the same, with one exception, is true within each decile. In general growth in Total Income

is more equalizing than growth in Income. But this is especially the case for those aged 25-61

and those aged 62 and over.

       Table 4 reports changes in the share of health insurance in the portfolio of incomes by

decile and likewise reports the larger levels and share growth among the lowest deciles in all age

groups. Growth in the share of health insurance was greatest among those aged 62 and older.



                                                 12
       The previous four tables focused on the level of income and its change over the 14 years

of our data as a first measure of income inequality and its change over time and how much the

inclusion of the value of health insurance makes to these measures. In Table 5 we focus on the

most often used measure of inequality in the income distribution literature—a Gini coefficient. In

tables available from the authors, we have also examined these separately by four age groups.

       While the earnings literature almost always uses 90/10 ratios to measure levels and trends

in inequality, recent work by Burkhauser, Feng, and Jenkins (2009) argues that once problems

associated with topcoding are corrected, it is possible to use Gini coefficients or other scalar

measures of the entire distribution to consistently measure income inequality levels and trends

and this is what we do here. See Larrimore et al. (2008) for a discussion of the cell mean series

we use to overcome topcoding problems in the CPS. In tables available from the authors, we

look at four additional measures of inequality and the impact of including health insurance on

outcomes: the ratio of the 90th percentile value to the 10th percentile value (the 90/10 ratio), the

90/50 ratio, the 50/10 ratio, and the 75/25 ratio.

       The first column of Table 5 reports Gini coefficients for pre tax post in-cash transfer size

adjusted income for all Americans from 1995 to 2008. Income inequality increased modestly

over this period hitting a period high in 2006 before falling slightly in 2007 and rising again in

2008. Column 2 shows that the addition of employer health insurance decreases inequality in all

years. This matches our findings in column 2 of Table 1 which show that employers’ costs of

health insurance is much more equally distributed across household income deciles than the rest

of household income. It is harder to discern the importance of employer health insurance on the

trend in income inequality. Column 3 shows how the addition of Medicaid insurance alone

without including employer health insurance also decreases inequality in all years. The size of



                                                     13
this decrease is about the same as that found when adding employer health insurance. Column 4

shows how the addition of Medicare insurance decreases inequality in all years. The size of this

decrease is larger than was the case for either Medicaid or employer health insurance, in all years.

The final column reports the full effect of employer and government provision of health

insurance on income inequality.

       When health insurance from all three of these sources is included, this fuller measure of

income inequality rises slightly over the years 1995-2006 but then falls over the next two years.

Thus, by 2007 income inequality is slightly below its 1995 in 2007 and slightly above the 1995

level in 2008. To more precisely measure trends in income inequality over this period rather

than use casual inspection, we run a regression that tests whether there is a difference in slopes

between the Gini series without health insurance vs. the series with health insurance.



[1]Gini=f(time, allHI, time*allHI)



where ‘time’ stands for a linear time variable in years since 1994, and “allHI” is a dummy

variable that equals one for the series with health insurance added, while the omitted is the series

without health insurance added. The coefficient on "allHI" shows whether the series with health

insurance added had lower or higher inequality than the series without health insurance added,

on average across all years. The coefficient on time shows whether the Gini increases or

decreases with time overall. The coefficient on “time*allHI” shows whether there is a differential

time trend for the series with health insurance vs. the series without health insurance.

       The results from the regression (reported in this paragraph rather than in a separate table)

are consistent with the findings discussed in Table 5. There is a small but statistically significant

positive trend (0.0008) in income inequality over the period 1995-2008 when health insurance is

not considered. But when health insurance is considered, the level of income inequality over the

entire period is lower by a small but statistically significant amount (-0.0227). Furthermore, the

inclusion of health insurance almost entirely oversets the rise income inequality (-0.0008).

          To examine potential impacts of a future Medicaid expansion and income based subsidies,

Table 7 repeats the relevant categories in Table 1, except with Medicaid coverage and the

separate public subsidies randomly assigned to 70 percent of those non-elderly who would be

eligible were the policies implemented in 2008. We repeat this exercise in Appendix Table 6

assuming a 50 percent take-up rate to show the sensitivity of our results. Using this lower take-

up rate reduces the impact’s magnitude but the qualitative story is similar.

           By comparing the results in Table 7 to those in Table 1, we see that the proposed

expansionary health insurance policies would increase the full income measure of a household in

the lowest decile by $797 from $9,597 to $10,173, a change of 8.3 percent.8 Total Income

increases by $787, or 4.3 percent in the second decile. It comes to 3% ($735) for those in the 4th

decile, and falls under 1 percent by the 5th decile ($447). In the top two rows of Table 5 we

show the impact of the two proposed policies on overall income inequality using comparable

categories. The reforms would reduce our Gini values by about 1 percent under the 70 percent

take-up assumption, from .398 to .394.



Discussion and Conclusion

           Because health insurance in most industrialized countries is universally provided by

government, measures of inequality in those countries can focus on wage or income inequality

without greatly distorting trends in their actual level or distribution of economic well being. But
8
    If we were to use a 50 percent take-up rate, the change for the 1st decile would be 6% instead of 8.3%.

                                                           15
in the United States, where health insurance is the most important component of non-wage

compensation but is unequally distributed across employers and where government provided

health insurance makes up a major and growing component of our social safety net, measures of

inequality that focus on cash wages or pre tax post in-cash transfer income will greatly distort

both levels and trends in the economic well being of Americans and are incapable of measuring

the impact of health insurance reform on that distribution.

       In this paper, we show the sensitivity of trends in the level and distribution of measured

income when the value of employer paid health insurance and government provided Medicare

and Medicaid are included in our fuller measure of income. We do so by constructing measures

of inequality of income based on the public use CPS before and after adding an imputed value of

health care insurance to the pre tax post in-cash transfer size-adjusted household income of all

Americans for the years 1995 through 2008.

       A priori, inequality could increase when health insurance is added because employer

provided health insurance benefits are more likely to go to higher skilled workers living in higher

income households. This may be the case since employer provided health care insurance is tax

free to workers and this tax exemption is of greater value to higher income workers.

Alternatively including the value of employer provided health insurance could decrease

inequality; at least among those who receive health insurance because tax laws effectively

require employers in practice to provide fairly uniform levels of fringe benefits to all workers

within a firm regardless of the variation that exists in their productivity and cash wages.

       In like manner, the rise in inequality could be greater when health insurance is added

since the share of workers covered by employer health insurance has fallen since 1995 while its

average value has risen for those who still have it. Alternatively it could be lower since the tax



                                                 16
codes require employers to equally provide this now more valuable health insurance equally

across all their employees.

       Our results first showed that adding employer provided health insurance to compensation

not only increased the income of the average (median) American household but because its value

has been rising over time pushed median income above its 2000 peak. But improvements in

income and its distribution were also found whether measured by an increase in mean income by

decile or by a Gini coefficient. Adding the value of employer health insurance payments to

income reduces measured income inequality and reduces increases in measured income

inequality over time.

       When the value of government provide Medicare and Medicaid is included in our broader

measure of income the effects are even greater. As discussed in Table 6 including the full value

of employer and government provided health insurance significantly reduces measured income

inequality and effectively offsets all increases in income inequality accounted for by other

sources of income over the period 1995-2008.

       When we use our expanded measure of income to measure the effects of two key

provisions of health care reform, Medicaid expansions and health insurance subsidies, we find

that the benefits would primarily go to households in the lower income deciles. In both dollar

terms and as a percent of income, a disproportionate share of benefits goes to the lowest income

Americans. This is despite the fact that the two expansions we model are incremental, operating

on top of an existing program of Medicaid coverage for certain low income groups. Our

estimates show that the expansions would increase the broader measure of income earned by

those households in the lowest decile by over 8 percent ($797) and reduce overall income

inequality by about 1 percent. While a more complete measure of the change in economic well



                                                17
being would include the impact of the taxes necessary to finance these programs, our first cut

analyses here underscore the importance of incorporating health insurance in measures of the

level and distribution of economic wellbeing when considering the consequences of policies.

Whether health reform is enacted this year or not, future policy discussions need to be informed

by a better understanding of how health insurance expansions affect the level and distribution of

economic wellbeing.

Data Appendix A-Creation of the Health Insurance Values Database

1. Medicare
        Estimates of the average Medicare costs per beneficiary by state of residence by year are
    available for 1995-2004 from the State Health Expenditure Accounts system at CMS. 2005-
    2008 data are not yet available, thus are imputed (as explained below). According to CMS,
    (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/res-methodology.pdf),
    these numbers are made “using consistent definitions and methodologies that allow for
    comparisons across time and across states”. An example of prior research using these
    numbers is Martin et al, 2007. These data are just for all Medicare beneficiaries, not
    separately by over and under age 65. Riley (2004) estimates that the 2 year cost for newly
    eligible Medicare beneficiaries under the age of 62 is $10,055 in year 2000 dollars. At the
    national level, per person Medicare spending from the State Health Accounts is $5,585,
    which is slightly above Riley’s per year cost of $5,027.50.
        From the State Health Expenditure accounts page for Medicare, we took values from
    page 10 (estimates per capita by state) and created a data set to merge by state and year into
    the CPS.We filled in valued for 2005-2008 in the following manner using the inflation rates
    from the Medicare Trustees reports:
        The 2009 Medicare Trustees report says (in Table IIB1) that the average benefits per
    enrollee was in total $11,018 in 2008 which is $5,179 in Part A, $4,322 in B and $1,517 in D.
    2008’s report says that in Calendar 2007 (same table) it was $4,573 in A, $4,312 in B and
    $1,575 in D for a total of $10,460. 2007’s report same table says in 2006, A was $4,410 B
    was $4,121 and D was $1690 for total of $10,221. 2006’s report says in 2005 A was $4284
    and B was 3796 for total of $8080. 2005’s report says in 2004 A was 4064 and B was 3489
    for total of 7553. The amount reported per beneficiary for entire US in
    http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/res-mcare.pdf for 2004 is
    7,439 total, thus the two sources appear close enough for us to use the inflation rate from the
    Trustees report for future years to extend the state by year series. We inflated amounts from
    2004 by (8080-7553=527/7553)=6.98% for 2005, then from 2004 to 2006 we inflated by
    (10221-7553=2668/7553=)35.3% and from 2004 to 2007, we inflated by (10,460-
    7553/7553=2907/7553=) 8%; similarly from 2004 to 2008, based on the numbers above.

2. Medicaid/SCHIP
        For Medicaid and SCHIP spending per capita (henceforth referred to as Medicaid), the
    smallest level of aggregation possible is by state, year and by whether the individual is an
    adult or child. States regularly reported the total level of annual spending and the number of
    enrollees by state and year to CMS and this was released in the HCFA2082 forms database
    on CMS; for more recent years9 the system changed name to Medicaid Statistical
    Information System through which the states uploaded all their micro data to CMS and
    enabled CMS to create and report the totals themselves. From these tables, we obtain the
    number of enrolled children and number of enrolled adults, then the total amount of money
    spent on the two populations. For most years, the data was manually copied and pasted cell
    by cell and crossed checked several times. Details of data cleaning and checks for outliers are
    available upon request. The most recent data are for 2006, thus we inflated the values to 2007


9
    This switch happened on a rolling basis so for many states, the micro data was being sent to CMS well before 1998.

     and 2008 terms using the growth rate that occurred from 2005 to 2006 (which was 3% for
     adults and 6% for children).

3. Employer health insurance.
        The concept measured here is the amount of compensation that is given by an employer
    to the employee that is in the form of health insurance. Mechanically, this is the difference
    between the employer’s reported total cost per person’s policy, minus the co-premium
    amount that is deducted from the employee’s pre-tax income. This is the amount that is
    added to the individual’s household pre-tax post-transfer income as the cash equivalent of the
    compensation in kind.
        The relevant numbers come from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Insurance
    Component. For each year, state, and each firm size (Less than 10 employees, 10 - 24
    employees, 25 - 99 employees, 100-999 employees, 1000 or more employees) 4 different
    values were copied and pasted into cells: the total amount paid by the employer, the total
    amount paid by the employee, for both single and family policies. In the CPS, the firm size
    values are under 10, 10 – 24, 25 – 99, 100 – 499, 500 – 999, 1000+, so the two categories
    100 – 499 and 500 – 999 were collapsed for the purpose of merging the two data sets, so
    there are 5 firm size categories that are tracked.
        In the case of some small states, the MEPSIC does not report separate estimates for each
    state in some of the years. In the years 1996-2000, there are 11 such states whose identity
    changes slightly from year to year (e.g. in 1996 the list is Alaska, Delaware, District of
    Columbia, Idaho, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota,
    Vermont, and Wyoming, while in 2000 it is Alaska ,Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii,
    Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nevada, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wyoming). In 2001 there are
    9 states, and in 2002 there are 8 states. There are no missing states after that. In these cases,
    we use the national average for that year and firm size.
        The created series cover 1993, 1996-2008. However, there is no way to obtain a 1995
    value from surveys. Thus, we used the values for the Medical Care CPI (Series id
    CUSR0000SAM), and deflated values of 1996 by (225-2-216.6/225=) 3.8% to create the
    values for 1995.10 The series also excludes data for 2007 since the survey was not conducted
    in that year. We deflate the 2008 values by the inflation factor 5% for single coverage
    employer portion of premium and 5.4% for employer portion of the single plan premium. We
    obtain these deflation values by observing how the employer portion of premiums reported in
    the Kaiser Employer Health Insurance Survey 2008 report differ between 2007 and 2008 at
    the national level.

Data Appendix B: The Current Population Survey Dataset
        We use the March files from 1996 to 2008 (containing data from 1995 to 2007). We first
create individual indicators of health insurance, using the Census Bureau definitions, thus our
estimates are identical to the published tables.11 We create indicators first that record a value of 1
10
   Note that in 1995 there is no other way to obtain these data at even the national level, as the Kaiser/HRET/KPMG
Employer Survey which usually provides national annual estimates was not conducted that year either. The Health
Insurance CPI did not start until December 2005 (CUUR0000SEME) thus the only appropriate inflating factor is
provided by the medical care CPI.

   Historical CPS tables are at http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/historic/hlthin05/hihistt1.html and
http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/historic/index.html. The total sample size and means for health insurance
categories are identical between our data set and the published CPS means. For 95-2005, our data match the data in

if an individual reports holding that type of health insurance at any point in the previous year.
This means that an individual could be assigned to have more than one form of health insurance
during the past year. The types of health insurance tracked include Medicare, employer health
insurance in own name, employer health insurance as a dependent, individually purchased health
insurance, military health insurance, Medicaid or SCHIP, or whether uninsured that year. For
individuals who report receiving a policy from their own employer, we record whether it is a
single or family level policy. This variable was included for the first time in March 1996’s CPS.
        In the next step of the program, we assign an individual to at most one type of health
insurance during the year, following this hierarchy: if an individual has reported employer health
insurance through an employer in his or her own name, that takes precedence and the individual
is assigned to that insurance type. If an individual reports dependent insurance from an employer
source (and does not report his or her own employer provided it), then that is the insurance status
assigned to that person. If a person reports Medicare (but does not report employer health
insurance), then a status of Medicare is assigned to that individual. Next comes Medicaid (or
SCHIP), then individually purchased coverage, military coverage, and the status of un-insurance.
Household values of incomes that have been top-coded are replaced with the cell means
following Larrimore et al., 2008. Values from the health insurance values database are merged
into the CPS, after individuals have been assigned to at most one insurance status. All values are
merged in by state and year. For Medicaid, there is a further level of differentiation depending on
whether the individual is aged 18 and over or not. For employer health insurance, individuals
receive a different value if they report that their employer policy is obtained from their employer
as a single policy vs. as a family policy. It is also differentiated by the firm size of the employer
of the policy holder. Once these values are merged on to the individuals, the dollar amounts are
added to the household income reported pre-tax and post transfer. The data set excludes
individuals who live in group quarters and individuals in households with members of the armed
forces. Household size-adjusted income is the household income of the individual divided by
square root of the number of individuals in the household. Negative values of household income
are replaced with zeros for the inequality analysis. This constitutes the final data set for analysis.
        Appendix Table 5 shows the distribution of this mutually exclusive insurance status by
decile of household size-adjusted income. As in the tables above that are by decile of income, the
rows are for the same individuals.

Notes: To produce the numbers in this table, we create 100 percentile groups, then take the mean values of
income, the total income that includes the value of health insurance, and the share that represents insurance, for
those who are at the 10th, 50th and 90th percentile group of total income in that year. The percent change is
calculated from these numbers.

Notes: These represent the values that are added on to one's income as a result of receiving this type of
coverage from the government or from an employer.
These values represent the average across states in the nation (i.e. one observation per state per year).
They come from a data set that is at the state (51) by year (13) level, with 663 observations.
In the case of employer policies, it further represents the average firm size, where the categories are <10,
10-24, 25-99, 100-999, 1000+ (thus the N for the employer health insurance cells is 255 each).

Notes: These represent all individuals who appear in the March CPS of the following year (so 2007
data come from the 2008 March CPS), weighted with the supplement weight. The estimates above
match are an exact replication of the published CPS numbers. In 2001-2003, the CPS has two
estimates available on line; our numbers match the CPS's first historical series. In 2000 there is an
additional oversample which is not present in the data set for which income topcode cell means are
available, thus our numbers are slightly different from the published CPS numbers that contain the
oversample. In 1999, the CPS produces two alternative series (again, one has an oversample). Our
numbers are consistent with the first listed version of the published CPS tables.
