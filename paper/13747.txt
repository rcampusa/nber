This paper investigates the impact of Medicare HMO penetration on the medical care expenditures
incurred by Medicare fee-for-service enrollees. We find that increasing penetration leads to reduced
health care spending on fee-for-service beneficiaries. In particular, a one percentage point increase
in Medicare HMO penetration reduces such spending by .9 percent. We estimate similar models for
various measures of health care utilization and find penetration-induced reductions, consistent with
our spending estimates. Finally, we present evidence that suggests our estimated spending reductions
are driven by beneficiaries who have at least one chronic condition.

1. Introduction

The 1990s saw a dramatic increase in the percentage of Medicare enrollees who joined an

HMO. After the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, enrollment dropped dramatically, but

following the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, enrollment is again on the rise —

20% of Medicare beneficiaries are currently enrolled in a privately administered health

plan.1 The Congressional Budget Office predicts further increases in Medicare HMO

enrollment, suggesting enrollment in HMOs (excluding Private Fee-For-Service Plans

and regional PPOs) will rise by about 50% by 2017.2 While the rise of a meaningful

managed care sector may affect both the financial health of the program and the physical

health of Medicare enrollees, we focus on the former.3 In particular, we ask the question:

Does Medicare HMO penetration affect total health care spending incurred by fee-for-

service beneficiaries? Put differently, do the effects of HMO penetration spill over into

fee-for-service Medicare?

        Spillover effects refer to changes in the care delivered to fee-for-service enrollees

that arise due to changes in HMO enrollment among Medicare beneficiaries, holding the

health status of fee-for-service enrollees constant. There are several reasons to expect

spillovers. For example, if physicians tend to practice similarly for all patients, more

managed care enrollment may alter practice patterns for fee-for-service patients.

Additionally, managed care enrollment may influence aspects of market structure such as

  In late 2000, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), now called the Center for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS), convened a technical review panel to examine the assumptions used by the
Office of Actuaries to assess the financial health of the Medicare Trust Funds. The panel concluded that
these assumptions were in need of revision. One specific area was forecasting the impact of Medicare
managed care on total Medicare costs.


                                                   1
the number of hospitals, beds or available services over time (Chernew, 1995a). In turn,

these changes could impact practice patterns for all individuals in a given market.

Overall, the notion behind the possibility of spillovers is that an increased managed care

presence may change the manner in which fee-for-service patients are treated.

        Accurate assessment of spillovers is important. In the current policy debate, it has

been suggested that Medicare managed care plans are overpaid and there is some

discussion of reducing payment rates.4 However, if spillovers are substantial, optimal

payment rates from CMS to HMOs might be higher than they otherwise would be, to

encourage greater HMO participation in the Medicare program. Conceptually, this would

reflect some of the externality represented by savings to FFS Medicare stemming from

Medicare managed care enrollment. More generally, additional steps to increase

enrollment in HMOs might be warranted, if it encouraged savings in FFS Medicare or

more broadly.

        Economists’ interest in such spillover effects is captured in the growing body of

work examining the impact of managed care enrollment on Medicare costs or utilization

(Baker and Corts, 1996; Baker, 1997; Baker and Shankarkumar, 1997; Cutler and

Sheiner, 1997; McClellan and Baker, 2001; Cao and McGuire, 2003; Bundorf et al.,

2004) as well as the somewhat larger literature examining the impact of overall HMO

activity on the market as a whole (Robinson and Luft, 1988; Robinson, 1991; Melnick

and Zwanziger, 1995; Wickizer and Feldstein, 1995; Robinson, 1996; Gaskin and

Hadley, 1997; Hill and Wolfe, 1997). Overall, this research provides strong support for

the general proposition that markets are connected and thus we may reasonably expect

                                                   2
activities in the Medicare HMO market to influence the expenditures associated with

treating Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries.5

         Although the overall body of literature supports the existence of spillover effects,

research explicitly examining the impact of Medicare HMO enrollment on expenditures

by fee-for-service beneficiaries is relatively small and contributions to this literature tend

to ignore the potential endogeneity of HMO penetration, treating it as exogenous.

However, this strategy may be flawed if, for example, omitted area characteristics are

correlated with Medicare HMO penetration and also have an independent impact on

expenditures on fee-for-service enrollees.6

         In this paper, we assess the spillover between Medicare HMO enrollment and

expenditures on Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. Our basic approach is to regress

spending by fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries on the share of Medicare beneficiaries

in their county who are enrolled in HMO plans. Because of selection effects and because

HMO penetration is potentially endogenous, we use county-level variation in Medicare

payment policy as an instrument for Medicare-specific HMO penetration, which we also

measure at the county-level on the assumption that a county geographically represents the

relevant market. This approach has been used successfully in other contexts (c.f., Town

and Liu, 2002; Gowrisankaran and Town, 2004). Our identification comes from

longitudinal variation in payment rates over our study period (1994-2001) and reflects, in


5
  Note also that a series of studies by Zwanziger, Melnick and colleagues reach a similar qualitative
conclusion using a somewhat different approach, emphasizing the importance of selective contracting on
costs, without explicitly controlling for managed care penetration (Zwanziger and Melnick, 1988; Melnick
et al., 1989a; Melnick et al., 1989b; Zwanziger et al., 1994).
6
  Baker (1997), Cao and McGuire (2003) and Mello et al. (2002) are exceptions as they report instrumental
variables estimates. Baker (1997) and Cao and McGuire (2003) use cross-sectional models so their
identification is fundamentally different from ours. Mello et al. (2002) use payment rate changes, similar to
our approach, using a short panel from 1993-1996, prior to the BBA. These latter authors, however,
examine utilization and not spending.

large part, reforms instituted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and

idiosyncrasies in Medicare payment rules.

       We find evidence of substantial spillover in a sample of fee-for-service Medicare

beneficiaries. In particular, in instrumental variables models we find that a one

percentage point increase in county-level Medicare HMO penetration is associated with a

.9 percent reduction in individual annual spending on fee-for-service beneficiaries. These

estimates are larger in magnitude than corresponding least squares estimates, which also

imply the existence of such spillovers. To investigate the validity of our findings, we also

estimate models which examine the impact of Medicare HMO penetration on various

broad categories of health care utilization. We find that increases in county-level

Medicare HMO penetration reduce both inpatient and outpatient events, with larger

effects found on intensive utilization margins. These estimates are consistent with our

main finding that increased Medicare HMO penetration reduced spending by fee-for-

service beneficiaries in that they provide a plausible mechanism for the spending

reductions. Finally, we present evidence that this relationship is driven by individuals,

who report at least one chronic condition. By contrast, we find no evidence of a

systematic relationship for beneficiaries without any reported chronic conditions.

       In the following section, we provide background on the progression of Medicare

managed care and its relation to our work. Section 3 presents our empirical strategy,

which relies on county-specific payment rates as instruments for county-level Medicare

HMO penetration and discusses relevant issues, including the possibility that beneficiary

selection affects our spillover estimates. Section 4 describes our data, including the

construction of key variables and detailed descriptions of the samples we analyze.

Section 5 presents our estimates and Section 6 concludes.

2. Background

In 1982, Congress passed the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA). Under

this statute, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) was directed to contract

with HMOs to provide a managed care option to Medicare enrollees. Under

Medicare+Choice, Medicare enrollees can forgo the traditional Medicare insurance

program and enroll in a qualified HMO. The HMO agrees to provide health insurance

that covers all Medicare-covered services (Parts A and B) in exchange for a per-capita

fee, which varies at the county-level, from CMS. In addition, HMOs may offer benefits

beyond those available to fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. The rationale

underlying TEFRA is that HMOs may be more efficient at providing care thereby

reducing federal Medicare expenditures.7 Beginning in the early 1990s and extending to

the latter part of the decade, there was a surge in the share of Medicare beneficiaries who

took advantage of this option.

         An important lever that Medicare has to influence beneficiary participation in

HMOs is payment policy. Our empirical strategy, discussed in detail in the next section,

relies on a strong relationship between payment rates, which are specific to counties, and

aggregate enrollment levels. The findings of several studies suggest payment rates affect

HMO participation in the Medicare program (Cawley, Chernew and McLaughlin, 2002;



7
 HMO enrollment may be beneficial for enrollees, themselves, and the Medicare program if Medicare
HMOs provide care more efficiently than the traditional fee-for-service system. More efficient care can
manifest itself through lower costs of care, higher quality or through broader benefit coverage. If savings
exist from HMOs, Medicare ultimately may save money and/or enrollees may receive enhanced benefits
because of competition among plans.


                                                      5
Town and Liu, 2002). However, none of these studies directly measures the impact of

payment changes on aggregated HMO enrollment at the county-level.

        In addition to estimating the impact of payments on enrollment, it is important for

forecasting and policy purposes to understand the fiscal impact of Medicare HMO

enrollment on the program. Medicare HMO enrollment has both direct and indirect

impacts on the Medicare program. The direct fiscal impact of a Medicare beneficiary

choosing to enroll in an HMO depends on Medicare’s payment rates to HMOs, relative to

what the dollar value of care individuals would have used had they remained in the

traditional fee-for-service system. Because payment rates for Medicare HMOs were

historically tied to the local costs of care for enrollees in the fee-for-service portion of

Medicare, and because HMOs tended to attract a relatively healthier population, analysts

have felt that growing HMO enrollment would increase the total costs of the Medicare

program. Any cost savings obtained by HMOs were either captured by the HMOs,

themselves, or competed away via more extensive benefit packages to beneficiaries. For

example, analysis by MedPAC suggests that spending by Medicare for HMO participants

was four percent higher relative to demographically similar beneficiaries in traditional

Medicare (MedPAC, 2002). Yet, this calculation does not adjust for potential spillover

effects. If there are spillover effects from Medicare HMO penetration, such efficiencies

may reduce the cost for caring for individuals who do not enroll in Medicare HMOs. To

some extent, these savings may offset the direct effect of Medicare HMO enrollment.

3. Empirical Strategy and Related Issues

Using a sample of individuals enrolled in traditional fee-for-service Medicare, we

estimate models of the form:




                                               6
LogExpenditureict = α c + γ t + βMC ct + λX it + ε ict ,                                            (1)

where i indexes the individual fee-for-service beneficiary, c represents county of

residence and t represents year of interview. Expenditure represents total annual medical

care spending on fee-for-service beneficiaries enrolled in a given county in a given year.8

In later specifications, we replace spending with measures of health care utilization (e.g.,

inpatient and outpatient events, doctor visits, etc.) in an attempt to better understand the

mechanism driving our spending estimates. MC represents the fraction of Medicare

beneficiaries enrolled in an HMO in a given county in a particular year. Because we

include county fixed effects ( α c ) in our specification, we identify the impact of Medicare

HMO penetration on spending via within-county changes in penetration. To the extent

that there are unobserved characteristics that are correlated with both penetration and

spending (e.g., county-level health status), this represents an improvement over cross-

sectional estimation. In addition, we also include a vector of year effects ( γ t ) to account

for trends that are common across all counties in our sample. The vector X represents

individual covariates that will affect demand for services. These include beneficiary

demographic information as well as additional health status measures and other variables

likely correlated with demand. In addition to self-reported health, additional covariates

include experience with sixteen diseases/disorders as well as smoking status and body

mass index.9 In our preferred specification, we add other county-level information




8
 This specification is similar to those found in the existing literature, though we use individual data.
9
 The sixteen disease/disorder indicators are based on a central question which asks respondents if they
have ever had: arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, Alzheimer’s disease, hip fracture, cancer, skin
cancer, Parkinson’s disease, at least partial paralysis, psychiatric disorder, coronary heart disease,
hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, stroke or a hear problem not included in this list.


                                                     7
including overall commercial HMO penetration and various measures of county-specific

medical resources.

         The disturbance term in equation (1) is likely correlated with county-level

Medicare HMO penetration. Specifically, there may be unobserved, time-varying county

level traits that are correlated with both Medicare HMO penetration and spending, such

as consolidation in the provider market or changes in employer demand. Assuming that

HMOs tend to enter areas with rising fee-for-service spending (because they have greater

potential to achieve savings), we would expect least squares estimates of β to be biased

upwards. If the true effect of penetration on expenditures is negative, this means β will

be biased towards zero.

         We correct for this potential bias using an instrumental variables (IV) approach.

In particular, we use county-level payment rates from CMS to HMOs as instruments to

identify the effect of county-level Medicare HMO penetration.10 To the extent that these

payment rates are correlated with county-level penetration, but are orthogonal to current

fee-for-service expenditures, our IV estimates represent an improvement over

corresponding OLS estimates. Given our expectations regarding HMO entrance into

markets with relatively high cost growth in expenditures, and given our expectation that

healthier enrollees chose HMOs, we expect the IV estimates to be more negative, and

hence larger in magnitude, than our OLS estimates.11

         Variation in county-level payment rates comes from two sources. First, prior to

the BBA, Medicare based its payment to HMOs on the per capita costs of the fee-for-

10
   Other potential instruments could be based on the distribution of firm sizes in an area, though this is most
likely more relevant to commercial HMO penetration than Medicare-specific penetration. Baker (1997)
advocates the use of such an instrument for commercial HMO penetration.
11
   Even with IV estimation, change in the composition of the FFS population remains possible. We discuss
this later in this section.


                                                      8
service enrollees in counties. This may seem to suggest that payment rates would be a

poor instrument for HMO penetration in our model because of their apparent relationship

with fee-for-service spending. However, payment rates at time t were based on average

fee-for-services spending between periods t-8 to t-3.12 The validity of county-level

payment rates depends on the degree of autocorrelation in fee-for-service spending over

time. To explore the potential for using payment as an instrument, we estimated a first-

order autoregression of the residuals from a regression of log spending by fee-for-service

beneficiaries on all of our exogenous variables, including the payment rates.13 The

autocorrelation parameter appears to be sufficiently small to allow this to be a useful

source of identifying variation. In particular, the parameter ranges from 0.04 to 0.07 and

is not statistically different from zero at conventional levels of significance.

         The other source of payment variation is the BBA of 1997, and subsequent

refinements, which broke the link between payment rates and average local fee-for-

service costs. The BBA fundamentally modified Medicare’s payment methodology.

While the changes in the payment formula are relatively technical, for our purposes, the

important feature is that adjustments to county-level payments are now divorced from the

Medicare fee-for-service experience in the county. Specifically, after the BBA, county

rates were set equal to the maximum of three rates: (a) a blended input price which is a

combination of an adjusted national rate and an area-specific rate, (b) a floor payment

designed to increase the rates in low-paid counties, and (c) a minimum increase of two

percent per year. Initially, most counties were either ceiling or floor counties, minimizing

the variation in payment changes post-BBA. However, the subsequent refinements to the

12
  More specifically, these are five-year averages, starting eight years prior to time t.
13
  This required collapsing the residuals to county-year cells, so the residuals used in the autoregression are
averaged over all sample individuals in a given county in a particular year.


                                                      9
BBA payment formulas added greater variation in payments across counties. In most

counties the post-BBA payment formula led to a substantial decrease in payment rates

over what HMOs would have received prior to the BBA. It is estimated that the BBA

methodology lowered payments to HMOs by an average of six percent.14 In addition to

reducing the level of payments, the BBA also diminished the variance in payment rates

across counties.

         While the impact of the BBA on payment rates is likely unrelated to the error

term in equation (1), the payment rate still may be a “weak” instrument. We test the

strength of our instrument set via a standard F-test. As will be seen, all F-tests strongly

reject the hypothesis that our instruments are unrelated to county-level Medicare HMO

enrollment rates.15 The validity of these county-level payments rates also requires

payment changes to be unrelated to existing trends in spending across counties. In

particular, the counties that experienced relatively generous or stingy growth in payments

due to the BBA might differ systematically in this regard.

         To examine this possibility, we divided counties in our sample into those whose

payment growth was slowed following the BBA and those whose spending growth was

accelerated.16 This taxonomy is based on the ratio of payment growth in each county

post-BBA to growth pre-BBA. The results from this exercise are presented in Table 1.

Prior to 1997, counties which were treated generously following the BBA (i.e., had above

median relative payment growth) had roughly the same percent growth in expenditures as

those counties which were treated less generously. In particular, the former counties

14

15
   A standard rule-of-thumb is that this F-statistic be greater than ten. All of our F-statistics are greater than
thirty-seven. In addition, we report the partial R-squared for each first-stage regression.
16
   The figures that follow are generated from our sample of counties. See section 4.2 for details on our
analysis sample, including selection of counties.


                                                       10
experienced growth in spending on fee-for-service beneficiaries of 9.2 percent, while the

latter counties experienced growth of 10 percent. This suggests spending trends prior to

the BBA were similar across counties that later were differentially impacted by the BBA

and subsequent payment regimes. After the BBA, and consistent with results we report

below, counties whose payment growth was slowed following the BBA had higher

percentage FFS spending growth (25.1 percent) relative to those counties whose payment

growth was accelerated following the BBA (16.7 percent).

       Finally, we note that the measurement of spillovers is complicated by selection

concerns. Selection effects refer to the impact of non-random sorting of beneficiaries into

Medicare managed care. A common concern is that relatively healthier individuals will

opt out of fee-for-service Medicare. The concern has fiscal implications. In particular, if

healthier beneficiaries systematically enroll in Medicare HMOs, the costs for those

remaining in the fee-for-service sector will rise because that population will be, on

average, less healthy. Conditional on such sorting, costs will be higher in markets with

high HMO penetration, even if care for any given fee-for-service patient is unaffected by

managed care penetration. In contrast to the spillover story, if fee-for-service costs were

regressed on Medicare HMO penetration, the estimated coefficient would be positive.

       In our IV context, the concern is similar, but we are concerned with whether

enrollment shifts induced by payment changes are systematically related to health status

or other enrollee traits that may affect spending. If FFS beneficiaries who are healthier,

on average, than the initial FFS population are induced by payment changes to leave the

FFS system for HMOs, then the remaining FFS population may become less healthy, on

average. Such movement would generate estimates that would underestimate spillover




                                             11
effects.17 Recent evidence, however, suggests that there is no association between

favorable selection into Medicare HMOs and county-level HMO penetration (Mello et

al., 2003), suggesting that at the margin, shifts in HMO penetration associated with

payment changes do not substantially alter the health status of fee-for-service enrollees.

However, Cao and McGuire (2003), using service-level variation, find evidence of

selection in markets with HMO penetration rates below fifteen percent.

        Despite the lack of clear evidence, we address this issue in several ways. First, we

estimated models with a large set of health status controls, including covariates for

general health status and a set of sixteen disease indicators. Additionally, we investigate

the association between payment changes and changes in the composition of our fee-for-

service sample over time. In particular, we estimate models that replace spending with

age and health status measures in order to test whether payment-induced changes in

Medicare HMO penetration affected the composition of this group. Here, a finding that

the fee-for-service population became younger or healthier, as payment rates alter

penetration, would indicate that selection may be driving compositional changes that

could taint our estimates in ways described above. Similarly, a finding that the fee-for-

service population got older or less healthy would also represent compositional change.

However, as we discuss in section 5.4, we find no systematic evidence of any such

compositional changes, implying that our estimates represent true spillover.

4. Data

4.1 Data description




17
  Of course, if less healthy beneficiaries are induced to leave fee-for-service Medicare for HMOs as
payments change, then our measured spillover effect may overstate the magnitude of the true effect.


                                                    12
We use data from the annual Cost and Use files of the Medicare Current Beneficiary

Survey (MCBS) for the years 1994 to 2001, inclusive. This period pre-dates the rise in

private FFS plans, which have grown rapidly but are not likely to generate the substantial

spillovers. The MCBS is a nationally-representative survey of Medicare beneficiaries

which gathers information on respondents via a rotating panel. While the sampling frame

includes elderly and disabled beneficiaries, we limit our analysis to individuals aged

sixty-five and older. In addition, we exclude the roughly ten percent of respondents who

completed “facility” interviews, which were administered to individuals who could not

complete the interview on their own and required a proxy to do so. Since we examine

potential spillovers associated with Medicare managed care, we include only individuals

who were consistently enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare in each wave of the survey.

        The MCBS contains detailed information on respondent demographics (e.g.,

income, race, living arrangements), health status (e.g., self-reported health status, past

experience with a variety of diseases and disorders) as well as information on health care

utilization and expenditure. With respect to the latter, respondents are linked with claims

data to ensure the accuracy of individual spending measures. The MCBS staff uses this

information, in conjunction with information provided by respondents, to construct each

respondent’s total annual expenditure, which is our outcome of interest.18 We focus on

total spending, rather than just fee-for-service Medicare spending, because spillovers may

be wide-ranging. That said, fee-for-service Medicare expenditure accounts for about two-

thirds of total expenditures in our samples. Indeed, though not reported, when we

  In particular, we use the variable PAMTTOT which aggregates expenditures from eleven different
sources to construct a measure of total expenditures.

estimate models that replace total expenditure with Medicare-specific expenditures, our

estimates provide slightly stronger evidence of spillovers.

         To better understand our findings, we also examine the impact of Medicare HMO

penetration on selected categories of health care utilization including inpatient events,

outpatient events, medical provider events and office visits.19 Another set of key variables

included county-level estimates of Medicare HMO enrollment and the county-specific

payment rates CMS uses to compensate managed care companies, both of which are

available from CMS. We also add other county-specific variables including commercial

HMO penetration and various measures of local medical resources as covariates. We

merge all of this county-level information to our data using geographic identifiers

available in restricted-use versions of the MCBS.

4.2 Analysis samples

Our primary sample eliminates the relatively few individuals with zero total annual

expenditure. As a sensitivity check, we estimate models that include these individuals,

assigning such respondents an expenditure of one dollar since we model log expenditure

in our spending models. As mentioned, we eliminate institutionalized individuals and

those under sixty-five years old which results in a sample of 77,963 individuals. Limiting

our sample to those enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare for the entire year reduces this

figure to 60,844 and missing information on key variables further reduces our sample size

to 58,231. Excluding individuals with zero expenditure further drops the sample by about

2.6 percent to 56,754.

  Medical provider events include doctor visits, surgical and laboratory services, or purchases of medical
equipment and supplies.


                                                    14
         Since the MCBS contains several counties with relatively few individuals, we

restrict our analysis to individuals in counties that contribute at least fifteen observations

over the eight years of data we examine.20 This restriction reduces the sample that

excludes zero expenditure individuals to 53,188. Table 2 presents means and standard

deviations for four samples. The first two columns represent samples we use to generate

regression estimates, while the latter two columns represent ones that include all counties,

regardless of the number of observations they contribute. Comparing the first and third

columns as well as the second and fourth ones, it is apparent that there are no substantial

differences associated with our restrictions. However, as expected, there are differences

in average expenditure between samples that do and do not contain zero expenditure

individuals, but these are slight given the relatively small fraction of individuals with zero

expenditure.

5. Results

5.1 Main estimates

In Table 3, we present OLS and IV estimates of the impact of Medicare HMO penetration

on the expenditure of fee-for-service enrollees. In the OLS models, presented in the first

two columns, the estimated coefficients on Medicare HMO penetration are small, relative

to the IV estimates we will present. For example, we estimate that a one percentage point

increase in Medicare HMO penetration is associated with a decrease of about 0.3 percent

in expected expenditures by fee-for-service enrollees. Despite their relatively small

magnitudes, the signs of these coefficients are consistent with the existence of spillovers.

As noted earlier, since it is likely that the error terms of these equations are correlated


20
  Counties contributing fewer than fifteen observations contribute an average of less than four observations
over the eight years in question or less than one-half of one observation per year, on average.


                                                    15
with county-level Medicare HMO penetration, OLS may provide biased estimates of the

true relationship. For reasons also discussed earlier, this bias is likely to be negative; if

so, the true impact of HMO penetration on fee-for-service expenditure will be

understated or biased towards zero.

        Table 3 also presents our IV spending estimates. Across the specifications

presented, the estimated coefficient on Medicare HMO penetration is negative and

relatively large in magnitude. Columns 3 and 4 present a base specification, first without

zero expenditure individuals and then including such individuals, respectively. These

estimates imply that a one percentage point increase in Medicare HMO enrollment is

associated with a reduction in expected fee-for-service expenditure of between 0.7 and

0.8 percent. Over our sample period, mean Medicare HMO penetration increased by

approximately eight percentage points. By extrapolation, these estimates imply that the

rise of managed care reduced fee-for-service expenditure by about six percent, relative to

the level that would have obtained in the absence of such penetration. It is also worth

noting that, consistent with recent work, we estimated versions of these specifications

that allowed for a quadratic in Medicare HMO penetration. However, the squared term

was consistently close to zero and insignificant, suggesting no improvement over our

linear parameterization.

        Of course, the reliability of our estimates is only as good as the validity of our

instruments. In Table 3, we present some additional evidence on this issue. First, our

instruments explain a significant amount of the variation in Medicare HMO penetration,

controlling for county fixed-effects and other right-hand-side variables. In particular, the

partial R2 is at least 0.14 in all specifications and the F-test that the coefficients on the




                                               16
instruments are all zero is over thirty-seven in all specifications, relative to a rule-of-

thumb of ten. Thus, there is no evidence that our estimates suffer from a weak instrument

problem. When combined with the diagnostic results of minimal autocorrelation in

spending growth among fee-for-service beneficiaries and similar spending growth prior

to the BBA in counties treated more and less generously by it, we believe these are

reasonable instruments.21

         Column 5 presents an estimate of β from our most preferred specification. It

adds a set of county-level controls as well as information on supplemental coverages’ to

the specification presented in Column 3. In particular, this specification adds controls for

county-level commercial HMO penetration, county-specific medical resources, including

measures of hospital beds, total medical doctors, medical specialists, hospice beds and

long term beds, as well as person-specific supplemental coverage information including

the availability of employer-sponsored health insurance coverage and Medicaid

eligibility.22 As can be seen in Column 5, our estimate of the impact of a one percentage

point change in Medicare HMO penetration rises about 25% when area controls are

added, to nearly one percent. This figure represents an economically significant effect

that continues to imply non-trivial spillover. Again, given the fullness of this model, it is

our preferred specification.

         Finally, Column 6 presents a specific robustness check. In particular, it eliminates

observations from California and Florida, areas where Medicare managed care grew

21
   Additionally, the Hansen test of the over-identifying restrictions does not reject in any specification.
However, the over identifying restrictions are the consequence of adding nonlinear transformation of the
payment rate to the instruments set (which are statistically significant in the first stage). Thus while we
believe the Hansen test is informative, the test statistic must be interpreted recognizing it relies on non-
linear transformation of payments to generate the over identification.
22
   Information on county-level medical resources was drawn from the appropriate versions of the Area
Resource File (ARF).


                                                      17
rapidly in the 1990s. The concern is that estimates from our preferred specification may

be driven by changes in these areas. However, the estimate in Column 6 suggests that the

estimate from our preferred model is not dependent on the California and Florida

experience. In particular, this coefficient on Medicare HMO penetration, -0.00896, is

precisely estimated and also implies an effect of just under one percent, quite similar to

our preferred estimate.23

5.2 Utilization models

In order to better understand the nature of our spending estimates, we estimate IV

specifications of the impact of Medicare HMO penetration on the following measures of

utilization: inpatient events, outpatient events, medical provider events and office visits.

Corresponding estimates, from models that exclude zero expenditure individuals and

implement our most preferred specification, are presented in Table 4.24 Since the

distributions of these events are skewed, we estimate three sets of models that correspond

to different specifications of the dependent variable. The three specifications indicate: (a)

whether an individual experienced a given event, (b) the number of events, and (c) the

number of events, conditional upon the number being greater than zero. The estimates

indicate that the impact of Medicare HMO penetration on utilization appears to be

occurring on the intensive margins of outpatient and medical provider events. The

magnitude of these effects is not trivial. Conditional on having an outpatient event, a one

percentage point increase in Medicare HMO penetration reduces the expected number of

visits by nearly one percent when evaluated relative to the mean of the dependent

variable. There is also some evidence that penetration impacts inpatient events, on both

23
   Though not reported, estimates from models that exclude California and Florida separately also yield
similar estimates.
24
   Estimates from models that include zero expenditure individuals yield similar estimates.


                                                    18
extensive and intensive margins. While not as statistically precise as estimates in Table 3,

our findings with respect to utilization are consistent with our main finding that Medicare

HMO penetration reduces expenditures by fee-for-service enrollees in that they provide a

mechanism for such reductions.

5.3 Exploring our main estimates in more detail

We next allow the impact of Medicare HMO penetration to vary by the level of

individual health care use. In particular, we are interested in whether the effect of

penetration differs across plausibly high and low-use individuals. To this end, we proxy

“high-use” and “low-use” by whether the individual reports ever having been told they

have one of four chronic conditions which include coronary heart disease, arthritis,

diabetes or some “other” heart problem. We separate respondents into two groups—those

who report at least one of these conditions and those who report none—and refer to the

former as “high-use” and the latter as “low-use”. Mean spending levels support this

characterization—individuals with at least one chronic condition had an average annual

expenditure of $7,776, while those individuals who report none of these chronic

conditions had a similar expenditure of $4,686.25 We hypothesize that the effects of

HMO penetration will be larger in the population with chronic disease because HMOs

target chronic disease and because care management for these conditions may be more

prone to systematic approaches and thus spillover. For example, Chernew 1995b reports

that the impact of HMO on diagnostic testing was much greater for patients with chronic

diseases.



25
  These figures are computed from our 1994 sample and include the relatively few beneficiaries with zero
expenditure. Corresponding figures from our sample without individuals with zero expenditure are $7,908
and $5,041, respectively.


                                                   19
       We explore this possibility in Table 5. As can be seen, the implied spending

reductions for higher-use individuals are much larger in magnitude than their low-use

counterparts. In particular, while the implied reduction for the former group ranges from

1.1 to 1.5 percent, we find no systematic relationship for low-use individuals. This

suggests that the savings associated with increasing Medicare HMO penetration are

derived from individuals with relatively higher use and expenditure. That said, our data

do not allow us to distinguish whether reductions among high-use beneficiaries represent

reductions in superfluous or necessary care.

5.4 Are changes in composition of FFS beneficiaries driving our spillover estimates?

Despite the advantages of instrumental variables estimation and the quality of our

instruments, the issue of who is induced to switch between FFS and HMOs remains.

Recall that if fee-for-service beneficiaries who select into HMOs are, on average,

healthier than the FFS population, then our estimates may be due to change in the

composition of this group, rather than true spillover. In this case, we would be

overestimating the true spillover effect. Conversely, if the FFS beneficiaries who leave

are, on average, less healthy than the FFS population, we may underestimate this effect.

We test for such compositional change by investigating the relationship between

Medicare HMO penetration and various demographic and health-related variables to

assess the likelihood of such compositional change. In particular, we estimate our most

preferred specification, replacing the dependent variable with age and health-related

measures, preserving our basic empirical strategy.

       As seen in Table 6, we find no evidence that FFS recipients in our sample became

less healthy over time. Indeed, there is some evidence that our FFS sample became older




                                            20
as a result of payment-induced changes in Medicare HMO penetration, perhaps

suggesting that the remaining sample became less healthy, which, in principle, should

bias our strategy against finding evidence of spillover effects. However, the estimated

effects are practically very small. For example, the estimates suggest that a one

percentage point increase in Medicare HMO penetration is associated with roughly a 0.04

year increase in age, on average. Moreover, there is no evidence that the fraction of the

FFS population at least seventy-five years old increased. Perhaps most directly, we find

no systematic relationship between “excellent” and “poor” health and penetration,

suggesting no compositional change with regard to health status. These findings are

consistent with Mello et al. (2003) who find no systematic evidence of an association

between favorable selection into Medicare HMOs and county-level HMO penetration.

6. Conclusions

Quantifying the impact of managed care enrollment on spending on fee-for-service

beneficiaries is an important policy exercise, especially since such spillovers are

generally ignored in considering future program costs. This paper suggests that such

spillovers are substantial. Using IV models that correct for the endogeneity of HMO

penetration changes across counties, we estimate that a one percentage point increase in

county-level Medicare HMO penetration is associated with nearly a one percent

reduction in individual-level annual spending by fee-for-service enrollees. The findings

are robust to several sensitivity checks and a number of diagnostic exercises suggest that

our instruments are valid. Our spending estimates are also supported by utilization

models which suggest a mechanism through which Medicare HMO penetration affects

spending in the fee-for-service sector. Finally, the spending reductions implied by our




                                             21
estimates seem to be derived from less healthy and consequently high-cost beneficiaries,

as opposed to their healthier counterparts.

       Our findings should be interpreted as applying to the range of HMO penetration

influenced by payment policy. Given their substantial magnitude, we suspect additional

large changes in penetration might translate into somewhat smaller effects. Moreover, our

results do not apply to Private FFS plans, which have benefited from generous payment

and do not likely generate substantial spillovers. Yet given the present estimated effects,

policy makers might well be advised to encourage greater HMO presence because at least

some of the costs of increased payments to plans would be offset by savings in the fee-

for-service system, and likely the health care system overall. At a minimum, the

possibility of such spillovers should be considered in policy debates.

Notes: All four samples include only beneficiaries enrolled in traditional fee-for-service Medicare. The first
two columns represent the samples we use to generate regression estimates. The second two columns relax
our restriction that a county contribute at least fifteen observations over the eight years of data in question.
Total annual expenditures and payment rates are in nominal dollars. Standard deviations are in parentheses.

Notes: Dependent variable is log of annual spending. In addition to county and year fixed effects, all models control for age, age squared, race, income,
household size, marital status, general health status, sixteen disease indicators, smoking status and body mass index. Model (1) is our OLS base specification
without zero expenditure individuals, Model (2) includes these zero expenditure individuals, adding one dollar of expenditure so that logs may be taken, Model
(3) is our IV base specification without zero expenditure individuals, Model (4) adds zero expenditure individuals, Model (5), our preferred specification, adds
controls for county-level commercial HMO penetration, county-level medical resources, and the availability of supplemental coverages to Model (3), and Model
(6) is a sensitivity check which excludes California and Florida observations. The Over-identification test statistic is distributed χ2(1). Absolute values of t-ratios

Notes: This table presents estimates from twelve separate IV regressions. Columns represent the model specification and rows represent the dependent variable in
question. In particular, the column labeled “any” presents models where the dependent variable equals one if the individual has experienced an event indicated by
a given row, the column labeled “number” presents models where the dependent variable is the number of relevant events, and the column labeled “number>0”
present models where the sample is restricted to individuals with strictly positive events. Models correspond to our most preferred specification which is
represented by Column 5 of Table 3. Absolute values of t-ratios in parentheses, dependent variable mean in curly brackets, and sample sizes in square brackets.

Notes: Dependent variable is log of annual spending. “High-Use” individuals are those with at least one
chronic condition as described in the text, while “Low-Use” individuals include those without any of these
conditions. Models “without zeroes” drop individuals with zero expenditure, while models “with zeroes”
assign one dollar of spending to these individuals and include a dummy variable indicating if an individual
has zero expenditure. Models correspond to our most preferred specification which is represented by
