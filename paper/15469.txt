                                               ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes new data on financial literacy and financial sophistication from the 2008 Health
and Retirement Study. We show that financial literacy is lacking among older individuals and for
the first time explore additional questions on financial sophistication which proves even scarcer. For
this sample of older respondents over the age of 55, we find that people lack even a rudimentary understanding
of stock and bond prices, risk diversification, portfolio choice, and investment fees. In view of the
fact that individuals are increasingly required to take on responsibility for their own retirement security,
this lack of knowledge has serious implications.

                                   Among Older Americans

                       Annamaria Lusardi, Olivia S. Mitchell, and Vilsa Curto


Research Question and Relevance

         Financial literacy among Americans is disappointingly low. For instance, only half of

older respondents surveyed in a special module of the 2004 Health and Retirement Study (HRS)

could correctly answer two simple questions regarding inflation and compound interest. Only

one-third correctly answered these two questions as well as a third question about risk

diversification (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2006, 2008a). Evidence of low numeracy and low financial

sophistication is also evident for younger respondents (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007a; Lusardi,

Mitchell and Curto, 2009) in surveys including the Rand American Life Panel (ALP) and the

Survey of Consumers (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007c; Hilgert, Hogarth, and Beverly, 2003).

Financial illiteracy is also particularly acute among specific demographic sub-groups, such as

women, minorities, and those with low income and education (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007b,

2008a). Lack of financial literacy has important consequences; those who lack literacy are much

less likely to plan for retirement (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2006, 2007a, 2007c), are more likely to

end up with less wealth close to retirement (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007a), are less likely to invest

in stocks (van Rooij, Lusardi and Alessie, 2007; Kimball and Shumway, 2006; Yoong , 2007),

and are more likely to use high-cost means of borrowing (Lusardi and Tufano, 2009).

         This paper analyzes new data from the 2008 HRS on financial literacy and financial

sophistication.1 We assess levels of financial sophistication among older individuals, specifically

paper.
                                                                                                 2


persons over the age of 55 in 2008. Many prior studies focused on simple measures of basic

financial literacy and did not consider financial sophistication. Our research is informative for

policy in several ways. First, results from this research can be used to design financial education

programs that are more effective in fostering financial literacy and saving. By examining

knowledge about the behavior of the stock market, basic asset pricing, and the importance of

mutual fund fees on long-term investments, explicit suggestions can be provided regarding topics

that should be covered in financial education programs. Second, this paper identifies which

population groups are most likely to be financially unsophisticated. Third, the analysis indicates

which groups are most prone to poor financial decision-making at older ages and provides some

suggestions for improving the effectiveness of financial education programs.



Prior Research

       Older Americans are not particularly financially literate, as shown by Lusardi and

Mitchell (2006) using data from a special-purpose module the authors created for the 2004 HRS.

These findings have been confirmed among Early Baby Boomers, who displayed not only low

numeracy, but also a lack of knowledge of fundamental economic concepts such as interest rate

compounding (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007a). Moreover, particular sub-groups of the population

suffer even greater deficits in financial literacy; Lusardi and Mitchell (2008a) find that women

display much lower literacy than men and are much less likely to plan for retirement.

Furthermore, minorities and those with low education and low income are more likely to display

low levels of financial knowledge (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007b; Lusardi, 2008b; Smith and

Stewart, 2008).
                                                                                                                  3


        These results are troublesome given the increasing complexity of financial instruments

and the many transactions households must undertake that require sound economic

understanding. For instance, Moore (2003) found that mortgage borrowers in Washington State

knew little about compound interest and were confused about the terms of their mortgages.

Campbell (2006) found that many households failed to refinance their mortgages over the 2001–

2003 period, when interest rates were falling.

        Furthermore, financial illiteracy can have significant long-term financial consequences

(Lusardi, 2008a). For example, those who underestimate the power of interest compounding are

more likely to end up with excessive amounts of debt (Lusardi and Tufano, 2009). Those who

fail to refinance or to correctly estimate the amount by which interest rates could change will pay

significantly more in mortgage interest (Campbell, 2006).



Data and Methodology

        Most of the financial literacy studies mentioned above have drawn on evidence gathered

in a short experimental module in the 2004 HRS designed by Lusardi and Mitchell. 2 This set of

questions has been used very successfully to explore the links between financial literacy and

retirement planning as well as retirement wealth accumulation. Nevertheless, that module

included only three questions designed to assess basic numeracy and knowledge of basic

economic concepts such as inflation and risk diversification. For this reason, we have sought to

expand the scope of investigation into financial knowledge among the older population with

additional questions added to other surveys. For instance we have developed questions on

financial knowledge in the American Life Panel which we first piloted on the Dutch DNB


2
         These questions have now been added to related surveys in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, New
Zealand, Japan, Chile, and Mexico, revealing similar patterns of widespread illiteracy.
                                                                                                     4


Household Survey (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007c; van Rooij, Lusardi and Alessie, 2007). These

new measures cover not only basic but also sophisticated financial knowledge, eliciting

knowledge on the difference between bonds and stocks, the working of the stock market, and

basic asset pricing. In turn, this expanded set of data about financial knowledge then influenced

the wording of the new module for the 2008 HRS, to be described in more detail below. Using

this extended information, we can now classify respondents not only in terms of basic financial

literacy but also in terms of financial sophistication.

       An interesting aspect of the 2008 HRS module on financial literacy is its innovative

approach to assessing how the literacy questions are designed. Not only is there a richer list of

questions compared to the 2004 HRS, but also respondents are presented with alternative

question wording to assess whether respondents are guessing or whether they actually understand

the questions. Specifically, respondents are randomly chosen to be presented with the same

questions but with reverse wording. For example, one set of respondents is asked whether the

following statement is true or false: “If you invest for the long run, the annual fees of mutual

funds are important;” the second group is asked: “If you invest for the long run, the annual fees

of mutual funds are unimportant.” Such wording reversal permits us to begin to evaluate the

extent of measurement error in responses to financial sophistication questions. This is a very

important methodological innovation. Both the Dutch DNB Household Survey and the ALP used

a similar approach for a small subset of the questions, and there we showed that the wording of

the questions does matter, particularly for questions measuring financial sophistication (Lusardi

and Mitchell, 2007c, 2009; van Rooij, Lusardi and Alessie, 2007). In general, if people are

financially unsophisticated, it will be difficult to elicit accurate responses to unfamiliar concepts.

Measuring Financial Sophistication

       In 2008, a subset of some 1332 HRS respondents responded to a battery of questions

seeking to assess their knowledge of the stock market, asset pricing, investment strategies, risk

diversification, the importance of fees, financial attitudes and related topics. Because so many

questions are asked to respondents, we have organized them into five different sub-groups

according to the topics they cover, as follows (exact question wording appears in the Appendix):

(A) Knowledge of capital markets

       V407 Understanding of the stock market

       V408 Investment in company stocks

       V408 Avoidance of foreign stocks

       V416 Bond value versus interest rate

(B) Risk diversification

       V411 Invest in few stocks

       V417 Stock risk spread

       V419 Diversify stocks

(C) Knowledge of fees

       V415 Importance of annual fees

       V418 Asset annual fees

(D) Savvy/numeracy

       V412 Buy/sell stocks often

       V413 Enough life insurance
                                                                                                6


       V422 Use savings in bank to pay off credit cards

       V423 Power of interest compounding

(E) Attitudes toward investing and risk

       V406 All money in safest asset

       V410 Whether older retired should hold stocks

       V420 Smart people select stocks with good return

       V421 Stock market equals lottery

       V424 Advisors take unfair advantage

       Respondents to this module were, on average, age 67, with about 55% female. About

16% had less than high school education, 33% had high school, 24% had some college, and 28%

had college or advanced degrees. The majority, 81%, of the respondents was White, 9% African-

American, and 8% Hispanic. Summary statistics on outcomes appear in Tables 1-5, and detail by

sex, age, and education in Tables 6-9.



A. Knowledge of capital markets

       Recalling that this module was fielded in 2008, a year of particularly volatile capital

markets, it is probably not surprising that a large majority of respondents reported that they did

not understand this market; only about 30% said they did. Nevertheless the degree of financially

illiteracy extends much more broadly, supporting the view that older Americans lack an

understanding of key concepts related to stock prices, risk diversification, and portfolio choice

(Table 1). For instance, many respondents expressed a preference for having some company

stocks, though there is some sensitivity to the way the question was asked. Respondents given

the first wording of this question (whether an employee of a company with publicly traded stock
                                                                                                7


should have a lot of his/her retirement savings in the company stock) did believe that holding a

lot a company stocks is not a good idea. Yet when presented with the reverse wording, most

rejected the idea of holding little or no money in company stock. Since the typical worker will

have a large part of his total wealth in human capital which is highly correlated with his

employer’s financial stability, it is likely to be unwise from a risk diversification viewpoint to

hold own employer stock.

       The results also show that respondents were wary of investing in international equity.

Experts have long argued that international diversification helps diversify risk and offers

exposure to fast-growing foreign economies. Nevertheless, many prior studies have found

evidence of “home bias,” and this is also evident among older respondents (French and Poterba,

1991). It is interesting that the wording of the question matters: respondents were more likely to

display financial sophistication when they were asked if it is best to avoid stocks of foreign

companies, rather than if it is a good idea to own stocks of foreign companies.

       Table 1 also shows that a large majority of respondents did not know about asset pricing,

which we have tested by asking whether people know about the inverse relationship between

bond prices and interest rates. This is a particularly good question to assess financial

sophistication because, while some questions may be answered correctly if people are good at

math or are clever and can figure out an answer, it is hard if not impossible to know or infer the

correct answer to this question without having some knowledge of finance. When we piloted this

question in both the ALP and the Dutch DNB, we found that a small share (fewer than half) of

respondents knew about bond pricing, and also the wording of this question mattered. We

confirm this finding for the present module as well. When presented with the statement if interest

rates fall, bond prices will rise, only about one-third (36%) of respondents answered correctly;
                                                                                                 8


the wording was reversed and people were asked if interest rates fall, bond prices will fall , many

more are correct. This may be due to guessing, since a sizable proportion of respondents (as

many as 23%) reported they did not know the answer to this question.3 Note too that answers to

these questions are not highly correlated and only 6% could respond correctly to all four

questions. Moreover, more than a fourth answered “do not know” to at least one of the questions.



B. Knowledge of risk diversification

       Knowledge of risk diversification is very important when contemplating investment

options. Table 2 shows that many respondents (over 60%) seemed to know that it is not a good

idea to invest in a few stocks rather than in many stocks or in mutual funds, which may imply

some sophistication about risk. Moreover, the large majority seemed to know that spreading

money across 20 stocks rather than two decreases the risk of losing money. Yet again the way

both questions are worded matters, indicating that some respondents were simply guessing. We

hypothesize that some of the sensitivity to how the questions are asked could be due to economic

terminology. For instance, many respondents may not know what a mutual fund is or the fact that

mutual funds contain many stocks. Finally, close to half of the respondents agreed that by

diversifying, one could invest more in stocks; now there is little sensitivity to question wording,

perhaps because this question does not require much knowledge beyond what a stock is.

       While each individual question seems to indicate some knowledge and understanding of

risk diversification, only one-third (32%) of respondents answered correctly to all three questions

and 23% responded “do not know” to at least one question, showing that their knowledge was

limited to one specific concept.


3
       In prior research we have found that those who respond that they “do not know” are also
those who are least financially knowledgeable (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2006).
                                                                                                 9




C. Knowledge of fees

       Two questions in the module seek to assess peoples’ knowledge of fees associated with

investments; see Table 3. This is important since higher fees erode retirement wealth, yet prior

studies have shown that investors often overlook fees when deciding how to invest (Choi,

Laibson and Madrian, 2009; Mitchell, Todd and Bravo, 2008). In our sample, a sizable

percentage (60%) seemed to know that mutual fund fees are important when investing for the

long run, but the responses are sensitive to the wording of the questions, perhaps due to the fact

that the respondent would have to know both about mutual funds and what investing for the long

run means. Note also that a large majority of respondents found it difficult to locate mutual funds

with annual fees of less than one percent of assets, suggesting that many respondents may not

know about indexed funds. Moreover, only about one-quarter (28%) of respondents evinced

some financial sophistication with respect to fees by answering both questions correctly, while

more than 30% responded “do not know” to at least one of these two questions.



D. Savvy/numeracy

       While it is important to evaluate whether people know about fees, it is also important to

know whether they pursue behaviors that could reduce fees. Table 4 shows what respondents

knew regarding the question of whether “to make money in the market they should not buy and

sell stocks too often.” Most respondents (over 60%) seemed to be savvy with regard to buying

and selling stocks. Similarly, many respondents (almost 70%) were savvy about life insurance

and, for example, knew that replacing three years of income would be inadequate coverage for a

family with a working husband and a wife who stays home to take care of young children. Most
                                                                                                 10


respondents also knew that using money in a bank account to pay off credit card debt is usually a

good idea.

       Probably due to their simplicity, those questions elicit responses that are insensitive to

question wording. This is, however, not the case for a different query asked to assess whether

people know about the power of interest compounding and their ability to do rather complex

calculations involving interest rates. Over half seemed to be able to figure out that an initial

investment of $1,000 would grow more than six-fold when invested at an interest rate of 10% for

30 years. Nevertheless the alternative wording generates different answers, so at least some were

guessing. Moreover, only one quarter (22%) were able to give correct answers to all four

questions, and another quarter (22%) responded with “do not know” to at least one of these

questions.



E. Attitudes toward investing and risk

       Other questions in the module measure financial attitudes; see Table 5. One focuses on

older persons’ willingness to accept investment risk. It is interesting that a large majority of the

older respondents (68%) did not agree that “one should put all money into the safest investment

and accept whatever return it pays,” a notable finding given the timing of the survey. And most

respondents thought that even older retired households should hold some stocks, a finding very

much in line with the willingness to accept some risk displayed in the responses to the first

question. Many respondents were also aware that “even if one is smart, it is very difficult to pick

individual stocks that will have better than average returns.” In the latter case, however,

responses were vastly different depending on how the question was asked. Most respondents also
                                                                                                11


knew that investing in the stock market is better than buying lottery tickets, and that it is

incorrect to think that one has to be taken advantage of when investing in the stock market.

       While responses to these questions do seem to pick up some sophistication among

respondents, the fact that the question wording matters so much casts some doubt on whether

respondents were informed or simply guessing. Furthermore, since only one fifth of respondents

could answer all questions correctly and one fifth responded “do not know” to at least one

question, the evidence is indicative of widespread shortcomings in financial sophistication.



Who Knows the Least?

       As shown above, there is some evidence of financial sophistication when assessing the

answers to a large set of questions, but sophistication seems limited to a specific concept and the

fraction of respondents that can be considered sophisticated, at least judging from their responses

to this set of questions, is hardly above 25%. Next we explore how responses to these questions

vary by sex, education, age, and race/ethnicity.

       Table 6 shows that older women were substantially less likely than older men to report

they understood the stock market reasonably well. And while they did not differ much in how

they would invest in company stock, women were more likely to avoid investing in foreign

stocks. Moreover, they were less likely to be knowledgeable about asset pricing, i.e., the

relationship between bond prices and interest rates. They were also less knowledgeable than men

about risk diversification; for example, they were less likely to know that spreading money

across many stocks decreases the risk of losing money. This raises the question of whether some

of the attitudes toward risk that women display are due to preferences or to financial

sophistication.
                                                                                              12


        In terms of knowledge about fees, women were similar to men and sometimes they

seemed to know more. Further, their financial savvy was similar to men’s and in some cases,

they were more knowledgeable about adequate life insurance and how to be savvy about credit

cards. Nevertheless, women performed substantially less well in terms of numeracy and complex

calculations than men, confirming our findings from other surveys (Mitchell and Lusardi, 2006,

2008, 2009). We also note that the attitudes of women were not very different from those of men,

and while women tended to score a little lower than men in these questions, differences were

often not statistically significant.

        Overall, there was a gender gap in terms of financial sophistication between women and

men. Women were less knowledgeable about some of the complex concepts of finance and

investing, such as the working of the stock market, risk diversification, and asset pricing. They

also had more difficulty in doing complex calculations. Because women were more likely to

respond that they do not know the answers to the questions, they are more likely to be classified

among those with low knowledge. Of course, awareness of lack of knowledge could help women

acquire knowledge or become more active in seeking for help and counseling (Lusardi, Keller

and Keller, 2008).

        Table 7 reports how financial sophistication varies by educational level. Overall, the

proportion of sophisticated respondents increases monotonically as we move to higher

educational attainment and it is highest for those with at least a college degree. Some of the

differences are quite staggering. For example, only 14% of those with less than a high school

degree stated that they know how the stock market works reasonably well. For those with at

least a college degree the percentages are far higher, though even here, fewer than half agreed

with this assessment. These are worrisome statistics, in view of the shift in responsibility from
                                                                                                 13


employers to workers for saving and investing retirement wealth. Similarly, only one third (31%)

of respondents with less than a high school degree thought it was a good idea to invest in foreign

stocks; the share increases steadily across higher levels of education and more than doubles

(66%) among those with a college degree. This suggests that financial sophistication can be an

important determinant not only of stock market participation but also of the types of portfolios

that investors hold. Similarly, we find that the knowledge of asset pricing was very low among

those with less than a high school degree (23.5%), while it increased to more than 50% for the

college educated.

       Across all questions measuring risk diversification, there is a steep education gradient, so

the financially sophisticated tend be the most educated. This is true even for questions that do not

use economic terminology (e.g. do not require knowing what a mutual fund is and how it

operates). For example, the least educated were much less likely to know that holding 20 rather

than two stocks decreases the risk of losing a lot of money.

       With respect to fees, less educated respondents were unlikely to be aware of the

importance of fees, but there are no significant differences across educational grouping as to the

difficulty of finding low-cost mutual funds. We take this to imply that knowledge of indexed

funds is not widespread even among the educated, and/or that search and time costs are high for

most groups. Financial savvy was lower among those with less education; those respondents

were less skillful in doing complex calculations and in credit card debt management, a finding

consistent with other surveys (Lusardi and Tufano, 2009). It probably means that those with the

least knowledge will pay higher interest rates on their debt. It may be that the tendency to invest

in the safest investment is a proxy for having little knowledge, rather than risk aversion.
                                                                                                 14


       Responses to the financial sophistication questions also differed across age groups; see

Table 7. Few over age 75 understood the working of the stock market or were willing to buy

foreign stock, perhaps reflecting the fact of limited exposure to stock markets. Knowledge about

risk diversification declined steadily with age: older respondents were much less likely to know

how to decrease risk when investing in stocks, even when questions were phrased simply. Many

respondents stated that fees were important, but older respondents found it more difficult to

locate low-fee mutual funds. This might be due to their lesser facility with the internet or reduced

cognitive ability. People age 75+ seemed less savvy as well; they were less likely to know that

one loses money by trading stocks often or how to manage credit card debt, and they were less

likely to be correct in complex calculations about interest compounding. Older investors were

also more wary of being taken advantage of in the stock market, consistent with their lower

levels of financial sophistication.

       In Table 9 we summarize differences across race/ethnicity. Knowledge about the stock

market low was particularly low among African-Americans and Hispanics, where only 21% and

15%, respectively, reported that they understood the stock market reasonably well. This lesser

knowledge was also apparent in responses to questions about company stock, foreign stocks, and

asset pricing. Sharp differences in knowledge also emerged regarding risk diversification. Even

when questions did not refer to concepts such as mutual funds, the percentage of respondents

knowing about risk diversification was much lower among African-Americans and Hispanics.

Nonwhites were also less likely to know about adequate life insurance, that stock market trading

is costly, and that is a good idea to pay off credit cards with bank saving. They were also less

likely to be correct in calculations involving interest compounding. Some of the answers to these

questions may simply pick up the limited experience that respondents have with stocks and
                                                                                                   15


bonds, and also with credit cards. Note also that the attitudes of African-Americans and

Hispanics differed markedly from those of White respondents. For example, Hispanics were

substantially more likely to think they should put all of their money in the safest investment they

can find and accept whatever return it pays. Moreover, they were more likely to think that

“investing in the stock market is no better than buying lottery tickets,” and that “there is no way

to avoid people taking advantage of you if you invest in the stock market.” These findings are

supportive of prior surveys on differences in financial literacy by race/ethnicity (Lusardi and

Mitchell, 2006, 2007a, 2007b, 2009).



Implications

       In this paper, and in much of our earlier work, we have found substantial shortfalls in

older persons’ levels of financial literacy and financial sophistication. The value-added of the

present research is to illuminate key areas where more could be done to inform, educate, and

deepen peoples’ understanding of what must be done to diversify investments, reduce costs, and

make retirement saving more effective. We have used an extensive module fielded in the 2008

HRS to explore knowledge about capital markets and risk diversification, knowledge of fees,

financial savvy/numeracy, and attitudes toward investing and risk. We also exploit differences in

question wording to gain insight into whether respondents are guessing or actually know the

answers to the questions posed.

       For this sample of older respondents over the age of 55, we find that people lack even a

rudimentary understanding of stock and bond prices, risk diversification, portfolio choice, and

investment fees. Furthermore, people that got one question correct were not particularly likely to

get others correct, and “do not know” responses were quite widespread. Simpler questions that
                                                                                                   16


avoided economic jargon were easier to answer. We also conclude that the way in which the

questions were framed mattered: for instance, 38% answered correctly when asked to opine on

the following statement:“it is easy to pick individual company stock that will have better than

average returns” whereas 74% answered correctly when the reverse wording was offered “it is

hard to pick individual company stock that will have better than average returns.” This suggests

that more research is needed on the way in which financial sophistication questions are framed,

to evaluate whether and how to help people develop a fuller understanding of how retirement

saving and investment work.

       This analysis may be of use to those working to enhance retirement security. It is clear

that employees and retirees are increasingly being asked to take on tasks requiring financial

sophistication, including making saving, investment, and dissaving decisions for retirement. Our

research suggests that it may be particularly important to build human capital via retirement,

educational programs, and retirement planning products. Nevertheless, one-size-fits-all programs

are unlikely to successfully address saving shortfalls particularly among the elderly, given the

very different patterns we have discerned by sex, age, educational levels, and race/ethnicity. Our

research suggests that programs targeted to address fundamental differences in preferences,

saving needs, and financial knowledge as well as sophistication, could be more effective.
