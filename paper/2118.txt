                 Why Have Corporate Tax Revenues Declined?


                                  ABSTRACT


     This paper examines the source of changes in corporate tax revenues

during the last twenty—five years. It finds that legislative changes explain

less than half of the revenue decline during this period. Falling corporate

profits have had a larger influence on revenue collections than all

legislative changes taken together, a result that is often obscured in studies

focusing solely on the average corporate tax rate. Changes in capital

recovery provisions are the most important legislative factor influencing

corporate tax revenues, especially in the last five years.

     The paper also considers the impact of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The

new law will increase the average tax rate on corporate profits by

approximately 10 percent. By 1990, the average tax rate will equal its level

in the late 1970s, although it will remain substantially below its level in

the 1960s and the early 1970$.

     Corporate income tax revenues have declined dramatically during the last

two decades. The corporate tax accounted for almost twenty percent of federal

receipts during the 1960s, compared with only seven percent of federal

receipts in the last five years. Federal corporate taxes averaged 3.9 percent

of GNP during the first five years of the 1960s, 2.7 percent of GNP for the

first five years of the 1970s, and only 1.4 percent of GNP for the first five

years of the 1980s. In 1985, the tax to GNP ratio was less than half what it

was ten years ago, and only one quarter as large as in 1955. In 1982, real

corporate tax payments were lower than in any year since 1940. Although

corporate taxes in each of the last three years were substantially greater

than in 1982, the average level of tax receipts remains at its postwar low.

     The erosion of corporate tax revenues is widely regarded as the result of

legislative changes. For example, a frequently cited study by Mcintyre (1984)

argues:

     The decline of the corporate tax began with the adoption of the
     investment tax credit in the 1960s, and continued into the 1970s
     as Congress adopted one loophole after another in response to
     corporate lobbyists.., the largest single blow to the corporate
     tax came in 1981 with the passage of ... the Accelerated Cost
     Recovery System, which opened up massive new possibilities for
     corporate tax avoidance. p.1]

This viewpoint clearly influenced the architects of the recently-enacted Tax

Reform Act of 1986. The new laws stringent corporate minimum tax of

20 percent, coupled with significant reductions in capital recovery

allowances, will raise corporate taxes by $120 billion during the next five

years.

     This paper examines why corporate taxes have declined. It decomposes
                                     —2—


movements in federal tax receipts into components attributable to changes in

tax rates, changes in tax preferences, changes in corporate profitability, and

other factors. The results suggest that while legislative changes have been

important contributors to the decline of corporate tax revenues, they account

for less than half of the change since the mid-1960s. Reduced profitability,

which has shrunk the corporate tax base, is the single most important cause of

declining corporate taxes.

     The paper is divided into five sections. The first section documents the

decline in corporate tax revenues during the last three decades. Section 2

presents a simple division of changes in corporate taxes into components due

to changes in tax rules and changes in the corporate tax base. It shows that

during the last twenty years, while the average tax rate has fallen by nearly

one third, corporate profitability has declined by a factor of two. Section 3

examines the factors which have been most important in reducing average

corporate tax rates. It focuses on changes in capital recovery,

inflation—induced misstatement of corporate profits, and various legislative

changes. The fourth section examines the expected revenue gains under the Tax

Reform Act of 1986, and presents preliminary evidence on how the bill will

alter average tax rates. There is a brief conclusion.



1.   The WitherinQ Corporate Income Tax


     The decline in corporate taxes played an important part in stimulating

recent calls for tax reform. The withering of the corporate income tax,

however, began long before the passage of the Economic Recovery Tax Act in
                                     —3—



1981. Corporate tax payments as a share of GNP or the value of corporate

assets have been declining for nearly three decades. This trend accelerated

during the last five years, when real corporate taxes also declined.

     Table 1 presents four measures of the net corporate tax payments by

nonfinancial corporations. We measure tax payments net of refunds obtained by

carrying current losses back to offset prior taxes, and including taxes

collected as a result of audits or other retabulations. A detailed

description of our data series is provided in the appendix. We focus on

nonfinancial corporate firms (NFCs) because they were most significantly

affected by the changes in capital recovery rules under ERTA. The NFCs

accounted for eighty-nine percent of corporate tax revenues in 1984 and 1985,

and movements in their tax payments track total taxes very closely. There are

also a number of detailed tax provisions which affect financial firms (see

Galper and Neubig (1983)) that we avoid by focusing on the NFCs.

     The first column of Table 1 reports the NFC's real corporate tax

payments, measured in 1986 dollars. These tax payments peaked at $92.5

billion in 1968, and with the exception of three years in the late 1970s, have

been substantially below this level ever since. Average tax payments by the

NFCs were $78.6 billion in the 1960s, $76.4 billion in the 1970s, and $49.6

billion for the last five years. The data demonstrate the recent decline in

corporate tax revenues, however, since average payments for the 1976-80 period

were 63 percent greater than average revenues in the last five years.

     This decline in corporate taxes is even more remarkable when viewed in

the context of the growing economy. The second and third columns in Table 1

describe corporate taxes relative to GNP and corporate assets. Corporate

taxes averaged 3.7 percent of t3NP during the 1960s, compared with 1.3 percent

during the first half of the 1980s. In 1982, when corporate taxes reached

their postwar low, they accounted for only 0.9 percent of GNP. An equally

pronounced decline emerges from column three, which shows the ratio of tax

payments by nonfinancial corporations to the net replacement value of the-jr

tangible assets. This asset measure is constructed by subtracting corporate

debt outstanding from the replacement cost of corporate tangible assets, and

provides a natural scaling variable for corporate taxes since it reflects

changes in the size of the corporate sector. Tax payments by NFCs averaged

4.6 percent of net assets during the first five years of the 1960s, and were

even higher at the end of the 1950s. The tax—to-asset ratio has fallen by a

factor of three during the last twenty-five years. For the five years ended

1985, it averaged 1.5 percent, and it fell below 1 percent in 1982. Taxes as

a percent of assets fell by 1.4 percent between the 1961-65 and 1971-75

periods, and declined by as much again during the last ten years.

     Corporate taxes have also become a substantially less important part of

the federal budget. They accounted for 6.5 percent of revenues during the

most recent five years. By comparison, corporate taxes were nearly three

times as important, accounting for 18.7 percent of federal revenues, during

the 1961-65 period. The rapid growth of federal revenues from other sources,

particularly social insurance taxes, coupled with declining corporate taxes to

explain the pronounced reduction in the corporate tax share during the last

twenty-five years.

2.    Declining Tax Rates vs. Declining Tax Base


      The decline in corporate taxes can be divided into two components: a

decline in the rate at which corporate profits are taxed, and a decline in

corporate profits themselves. The first component is the average tax rate,

which has attracted widespread attention in the tax policy debate of the last

five years (see Joint Tax Committee (1984) or Spooner (1986) for example).

Many analyses of the corporate tax focus exclusively on the average rate,

however, and imply the misleading conclusion that its movements are the sole

cause of recent reductions in corporate tax revenues. This section

demonstrates that while average tax rates have -in fact declined, changes in

corporate profits, the base of the corporate income tax, are an

equally—important factor -in explaining the change in corporate taxes.


2.1 Effective Tax Rates and the Tax—to-Asset Ratio

      The tax—to--asset ratio is the product of the average tax rate and the

corporate profit rate:


(1)         TAXES/ASSETS = (TAXES/PROFITS)*(PROFITS/ASSETS).


PROFITS denote the real economic profits earned by corporate equity-holders,1

TAXES/PROFITS is the average effective tax rate, and PROFITS/ASSETS defines

the real economic profit rate. PROFITS excludes foreign source income of U.S.

corporations, since our asset measure includes only domestic capital. A

detailed description of our measure of economic profits is provided in the

appendix.

and the profit rate for each year since 1959, the year when some IRS data used

in our calculations first became available. The data clearly indicate that

both falling average tax rates and a decline in profitability have contributed

to lower corporate taxes.   The average effective tax rate is 41.8 percent

during the 1960s, compared with 30.8 percent during the last five years, a

decline of more than one quarter. Average tax rates declined throughout the

1970s, averaging 43.4 percent for the 1971-75 period and 40.1 percent for the

1976-80 period. The average effective tax rate for the 1981-1985 period was

9 percent lower than its value for the 1976—80 period. This decline is twice

as large as the drop between the first and second halves of the 1970s.

     The second column of Table 2 reports the economic profit rate on

nonfinancial corporate capital. The profit rate trends down throughout our

sample period, but drops particularly sharply in the 1980s. From an average

of 10.9 percent during the 1960s, the profit rate fell to 7.2 percent during

the 1970s and 4.9 percent during the last five years. In 1982, when corporate

taxes reached their postwar low, the corporate profit rate was also at its

lowest level (2.9 percent). Although profits accruing to equity holders have

rebounded since then, averaging 6.3 percent in the last two years, they are

still well below their level in the previous two decades.

     This dramatic decline in corporate profits is an important source of

lower corporate tax receipts. The last column of Table 2 shows that the

tax—to-asset ratio at the beginning of the 1960s, for example, was 3.1 times
                                        —7—



that at the beginning of the 1980s. The average effective tax rate was 1.35

times its level in recent years, while the profit rate was 2.2 times its

recent value. Declining profitability is therefore substantially more

important than changes in the average tax rate in accounting for the reduction

in corporate taxes.

      The relative importance of changes in tax rates and the tax base can be

illustrated by calculating what corporate tax receipts in the early 1980s

would have been if either of the average tax rate or the profit rate had

remained at its earlier level while the other changed over time. Actual

corporate tax receipts averaged 49.6 billion 1986 dollars in the 1981—1985

period. If the profitability of corporate assets had been the same as in the

1960s, tax receipts would have more than doubled to $110.4 billion. Even

setting the profit rate equal to its value for the 1976-80 period would have

increased annual revenues by over $20 billion, to $72.5 billion. Fixing the

average effective tax rate at its earlier level would also have raised taxes,

though not by as much as the return to earlier profit levels. If the tax rate

during the last five years had returned to its level in the early 1960s, taxes

would have averaged $68.4 billion per year. Replacing the actual tax rate

with its average value for the late 1970s would raise tax receipts by

$13 billion to $62.5 billion per year.


2.2   Interpreting   the Average Tax Rate

      Although our division of the tax-to-asset ratio into average tax rate and

profit rate components may provide some insight into the source of declining

tax revenues, the two components are not independent. The nature of the
                                      -8-


corporate income tax makes the average tax rate critically dependent upon the

level of corporate profits. For taxable firms, many corporate tax deductions,

such as depreciation allowances and tax credits, may be claimed regardless of

the level of profits. A one percent increase in profits therefore raises the

firm's taxable corporate income by more than 1 percent, increasing the average

tax rate.

     An offsetting effect arises for non—taxable firms. For firms with

negative taxable income and no capacity to carry losses back against prior

taxes, current tax payments will be zero regardless of how negative their real

economic income is. An increase in profitability will not affect their taxes.

It will, however increase their economic profits, which enter the denominator

of the average tax rate calculation for the entire corporate sector. These

links between profitability and tax rates make it impossible to interpret

changes in the average tax rate solely as the result of legislation.

     A simple example can illustrate these points. Consider a firm that

purchases a capital asset for $1000 and is entitled to tax depreciation

allowances of $150 per year, while the asset's true economic depreciation is

$100 per year. If the firm uses no debt and has no other inputs to the

production process, then its real economic profits are its receipts less $100.

If the economic profit rate is 7 percent, receipts will equal $170 and the

firm's taxable income will be $20. Assuming a flat-rate corporate income tax

with a 0.50 marginal rate, the firm pays $10 in taxes for an average tax rate

of 10/70 =   .142, and a tax-to-asset ratio of .01. Now consider what happens
if the economic profit rate rises to 10 percent, bringing receipts to $200.

Taxable income rises to $50, so taxes are $25, the tax-to-asset ratio is .025,
                                      —9-


with a 0.50 marginal rate, the firm pays $10 in taxes for an average tax rate

of 10/70 = .142, and a tax-to-asset ratio of .01. Now consider what happens

if the economic profit rate rises to 10 percent, bringing receipts to $200.

Taxable income rises to $50, so taxes are $25, the tax-to-asset ratio is .025,

and the average tax rate is 0.25. Shocks to corporate profits therefore affect

measured average tax rates, even when the tax system is held constant.

     To illustrate how, if some firms have tax losses, increased profits can

lower the average tax rate, we introduce a second firm.   It owns assets

identical to those of the first firm, which earns a 7 percent return, but -it

operates in a different market with a 3 percent profit rate. Its receipts are

$130, taxable income equals -$20, and it pays no taxes. The aggregate tax

rate, computed by adding together the taxes of both firms and dividing by the

sum of their profits, is 19.2 percent (25/130). The aggregate profit rate is

6.5 percent (130/2000). Now consider what happens if the second firm's profit

rate rises to 5 percent. Its taxable income is now exactly zero but it still

pays no taxes, so the aggregate average tax rate is 16.7 percent (25/150),

down from 19.2 percent. The aggregate profit rate rises to 7.5 percent,

illustrating the possibility of a negative relationship between profitability

and the aggregate average tax rate.

     The sensitivity of average tax rates to economic conditions is only one

of their many shortcomings as a measure of corporate tax burdens. It is well

known (see Auerbach (1983) or Fullerton (1984)) that average tax rates may

provide little information on the pattern of marginal tax incentives facing

new investments. In addition, aggregate average tax rates may conceal

important differences in tax burdens across different assets and different
                                      -10-


by banks that invest in municipal debt, as part of the total tax burden.

Likewise, many sources of true economic income are ignored, since certain

accounting practices that misstate economic income are not corrected. This

problem even applies to the National Income Accounts. An example of such a

misstatement is the inappropriate timing of expenses under the completed

contract accounting method. Accounting differences accentuate the problem of

comparing average tax rates across industries.



3.   Why Have Average Tax Rates Declined?


     The last section demonstrated that declining profits and declining

average tax rates are jointly responsible for the dramatic fall in corporate

taxes. Despite numerous shortcomings, average tax rates do prove useful in

analyzing changes in corporate tax revenues. They have also played an

important part in the recent corporate tax reform debate. This section

therefore extends our previous analysis by investigating the proximate causes

of declining average tax rates. The source of recent changes in corporate

profitability constitutes an unresolved puzzle which is beyond the scope of

the current paper.2


3.1 Statutory Tax Rates versus Average Tax Rates

     Movements in average tax rates may be traced to changes in capital

recovery provisions, the increased prevalence of firms with tax losses,

increased use of investment tax credits, and other factors. Each of these

factors causes the average tax rate to differ from the statutory maximum rate,
                                     —11—


as shown in Table 3. The first column in Table 3 shows the maximum statutory

tax rate for each year from 1959 to 1985. The entries in the six middle

columns describe how various factors have caused the average tax rate to

differ from the statutory rate. Negative entries indicate factors that caused

the average tax rate to be less than the statutory rate, while positive

entries correspond to factors that increased the tax burden above the

statutory rate. The average tax rate, TAXES/PROFITS, is reported in the last

column. It it the sum of the maximum statutory tax rate plus the six

adjustment factors in the middle columns. A detailed description of our

methodology for decomposing the average tax rate is provided in the appendix.

     The first source of differences between statutory and average tax rates

is increasingly-generous capital recovery, as shown in the second column of

Table 3. This term includes both the tax reduction from use of the investment

tax credit, as well as that due to differences between tax depreciation and

true economic depreciation. During the most recent five year period, capital

recovery provisions accounted for a 22 percent differential between the

statutory and the average tax rate. This is a substantial increase from the

late 1970s, when these provisions explained a 9.5 percent difference between

the two tax rates, or the 1960s, when these factors reduced the average tax

rate by 8.9 percent. Because generous capital recovery provisions have been

one of the popular villains behind the recent decline in corporate taxes, we

shall return below to provide a more detailed breakdown of these effects.

     The third column in Table 3 reports the effect of inflation on average

tax rates. This column combines two separate influences. First, inflation

leads to spurious inventory profits that raise corporate tax payments and the

average tax rate. (Inflation's positive impact through a related channel, the

failure to index depreciation allowances for inflation, is subsumed in the

capital recovery term above). Inflation also exerts a countervailing effect

on the average tax rate by reducing the real value of corporate debt,

generating capital gains for equity holders. These gains are untaxed, so

inflation raises economic income but does not affect taxes. The two effects

roughly cancel, resulting in a small net effect of inflation on the average

tax rate. Inflation raised the average tax rate by less than 1 percent during

the 1970s, and it has reduced the average tax rate by 3.5 percent during the

1980s.

     The fourth column in Table 3 indicates the impact of imperfect

loss-offset provisions on the average tax rate. The principal effect of

imperfect loss offset is to raise the average tax rate when firms experience

losses, since firms with negative income cannot claim tax refunds. Tax

receipts are therefore higher than they would be in a system with proportional

taxation of economic income. This effect is somewhat attenuated by the

availability of loss carrybacks and net operating loss carryforwards.

Carrybacks allow some loss offset in the year when losses occur. Loss

carryforwards, in contrast, reduce a firm's current tax liability as a result

of previous losses.

     Imperfect loss offset provisions may raise or lower the average tax rate,

depending on whether net operating loss deductions exceed the value of losses

not carried back. The entries in column four of Table 3 shows that throughout

the 1959-1985 period imperfect loss offsets generated a substantial net

increase in the average tax rate. For the most recent five years, the
                                         —13-


provisions regarding losses increased the average tax rate by 11.8 percent.

This is much larger than the impact of losses in any previous period.

Imperfect loss offsets accounted for a 4.4 percent increase in the average tax

rate in the 1970s, and a 3.2 percent increase during the 1960s. This result

deserves emphasis: the increased incidence of tax losses during the 1980s has

increased, not reduced, the average corporate tax rate.

     The fifth column of Table 3 describes how foreign tax provisions affect

the average tax rate. This term consists of two parts. The first measures

the increase in taxes that would have resulted if foreign source income were

taxable at the U.S. statutory rate, while the second reduces taxes by the

amount of foreign tax credits claimed. If the statutory tax rates in all

other countries equalled that in the United States and all firms could utilize

foreign tax credits in full, then the net foreign tax effect in our table

would equal zero. If foreign countries levied taxes at rates below the

domestic rate, the foreign tax effect would be positive since the domestic

taxes on foreign source income would exceed the foreign tax credit. In our

data, the net effect of foreign tax provisions is a small increase in the

average tax rate. This effect averages 0.4 percent in the last five years,

compared with 0.45 percent during the 1970s and 1960s.

     The sixth and seventh columns of Table 3 indicate the influence of two

other factors, tax progressivity and an "other" category which includes post-

tabulation revisions and miscellaneous tax credits, on the average tax rate.

Neither factor has a large effect. Tax progressivity, which accounts for the

fact that some corporate income is taxed at rates below the statutory maximum,

lowers the average tax rate by roughly 3.5 percent with little variation over
                                     —14-


time. The "other" category usually raises the average corporate tax rate,

since the results of tax audits are included in this category and they

outweigh the other tax credits.

     Table 3 clearly suggests that the most important factor causing average

tax rates to fall below the statutory rate are capital recovery provisions.

For the last five years, capital recovery provisions depressed the average tax

rate by 14 percent more than they did during the 1960s and by 13 percent more

than during the late 1970s. We now consider a more detailed breakdown of

changes in capital recovery provisions.


3.2 Changes in Capital Recovery Provisions

     The capital recovery variable in Table 3 has two parts: one due to the

capital consumption adjustment, and the other due to the investment tax

credit. The capital consumption adjustment is the difference between tax

depreciation and real economic depreciation. It has two components:

Accelerated Depreciation, and Basis Misstatement. Accelerated Depreciation is

the difference between tax depreciation and economic depreciation at historic

cost. Tax depreciation is based on tax service lives and depreciation

schedules. It usually provides larger depreciation allowances than would

application of realistic economic lifetimes and decay patterns to the historic

costs of corporate assets. Taxable income therefore understates economic

income, reducing the average tax rate. The second term, Basis Misstatement,

measures the difference between straight—line depreciation using economic

asset lives but historic asset costs and that using the same decay profiles

but revaluing assets each year to their current replacement cost. Failure to
                                      —15—


index the basis of depreciable assets raises taxable income above economic

income and therefore increases the average tax rate.

      The data in Table 4 show the relative importance of the three parts of

the capital recovery aggregate. During the last five years, accelerated

depreciation reduced the average tax rate by 35 percent, the ITC lowered -it

13 percent, and inflationary misstatement of asset basis raised it by

26 percent. These large offsetting effects correspond to the net effect of

-22   percent that is reported in the third column of Table 3. All three
factors have become larger in absolute value during our sample period. In the

1960s, for example, accelerated depreciation lowered the average rate by

11.9 percent, inflation effects raised it by 5.4 percent, and the ITC lowered

it by another 2.3 percent.

      These results naturally raise the question of whether movements in the

capital recovery factor are primarily the result of legislative changes, or

whether they have been caused by other forces such as a shift in the

composition of investment toward equipment rather than structures. Although

separating average tax rate movements into components due to legislative and

other changes is a treacherous exercise, some illustrative calculations are

nonetheless possible. Ziemer (1985) estimates the change in federal corporate

tax revenues due to the passage of ERTA and TEFRA, and presents a separate

calculation for the impact of accelerated depreciation and other provisions.

Using his revenue estimates, we calculate that the average tax rate would have

been about 7 percent higher during the last four years if ACRS had not been

adopted. This corresponds to increased revenues of $20 billion per year, on

average, since 1982. The effect would have been largest in 1985, the year

with the largest stock of assets receiving generous ACRS depreciation.

     Although ACRS has lowered corporate taxes in the past four years,

focusing only on the immediate post-enactment effects of tax legislation can

be misleading. Passage of a bill such as the Economic Recovery Tax Act

depresses corporate taxes by more in the period immediately after enactment

than it does in the steady state. Immediately after enactment, revenues are

reduced both because new assets are given substantial depreciation benefits

immediately after installation, and because some relatively old pre-reform

assets are still eligible for depreciation benefits under the prior, less

generous depreciation rules. In the steady state, only the generous

depreciation for new assets reduces revenues. This partially explains why,

even without the 1986 Tax Reform Act, corporate tax revenues were expected to

rise during the late 1980s. An opposite effect arises with the recent

legislation, which lengthens asset lives. It will collect more revenue in the

short run than in the steady state, because some aging pre—TRA assets are

paying higher taxes than they would had they been depreciated under the new

rules.




4.   Corporate Taxes Under the 1986 Tax Reform Act


     The recently enacted Tax Reform Act of 1986 shifts $120 billion of

federal tax liability from households to corporations over the 1987—1991

period. The IRA will therefore affect both the average tax rate and the

tax-to-asset ratio for nonfinancial corporations. This section uses revenue

projections from the Congressional Budget Office (1986) to estimate the course
                                       —17—


of average tax rates over the next five years. It compares the tax trajectory

without the Tax Reform Act with   the trajectory under the new legislation, and
places the increased corporate tax burden in historical perspective.

     Table 5 compares the paths of corporate tax payments under old law and

the Tax Reform Act of 1986. A detailed description of the calculations is

provided in the appendix. The first panel shows the level of corporate tax

payments by NFC5 in 1986 dollars under the two regimes. Even under old law,

corporate taxes are projected to rise. By 1990, for example, they will be

77 percent higher than in the first five years of the 1980s. Rising corporate

tax payments can be traced to two sources. First, corporate profits are

forecast to rise in the late 1980s. Our CBO-based projections imply a profit

rate of 8.2 percent for the period 1987-1991, compared with 4.9 percent in the

early 1980s. In addition, the front-loading of depreciation under ACRS

implies that the average tax rate on projects undertaken since 1981 is low

early in the project's life and high later on. As more projects reach the

high-tax stage of their life cycle, corporate taxes also rise.

     Under the Tax Reform Act, revenues rise even more rapidly than under old

law. By 1990 corporate taxes from the NFCs exceed $100 billion (1986

dollars), more than double the level of the past five years. For the

1987-1991 period, corporate taxes are 22 percent greater under the IRA than

under current law. The new bill's revenue impact is largest in 1987, when it

raises over 30 percent more revenue than the current law. This is because

rates remain high, but most tax preferences have been eliminated.

     The two lower panels of Table 5 show corporate taxes relative to GNP and

corporate assets. Under current law the tax-to-GNP ratio would rise from

        of 1986.

1.2 percent in 1985 to 1.8 percent in 1991, while the Tax Reform Act raises

this ratio to 2.2 percent. The new law therefore returns the tax-to-GNP ratio

to its level during the late 1970s, but not to the level (3.2 percent on

average) of the 1960s. A similar statement applies to the ratio of tax

payments to net NFC assets, which is plotted in Figure 1. From an average of

1.5 percent in the 1981-85 period, this tax measure rises to 2.6 percent under

old law and to 3.1 percent under new law by 1991. The new law will double the

ratio of taxes to corporate assets, although this ratio will still be lower

than it was during the 1960s.

     Although part of the change in tax revenues is due to anticipated

increases in corporate profits, the average tax rate will also change

significantly during the next five years. This is shown in the first two rows

of Table 6, which report the average tax rates under old law and under the Tax

Reform Act for the 1986—1991 period. Without any legislative change, the

average tax rate would have increased from 0.24 in 1985 to 0.30 by 1990. This

is higher than in the first five years of the 1980s, but still below the level

of the late 1970s. Under new law, by comparison, the average tax rate rises

to 0.36 by the end of the decade, almost returning to its level of the late

1970s. The Tax Reform Act has its largest impact on the tax rate in the

transition period, 1987 and 1988, when the ratio of taxes to economic profits

rises by 8.1 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively. Figure 2 plots the

movements in average tax rates both for the 1959-1985 period as well as for

the next five years under both old and new law.

     The Tax Reform Act of 1986 changes numerous provisions in the corporate

income tax. The Joint Tax Committee's revenue estimates, for example, include

seventeen major categories, and hundreds of minor categories, through which

revenue changes occur. A detailed analysis of why the average tax rate will

differ from the statutory rate is impossible because many of the required data

series are unavailable. We can, however, provide a rough sketch of why the

average tax rate changes under the new law.

     The last four rows in Table 6 disaggregate changes in the effective tax

rate between old law and the Tax Reform Act into four categories. The first,

the change in the statutory rate, reduces the average rate. There are no rate

changes for 1986. In 1987, the statutory rate falls by 6 percent to the

40 percent "blended" rate for a company whose fiscal year coincides with the

calendar year. Beginning in calendar 1988, the top statutory rate is

34 percent.

     Several provisions offset the statutory rate reduction and raise the

average tax rate. The next row shows the impact of changes in capital

recovery provisions, principally the repeal of the Investment Tax Credit and

the extension of tax depreciation lives. This accounts for an 11 percent

increase in the average tax rate in 1991. In the earlier years it is somewhat

less important, principally because transition rules allow a substantial share

of the investment undertaken prior to 1988 to obtain favorable tax

treatment .5

     The penultimate row in Table 6 shows how changes in accounting rules

affect the average tax rate. There are a number of important provisions in

this category, including changes affecting long-term contracts, the

capitalization of construction and development costs, and the treatment of

capital gains on installment obligations. These accounting changes raise the
                                     -20—


average tax rate by nearly 5 percent in 1988, and by an average of 3.8 percent

during the 1987-1991 period.6 The final row of Table 6 shows how various

other factors cause the average tax rate under the new law to differ from that

under previous law. These provisions include the strengthened minimum tax,

changes in foreign tax credit provisions, and revenues from increased tax

compliance. These miscellaneous provisions increase the average tax rate by

4.4 percent in 1991.

    Although our calculations of the factors behind changes in average tax

rates are necessarily uncertain, they do underscore two important features of

the 1985 Tax Reform Act. First, changes in capital recovery provisions will

significantly raise corporate taxes. By the late 1980s, the differential

between the statutory and the average tax rate that will be attributable to

capital recovery rules will return to its level in the 1960s and 1970s. The

Tax Reform Act therefore reverses the changes of the early 1980s, when the

combination of accelerated depreciation and investment credits lowered average

tax rates by as much as 25 percent. Second, many of the important

revenue-raising provisions in the new law are excluded from the usual economic

analysis of corporate tax incentives. Marginal effective tax rate

calculations, such as those in King and Fullerton (1984), do not usually

incorporate particular accounting rules, minimum taxes, or many of the other

provisions that have an important effect on corporate investment incentives.

5. Conclusions


    This paper explores why corporate tax revenues have declined for the last

thirty years. Contrary to many claims, legislative changes explain less than

half of the decline in revenues since the mid-1960s.   The decline in

corporate profits, which averaged nearly 11 percent of the value of net

corporate assets during the 1960s as compared with just under 5 percent in the

1980s, is a more important factor.

    Declining corporate tax revenues have been accompanied by a decline in the

average tax rate, the ratio of corporate taxes to economic profits. While

this average tax rate is of limited value for analyzing the incentive effects

of the corporate tax, it has attracted widespread attention in the recent tax

reform discussion. Changes in both the tax law and the rate of corporate

profits affect the average tax rate. The change in depreciation provisions

between the late 1970s and the early 1980s reduced the average tax rate by

roughly 13 percent.

     The Tax Reform Act of 1986, which raises $120 billion in corporate taxes

over the next five years, accelerates the trend toward rising average tax

rates that would have occurred under old law. Reduced capital recovery

allowances and other changes in the 1986 Act will combine to raise average

effective tax rates to 36 percent by 1990, compared with 31 percent in the

first five years of the 1980s. Corporate taxes as a share of GNP and relative

to corporate assets will also rise significantly. By 1990, federal tax

payments will equal 3 percent of net corporate assets, well above their level

in the early 1980s and approximately equal to their asset share in the late
                                     —22—


1970s. Taxes will still remain a smaller fraction of assets than they were in

the 19605, however, in part because corporate profitability is projected to be

well below its level two decades ago. Although we focus on the Tax Reform

Act's revenue impact over the next five years, this is a potentially

misleading indicator of a tax bill's revenue effects. By lengthening the

depreciation lives of many assets, the new law raises corporate tax revenues

in the short run at the expense of some reduction in future years. The

inherent uncertainty in long-range forecasts, however, makes it difficult to

quantify these effects.

     Much of our analysis implicitly divorces the average tax rate from the

corporate profit rate, although such a separation is in fact impossible.

Because corporate taxes do not rise proportionally with corporate profits,

changes in the profit rate have a direct influence on the average tax rate.

Over longer horizons, the average tax rate may also affect the profit rate, at

least if average and marginal tax rates move in tandem. Higher tax burdens

will induce offsetting reductions in capital investment which should increase

pretax profitability.

     Finally, our analysis of revenue changes in the 1986 Tax Reform Act

suggests that a wide range of corporate tax provisions which have important

revenue effects are typically ignored in the economic analysis of the

corporate income tax. These provisions affect both the average and marginal

tax rates on new investment, and deserve to be incorporated in future work.

                                  Footnotes

1.   Alternative views of what constitutes the corporate tax base are also
possible. Feldstein and Summers (1979) and Feldstein, Dicks-Mireaux, and
Poterba (1983) consider the total earnings of the corporate sector, including
those paid to debt-holders, as the tax base. Because interest payments are
taxed less heavily than equity earnings, measuring the average tax rate
relative to this base would lower the average tax rate but not affect its
decline over time. The profit rate associated with this concept of corporate
profits has also declined significantly during our sample period.

2.   Since we are concerned primarily with the impact of legislative changes
on tax receipts, we focus on the role of tax reforms in altering the average
tax rate. Although tax changes may also affect revenues by altering profits,
this effect is likely to be small over the time horizons we consider.

3.   Our calculations may overstate the importance of capital recovery
provisions in lowering the average tax rate, because we assume that all
changes in the difference between tax and economic depreciation were actually
claimed by firms. For firms which are carrying losses forward, this will
overstate the importance of depreciation provisions, and overstate the
importance of losses as well.

4.   Although revenues will be lower immediately after a tax reform like ERTA
than in the steady state, it does not follow that tax revenues two years after
the reform are higher than those in the year after the reform. There is a
countervailing revenue—reducing effect: as the stock of assets being
depreciated under the generous new rules rises, tax receipts may decline.

5.   Our measure of the average tax rate change due to capital recovery may
understate the actual impact of the new law because of the interaction between
depreciation provisions and the strengthened minimum tax. For firms with
substantial depreciation deductions, the new minimum tax may raise tax
payments. This is classified as an effect of the minimum tax, not
depreciation rules, in our analysis.

6. An important caveat applies to the accounting-induced change in average
tax rates. Table 6 reports the accounting-induced change in taxes divided by
our measure of economic income. Each accounting change, however, also affects
the measured value of economic income. Repeal of the completed contract
method of accounting, for example, will change the IRS measure of receipts
less deductions that forms the basis for our profits variable. Average tax
rates computed relative to measured economic income under the new tax regime,
therefore, would be slightly lower than those reported here since income will
be higher as a result of these accounting changes. Average tax rates in all
previous years, computed relative to an economic income measure which did not
allow for deferred accrual under the completed contract method, would be lower
than those reported in Tables 2 and 3. The change in average rates over time
is not affected by the choice of convention for economic income, even though
the level of the average rate is.

                               Technical Appendix

        Description of the Average Tax Rate Decomposition and Data Sources


       This appendix explains how we allocate changes in the average tax rate

into various components, describes our measures of tax payments and economic

income for nonfinancial corporations, and presents a detailed account of our

post-1986 projections.


The Average Tax Rate Decomposition
                                                                            -


       Our average tax rate decomposition begins from the definition of federal

tax receipts from the NFCs:


(Al)        TAXES = T*A*ISTT - CBACKS - ITC    -   FTC - OTHCRED + RETAB.


ISTT denotes income subject to tax, T   is   the maximum statutory corporate tax

rate, and A is a "progressivity parameter" reflecting the fact that not all

taxable income is taxed at the top marginal rate. All the terms on the

right-hand side of (Al) are directly available, except for A. We estimate A

using data from the Statistics of Income Sourcebook as A = TAXBEFCRED/(T*ISTT),

where TAXBEFCRED is taxes payable before computation of credits. Investment

tax credits (ITC), foreign tax credits (FTC), other credits (OTHCRED), and

CBACKS (loss carrybacks) reduce corporate tax receipts. RETAB, which

corresponds to the results of IRS audits and other changes in prior returns,

is typically positive and therefore raises revenue. Note that our measures of

tax credits correspond to actual, not potential, credits; limits on the use of

tax credits may induce substantial differences between the two in recent years

(see Altshuler and Auerbach (1986) for a discussion).
                                           —27-


       While taxes are levied on income subject to tax, average tax rates are

calculated relative to the real economic income of shareholders, denoted by

PROFITS. Income subject to tax and economic income are related by the

identity:


(A2)     PROFITS = ISTT + NTI + NOL + CCADJ + IVA + DEBTGAIN       -   FSI


where NTI is the net income of firms with current losses and zero taxable

income, NOL is the statutory deduction for net operating losses incurred in

previous years, CCADJ is the National Income Accounts capital consumption

adjustment that is the difference between tax and economic depreciation, IVA

is the inventory valuation adjustment (again from NIPA) that measures the

spurious profits which result from inflation on goods in inventory, DEBTGAIN

is the transfer from bondholders to equity—holders that takes place when

inflation reduces the value of outstanding debt, and FSI is the foreign source

income of U.S. corporations. A very helpful reference for understanding the

relationship between IRS and National Income Accounts measures of corporate

profits is the U.S. Department of Commerce (1985).

       Equations (Al) and (A2) can be combined to obtain an expression for tax

receipts in terms of economic income. Dividing through this expression by

economic income yields:


(A3) TAXES/PROFITS = T*A -    r*A*(NTI    + NOL   + CCADJ + IVA + DEBTGAIN - FSI)/PROFITS

                      -
                          (ITC + FTC +   OTHCRED + CBACKS)/PROFITS +     RETAB/PROFITS.


We rewrite this expression by grouping together related terms:
                                           -28-


(A4) TAXES/PROFITS = T - (T*A*CCAOJ + ITC)/PROFITS - T*A*(IVA+DEBTGAIN)/PROFITS

                     -
                         (T*X*[NOL +    Nil]   + CBACKS)/PROFITS -   (FTC - T*A*FSI)/PROFITS
                                  -
                     +   T(A-1)       (OTHCRED +   RETAB)/PROFITS.


The first term on the right-hand side of (A4) is the maximum statutory tax

rate. The six adjustments to the statutory rate that are required to obtain

the average tax rate correspond to the entries in Table 3.

     The first adjustment involves capital recovery provisions. It is the sum

of investment tax credits and CCAOJ, the difference between tax depreciation

and economic depreciation of corporate assets at replacement cost. The

National Income Accounts also disaggregate the CCADJ into the components due

to accelerated depreciation at historic cost and inflationary misstatement of

basis; this breakdown is used in our Table 4.

     The next adjustment term corresponds to the other distortions of profits

related to inflation. It includes the inventory valuation adjustment and the

inflation-induced gain on corporate debt. NIPA convention defines IVA as a

negative quantity; the average tax rate is therefore increasing in the IVA,

which in turn is an increasing function of infTation. DEBTGAIN is positive,

however, and reduces the average tax rate during periods of high inflation.

This is because the inflation-induced gains of the equity holders are not part

of the tax base, so they yield income but no tax liability. The net effect of

these two factors depends upon the level of leverage and the stock of

inventories held in the corporate sector.

     The third adjustment term concerns corporate losses, and Consists of

three parts. The first is the net income of firms with zero taxable income,
                                       -29-


the second adds net operating loss deductions back into taxable income, and

the third adjusts for the use of current losses to obtain carryback refunds.

Again there are countervailing effects. Higher levels of both NOL deductions

and carryback refunds reduce the average corporate tax rate relative to what

it vould be in a system which taxed current economic income. Increases in the

losses accruing to currently non-taxable firms, however, raise the average tax

rate.     (NTI is a negative number, so that an "increase in losses" is in fact a

reduction of NTI, although an increase in its absolute value.) Losses raise

the average tax rate because economic income is computed by netting the income

of firms with positive profits against the income of firms with losses. For

tax purposes, however, this offset does not take place. Firms with positive

profits pay taxes while those with negative earnings receive nothing.

Imperfect loss offset provisions therefore cause losses to raise the average

tax rate.

        The fourth adjustment to the statutory rate involves foreign income and

tax credits. The adjustment term equals the tax liability that would have

been due on foreign source income if it had been earned in the United States,

minus foreign tax credits claimed. Since foreign tax credits are subject to a

variety of limitations, the net effect of these two factors is usually to raise

average tax rates. Our treatment of foreign source income also induces a

potential relationship between foreign tax rates and the measured average tax

rate on domestic income. For example, income earned in a country with a

corporate tax rate below A*'r will face additional tax when repatriated to a

U.S. firm. This will raise our measured average tax rate on domestic income.

Such effects are inevitable in any calculation such as ours that considers the
                                     -30-


domestic tax rate in one nation rather than the worldwide tax rate on

worldwide income.

     The two remaining adjustments are straightforward. The fifth, for the

progressivity of the tax code, measures the change in the average tax rate due

to taxing some positive-income firms at rates below the statutory maximum. It

always reduces the average tax rate, since about 1O of the positive taxable

income accruing to corporations is taxed at rates below the statutory maximum.

The final term combines other tax credits with retabulations, Other tax

credits are important primarily in recent years, when they include the R&D Tax

Credit, the New Jobs Credit, and various energy-related credits.

Retabulations Consist primarily of audit profits and minor adjustments to tax

returns filed in previous years.


Data Sources

     Most of the data series used in our analysis are drawn from either the

National Income and Product Accounts, supplemented by unpublished NIPA data,

or the IRS Corporation Sourcebook of Statistics of Income. In some cases the

data series for 1984 and 1985 are based on preliminary data or have been

constructed by extrapolating 1983 values.

     The National Income and Product Accounts present data on federal

corporate profits tax liability for the entire corporate sector, but not for

the NFCs. (NIPA also presents total tax liabilities to all governments,

divided into financial and nonfinancial sectors). We construct our own

estimate of NFC federal taxes following the NIPA approach for all corporations

as in NIPA Table 8.13. Our tax measure is:
                                          —31-


(A5)       TAXES = Income Taxes Before Credits (SOl) - Tax Credits (SOl)

                  -
                      Carryback Refunds (NIPA) + Other Retabulations (NIPA)

The first two variables are drawn from Statistics of Income for the years

1959—1983. Our sample period begins in 1959 because that is when the IRS

began publishing information on Income Subject to Tax, one of the variables

used in constructing corporate profits. We construct a measure for the

nonfinancial corporate sector as All Returns - Finance Insurance and Real

Estate +   Insurance Agents + Real Estate Operators. This is not exactly
coincident with the NIPA definition, which also includes some holding

companies that cannot be separately identified from the SOI data, but the

differences between the two series are trivial. Carrybacks and other

retabulations are drawn from unpublished data used to construct NIPA Table

8.13. Our data on these series are for the entire corporate sector, because a

breakdown for financial versus nonfinancial firms is not available. The

errors associated with the inclusion of financial firms in these aggregates

are also likely to be small.

       For 1984 and 1985 our measures of tax credits are based on forecasts

provided by the Joint Tax Committee. We extrapolated Income Taxes Before

Credits by extrapolating total taxes, using NIPA data on NFC tax liability to

all levels of government, and then adjusting it for the credit terms on the

right—hand side. We obtained data on the sum of carrybacks and retabulations

from the preliminary National Income and Product Accounts, and assumed

carrybacks remained constant at their 1983 level to divide the series into its

two components.

       We define real economic profits of the nonfinancial corporate sector as:
                                       -32-


(A6) PROFITS = Income Subject to Tax (SOl) + Net Operating Loss Deductions (SOl)

             +   Negative Taxable Income (SOl) +   CCADJ (NIPA) +   IVA (NIPA)

             + DEBTGAIN   -   FSI


The data series for Income Subject to Tax and NOL Deductions are drawn from

Statistics of Income. IVA is reported in the NIPA, in Table 1.16. The

measurement of NTI, CCADJ, DEBTGAIN, and FSI require discussion.

     NTI is the net income of firms with zero taxable income.        It is computed

as the difference between the entries for Net Income in the Sourcebook tables

for (i) Firms With and Without Net Income, and (ii) Firms With Net Income.

NTI -is this difference minus the net income differential for Subchapter S

corporations and the Special Statutory Deductions for firms with no taxable

income.

     Although a measure of CCADJ is reported in the National Income Accounts,

we amend -it slightly for our analysis. We augment the NIPA measure of CCADJ

(Table 8.4) with the depletion adjustment for domestic minerals and the

adjustment to depreciate expenditures for oil shafts, wells, and exploration

from NIPA Table 8.12. These are additional cases in which tax depreciation

differs from economic depreciation, so these terms must be added to the

accelerated depreciation component of CCADJ.

     DEBTGAIN is defined as the fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter percentage

change in the GNP deflator, times the market value of outstanding NFC debt at

the end of the previous year. The time series for debt at market value is

described in Feldstein and Jung (1986).

     FSI is measured as foreign service taxable income less loss (before
                                     -33-


recapture) as reported in various issues of the Statistics of Income Bulletin.

This corresponds to current taxable income from foreign sources.

Unfortunately, this data series is not available for every year since 1959;

rather, it is available for 14 of the years between 1961 and 1982. We

interpolated and extrapolated these data to other years when necessary. In

1979, the dramatic decline in the net foreign tax effect on the average tax

rate may be due to some error induced by our interpolation procedure.

     Our measure of economic profits differs from that in the National Income

Accounts in several ways. The most important is its inclusion of the

equity—holders capital gain on corporate debt during inflationary periods. In

addition, the National Income Accounts include net foreign source equity

income of all U.S. residents in the measured corporate profits. We also

include the 15 of intercorporate dividends not exempt from taxation, because

the data required to remove this component of IRS taxable income were not

available prior to 1978.

     All of the series based on NIPA data were available through 1985, with

the exception of the depletion and oil exploration adjustments which were

available through 1983. We constructed 1984 and 1985 values for these series

as well as the NOL and NTI series from the IRS by assuming they remained

constant at their real 1983 levels. We assumed A remained constant at its

1983 value, and updated ISTT as ISTT =   TAXBEFCRED/T*X using our TAXBEFCRED

forecast.

     Finally, we measured the current replacement cost of the net tangible

assets held in the nonfinancial corporate sector using the Federal Reserve

Board's Balance Sheets of the U.S.Economy. The Balance Sheets report year—end
                                     -34-


values, which we averaged to construct the mid-year value for the denominator

of our profit rate calculations. We subtract the Feldsteiri-Jun (1986)

measure of the market value of corporate debt to obtain a series for the net

assets of the corporate sector.


Revenue and Average Tax Rate Projections, 1986-1991

    Most of our calculations for the 1986—1991 period rely on data from the

Congressional Budget Office (1986). We use their GNP projections and

inflation forecasts for the GNP deflator throughout our calculation.

    Our profit variable, PROFITS, has two components. One corresponds loosely

to real economic profits in the NIPA, the other is OEBTGAIN. To calculate the

PROFITS components other than DEBTGAIN, we use the CBO forecast of real

corporate profits on a NIPA basis, PROFITSNIPA. We compute the ratio (PROFITS
— DEBTGAIN)/PR0FITSNIPA for 1984 and 1985; the ratios are .747 and .703,

respectively. Using an average ratio of .725, we forecast (PROFITS -

DEBTGAIN) based on the CBO forecasts and then add in DEBTGAIN, calculated as

the CBO inflation rate times our extrapolation of corporate debt (which is the

1985 value extrapolated at the nominal GNP growth rate).

     We compute NFC tax liabilities under old law using the CBO's forecasts of

fiscal year corporate tax receipts (p.63), less projected receipts from

Federal Reserve Banks (taken from the 0MB Federal Budget projections for

Fiscal 1987 and years through 1989, with extrapolation through 1991 holding

the series constant in real terms). This tax measure is a fiscal year

indicator of accruals from the whole corporate sector. We use the ratio of

NFC to total federal taxes in 1985 (.885) to scale this profit measure for the
                                      —35—


NFCs, and then convert to calendar years by averaging adjacent fiscal years

with weights of .75 and .25, respectively. When projections for FY 1992 were

needed, we assumed that the fiscal 1991 value grew at the same rate as between

FY 1990 and 1991.

     Total federal revenues for fiscal years through 1991 are reported in the

CBO (p.63). We calculated calendar year revenues as a weighted average, and

found the calendar 1991 value by increasing the calendar 1990 value in the

same proportion as the fiscal 1991 revenue forecast relative to the fiscal

1990 forecast. We extrapolated the net replacement value of NFC assets

assuming they grew in real terms at 1.64% per year, the average growth rate

for the years 1980 through 1985, and fully reflected inflation in the GNP

deflator.

     Finally, to measure the revenue changes associated with the 1986 Tax

Reform Act, we rely upon the Joint Tax Committee's revenue estimates presented

in House of Representatives (1986). We estimate the total tax effect for

nonfinancial corporations as the total change in corporate revenues, less the

changes due to taxation of insurance companies and financial institutions

(titles IX and X of the revenue estimates), less .115 times the revenue

changes for the minimum tax, pension provisions, compliance, and miscellaneous

other provisions (titles VII, XI, XV, and XVII). This correction adjusts for

the share of these revenue changes which arise from the financial

corporations. We adjust all revenue estimates from fiscal to calendar years

using weighted averages, and construct fiscal 1992 estimates assuming the

fiscal 1991 value grows at the same rate as it did between fiscal 1990 and

fiscal 1991. Our measure of capital recovery changes is just the revenue

change due to title II, capital cost provisions, and that for accounting

reforms is the revenue estimate in title VIII.
