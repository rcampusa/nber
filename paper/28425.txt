                                          ABSTRACT

Partisanship of state level politicians affect the impact of federal fiscal policy in the U.S. Using
data from close gubernatorial elections, we find partisan differences in the marginal propensity to
spend federal transfers since the early 1980's: Republican governors spend less. A New
Keynesian model of partisan states in a monetary union implies sizable aggregate income effects
from these partisan differences. First, the transfer multiplier would rise by 0.60 if Republican
governors were to spend as much from federal aid as do Democratic governors. Second, the
observed changes in the share of Republican governors imply variation in the fiscal multiplier of
0.40. Local projection regressions support this prediction.

1       Introduction

    The United States and many other important democracies are economic unions: collec-
tions of politically independent but integrated economies.1 While the national government
funds national public goods and provides for aggregate income and price stability, state
and local governments often are required to implement national policies. Examples include
health care, national infrastructure, and unemployment and income insurance. The political
independence of the subnational governments creates a principal-agent problem between sep-
arately elected national and state or provincial governments for these policies. The national
government is the "principal" who funds a significant share of services via intergovernmental
(IG) transfers. State and local governments act as "agents" who provide the funded services.2
The agency problem is well documented: States spend much of IG transfers (the "flypaper
effect"), but do not necessarily spend transfers as intended by the federal government.3 We
first document that the flypaper effect varies by political party. Second, we show that the
partisan differences matter for the impact of national stabilization policies on the aggregate
economy.
    The importance of IG transfers has grown over time, and particularly during severe
downturns. Figure 1 illustrates the growth of IG transfers in the U.S. since 1902 from 0.01%
of GDP to as much as 3.7% of GDP in the aftermath of the Great Recession. In 2019, U.S.
federal transfers to state and local governments were 14.8% of the federal budget. Temporary
increases in federal aid often occur during recessions (see the shaded recession bands in
Figure 1). For example, the Great Depression saw the introduction of nationally funded but
state administered transfer programs to lower income households and the unemployed. The
importance of intergovernmental aid as a stimulus for the macro-economy was also evident

    1
      In addition to the U.S., economic unions include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, South
Africa, and, for most policies, the European Union and several of its member countries.
    2
      There is a large literature on the theory of optimal intergovernmental transfers beginning with Musgrave
(1959), Oates (1972), and summarized in Inman and Rubinfeld (2020, ch. 8). Lockwood (1999) provides the
contemporary analysis of transfer policies as an exercise in mechanism design.

Recession. ARRA reserved $318 billion of its $796 billion in aggregate economic stimulus
for allocation by U.S. states and localities. The U.S. government's response to the economic
decline caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has also allocated significant federal transfers to
the state and local public sector.4

    Recent theoretical work has stressed the importance of IG transfers for aggregate fiscal
policy in currency unions, see Gali and Monacelli (2008), Ferrero (2009), and Farhi and
Werning (2017). Because of free trade, state stabilization policies are likely to have signifi-
cant consumption spillovers; see Carlino and Inman (2013) and Auerbach et al. (2019). This
leads to an inefficient under-provision of union-wide expansionary policies if left to state
governments. Central government borrowing to finance IG transfers is one policy response.
Intergovernmental transfers from the central to union-member governments play two po-
   4
     While we focus on the U.S. in our paper, IG transfers and the resulting agency problem matter in
other non-unitary governments, for example the European Union. Similar to the U.S., the European Council
allocates significant transfers to member states. Similar to the U.S., EU transfers are also diverted to member
states' own priorities; see Ivanova et al. (2017).

                                                      2
tentially important roles: First, to provide income insurance for residents in response to
country-specific shocks, and second, to help stabilize the union-wide economy in response to
both country specific and union-wide shocks.
    Understanding how IG transfers are allocated to state governments and how states then
allocate those transfers is essential for predicting the effects of transfers on the aggregate
economy. As politically independent agents, elected state officials may choose to allocate
transfers in ways counter to the intention of national policy-makers. Partisan differences
are the explanation we study here. Consider the recent expansion of Medicaid. Republican
politicians at the state level often blocked the Medicaid expansion that formed part of the
Democratic healthcare reform bill; see Washington Post (2013) and also Kaiser Family Foun-
dation (2019). Such decisions are not limited to Republicans: Democratic governors refused
funding for a Republican approved federal education program promoting sexual abstinence
(Raymond et al., 2008). We argue here that the partisan affiliation of governors has become
important for federal transfer programs, particularly since the presidency of Ronald Reagan
in the 1980s.
    Our paper makes two contributions. First, we show that the so-called flypaper effect
measuring the budgetary impacts of federal aid for state and local government spending
varies by partisanship.5 Estimates of these impacts are essential for the implementation of
federal fiscal policies using state and local governments. When averaged across parties, our
results are consistent with current estimates of the flypaper effect in the literature. The
familiar approaches to estimating this effect conceal large partisan differences, however. We
estimate the impact of state-level partisanship on the implementation of national government
policies paid for by IG transfers. Given state-level budgetary institutions, we focus on the
the political party of the governor as our measure of partisanship. Central to our analysis

    5
      Gramlich (1977), Hines and Thaler (1995), and Inman (2009) survey this extensive literature. The
literature's concludes that federal money "sticks where it hits": A federal dollar given directly to a household,
say through tax relief, leads to about $.04 to $.10 in additional state and local spending. In contrast, a dollar
given directly to a state and local government has been estimated to lead on average to $.25 to even more
than $1.00 increase in state or local spending.

                                                       3
is the identification of partisan differences in state responses to national transfers ­ that is,
the marginal propensity to spend from federal aid (MPS) under Democratic or Republican
governors. We identify partisan differences in spending of IG transfers using panel data on
close gubernatorial elections, similar to the regression discontinuity design (RDD) used by
Ferreira and Gyourko (2009) in their study of mayoral partisan differences in city spending.
We find statistically significant and economically important differences: Democrats favor
spending, while Republicans favor tax relief. Our estimated partisan differences in the MPS
emerged during and following the tenure of President Reagan, a Republican, and parallel
the national increase in partisan polarization of U.S. politics documented by McCarty et al.
(2016) and Azzimonti (2018). In contrast to the post-Reagan era, we find no evidence
of partisan difference in the pre-Reagan era with its lower levels of polarization, a result
consistent with evidence surveyed in Potrafke (2018).
   Our second contribution is to quantify the macroeconomic effects of these partisan differ-
ences in MPS. We focus on the federal multiplier of IG transfers on GDP. This IG multiplier
matters for national policymakers hoping to stimulate the economy via IG transfers. The IG
multiplier is the product of two effects: First, the MPS from IG aid and, second, the effect
of changes in state government spending or tax relief on aggregate GDP. Our state level
estimates yield the first effect. To quantify the second effect, we use a macroeconomic model
consistent with recent estimates of aggregate fiscal multipliers. Our causal state-level esti-
mates parameterize the partisan fiscal rules for a representative Democratic and Republican
governors in the macro model. The model features states in a monetary union and shares
the many New Keynesian features of the models in Nakamura and Steinsson (2014), Brueck-
ner et al. (2019), and Auclert et al. (2019). It gives a role to demand-side and supply-side
policies through nominal frictions, constrained households, and distortionary taxes as well
as endogenous labor supply and capital accumulation. The model is flexible enough to give
a role for Democratic policies, which are estimated to favor increased spending, including
federal and state transfers to lower income households, as well as Republican policies, which


                                               4
favor tax relief for households.
    Without partisan differences in governor allocations (pre-1980) the aggregate impact
multiplier of federal IG transfers is 0.85. Allowing for partisan differences with half the
states assigned the policy preferences of a Republican governor and half of a Democratic
governor reduces the impact multiplier to about 0.5. The reason for the decline is initially
lower state spending and thus lower aggregate demand in Republican states. Finally, we
vary the partisan division among states to match that of U.S. states from 1983 to 2014.
The model predicts that the aggregate impact multiplier falls as the share of Republican
governor increases. We validate the model's prediction for U.S. data using a local projection
time series regression.
    Our paper is one of several to estimate the aggregate effect of federal aid. Chodorow-
Reich (2019) provides a detailed review of estimates of the aid multiplier. Based upon studies
evaluating the impact of ARRA intergovernmental aid on local jobs and income, he concludes
the best estimate of aid's impact on the aggregate economy, if deficit-financed, is a national
multiplier of 1.7. Our multiplier estimates are typically smaller, in part because IG transfers
are eventually tax financed. Our focus, however, is less on the level of the IG multiplier,
but rather on estimating and quantifying on how partisan differences matter for its relative
impact. Overall, our analysis points to the potential importance of partisan differences in
policy-makers' preferences as a new source of heterogeneity in macroeconomics, along with
that for households and firms.



2     Estimating Partisan Differences in Aid Allocation

2.1    Specification: Governors and the Allocation of Aid

    State and local governments receive federal IG aid in one of four ways: (1) lump-sum
aid with no constraints on purpose (e.g., General Revenue Sharing); (2) lump-sum aid for
spending on a specific policy objective (e.g., ESEA Title I aid for the education of lower


                                              5
income children), (3) matching aid paying a share of program expenses up to a cap on total
aid (e.g., Water and Sewer Facilities Assistance), and finally (4), open-ended matching aid
with no limit on assistance (e.g., Medicaid). Each of the first three forms of assistance
provides a fixed sum of funding, with or without programmatic restrictions on how the
money may be spent. While efforts are often made by the funding agency to enforce spending
restrictions ­ known as maintenance of effort provisions ­ such constraints are very difficult
to enforce and binding only for new programs with no prior state or local spending.6 Without
enforcement, the recipient government is free to use any lump-sum categorical grant as it
wishes within its budget, allocations known as the "fungibility" of aid. We assume fungibility
and aggregate all assistance in the first three categories into a single lump-sum transfer called
hereafter IG aid (denoted as IG). Open-ended matching aid, of which Medicaid is the only
significant example, pays a fixed share of the costs of allowed state spending at a matching
rate m; such assistance is effectively a price subsidy. Our empirical analysis will focus on
the impact of lump-sum IG aid.
    The institutional features of state budgeting motivate our econometric specification.
First, the central role of the state reversion (status quo) and the use of contining resolu-
tions if no budgetary agreement can be reached between the governor and and the state
legislature leads us to specify our regression for government spending relative to last year's
budget, and thus to focus on changes in spending; see Persson and Tabellini (2000, Chap-
ter 2). Second, governors are in a strong bargaining position: Governors have the right to
propose a budget, and, in most states, have the power to veto or change individual budget
items. These institutions, plus governors' appointment powers, underlies our specfication of
the governor as the decisive political agent for state budgets; see Barrilleaux and Berkman
(2003) and Kousser and Phillips (2012). Third, registered voters from the Democratic and
Republican parties choose party candidates for governor from a set of "citizen-candidates"
   6
     While maintenance of effort is easily monitored with programs that directly reimburse a share of state
spending as for open-ended matching grants such as Medicaid, even these funds have been found to be
diverted; see Nicholson-Crotty (2004). For programs that provide a fixed allocation of funding as for IG aid,
most of program aid is diverted to other spending or to general tax relief; see Carlino and Inman (2016).

                                                     6
wishing to represent the party in the general election; see Besley and Coate (1997).7 If can-
didates are policy motivated, rather than just office-motivated, and if the registered voters in
the party primaries care about the governor's policies when in office, the convergence result
of Downs (1957) is overturned and the winning candidate will typically not represent the
preferences of the state-wide median voter (Wittman, 1983).8 We recognize the dominant
position of the governor in budgeting, and the potential importance of her partisan decided
preferences, by including an indicator variable for the governor's party affiliation as an ex-
planator of IG aid's impact of changes in state spending. Finally, we explicitly allow for the
possibility of asymmetry in the impact of increases and decreases in IG aid on spending to
accommodate the possibility of "habit formation" in observed preferences for state services
or tax relief, coming from either divided government or constituent preferences.9
    Equation (2.1) provides the core specification for changes in log expenditures  ln Es,t
in state s in fiscal year t in response to changes in (ln) IG aid in state s and year t. The
effect of aid may differ when aid increases ( ln IG+
                                                   s,t = max{0,  ln IGs,t }) or decreases

( ln IG-
       s,t = min{0,  ln IGs,t }). It may also differ by governors party affiliation as Repub-

lican (Reps,t-1 = 1) or Democratic (Reps,t-1 = 0):


                                                                                  -
         ln Es,t =(0,+ + r,+ × Reps,t-1 ) ln IG+
                                               s,t + (0,- + r,- × Reps,t-1 ) ln IGs,t


                    + µ0 + µr × Reps,t-1 + fixed effects +         s,t .                                   (2.1)
    7
      The citizen-candidate specification ties party policy directly to the preferences of the candidate chosen
to represent the party, an outcome described by Lee et al. (2004) as "complete" divergence of the politician's
preferences from contemporaneous pressures of the electorate. They reject the alternative of no divergence,
or the median voter result, using data on U.S. Representatives' policy choices.
    8
      Party voters trade off the benefits of holding office against those of having a candidate who will imple-
ment policies closer to their preferred allocations; see Alesina and Spear (1988) and Harrington (1992).
    9
      We leave unspecified the exact source of spending asymmetries. There are at least two potential ex-
planations. First, constituent preferences may reveal a form of habit formation where past state spending
comes to be seen as an "entitlement" by Democratic constituents and past levels of after-tax incomes as an
entitlement by Republican constituents. Entitlements then play the role of a "minimum bundle" which must
be protected against IG cuts (with borrowed funding, for Democrats) or enhanced with IG increases (with
tax cuts, for Republicans). Second, divided government with a governor veto and a status quo reversion
means the Democratic governor can protect against spending cuts when IG aid is cut, and the Republican
governor can protect against big spending increases when IG aid is increased. We do not test specifically
for one explanation or the other but our extensive specification of fixed effects controls for a possible role of
lagged spending and taxation or a history of divided governments.

                                                       7
Our aim is to recover the average MPSs for Democratic and Republican governors separately
for when aid is increased or decreased. We lag the governor's party affiliation by one year
as state budgets are decided one year prior to their implementation. Finally,      s,t   is the error
term, which is allowed to be correlated across states and time. The µ0 coefficient is the
average spending growth under Democratic governors, and µ0 + µr is the average spending
growth under Republican governors, unrelated to changes in IG aid. Under our preferred
fixed effects specification, µ0 and µr are unidentified, however. While the growth rates are
nominal, the fixed effects always include time dummies, so that estimated growth rates are
real changes. A Democratic governor's MPS elasticity equals 0,+ when IG aid is increased
                                                          -
(IG+
   s,t > 0) and equals (0,- ) when IG aid is decreased (IGs,t < 0). A Republican

governor's MPS elasticity is measured relative to that of the Democratic governor ­ that
is, 0,+ + r,+ for an increase in aid and 0,- + r,- for a decrease in aid. We conjecture
that partisan differences are non-zero. Since the Republican party is often associated with
lower taxes and spending cuts and the Democratic party with spending increases, we expect
r,+ < 0 and r,- > 0; see Besley and Case (2003).
   The core specification also includes state and year fixed effects, interacted with the Gov-
ernor's party or the state's census region. We include fixed effects to control for the effects on
state spending of annual changes in the national economy and national fiscal policies and for
state and regional differences in state economies and local public goods prices. State-party
fixed effects allow a Texas Republican governor to differ from a Massachusetts Republican
governor, while year-party fixed effects will allow a Republican governor to allocate differ-
ently during a Bush or Obama administration. Importantly, year-party fixed effects also
control for strategic congressional or presidential allocations of IG aid to states conditional
on the governor's party affiliation; see Albouy (2013).




                                                8
2.2     Estimation

   OLS estimation of equation (2.1) may lead to inconsistent estimates of the causal effects
                          +     -
of partisanship: that is, r and r may not be consistently estimated. The governor's party
is not assigned randomly, but may be correlated with unobserved events that simultaneously
affect state spending. For example, an economic shock such as a local recession may shift
election outcomes towards more fiscally conservative (Republican) candidates, at the same
time that the state is forced to cut expenditures and the federal government increases IG
aid.10 The OLS estimator would then yield a downard bias to the coefficient r,+ that is
unrelated to the underlying causal effect of partisan preferences. Political shocks, such as
scandals, may have similar effects, if governors use fiscal policy to minimize the consequences
of their misdeeds.
   While our fixed effects control for some unobservables, they will do so only imperfectly.
To address this issue, we use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) based on close elec-
tions. In standard RDD, the identifying assumption is that, in close elections, the election
outcome is unrelated to the governor's policy preferences or the state of the economy. For
example, when elections are close, say they are decided by a margin of victory (MOV) of 2pp
(51 vs. 49 percent), small exogenous events, such as weather on election day or a clumsy TV
appearance, could decide who wins the election. RDDs based on close elections, identify dif-
ferences in intercepts by assuming that the winning candidate (and her partisan preferences)
has been quasi-randomly assigned and is therefore independent of any unobservables.11 Since
we want to identify differences in slopes (MPS), we will need a stronger assumption. We
assume that, conditional on close elections, the party affiliation of the governor is jointly
independent of the change in IG transfers and of shocks to expenditures. To ensure that IG
transfers used in our estimation are exogenous to the party affiliation of the governor, we

exclude welfare transfers from our measure of IG, as previously discussed.
    While the regression discontinuity allows us identify the partisan differences, it does not
allow us to identify all preference parameters. Under the assumption that IG aid and re-
maining unobservables are independent from the party affiliation of the governor conditional
on close elections, the partisan difference in the MPS is identified. But selection ­ e.g.,
Democrats being elected more frequently in periods of higher IG increases and higher ex-
penditure growth ­ could make the baseline MPS asymptotically biased. We therefore focus
on the partisan differences. We will, however, use the point estimates as a plausible (exoge-
nously specified) benchmark to compute the implied levels of Democratic and Republican
MPS's for policy simulations.
    Our preferred specification identifies discontinuities in marginal effects rather than dis-
continuities in average effects as in standard RDDs. To control for selection, we include
the winning governor's MOV and that MOV interacted with the governor's political party,
and changes in IG.12 In addition to the simple equation (2.1), we, therefore, estimate the
following (baseline) specification:


                                                                           -
  ln Es,t =(0,+ + r,+ × Reps,t-1 ) ln IG+
                                        s,t + (0,- + r,- × Reps,t-1 ) ln IGs,t

              +         (0,s,m + r,s,m × Reps,t-1 ) ln IGs
                                                         s,t × M OVs,t-1
                  s{-,+}

              + (0,m + r,m × Reps,t-1 )M OVs,t-1 + µ0 + µr × Reps,t-1 + fixed effects +            s,t .   (2.2)


To choose the MOV cutoff when estimating (2.2), we balance the the gains in precision from
a larger cutoff against the possibility of reduced bias from a smaller cutoff. Minimizing the
estimated root mean sequared error leads us to prefer a MOV below 10pp as the cutoff (55%
vs 45%).13 For robustness, we also estimate the more parsimonious specification without

  12
      See Caetano et al. (2017), who analyze a similar setting where the treatment effect could be zero on
average, even though the treatment effect may be nonzero for certain groups. In our preferred specification,
the average spending effect is captured by fixed effects. Here, partisan differences emerge conditional on
changes in IG.
   13
      Specifically, we use cross-validation to compute the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of fitting eq. (2.2)
to our data: We estimate (2.2) first leaving one state out at a time, and then one year out at a time. We then

MOV controls with governors elected with a MOV of up to 5pp.14 We cluster standard
errors by state and year.15
   For ease of interpretation, it is useful to transform our estimates of r,+ , r,- from elastic-
ities to dollar coefficients. To do so, we could simply use the average ratio of expenditures to
IG transfers. However, this ratio varies across states. Instead, we transform the left-hand-
                                                  Es,t-5
side variable directly. The scaled variable      IGs,t-5
                                                         Es,t   on the LHS has the virtue that it
reflects heterogeneity in the ratio of expenditures to transfers across states. This is similar
to regressing the (real, per capita) dollar change in expenditures on the (real, per capita)
dollar change in transfers, but we have found the scaled variable approach to yield more
precise estimates, as measured by smaller standard errors.


2.3     Data and Sample

   The model is estimated using panel data encompassing fiscal and political outcomes for
the fiscal years, 1983 to 2014. The year 1983 is the first fiscal year for state governments to
respond to new fiscal federal policies following the election of Ronald Reagan as president,
typically viewed as the start of polarization in U.S. politics; see McCarty et al. (2016) and
Azzimonti (2018) for rising polarization in national politics and Shor and McCarty (2011)
for U.S. states. Our sample includes all states except those states with large sovereign wealth
funds financed through severance taxes. These states have the luxury of treating IG as a
change in wealth, rather than income. We therefore exclude from the analysis Alaska and
Wyoming and (after the 2009 fracking boom) North Dakota.16 State fiscal data are from the
Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances, U.S. Census of Governments. Data
for governors political party and terms of office are from Book of States, Council of State
compute the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) for omitted observations. We repeat this process for MOV
cutoffs on a one percentage point grid, and choose the cutoff that minimizes the RMSE averaged across
leaving out state and leaving out years. With fixed effects, the preferred cutoff is 10pp.
   14
      We also considered a specification with a third order MOV polynomial. The point estimates were
consistent to our baseline specifications, but less precise.
   15
      We use the reghdfe package for Stata by Correia (2016).
   16
      We drop these states starting in the year that they instituted their wealth fund: Wyoming (1975),
Alaska (1976), and North Dakota (2009). Only these states have severance tax revenue shares  20%.

 Significance of partisan differences for terms of governors decided by MOV 10pp, 1983-2014. Shares and ratios in percent.
 All growth rates are real per capita. Tests for significance of partisan differences are from regressions explaining each variable
 by a dummy variable indicating if the governor is Republican (omitting independents), and including linear MOV controls and
 no fixed effects (col. 5), or state and year fixed effects (col. 6), or state and (year×region) fixed effects (col. 7). t-statistics are
 based on standard errors clustered by state and year.



      Table 1 summarizes the data used in our analysis, and importantly, provides tests for the
 identifying assumption that the measured economic, political, and fiscal attributes of our
 sample states are similar between states electing a Democratic or Republican governor in a
 close election (MOV 10pp). Column (1) presents the full sample's mean for each variable
 and then the means for the variable for a sample of close elections (Col. (2)) and for the
 sample of "close elections" divided between states that elected a Democratic governor (Col.
 (3)) or a Republican governor (Col. (4)). A statistical comparison of sample means between
 states with closely elected Democratic and Republican governors for each variable does not
 allow us to reject the null hypothesis of equal means as reported by the t-statistic for the
 two-sided test for equality of means; see Cols. 5 (no fixed effect controls), Col. 6 (year and
 state fixed effect controls), and Col. 7 (state and region x year fixed effect controls). We
 conclude that the sample of close elections is balanced by all plausibly important economic,


                                                                   12
political, and fiscal covariates with the elected governor's party. We will therefore interpret
any estimated policy differences in an elected governor's allocation of  ln IG to  ln E to
be due to the partisan preferences of the elected governor as chosen by his or her party.



3        Estimates of state-level partisanship

3.1      Graphical analysis

     In Figure 2 we illustrate the working of our RDD. Governors are grouped into subsamples
by their MOV, with all winning Democratic governors collected in positive MOV bins and all
Republicans in negative bins. Bins have a width of one percentage point. A positive MOV
equal to 2 corresponds to the subsample of Democratic governors winning their election by
a margin of more than 1pp, but no more than 2pp (i.e., within a 51% to 49% margin). Each
panel shows the estimated MPS for an increase in IG aid ( + ) from each bin as an elasticity,
with the ±1.65 standard error band for each estimate shown as the shaded area.17 Panel (a)
omits fixed effects, panel (b) includes party-specific fixed effects.
     Both panels in Figure 2 show a clear break in the estimated MPS elasticities as the MOV
approaches zero (tied elections): The Republican governors' estimated MPS elasticities are
close to zero, while closely elected Democratic governors have an estimated MPS elasticity
near 0.25. The difference between these elasticities at zero identifies the partisan difference.
Fitting a linear regression to the binned elasticities in panel (a) yields a difference of 0.26
(a Democratic intercept of 0.15 and a Republican interceptof -0.11): For a 1% increase in
IG transfers, Democrats increased expenditure growth by 0.26pp more than Republicans.
The results with fixed effects are very similar. Away from close elections, there are no
observed differences in MPS elasticities: When the MOV approaches 10pp in absolute terms,

    17
     The +2pp to +3pp bin contains an influential observation: Ann Richards, a Democratic governor of
Texas in the early 1990s. While governors Richards remains in the sample, we have removed Democratic
governor Bob Wise of West Virginia. Under the tenure of these two governors, their states experienced
particularly high growth in both IG aid and expenditures. Without either, the elasticity would also be
around 0.3 also in the +3pp bin. Adding Bob Wise, the elasticity is +0.94 (no FE) and +0.86 (with FE).

                                                 13
                           the estimated MPS tend to be positive with insignificant differences for Republicans and
                           Democrats, as the overlap of the confidence intervals for large MOVs indicate. In this case,
                           a MOV far from the cutoff suggests that, on average, the winning party picked a position close
                           to the state's median voter's, nonpartisan, preferences and was able to defeat an ideological
                           (partisan) opponent by a large margin; see Alesina and Spear (1988).

                               Governors' responses to cuts in transfers also show significant partisan differences, but
                           of opposite sign.18 Without fixed effects, the Republican MPS elasticity in response to a cut
                           in IG aid is to cut spending and is about .2 larger than the MPS of Democratic governors.
                           With party by year and party by state fixed effects, the difference in MPS elasticities is .3
                           and again for larger cuts in spending by Republican governors. But away from the point of
                           zero MOV the MPS elascities are similar, as for spending increases with increases with IG
                           aid. When partisan preferences are decisive, Republican governors cut their expenditures
                           more than do Democratic governors for the same cut in IG transfers.

    That only Democrats increase their expenditure growth in times of high transfer growth
is central to our policy analysis ­ and drives our results. Figure 3 shows this by reporting
estimates for a RDD in means for samples with high and low transfer growth: The dark
lines show the point estimates and 90% confidence intervals (dashed bands) for the mean
expenditure growth conditional on IG increases below the 75th percentile for various MOV
bins, while the thin line and its 90% confidence interval (shaded band) show the same for
the mean expenditure growth conditional on IG increases above the 75th percentile. The left
panel is without fixed effects, while the right panel includes state and year fixed effects.19 The
two confidence intervals for Republican governors (negative MOV) lie on top of each other,
suggesting their their spending does not respond to changes in IG transfers. In contrast,
for Democratic governors, expenditure growth is significantly higher when IG growth is high
rather than low. For a MOV near zero, the difference is about 7pp without fixed effects and
2.5pp with fixed effects.
    Finally, Figure 3 provides insight for when significant partisan differences are most likely
to be observed. For our sample, it will be for large spending increases typically observed
following a major federal IG policy initiative. The mean percentage increase in IG aid for
observations in the upper 25th percentile was 18.9%, or $114 (in 2010 dollars) per resident
for those years and states. For the remainder of the sample, the percentage increase in aid
was 4.6 percent, or $25 per resident. Thus, we find significant partisan effects just when
increases in aid are large and likely to be most economically significant. Importantly for
the analysis of Section 4, among these high aid observations are the major IG aid policies
designed to respond to major recessions.20




   19
      Without fixed effects, we estimate the plots within a MOV of ±6.5pp, based on cross-validation of
equation (2.2) without fixed effects. Here, the fixed effects cannot be party specific, because the part-specific
means would otherwise be unidentified. Figures B.3 and Figure B.4 in the Appendix also shows the analogous
with a cutoff at the 50th percentile, and also includes the binned observations.

                                  Tables 2 and 3 provide estimates of partisan differences in MPS: The first three columns
                              contain the result for the full model from eq. (2.2) for MOV margins of 10pp with linear MOV
                              controls, and for the full sample with third order MOV polynomial controls. Columns (4) and
                              (5) are for eq. (2.1) without MOV controls for samples with a MOV of less than 4pp or 5pp.
                              For comparison, column (6) contains results for elections that are not close (MOV>10pp).
                              Table 2 uses the scaled expenditure growth as the regressand, so that coefficients have the
                              interpretation of a dollar-for-dollar MPS. Table 3 shows elasticity estimates.

Republican. From Section 2, Democratic (liberal) governors are expected to spend more than
Republican (conservative) governors of any increase in aid and to cut less of any decrease in
aid. Table 2 confirms those predictions for a variety of RDD and fixed effects specifications.
    The first three columns in Table 2 present results for governors who won in elections
with a MOV of up to 10pp. Following eq. (2.2), these specifications include linear MOV
controls. Column (1) includes state and year fixed effects, column (2) includes party-specific
state and year fixed effects, and column (3) includes state fixed effects and U.S. Census
region by year fixed effects. The coefficient estimates imply that Democratic governors
increase state spending by between $1.260 and $1.411 for a $1 increase in IG aid. Our
focus is, however, on the partisan differences, estimated as the coefficient for Republican
governor (Rept-1 ) interacted with increases or decreases in aid. Switching governors from
a Democratic governor to a Republican governor lowers the MPS by between $1.510 and
$1.919. We can reject the hypothesis that the partisan differences are positive at the 10%
level in all cases and by the more conventional two-sided test for no differences (either positive
or negative) at least at the 15% level in all cases.

                                                               17
    While we focus on identifying the partisan difference, if we consider the coefficients for
the Democratic baseline at face value, the results are reasonable: We cannot reject the
hypothesis that Republican governors have a zero MPS in all three cases (p-values between
0.16 and 0.45): Republican governors allocate their increase in IG aid to tax relief or to
repaying government debt.21
    For a $1 decrease in IG aid, we find the opposite pattern: The MPS, here measuring
cuts in spending, is significantly higher under Republican governors than under Democratic
governors. The spending cut is between $2.996 and $3.541 higher for each dollar cut in IG
aid (all statistically significant): Republican governors cut spending relatively much more
than Democrats when IG is cut. Taking the Democratic coefficients as our benchmark,
Democratic governors are estimated to reduce spending by between -0.641 (i.e., to increase
spending) and 0.271 dollars. None of these estimates is statistically different from zero.
When Democratic governors lose IG aid, they protect spending either by raising state taxes,
by borrowing, or by withdrawing funds from state rainy day funds or pension accounts.
Adding the Democratic baseline and the causally identified partisan difference suggests that
Republicans cut spending by more than the loss in federal aid, making funds available for
tax cuts or debt repayment.
    A simpler specification tells the same story. Columns (4) and (5) remove MOV controls,
but use only elections won with a MOV of up to 5pp and 4pp, respectively. The estimated
partisan difference for IG increases imply that Republican governors spend $1.803 or $2.142
less than Democratic governors. Together with the Democratic baseline coefficient near $1.7,
we cannot reject a zero Republican MPS. For IG decreases, the partisan difference is also large
and statistically significant. Finally, and consistent with our graphical analysis in Figure 2,
when we exclude data on close elections and omit MOV controls in column (6), we find no
significant partisan difference following either IG increases or cuts. Governors who win by
large margins will likely have adopted policy positions attractive to the state-wide median
  21
     In an earlier version of this paper (Carlino et al., 2020), we provide direct evidence of relatively lower
tax rates and interest payments under Republican governors following IG increases.

voter as well as a fraction (>5%) of the opposing party's voters nearest the median. The
coefficient estimates for governors elected by a wide margin suggest non-partisan policies,
because they largely reflect median voter preferences in the general election, rather than the
partisan preferences we are trying to identify.22

    Table 3 repeats the analysis of Table 2, but now for a log-linear specification. This
specification has the advantage of allowing for variable estimates of partisan differences
in MPS conditional upon the relative importance of IG aid to state spending. Table 3's
estimates of the impact of changes in aid are qualitatively similar to those reported for
the linear specification in Table 2. We confirm that Republican governors spend less of an
increase in IG aid than do Democratic governors. Again relative to the Democratic baseline,
we fail to reject that the Republican MPS is zero. Also as in Table 2, Democratic governors

   22
     An F -test that there are no partisan differences for the MOV>10pp sample cannot reject that null
hypothesis (p = .47). Further, point estimates for increases and decreases in IG aid without partisan
interactions are both significant and equal .68 and .71 respectively, estimates well within the range of the
familiar (median voter) flypaper effect.

                                                              19
are seen to not cut spending when IG aid is decreased while Republican governors make
significant percentage cuts. Estimates of the partisan difference in MPS are robust across
all six of the samples and specifications when considering one-sided tests, and only very
marginally insignificant with the cubic controls when considering a two-sided test. That the
estimated elasticities in Table 3 are all well below 1.0, implies the partisan difference in MPS
declines as IG aid becomes relatively more important, but not strikingly so. For example,
the implied partisan difference in MPS for a $1 increase in IG aid as estimated in Table 3,
col. (1) for states with the median level of IG aid is $2.33, while that for states in the upper
25 percentile of IG aid is $2.23. These magnitudes are broadly similar to the ones reported
in Table 2.
    Finally, while the post-Reagan period is our focus, it is instructive to compare estimated
values of MPS for the years prior to the Reagan presidency. Below we provide evidence for
whether partisan differences in state fiscal allocations vary with increasing national political
polarization. The years prior to 1982 had lower levels of polarization, but there remained
significant changes in federal IG programs.23 Here, we focus on the polarization measure
of Azzimonti (2018). Denoting polarization by Pt , normalized to have zero mean and unit

relatively low, estimated partisan differences in MPS were insignificant. Prior to 1980, Pt
averaged minus one standard deviation. This implies a point estimate for the partisan
difference in MPS for an IG increase of 0.57 (= -0.53 + (-1) × (-1.10)) with a standard
error of 0.59. For IG cuts, the point estimate of partisan differences is 0.23 with a standard
error of 0.39. We conclude that the national trend towards increased political polarization
helps to explain the estimated partisan differences in the post-Reagan years and it motivates
the start date of our main sample in 1983.24


3.3     Discussion

    The estimated post-Reagan partisan differences in MPS are large, statistically signifi-
cant, and likely to be lost in the typical approach to estimating the response of state and
local governments to changes in IG aid, which omits partisan interactions. A simple OLS
regression for the (1983-2014) sample including year-party and state-party fixed effects to
measure the marginal spending impact of new IG aid without partisan effects or allowing
for asymmetric changes has an estimated impact of $.72 (s.e. = .15) for $1 of aid. From
Table 2, a sample weighted average over governorships yields a MPS for increases in IG aid
ranging from $.48 to $.96 and for decreases in IG aid of $1.1 to $1.8. The overall weighted
average of MPS across both increases and decreases in aid ranges from .75 to 1.18. These
average estimates are well within the range of most flypaper studies, as reviewed by Hines
and Thaler (1995) and Inman (2009).
    Our estimates unravel the previous average estimates of MPS from the flypaper litera-
ture to reveal an important new margin of agent heterogeneity, partisanship, that must be
respected when designing fiscal policies in economic unions. The importance is particularly
evident when the central government uses IG transfers to member states to stimulate the
macro economy: This stimulative effect is the product of how much state spending or tax
relief the federal government induces for each federal dollar spent and the effect of the state
  24
     Our estimates are in line with the survey by Potrafke (2018) on the effects of growing partisanship on
state policies.

                                                    21
spending or tax relief on the economy. Our estimates above yield the first component. For
the second component, we generally need a model. However, when demand effects domi-
nate, we can use a approximation suggested by Wolf (2020) ­ called "demand equivalence" ­
for the impact of fiscal policy on the aggregate economy. This simple calculation reveals di-
rectly the likely impact of IG transfers on aggregate income and, in the process, the potential
importance of partisan differences.
    By demand equivalence, the aggregate effect of fiscal policy will equal the multiplier
for federal fiscal policy times the impact of any transfer shock to individual agents ­ here
state governors ­ on agents' economic behaviors, here the governor's MPS. An increase
in IG aid stimulates state consumption by the governor's MPS which, when multiplied
by the multiplier for federal spending policy, equals the (demand equivalent) change in
aggregate income. For example, a political realignment of governorships from that in 1983
of 70% Democrat/30% Republican to 33% Democrat/67% Republican in 2018 ­ the maximal
realignment in our sample ­ and assuming an aggregate fiscal policy multiplier of .80 Ramey
(2011) will reduce the aggregate fiscal multiplier for IG transfers by .57, perhaps as much
as 50 percent.25 While our structural model of the aggregate economy in Section 4 features
supply effects that invalidate the exact demand equivalence specified by Wolf, we still confirm
the large potential importance of partisanship on the aggregate policy impacts of IG aid.26

   25
      Based on our estimated partisan differences between Republican and Democratic MPS's in Table 2,
col. 2 of -1.92, the implied demand equivalent multiplier for IG transfers in 1983 will equal .80 × (.70 ×
M P SD + .30 × (M P SD - 1.92)) while that in 2018 will equal .80 × (.33 × M P SD + .67 × (M P SD - 1.92)).
The difference in the two multipliers will then equal .57 = .80 × .37 × 1.92, where .37 is the percentage
higher share of Democratic governors in 1983 and 1.92 is the partisan increase in MPS by switching from a
Republican to Democratic governor. In our simulation model, we benchmark the two MPS's for an increase
in IG aid at 1.92 for Democrats and 0.0 for Republicans. For this benchmark the implied IG multiplier in
1983 is 1.07 and that in 2018 is .50.
   26
      The structural model, through the state budget constraint, implies that changes in IG aid may impact
state taxes and state debt as well as state spending. An empirical analysis, like that in Tables 2 and 3,
for taxes and debt is more challenging as it requires estimates of changes in tax rates, tax bases (i.e., tax
mix) and fees, as well as changes in the market value of outstanding state debt. The required data are not
available. For the structural model, therefore, we estimated reduced form equations for changes own state
revenues and the stock of (price deflated) government debt; see the Calibration Table, Table 4 below. An
earlier version of this paper provides evidence of lower tax rates (where available) and lower interest payments
under Republican governors following an increase in IG transfers; see Carlino et al. (2020). Implied behavior
in our structural model is consistent with these estimates.

                                                      22
4        Partisan states in a macroeconomic model

     To assess the aggregate effects of partisan policy rules, we specify a macroeconomic busi-
ness cycle model that features two representative states in a monetary union, each endowed
with the estimated preferences of a Democratic or Republican governor. We use the model
to evaluate the effects of a fiscal stimulus through IG transfers as a function of the partisan
difference in MPS.
     We model a New Keynesian economy of states (regions) within a monetary union, similar
to Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) and Auclert et al. (2019).27 Its New Keynesian nature
gives a role to both demand-side and supply-side policies. Firms set prices in monopolistically
competitive markets subject to nominal rigidities and some households live hand-to-mouth.
These features give rise to an aggregate demand channel for fiscal policy. Capital accu-
mulation, endogenous labor supply, and state-level distortionary taxes imply a potentially
important role for supply-side policies. We discipline the relative strength of these channels
by calibrating the model to match the federal government consumption multiplier in Ramey
(2011) We calibrate our fiscal experiment to the IG portion of the 2009 U.S. stimulus bill.


4.1      Environment

     There are two states, inhabited by representative households and intermediate firms. The
home state is of size n, while the foreign state is of size 1 - n, n  [0, 1]. The states trade with
each other, but households and capital are immobile across states. Each state has its own
government, and there is a federal fiscal authority as well as a common monetary authority.
Except for policy-makers' preferences and possibly their size, the home (H ) and foreign (F )
states are symmetric. We thus focus our discussion on the home state. As needed, we denote


    27
    Similar to Auclert et al. (2019), our model has two regions, each with two types of households who
consume two different types of goods, but with added fiscal detail to make the model suitable for the
question at hand. Unlike Auclert et al., we have no explicit model of borrowing constraints and tradable vs
nontradable sectors. Compared to Nakamura and Steinsson (2014), our model adds constrained households,
as well as state governments, intergovernmental transfers, and a role for productive government spending.

variables pertaining to the foreign state by an asterisk.28


Households There is a unit measure of households in each state, divided into constrained
and unconstrained households. Unconstrained households have access to complete markets
and accumulate private capital and government debt. A fraction 1 - µ of households is
credit constrained, has no savings, and consumes their income every period. Households
have identical utility over consumption, leisure, and state government services:

                                                            1+1/N
                                                         Nt
                       u(Ct , Nt , Gst,t ) = ln Ct - i
                                                     N            + v ((1 - K )Gst,t ),                   (4.1)
                                                         1 + 1/ N

where C is an aggregate consumption good, N is labor supply, and (1 - K )Gst,t is state
government expenditure on services other than infrastructure. K is the share of state
spending allocated to public capital. The Frisch elasticity of labor supply,                   N,   is common
across households. The household's preferences for leisure is governed by i   i
                                                                          N ; N differs

by type of household (i  {c, u} for constrained and unconstrained). While state public
goods impact household welfare, preferences for Gst,t are separable and thus do not affect
our positive analysis below.29
   Households pay proportional federal and state labor income tax rates tf and tst respec-
tively on their labor income Wt Nt , receive transfers T rt , and have profit income P rt derived
from firm ownership. Only unconstrained households can hold nominal bonds Bt or private
capital Kt . Households adjust their use of capital services by varying the rate of utilization
t , which incurs a resource cost of (t )Kt-1 . The price index for both consumption and
investment goods is Pt . The budget constraint for unconstrained agents is:


                                      f
Pt (Ctu + Itu + (t )Ktu       u           st     u    k    u      u    n               u

       Online Appendix C provides a full set of derivations and model equations.

       Public investment K Gst,t will have supply side effects through its impact on firm productivity, however.

                                                       24
Unconstrained agents also have access to complete markets, via Arrow-Debreu securities,
which are omitted for simplicity. The budget constraint is similar for constrained households,
          c
but with Bt = Ktc = 0 and without Arrow-Debreu securities. Constrained agents receive
             c
transfers T rt . In our simulations below, transfer payments to stimulate the economy are
                                              c          u
targeted only towards constrained agents (dT rt > 0; dT rt = 0).
   Household demand for consumption and investment is characterized by nested CES pref-
erences over varieties produced at home and abroad. The weight on home goods is H , and
the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign bundles is  . The price index Pt
is the cost-minimizing price index over home and foreign bundles. Capital accumulation is
subject to quadratic adjustment costs in the rate of investment.


Firms. Each state has a measure of intermediate goods producers z  [0, 1]. Each produces
its variety using a Cobb-Douglas technology, employing aggregate of utilization-adjusted
capital and of labor:


                              yh,t (z ) = At × (t Kt-1 ) Nt (z )1- .                     (4.3)


Firms perceive cost shares of capital and labor of  and 1 - , respectively. At depends on
state public infrastructure subject to a congestion externality as in Barro and Sala-I-Martin
(1992) and Drautzburg and Uhlig (2015). The equilibrium shares of public infrastructure,
private capital, and labor are , (1 -  ) and (1 -  )(1 - ), respectively. Firms face a
constant elasticity of demand () and set prices in monopolistic competition subject to a
Calvo-friction: With probability  , the firm cannot reoptimize in a given quarter and its
prices rise at the rate of trend inflation. Without frictions, firms would set a constant
         
markup   -1
              over marginal cost.


State governments. States adjust their transfer payments to households, government
consumption and public investment, and labor income tax rates in response to changes in IG


                                               25
transfers. The home and foreign state governments are symmetric, except for the propensity
                                                                      
to spend IG transfers. In the home state, the MPS is IG , while it is IG in the foreign state.
   Transfer payments to households and local governments are important in state budgets.
We assume that states spend a fraction tr of new IG aid on state transfers, T rst,t .

                                                 IGt
                            T rst,t = IG tr          - IG + T rst                         (4.4)
                                                  Pt

Here, bars indicate steady state values of transfers and IG revenue.
   The remaining IG revenue is spent on government consumption and investment Gst,t , of
which a fraction 1 - tr goes towards public services, which affects household utility.

Gx
 st,t is exogenous ("pre-transfer") government consumption plus public investment. State

demand for Gst,t and household demand have the same CES structure, with a home share H
and price elasticity  . States invest the fraction K of Gst,t in public capital (Kst,t ), where
Kst,t evolves as:


                              Kst,t = (1 - G )Kst,t-1 + K Gst,t .                         (4.6)


G is the rate of depreciation. Public capital (infrastructure) increases At for firm production
of intermediate goods.
   We assume that states adjust distortionary taxes to keep debt stable. As we discuss
below, states smooth tax rates, and gradually adjust labor income tax rates in response to
                                                                            ¯ our baseline
their debt burden and level of net expenditure. Denoting trend inflation by ,
tax rule therefore takes the following form:

Bst,t is nominal state debt, whereas bst is real debt. States change tax rates according to the
rate of adjustment  , and st,b determines how states adjust tax rates to increased interest
cost of outstanding debt. Similarly, st,E determines how states adjust rates to increased
expenditures net of IG revenue. Note that federal transfers to states, unlike expenditures
and state transfers to households, are in nominal dollars.


Federal government. The federal government levies lump-sum and distortionary taxes
to finance federal government consumption Gf,t and to provide intergovernmental transfers
to states. Real government consumption Gf,t is equalized across states in per capita terms.
Nominal per capita transfers are IGt and equal across states. The total federal allocation is
thus nIGt + (1 - n)IGt = IGt :

T rf,t denotes (nominal) federal transfers net of lump-sum taxes. Bf,t denotes federal nominal
debt. Variables with an asterisk refer to the foreign state.
   IGt transfers follows an exogenous AR(1) process with persistence IG , calibrated for
persistence of ARRA spending. The federal government finances its expenditures by taxation
of labor income, lump-sum taxes, or temporary borrowing. Federal labor income taxes
finance 1 -  f of government consumption and IG transfers every period (out of steady
state), and the government levies constant lump-sum taxes (or transfers) to balance the
federal budget. Out of steady state, the federal government finances the remaining fraction
 f of expenditures via nominal debt issuance.

Monetary authority. The monetary authority reacts to aggregate inflation and output
when setting interest rates. Specifically, it follows a standard Taylor rule, as in Gal´

Equilibrium and solution. We solve for a standard symmetric, competitive equilibrium
with each type of firm and household within each region behaving optimally, taking as given
the stochastic processes for policy and the fiscal and monetary policy rules. To approximate
the solution, we linearize the economy. We then solve for the equilibrium law of motion and
decision rules using Dynare (Adjemian et al., 2011).


4.2    Calibration

   Since our goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of fiscal policies, we calibrate our model
to match estimates of aggregate federal (defense) spending multipliers, which we take to be
0.8 for surprise spending increases, following Ramey (2011). We also match other moments
and parameter estimates from the literature, as detailed below. Importantly, we calibrate
the two states to have the estimated partisan propensities to spend IG transfers.


Type distribution, preferences, and technology. To match the defense spending mul-
tiplier, our model requires strong Keynesian features. We thus calibrate a high degree of
nominal rigidities and a large fraction of high MPC agents, similar to Auclert et al. (2019).
Specifically, we pick a persistence of nominal prices of  = 0.85 and choose a fraction of
constrained agents of 1 - µ = 0.4. Auclert et al. (2019) choose  = 0.8 and calibrate µ = 0.5

   The cost share of capital () equals .2 and, together with  implies a labor income share

as in Drautzburg and Uhlig (2015), the share of public infrastructure in production. The

The steady state inflation rate is 2%.
   The federal government adjusts labor tax rates to pay for expenditures, as in Nakamura
and Steinsson (2014). But while Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) assume a balanced budget,
we find that this yields too strong a response of the tax rate to a surprise increase in defense
spending. For example, Ramey (2011) estimates an average increase of .05pp over the first
year following a 1.0% of GDP increase in government spending. We thus assume that the
federal government adjusts labor income taxes to pay for a fraction 1 - f of changes in
current expenditures. We calibrate f = .8 to match the response of tax rates to surprise
defense spending shocks in Ramey (2011). For our policy comparison, the persistence of
defense spending shocks (G ) is set at .89 to match the duration of IG aid. The steady state

State policy rules. We estimate state tax policy as a dynamic process with a positive
rate of autocorrelation and taxes positively correlated with increases in interest paid on
debt and with expenditures net of IG transfers. In contrast, we do not find correlations
that suggest states stabilize their budgets throught adjustments in overall expenditures or
state transfers.30 In our baseline revenue rule, we thus use an estimated annual persistence
of the tax rate ( ) equal to .80, converted to a quarterly frequency of 0.95, and scale up
the correlations on interest payments and net expenditures by the same factor to achieve

    The central parameters in our calibration of state fiscal policy are the marginal propensi-
ties to spend of Democratic and Republican governors, as estimated in column (2) of Table 2.
Only the estimated difference between partisan propensities is causally identified, however.
We must therefore benchmark one of the two MPSs. We do so by setting the Republican
governor's MPS from new IG aid to zero, a result consistent with our point estimates. The
resulting MPS for a Democratic governor is therefore 1.92.32 We designate the home state to
be run by a Republican governor, and the foreign state to be run by a Democratic governor;
                                                      
therefore for increases in IG transfers, IG = 0.0 and IG = 1.92.33 Our analysis will also
perform two counterfactuals. First, we eliminate partisan differences in state responses to
          
aid (IG = IG = 1.92). Second, we vary the share (n) of the national economy run by Re-
                                           
publican (n; IG = 0.0) or Democratic (1-n; IG = 1.92) governors to illustrate how shifting
partisan control of state governments affects the impact of federal IG aid on the aggregate
economy. Otherwise, states are identical and of equal size.34


Shocks to federal transfer policy. We calibrate the IG process to the 2009 stimulus
package: We choose IG = 0.89 to yield a half-life of six quarters, given the duration of the
2009 stimulus of about three years (Drautzburg and Uhlig, 2015, Fig. 1) and a cumulative
(non-discounted) value of $320 billion (Carlino and Inman, 2016), or 2.2% of GDP at the
time. This yields a shock standard deviation IG of 100 × (1 - IG ) × 0.022  0.24: IG

  31
      The average share of transfers to households and municipalities is 38%. We assume that municipalities
spend their transfers on goods that are economically equivalent to consumption of the constrained agents.
   32
      Although our estimate is for a year-over-year increase in IG aid, we apply them more broadly to business-
cycle increases. This is consistent with Table B.2 in the Online Appendix which shows that the partisan
MPS differences are stable for multi-year increases.
   33
      The model is nearly linear in the MPS parameters. Consequently, our counterfactuals regarding the
size of the partisan differences are not sensitive to our benchmark.
   34
      To quantify the uncertainty surrounding our estimates of partisan differences, we compute confidence
intervals using the Delta method, based on the numerical derivative of the model and the asymptotic standard
error of the estimated partisan difference.

                                                        31
transfers rise initially by 0.24% of GDP, after a one standard deviation shock. For ease of
comparison, we impose the same process for the federal government spending process. The
steady state share of IG transfers in aggregate income is .02.


4.3    Results

   We quantify the role of partisanship on the effects of a surprise increase in IG transfers in
two scenarios: First, we illustrate how the dynamics of the economy vary with the preference
of the home ("Republican") governor. Our focus is on how the aggregate responses to
the IG increase changes if the initially partisan Republican governor then behaves as her
Democratic counterpart, consistent with our estimated insignificant partisan differences when
polarization was at its lower, pre-Reagan era levels. Second, we set the partisan differences
at the level prevailing in the Reagan era and vary the share (n) of the national population
living in the Republican state to compute how IG transfer multipliers would have changed
over time as a function of the changing partisan composition across U.S. governors.


Dynamics following a shock to federal transfers. Figure 4 shows the responses of
federal and state fiscal policies and output to a federal IG transfer shock. The three panels on
the left of Figure 4 show federal variables, the panels in the center outcomes in the Democratic
state, and the panels on the right outcomes in the Republican state. To isolate the causal
effect of partisanship identified in the state-level analysis, all panels show two scenarios: First,
the solid lines with squares shows the baseline scenarios arising from our partisan differences
in the MPS. Second, the dashed lines show the case without partisan estimated differences,
when the Republican has the same MPS as the Democratic governor. The difference between
these two scenarios is the effect of the identified partisan MPS differences. The thin solid
line with the surrounding band shows the point estimate of these differences with its 90%
confidence interval.
   The top panels in Figure 4 show the IG transfer shock and the state spending responses.

The top left panel shows the increased federal transfers. Transfers initially increase by 0.24%
of GDP and have a half-life of six quarters. Since transfers are exogenous, they are the same
in both scenarios of partisanship. The top middle panel shows the spending response in
the Democratic state. It always has an MPS of 1.92; spending increases by 0.47% of GDP

Impulse responses (relative to steady state) to IG transfer shock shown for two scenarios: (1) with partisan

other by a Republican governor (right column), and (2) when both states have the preferences of Democratic
governors (dashed line). The thin solid with its 90th percentile confidence interval as the shaded area shows

(=1.92×0.244%) on impact. It then declines as the shock to IG aid gradually declines
over time; the solid and dashed lines overlap in this case. The top right panel shows the
spending response in the Republican state with either the baseline MPS of zero (solid line
with squares) or with the counterfactual Democratic MPS of 1.92. Since spending depends
only on IG transfers and the MPS, it is zero in the baseline scenario, and equal to that in
the Democratic state without partisan differences. The narrow line with its 90% confidence
band shows the estimated (negative) partisan effect on spending in the Republican state (top
row, right panel). Republican state spending is statistically significantly lower (below zero)
than with a Democratic MPS.35 Given an increase in IG aid, Democrats increase spending.
   The center rows of Figure 4 shows the path of taxation. To finance the IG transfers,
federal taxes are increased by .3% of their steady state value, or by .09pp in absolute terms;
center row, left panel of Figure 4. With an MPS greater than unity in Democratic states,
Democratic states must increase state labor income taxes to pay for increased spending above
the $1 of new IG aid. As a result, state labor income tax rates must also rise, rising by up to
.43% of the steady state rate (or 0.02pp) after 14 quarters and remaining at the new higher
rate until after the 20-quarter horizon shown in the graph (solid line with squares; middle
row, center panel). The tax increase is only slightly higher when policy in the Republican
state changes (dashed line). Since Republican states do not increase spending but rather
allocate their increases in IG transfers to tax cuts (given their tax rule), state tax rates
fall, shown as the declining line with squares (center row, right panel). However, when the
Republican state is assigned the MPS of Democratic states, state labor income taxes will
now need to rise, not fall, along the "Democratic" dashed line. Again the estimated partisan
difference in tax responses is shown by the narrow line with its 90% confidence band in
the center row, right panel. The estimated level of Republican state taxation is shown as
significantly lower than that under Democratic policies state and centered at -.95% of steady

  35
     See Figure C.1 in the Online Appendix for the paths of state government consumption, investment, and
transfers. With a Democratic MPS, state government consumption and investment rises by 0.29% of GDP
and state transfers rise by 0.18%, adding up to the overall 0.47% increase.

state taxes, after 20 quarters. The shaded 90% confidence interval for this difference is (-.32%
to -1.58%). Given an increase in IG aid, Republican states cut taxes.
   The difference in fiscal policies across Republican and Democratic states lead to signifi-
cant differences in the paths of state output and in aggregate national output. The bottom
middle panel of Figure 4 shows the path of Democratic state output to rise by .28% on im-
pact and still by .14% after five quarters when only Democratic states raise state spending
(solid line with squares). Republican states, which do not raise state spending but instead
cut taxes, have much more modest gains in state output, shown as the solid line with squares
in the bottom right panel. If, however, Republican states were to spend IG transfers as do
Democratic states (dashed line) they would also enjoy significant gains in state output. The
end results is significantly lower output gains in Republican states because of their decision
to allocate IG transfers to tax cuts rather than spending: Output increases by .26% of GDP
less than with a Democratic MPS, with a 90% confidence interval of (-.09%, -.43%).
   Finally, note the nation as a whole and also Democratic states enjoy less output gains
because Republican states do not spend IG transfers. The higher dashed line in the bottom
left panel of Figure 4 shows national output gains if all states spent IG transfers as do
Democratic states. It implies an output gain of 0.28% on impact ­ which would be equally
shared by the two states, as the dashed lines in all bottom panels show. National output gains
with partisan differences are less than half as high: Output grows by only 0.13% (line with
squares; bottom left) on impact. Output is persistently lower with the partisan differences
in spending. This is because of calibrating the model to have an impact (defense spending)
multiplier of 0.8 and the fact that spending aggregated across the two (equal-sized) states is
only half as high with partisan policies. To a lesser extent, there are also spillovers: Output
is lower with the partisan spending policies not only in the Republican state, where it is .26%
lower (solid line with band; bottom right panel), with a 90% confidence interval of (-.09%,
-.43%). It is also lower by .04% in the Democratic state (thin solid line with band; bottom
middle panel) as a result of lower spillover demand for its exports.

Comparing multipliers. Given partisan differences, how much does the federal govern-
ment stimulate the economy for each dollar of new IG aid? And how does the impact of IG
aid compare to that of new defense spending as estimated by Ramey (2011)? How does the
IG multiplier change as preferences of state policymakers change? We follow Mountford and
Uhlig (2009) and analyze present discounted value (PDV) multipliers, defined as the ratio
of the PDV of output relative to the PDV of federal transfers. Figure 5 first replicates the
federal spending and aggregate output from Figure 4, and then also shows how the resulting
PDV multipliers evolve over time. The impact multiplier is just the ratio of the impact GDP
response to the impact spending impulse. For longer horizons, the multiplier is the ratio of
the discounted sums of the GDP response and the spending impulse for each horizon.

              IG: all Democrats   IG: partisan differences      defense spending   IG: difference between scenarios (90% CI)

Panel (a) shows identical paths of federal IG transfer aid and defense spending by quarter. Panel (b) shows
the simulated paths for national GDP for (i) defense spending (dark, dashed line with circles), (ii) IG aid
with one Republican and one Democratic state (dark line with squares; partisan differences), and (iii) IG aid
with Democratic policies in both states (dashed line; no partisan differences). The line thin within panels
(b) and (c) show the differences in simulated GDP (panel b) and PDV multipliers (panel c) between the
scenarios when states are run by one Republican and one Democratic governor (partisan differences) and
when states implement Democratic policies (no partisan differences).


    Figure 5 compares the response of the economy to a defense spending shock to responses
for an equivalent IG shock. Spending, shown in the left panel, follows the same path for
both the shock to IG spending and federal defense spending. The middle panel shows that
if policymakers in all states implement Democratic spending policies, aggregate output rises


                                                               36
initially by 0.28% (dashed line). This contrasts with defense spending (dark line with circles),
which would lead to an increase of 0.2% on impact. Intuitively, output rises more with IG
spending when all states implement Democratic policies, because they spend some funds of
their own, in addition to federal spending. However, if half the states are Republican and
do not spend from IG aid (solid line with squares), output rises by only 0.13% on impact.
    Partisan differences can change the relative effectiveness of different federal policy in-
struments. We calibrate the defense spending multiplier to be 0.8 on impact (dark line with
circles; right panel of Figure 5). If all states follow Democratic spending policies, the aggre-
gate multiplier for IG transfers is 1.14.36 But with partisan differences ­ half Republican, half
Democratic states ­ the resulting IG multiplier is 0.53 on impact, 61 cents lower per dollar
spent than with no partisan differences (thin line with 90% confidence band). Compared to
having all Democratic governors, partisan differences significantly lower the IG multiplier for
all 20 quarters as shown. On impact, the 90% confidence interval for this differences ranges
from -$.20 to -$1.02. With only Democratic governors, federal IG spending stimulates the
economy more than defense spending. But with the partisan differences, shocks to defense
spending have a greater multiplier, both on impact and over 20 quarters.
    Table 5 compares short-run and long-run multipliers for IG transfers and federal defense
spending for three scenarios: (i) when states spend on transfers, consumption, and invest-
ment (panel a); (ii) when federal tax rates are adjusted as slowly as state tax rates, so that
the federal spending must be initially largely debt financed (panel b), as, for example, in
Chodorow-Reich (2019); and (iii) when states spend only on state consumption (panel c).
Given our calibration, the federal defense multiplier is, by construction, 0.80 on impact. The
IG impact multiplier when all states have Democratic governors (top panel) is higher, at
1.14. However, allowing for partisan differences ­ again, half Republican, half Democratic
states ­ lowers the impact multiplier to 0.53. With states spending only on government con-
  36
      The federal consumption multiplier is smaller than the IG multiplier because our denominator is the cost
of stimulus to the federal government, not overall spending. In response to an IG shock, total government
spending including spending by states exceeds the federal government spending. Multipliers larger than
unity in our analysis do not imply crowding in of private activity, but rather state activity.

sumption (panel c), the impact IG multipliers is larger, as state government consumption
does not discourage work as do transfer payments to constrained households in panel (a).37
Long-run multipliers are only slightly lower than the impact multipliers.

All results based on the calibration of the economy as in Table 4.


    Finally, anything that increases the effectiveness of demand side policies in the model
or the MPS in the data increases the IG multiplier, and also the importance of partisan
differences. Table 5 illustrates this in two ways. First, if we hold the nominal interest fixed
for ten quarters (ZLB duration), demand side (spending) policies become more important,
and short-run effects of supply side policies less important. The impact of fiscal policy on the
  37
     Our results are intuitive in the light of our calibration that gives an important role to demand side
features of our model, given the "demand equivalence" in Wolf (2020). Of our simulations, the results in
Panel (c) comes closest to meeting the assumptions needed for Wolf's equivalence result. States now provide
only the consumption good and do not provide public infrastructure and targeted transfers as in panels (a)
and (b) with supply side effects. The multiplier differences shown in Panel (c), col. 3 (without ZLB) for
partisan spending ( 1              1
                    2 Democrats, 2 Republicans) and no partisan spending (all Democrats) are very close to
the implied difference from Wolf approximation of -.77: (= [.5×1.92+.5×0.0]×.80-[1.0×1.92-0.0×0.0]×.80).

                                                    38
aggregate therefore rises; see, for example, Christiano et al. (2011).38 Here, the IG multipliers
also rise, as does the importance of partisan differences. For example, it increases from -0.61
to -1.17 on impact in panel (a). Second, all multipliers are larger still when federal fiscal
policy is initially debt financed. But because the multiplier here increases due to supply side
policies (initially lower taxes), the partisan difference is unchanged.

Panel (a) shows the share of Democratic and Republican governors who are Republican, by year. Panel (b)
shows the simulated impact multiplier for IG transfers for the baseline specification of Table 4, where the
solid dark line traces the value of the simulated aggregate multiplier and the thin line shows the changes in
the multiplier as the share of Republican governors increases above its lowest share of 30 percent in 1983. As
the Republican share rises from .30 in 1984, the impact multiplier declines, shown as the thin line, largely
below zero, and its 90th percentile confidence band for the multiplier's predicted decline.


                Our results illustrate the importance for macro policy of knowing who is running the
states, Republicans or Democrats. The fraction of states run by Republicans has varied
significantly over our sample period; see Figure 6. Panel (a) shows the fraction of states gov-
erned by Republicans over the post-Reagan period, omitting the rare independent governors.
This Republican fraction ranges from a low of 30% just after Reagan took office to a high of
67% during Trump's presidency. Using these values to calibrate n in our model translates to
sizable differences in the impact IG multiplier, shown in panel (b) of Figure 6. The transfer

     We implement the ZLB in our linearized model via monetary policy shocks calibrated to keep interest
rates constant for 10 quarters, all revealed at the same time as the fiscal policy shocks.

multiplier peaks during the periods of low Republican governorships, specifically during Rea-
gan's first term and Clinton's and Obama's first terms. Allowing for estimation uncertainty
of partisan effects yields the confidence interval for the impact multiplier as the shaded band
in panel (b). Moving from the low 1983 share to the high 2018 Republican share lowers the
multiplier by -.45, with a 90% confidence interval of (-.15, -.75), very similar to the "demand
equivalence" estimate of -.51 at the end of Section 3.



5        Model validation in aggregate time series

     While state partisan preferences have a significant policy impact in our structural model,
it is valuable to see if there is direct statistical evidence for partisan effects as well. We
do so by estimating multipliers to IG transfer shocks in a model that includes the share of
Republican governors.39
     We use the surprise component of federal IG transfers as the transfer shock, treating it as
exogenous to other current shocks. Identification of the IG shock is similar to the approach
proposed by Blanchard and Perotti (2002) for government purchases and adopted to IG
transfers in Carlino and Inman (2016): We assume a decision lag in fiscal policy, so that
unexpected changes in fiscal policy are contemporaneously unaffected by changes in current
GDP. We view this assumption as reasonable, since the NIPA data used here excludes an
important automatic stabilizer, the unemployment insurance program. We also include a
rich set of controls to ensure that the transfer shocks are unexpected by economic agents.
     Our estimating equation applies the local projection approach of Jord`
                                                                          a (2005):


         ln GDPt+h = 0,h + Rep,h Rept-4 + 0,h ln IGt + Rep,h ln IGt × (Rept-4 - Rep)
    39
     We could also test the analogous prediction that, on impact, Democratic-governed states have higher
levels of economic activity ­ but that after a few quarters, growth in Republican states is higher. In line with
this prediction, we estimate in the state panel data that the change in the employment-to-population ratio is
lower under marginally elected Republican governors than under Democratic governors: If IG aid increases
by 1pp, the employment to population ratio drops by 0.04pp to 0.05pp relative to the Democratic-run state,
depending on the specification, see our Online Appendix. Table B.3 columns (1) to (5) for results on current
employment changes, and columns (6) and (7) for future employment changes.

where xt- includes lags of GDP, federal expenditures, state and local expenditures, federal
tax revenue net of transfers, and IG transfers, all in logs and real per capita terms. We lag the
share of Republican governors by four quarters to account for the fact that state budgets are
passed one fiscal year in advance, the same as in our panel regressions. Since Ramey (2011)
and Leeper et al. (2013) have documented the importance of accounting for agents' informa-
tion set when estimating fiscal multipliers, we use survey expectations to proxy for agents'
information: specifically, one-quarter ahead inflation and output growth expectations, one-
quarter ahead expectations of both federal and state and local government purchases, and
three-quarter ahead government purchase expectations. All expectation measures are from
the Philadelphia Fed's Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF). We also interact the ex-
pectation measures with the share of Republican governors. We use quarterly data from
1981q1 to 2018q3: It is the longest sample for which all SPF series are available, and largely
coincides with our post-Reagan sample. Our focus is on Rep,h , an estimate of the response
at horizon h of GDP to the IG shock as a function of the share of Republican governors.
   Figure 7, panel (a) shows the estimate for the impact of an IG shock worth 1% of GDP
on impact changes when the share of Republican governors is one standard deviation above
average. Specifically, it shows Rep,h times a 10.8pp higher Republican share (one standard
deviation) and converted to a share of GDP, along with the 67% and 90% confidence intervals.
As predicted by the structural model, on impact and for the first four quarters afterwards,
a surprise increase in IG aid lowers the GDP response significantly when the Republican
share is above average. But after two to three years, the GDP effects are estimated to
be significantly higher when the Republican share of governors is larger. We also estimate
eq. (5.1) with the IG level on the left-hand-side, to compute the corresponding change in the
cumulative multiplier; see Figure 7, panel (b). The cumulative multiplier is also estimated
to be significantly lower on impact and for the following four quarters when the Republican


                                                  41
share of governors is above average. The confidence interval for the cumulative multiplier is
centered near zero after about 10 quarters.40

Shown are the changes in the IG Transfer multipliers for when the share of Republican governors is increased by one standard

    The point estimate of the aggregate multiplier difference here is large. Centered near -2
for a 10.8pp. increase in the share of Republican governors, the change is much larger than
our model simulations. In the baseline calibration of the model, the change in the impact
multiplier is much smaller, only about -0.3 for a 30pp change in the share of Republican
governors, see Figure 6. In terms of the time series estimates in Figure 7, this point estimate
would be towards the upper end of the 90% confidence interval. The structural model's
predicted effect would rise, however, if we calibrated the model with all state spending to
be allocated to state consumption, and would about double for a ZLB; see Table 5. Overall,
the time series evidence points to a potentially bigger role for partisan differences than in
our baseline calibration. If anything, our simulated partisan differences seem a conservative
estimate for the importance of partisan politics for the administration of macroeconomic
policy through state governments.

6     Conclusion

    While well understood for the implementation of micro-economic policy in fiscal unions,
IG aid as a tool for macro-economic stabilization policy has only recently received serious
scholarly attention, primarily because of the importance of such aid in the U.S. government's
response to the Great Recession. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
allocated $318 billion to state and local governments. The current Covid Recession has
also called for significant assistance to state and local government: Over the past year
(2020), the U.S. CARES Act plus its Supplemental Covid Relief have jointly allocated $807
billion dollars through state and local governments for increased (state-run) unemployment
insurance ($450 billion) and the protection and expansion of state government services ($357
billion). Finally, the European Union in a major break with policy tradition has recently
approved an EU funded A
                      C750 billion fiscal relief package to be allocated by member states.
    States have discretion in how IG aid is finally allocated. State politics, and importantly
the partisan preferences of state political leaders, are therefore likely to play a significant role
in such spending, specifically whether to state services and transfers or to state tax relief. We
have seen that allocation can make a significant difference for the final impact of IG aid on
macro-economic performance. Our work provides evidence that because of partisan based
state politics, exacerbated by rising national political polarization, Republican governors
allocate extra aid almost exclusively to tax relief while Democratic governors choose to
(more than) fully spend their increased aid. Our New Keynesian model shows that these
partisan choices matter. Because Democratic governors spend their aid and Republican
governors provide tax relief, and because the model favors demand side policies over supply
side policies for short-term stimulus, the impact multiplier of federal IG aid is significantly
larger the greater the share of the nation's governors who are Democrats.
    With the growing importance of IG aid in fiscal unions, we have identified a new and
potentially important source of model heterogeneity ­ state partisanship ­ requiring our
consideration.
