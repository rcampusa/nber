          Exchange Rate Dynamics nd the. Overshooting Hypothesis

                                 Abstract

      In this paper we analyze the determinants of the evolution of ex-

 change rates within the context of alternative models of exchange rate

 dynamics. We examine the overshooting hypothesis in models which empha-

 size differential speeds of adjustment in asset and goods markets as

well as in models which emphasize portfolio balance considerations. We

 show that exchange rate overshooting is not an intrinsic characteristic

of the foreign exchange market and that it depends on a set of specific

assumptions. We also show that the overshooting is not a characteristic

of the assumption of perfect foresight nor does it depend in general on

the assumption that goods and asset markets clear at different speeds.

As long as the speeds of adjustment in the various markets are less than

infinite, the key factor determining the short run effects of a monetary

expansion is the degree of capital mobility. When capital is highly

mobile, the exchange rate overshoots its long—run value and when capital

is relatively immobile the exchange rate undershoots its long—run value.

Within the context of the portfolio—balance model we show that the effects

of a monetary expansion on the dynamics of exchange rates and in partic-

ular on whether exchange rates overshoot or undershoot their equilibrium

path depend critically on the specification of asset choice, on the degree

of substitution among assets, and on the quality of the various assets In

being an inflation hedge. Specifically, when Internationally traded goods

are a better inflation hedge than nontraded goods, the nominal exchange

rate overshoots the domestic price leveland conversely.

     The evolution of the international monetary system into a regime of
flexible exchange rates and the large volitility of these rates during
the 1970s have led to a renewed interest in studying the principal deter-
minants of equilibrium exchange rates. The large fluctuations stimulated
theories of exchange rate dynamics and have led to the development of var-
ious versions of the overshooting hypothesis. 1/ The explanations of the
overshooting phenomenon vary. All explanations rely on the short—run fix—
ity of some nominal quantity. Some account for it by the assumption that
in the short run commodity prices are slow to adjust relative to asset
prices (Dornbusch, 1976); some attribute it to the lack of sufficient spec-
ulation in the markets for foreign exchange (McKinnori, 1976); some attribute
it to the differential effects of new information on commodity and asset
markets (Dornbusch, 1978; Frenkel, l981a, 198lb; Frenkel and Mussa, 1980;
Mussa, 1979) and some attribute it to the implications of the process by
which asset holders restore portfolio balance in the face of disturbances
(Calvo and Rodriguez, 1977; Branson, 1979; Kouri, 1976; Ethier, 1979). 2/

hypothesis, see Levich (1981).

studies includes Bilson (1979), Flood (1979), Henderson (1979), Kimbrough
(1980), Liviatan (1980), Mussa (1982), and Shafer (1980). Further references

     In this paper we analyze the implications of two classes of models
for the dynamics of exchange rates. We assume throughout that expecta-
tions are formed rationally and that individuals are fully informed. We
therefore preclude the possibility that the dynamics of exchange rates
are due to systematic expectational errors.

     In Section II we analyze the dynamics of exchange rates in a model
in which commodity prices are slow to adjust. The basic structure of the
model is due to Dornbusch (1976). Our extension allows for a finite rate
of capital mobility and we show that the speed of adjustment in capital
markets plays a critical role in determining whether or not following a
monetary disturbance the exchange rate overshoots its equilibrium value.
It is shown that when the degree of capital mobility is low, the exchange
rate is likely to undershoot its equilibrium value.

     In Section III we analyze the dynamics of exchange rates within the
framework of the portfolio—balance model with complete flexibility of
prices. In this context we interpret earlier results of Calvo and Rodri-
guez (1977) concerning the effect of monetary growth on the real exchange
rate. We show that the fundamental factor determining the dynamics of the
real exchange rate is. the specification of the portfolios of assets, the
degree of capital mobility, and the relative qualities of the various
assets as hedges against inflation.    The study of the dynamics of the
real exchange rate shows that throughout the adjustment process the noini—
nal exchange rate is changing at a rate which differs from the rate of
inflation. It follows that a policy which ties the exchange rate to the
rate of inflation would be inconsistent with the equilibrium self—fulfil-
ling expectations adjustment path.


        II.   Exchange Rate Dynamics and the Speed of Adjustment in
                        Commodity and Asset Markets

     In this section, we analyze the dynamics of exchange rates and the
overshooting hypothesis from the perspective which emphasizes the speeds
of adjustment in commodity and asset markets. This perspective was de-
veloped by Dornbusch (1976) who assumed that, as a first approximation,
asset markets clear instantaneously while adjustment in commodity markets
is sluggish.   Dornbusch showed that when these assumptions are coupled
with the assumption that expectations are rational, a monetary expansion
induces an immediate depreciation of the currency in excess of its long—
run equilibrium value; i.e. , a monetary expansion results in an overshoot-
ing of the exchange rate. To gain further understanding into the rela-
tionship between the dynamics of exchange rates and the speeds of adjust-
roent in goods and asset markets, we modify the Dornbusch model and allow
for a finite speed of adjustment in asset markets. It is shown that un-
der these circumstances the key factor determining whether the exchange
                                     —3—

rate overshoots or undershoots its equilibrium value is the relation-
ship between the speed of adjustment in asset markets, the interest elas-
ticity of the demand for ney, and the effects of relative prices on the
balance of trade. The speed of adjustment in comndity markets does not
seem to be a fundamental factor.
       Our analysis draws on the analytical framework developed by Dorn—
busch (1976) and, in      order to highlight the key point, we simplify the
ridel by abstracting from many of the inconsequential details. We assume
that the economy faces a given price of foreign output and a given world
rate of interest, that domestically produced goods differ from foreign
goods, and that the spply of output is fixed.


                             11.1. The Money Market

     Let the demand for real balances depend on real income, Y, and on
the rate of interest, and let the logarithm of the demand be linear in
the logarithm of income, y, and in the rate of interest, i. Equilibrium
in the money market attains when


                     1.
(1)     m—p=y—1
where m and p denote, respectively, the logarithms of the nominal quan-
tity of ney and the price level. Thus, the equilibrium rate of inter-
est can be written as:

(2) i=by—b(m—p).



                             11.2. The Goods Market

     The demand for domestic output, D, is composed of domestic demand
and foreign demand. This demand can be expressed as the sum of total
domestic absorption (domestic demand for domestic and foreign goods) and
the excess of exports over imports (the trade balance surplus). Absorp-
tion    is assumed to depend on real income, while the trade balance is as-
sumed to    depend on. the relative price of domestic and foreign goods. 1/
Total   demand for domestic output can therefore be written as:
  1/  This specification abstracts from the effects of the rate of inter-
est on absorption, the effects of income on the trade balance, and the
distinction between GNP and GDP that results from interest income on net
ownership of foreign securities. These abstractions are made for simpli-
city since they do not affect the nature of the argument. Some of these
factors are allowed for by Dornbusch (1976).
                                   —4—


(3)     D =    A(Y) + T(SP*/P)
where A denotes domestic absorption, T denotes the balance of trade, S
denotes the exchange rate (the price of foreign exchange in terms of do—
mestic currency), * the fixed foreign price level (in tern's of foreign
currency), and P the price of domestic output. For convenience we define
units so as to equate the foreign price level to unity; therefore, the
                                                                       =
trade balance may be viewed as depending on the real exchange rate s
                                                                     and
S/P. Furthermore, since real output is given, absorption is fixed
the demand for domestic output varies with the real exchange rate.

     Long—run equilibrium obtains when the demand for domestic output
equals the fixed supply, that is, when D = Y. We define the real ex-
change rate that is associated with this long—run equilibrium by . In
order to abstract from long—run accumulation of foreign assets, we assume
that in the long run the trade balance is zero, so that T() = 0. This
assumption, that is made for convenience only, implies that absorption
equals the given level of output (A(Y)   Y).

     Proceeding with the log—linear specification, the trade balance is
written as


(4)
         T =      5    2.n (s/i)



or equivalently as


(4') T (e—p —k)

where e, p, and k are the logarithms of S, P, and , respectively.    Sub-
stituting (4') in (3), and recalling that A(Y) = Y, the demand for domes-
tic output is



(3') DY+ (e—p—k).

     The percentage change in the price level, j,   is   assumed to be pro-
portional to excess demand (D — Y):



(5)
              =       i(D   — Y)
                                      —5—

where the parameter iT measures the speed of adjustment in the goods mar—
ket.l/ Substituting (3') into (5) yields:

(6)         =a (e—p—k)
where     a =   rrc5.



     At each moment of time, the price level is given and its evolution
is described by equation (6).  The coefficient a is the product of two
factors:iT——the speed of adjustment in the goods market, and ——the sen-
sitivity of the balance of trade to the real exchange rate. As will be
seen below, of these two factors only the latter plays a role in deter-
mining whether or not nnetary changes result in exchange rate overshoot—
i ng.




          11.3 The Capital Account and the Balance of Payments

     Equilibrium in the world asset market attains when the difference
between the rates of interest on domestic and foreign securities, that
are identical in all respects except for the currency of denomination,
just equals the expected rate of change in the exchange rate. For exam-
ple, when the domestic currency is expected to depreciate at the percen-
tage rate x, long—run equilibrium requires that


(7)



where i' denotes the rate of interest on assets with foreign currency
denomination.  It is assumed that expectations concerning the percentage
rate of depreciation depend on the relationship between the equilibrium
long—run exchange rate   and the current rate, S. Expressed logarithmi-
cally,

(8)      x = O(e —      e);   0 > 0

where   is the logarithm of S and where 0 denotes the expectations ad just—
ment coefficient, the determinants of which are analyzed below. Equation
(8) states that when the long—run value, , exceeds the current value,
e, individuals expect a depreciation of the currency toward , i.e. , the
expected depreciation, x, is positive.

  1/ The assumption that prices change at a finite speed is taken as a
stylized fact and we do not attempt to rationalize it here. For an in-
teresting theory of sticky prices see Mussa (1978). The specification
of the rate of inflation as a function of excess demand is analogous to
the specification in Dornbusch (1976), equation (8).
                                                    —6--


     The equilibrium that is described in equation (7) is attained through
the mechanism of arbitrage that is effected through the international mo-
bility of capital.   It is assumed that capital flows are proportional to
(i —    — x)——the discrepancy between the net rates of return on the var-
ious securities. Substituting equation (8) for the expected depreciation
of the currency, we can specify the international flow of capital as:


(9) C =        fi   —   i   —   e(e   —
                                          e)}

where C denotes net capital inflow (the surplus in the capital account)
and where 3 denotes the speed of adjustment in asset markets.1/ When
capital is perfectly mobile,     =   and the mobility of capital ensures
that equation (7) holds all the time.   On the other extreme, chen 3 = 0
capital is completely immobile and the mechanism of arbitrage in asset
markets is completely inoperative. It is shown below that the magnitude
of S is a key factor determining the dynamics of exchange rates.

     Equilibrium in the balance of payments in the absence of Central
Bank intervention is attained when the sum of the trade balance and the
capital account is zero. Adding equations (4') and (9) and substituting
equation (2) for the (equilibrium) domestic rate of interest yield


(10) (e - p - k) +              3{by      - b(m -   p) —   i* -   - e)}   = 0




as the equilibrium condition for the balance of payments. It should be
noted that the equilibrium condition for the balance of payments (which
is a flow relationship) is necessary since the speed of adjustment     in
                                                                  instan-
asset markets is assumed to be finite. When asset markets clear
taneously, equation (10) always holds as an identity and the equilibrium
condition is replaced by the interest parity condition as in equation (7)
above .   2/




  1/  The theoretical deficiencies of the capital flow equation (9) are
well known.  Since our purpose is to highlight the role of alternative
assumptions concerning the speed of adjustment in asset markets, we chose
to specify the simplest formulation and to abstract from many other is-
sues.
  2/ For a discussion of the role of flow equilibrium when asset markets
adjust slowly see Kouri (1976) and Niehans (1977). For a discussion of
the conceptual issues involved in the formulation of flow equilibrium in
asset markets see Mussa (1976). See also Driskill (1978).

              11.4. Equilibrium Exchange Rate, the Speed of
                     Adjustment, and the Price Level

     We turn now to an analysis of the equilibrium exchange rate and the
relationship between the exchange rate, the price level, and the speed
of adjustment in goods and asset markets. We first note that in the long
run, given the quantity of money, the exchange rate equals its long—run
value 1/ and i =     i'.
                       Substituting 1* for i in equation (l)——the condi-
tion for money market equilibrium——the long—run price level, , can be
expressed as


(11)


To obtain the relationship between  and , we note that in the long run
excess demand for goods is zero and, therefore,  = 0; it follows from
equation (6) that


(12)      ep+k.
As may be seen from equations (11) and (12), the system satisfies the
homogeneity postulate: a given change in the money supply results in an
equiproportional change in the long—run equilibrium price level and the
exchange rate. Using equations (11) and (12) in equation (10), we can
write the equilibrium in the balance of payments as

(13) {(e -    ) - (p -          + [b(p -    -   - e)]=   0.



Equation (13) expresses the various accounts in the balance of payments
as functions of the discrepancies between current and long—run values of
the price level and the exchange rate. Since at each moment of time the
price level is given, equilibrium in the balance of payments is obtained
only when the exchange rate is at a level which satisfies equation (13).
By collecting terms in (13), the equilibrium exchange rate can be written
as



(14) e=e+c(p—)
              — 2b    >
 where c =    +            0.


     1/
      In the present framework the long—run value of the exchange rate is
fixed.  In general, the equilibrium value may be specified in terms of a
movement along an equilibrium path; see Mussa (1982).

                (14),   which is central to our analysis, relates the equilibrium
Equation
exchange rate to its long—run value and to the discrepancy between cur-
rent and long—run prices. This is a reduced form relationship which
holds at each moment of time. it is pertinent to note that, depending
                                                                   level
on the sign of the parameter r, the relationship between the price
and the         exchange rate may be positive or negative.   As may be seen, the
sign       depends on the degree of capital market integration which we
          of
have characterized in terms of the speed of adjustment 3. When the speed
of adjustment is low, >8b and c> 0. In thatthe    case, given and , the
exchange rate and the price level must move in       same direction. When
the speed of adjustment is high,      <  b and the opposite holds. In the
extreme case for which      = ° the price level and the exchange rate are
inversely related  since in  that case c = —(bIO) < 0.11 The determinants
                                                                         be
of the relationship between the price level and the exchange rate may
                                                                     values
interpreted in terms of equations (10) or (13). For given long—runthe bal-
of prices and exchange rates, a rise in the price level worsens
ance of trade and improves the capital account. The improvement in the
capital account results from the rise in
                                          the rate of interest necessary
to restore money market equilibrium in the face of a higher price level.
The extent of the required rise in the rate of interest depends on b——the
interest (semi) elasticity of the demand for money.    When the speed of
asset market adjustment is high, a given rise    in the rate of interest
results in a large improvement  in  the capital account,  which is likely
to more than offset the deterioration in the balance of trade. To res-
tore equilibrium in the balance of payments, theThe
                                                domestic currency will

ves to restore equilibrium by worsening the trade balance and by creating
expectations of currency depreciation and, thereby, worsening the capital
account.  tn this case, the exchange rate and the price level move in
                                                                    in
opposite directions. If, on the other hand, the speed of adjustment
                                                      is low relative to (5/b),
asset markets is low (or more precisely, if               in the price
the deterioration of the trade balance following the rise and balance
level  would outweigh the improvement in the capital account,
of payments equilibrium would require a depreciation of the currency,
i.e., a rise in the exchange rate. In that case the dynamics  of adjust-
ment are characterized by a situation in which prices and exchange rates
move in the same direction.

                                    and Undershoo4g
      In the previous section we characterized the relationship between
 the exchange rate, the price level, and the speed of asset market adjust-
 ment. This relationship can be illustrated with the aid of Figures 1 and
                                                                       In

The schedule plots equation (6) and its slope is unity.l/ The intercept
of the schedule corresponds to the (logarithm of the) equilibrium long—run
real exchange            rate k.
                        Also, along this schedule the balance of trade
must be balanced so that T = 0.                      All points to the right of the
                                                                  = 0 lo-
cus correspond to an excess demand for goods and to a trade balance sur-
plus. Consider next the schedule along which the capital account is bal-
anced. From (13), the capital account can be written as
          c   =
                  [b(p
                          —
                              )   — 3   ( —
                                              e)].
Thus, the slope of the schedule along which the capital account is balan-
ced (C=O) is —3/b < 0 as is shown in Figures 1 and 2. Points below the
C0 schedule correspond to a deficit in the capital account.

     The equilibrium relationship between the price level and the exchange
rate (which must hold at each moment of time) is summarized by equation
(14) that is plotted as the QQ schedule in Figures 1 and 2. The slope of
the schedule is 1/c which may be positive or negative depending on the
sign of c which in turn depends on whether       is smaller or larger than
(5/b. When the degree of capital tbility is low,    < (5/b and the slope of
the schedule is positive and larger than unity since     < 1.   When asset
markets adjust relatively fast, the QQ schedule is negatively sloped.
Since along the equilibrium path the balance of payments is balanced, the
QQ schedule must pass in a region which is characterized by a surplus in
the balance of trade and a deficit in the capital account (T > 0, C < 0)
or by a deficit in the balance of trade and a surplus in the capital ac-
count (T < 0, C > 0). Thus, when the QQ schedule is negatively sloped as
in Figure 1, it must be steeper than the C0 locus. 2/

          Consider point B in Figures 1 and 2.                At this point, there is an ex-
cess demand for goods and > 0. Also at point B there is a trade balance
surplus (T > 0) and a capital account deficit (C < 0). The path of ad-
justment is described by the arrows along the equilibrium schedule QQ and
long—run equilibrium is reached at point D where prices and exchange rates
reach their equilibrium values     and       At this point expected depre-
ciation of the currency is zero, domestic and foreign rates of interest
are equalized so that the capital account is balanced and goods market
clear so that p = 0, and the balance of trade Is balanced. As is evident,
in this del the trade balance and the capital account play a symmetric
role in determining the equilibrium exchange rate. It may not be argued
therefore that the exchange rate is determined exclusively in asset mar—


     1/   The       = 0    schedule would be flatter than a 45 line i th demand
for goods were to depend negatively on the rate of interest as in Dorn—
busch      (1976).       In that case a rise in the price level lowers the demand
via the higher relative price and via the rate of interest that must be
higher in order to restore uney market equilibrium.

of    B tends to infinity.

kets and not in the commodity markets.                 In the extreme case, however,
when =oo , as in Dornbusch's model (1976), this dichotomy does exist.
The exchange rate is determined at that level that ensures that the rates
of return on domestic and foreign securities are equalized at each in-
stant so as to satisfy equation (7). The size of the capital account in
turn is determined by the balance of trade so as to ensure equilibrium in
the balance of payments.

     To analyze the effects of a monetary expansion, consider an initial
long—run equilibrium at point A with    and    as the corresponding price
level and exchange rate. Through point A passes a QQ schedule (not drawn)
which corresponds to the initial quantity of money. A rise in the money
supply raises the long—run equilibrium values of prices and the exchange
rate equiproportionally to j5 and i and thus moves the long—run equili-
brium combination from point A to point D. The initial QQ schedule moves
to the right to the position that is drawn in Figures 1 and 2. Upon the
change in the money supply the price level is given at its initial value
      Equilibrium in the balance of payments requires that the exchange
rate jumps immediately to e1 and the short—run equilibrium is attained at
                                                                  markets
point B. As may be seen, when the speed of adjustment in asset
is relatively high, the exchange rate overshoots its equilibrium long—run
value (as in Figure 1) while when the speed of adjustment is relatively
low, the exchange rate undershoots its long—run equilibrium value (as.in
Figure 2).

     The impact effect of the monetary change can be analyzed in terms of
                                                  d  = d and thus, given
equation (14). By the homogeneity postulate dm =                with res-
the price level, the short—run elasticity of the exchange rate
pect to the        money supply is:

(15)           =   i.
                        —
          dm


and substituting (14) for ,              the   elasticity can be written as


                            —   >
 (15')         = i      —           1.
          dm

When the speed of adjustment is relatively high so that      > 5/b, c < 0
and the short—run elasticity exceeds unity as in Figure    1.  This is the
overshooting phenomenon that corresponds to the    Dornbusch  case.  On the
other hand, when the speed of adjustment is relatively low so that S <5/b,
 C   ispositive but smaller than unity, the short—run elasticity is smaller
than unity, and the exchange rate undershoots its new long—run equili—
 rium value. In the border case for which = /b, the QQ schedule
                                                                               is ver-
 tical and the exchange rate reaches immediately its long—run value asthee1
 coincides with e1.    It may also be noted from equation (15') that ——
                                                                        e

the speed of adjustment of expectations, the determinants of which are
analyzed below. As is clear from equation (15'), other things equal, the
short—run elasticity gets closer to unity as the value of e increases,
thereby reducing the extent to which the current exchange rate differs
from its long—run value. It is also evident that as long as e is not neg—
gative its magnitude is irrelevant for determining whether the short—run
elasticity is larger or  smaller than unity and, therefore, the analysis
is consistent with a variety of assumptions concerning the formation of
expectations ranging from the assumption of static expectations (for which
 e = 0), to the assumption of perfect foresight which is analyzed below.

     As is evident, the key factor determining whether the exchange rate
overshoots or undershooots its long—run equilibrium value is the relation-
ship between    and S/b. These parameters characterize the speed of ad-
justment in asset markets, the sensitivity of aggregate demand (the bal-
ance of trade) to relative prices, and the interest (semi) elasticity of
the demand for money.  As long as the speeds of adjustment are finite, the
speed of comnxdity price adjustment, ri, does not determine whether or not
there is overshooting.

     Turning to the effect of the monetary expansion on the international
accounts, we note that, at point B, independent of whether the exchange
rate overshoots or undershoots, the rise in e improves the balance of
trade and the rise in m deteriorates the capital account by lowering the
rate of interest. The deterioration in the capital account due to the
interest rate effect is mitigated when the exchange rate overshoots its
long—run equilibrium value since, in that case, expectations are for an
appreciation of the currency (a decline in e). In the case of undershoot—
ing, the expectations for a further depreciation reinforce the interest
rate effect in deteriorating the capital account. The transition toward
the long run (the path between points B and D), is characterized by a ris-
ing price level and by a decline in the real exchange rate. The decline
in (e — p) results in a deterioration of the balance of trade and, there-
fore, equilibrium in the balance of payments implies that during the tran-
sition, the capital account improves.
     The above analysis implies that the qualitative characteristics of
the dynamics of the price level, the trade balance, and the capital ac-
count are independent of whether there is overshooting or undershooting
of the exchange rate. These given qualitative paths may be associated
with a path along which the exchange rate is rising, as well as with a
path along which the exchange rate is falling. The ambiguous relationship
between the path of the exchange rate and the other paths should not be
taken to imply that the exchange rate does not exert a definite effect on
the trade balance, the capital account, and on the path of prices. Rather
it implies that one should not expect to observe, independent of the speed
of adjustment, a unique qualitative relationship between the equilibrium
paths of the exchange rate and those of prices and the international ac-
counts. This lack of a unique general relationship between the exchange
rate and the various balance of payments accounts may be responsible for
                                             — 12   —




 the   view that in recent years exchange rates have shown erratic and unpre-
 dictable movements. 1/
     In this section we analyzed the effects of a once and for all unanti-
cipated change in the money supply. The analysis can be easily extended
to examine the effects of other parametric changes like changes in output,
the foreign price level, and the foreign rate of interest. Similarly, the
analysis can be           extended   along the lines suggested by Wilson (1979)   and
Gray and Turnovsky (1979) to examine the effects of an anticipated future
change in the supply of money or in another parameter. For example, it
can be shown that an anticipated future rise in the money supply induces
an immediate adjustment of the exchange rate which jumps, for example, to
point E in Figures 1 and 2. The extent of the instantaneous jump in the
exchange rate is smaller than the change that would have taken place had
the money supply been expected to rise at the present (in which case the
exchange       rate would have adjusted to point B). Following the initial
jump in e, both the exchange rate and prices proceed to rise gradually
and    their
          path converges to the new QQ schedule (corresponding to the new
quantity of money) at the point in time at which the rise in the money
supply    actually occurs.           Thereafter the convergence proceeds along the
(new) QQ schedule towards the new long—run equilibrium 2/


          11.6.      Perfect Foresight and the Coefficient of Expectations

     So far it was assumed (in equation (8) that the expected percentage
change in the exchange rate is proportional to the discrepancy ( — e)
with 8> 0 being the proportionality factor. Dornbusch (1976) showed that
in a model of perfect foresight, the coefficient 8 cannot be chosen arbi-
trarily but rather, it must be consistent with the structure of the entire
model. 7e turn now to an analysis of the determinants of the coefficient
of expectations in our model.


        Using     equation (12) in (6), we may express the rate of inflation as

(16)          =   cz{(e   - ) - (p -

and    using equation (14), the rate of inflation can be written as:
 1T     The    relatiTiTp betwen the exchange rate and the trade balance is
analyzed in detail in many recent contributions. See, for example, Kouri
(1976), Dornbusch and Fischer (1980), Mussa (1980), and Rodriguez (1980).
  2/   It follows that when capital is highly mobile so that the QQ sche-
dule is negatively sloped, the path of prices will be monotonic while the
path of the exchange rate will exhibit a turning point, i.e. , e will ini-
tially rise and then decline; when capital is less mobile so that the QQ
schedule   is positively sloped, both prices and the exchange rate will
approach their new higher values monotonically.

     The relationship between the equilibrium exchange rate and the price
level that is described by equation (14), must be always satisfied. There-
fore, given the long—run values of    and p, changes in the exchange rate
and in the price level must be related such that

(18) e =

       Substituting              equation (17) for , we obtain

(19) é=ci(1— )                   (—e).
Equation (19) describes the actual change in the exchange rate while equa-
tion (8) describes the expected changeS   It is clear that, under perfect
foresight, consistency requires that the two are equal to each other and,
therefore,

(20) 0 =     c(1   —       E).
Substituting for c from (14) results in


(21) 0 =           —




from which it follows that the coefficient of expectations can be obtained
by solving the quadratic equation

                       -
(22) e2 + (7T                    )6 -    = 0.

From (22) the solution for 8 (obtained by taking the positive root) is


(23) 8 =     - [() -                            )2 4     b)h/2j> 0

which expresses the coefficient of expectations as a function of the var-
ious parameters of the r!odel.


     As may be verified, the coefficient of expectations decreases with
1/b, the interest (semi) elasticity of the demand f or nney, while it in-
creases with 71 and , the speeds of adjustment in goods and asset markets,
respectively. These propositions are independent of the degree of capital
tmbility. In contrast, however, it is noteworthy that the dependence of
the coefficient of expectations on the parameter 5 (the sensitivity of ag-
gregate demand to relative prices) is ambiguous and depends on whether Tr0_
                                          — 14   —




the product of the speeds of adjustment in goods and asset markets——is
smaller or larger than a critical value that is equal to 1/(1 + b/ 0).
For a given value of rr, a high value of   , such that r3 exceeds the cri-

tical value, yields a positive relationship between the coefficient of
expectations and the parameter 6 .    On the other hand, when    is small,
such that ir is smaller than the critical value, a high value of 6 redu-
ces the size of the coefficient of expectations. Since the relationship
between the speed of adjustment of expectations and 6 is ambiguous, it
follows that the effect of a higher value of 6 on the extent of the over-
shooting or undershoot jag is also ambiguous. Finally, it might be noted
that in the extreme case for which asset markets clear instantaneously
so that           equation       (21) becomes

(21')      0 =   ct(l   + b/e)

which corresponds to equation (14) in Dornbusch (1976, p. 1167) and, as
noted above, in that case 6 and 0 are positively related.

     In this sect ion we analyzed the dynamics of exchange rates within a
rational expectations model in which commodity prices adjust slowly. The
analysis cas based on a modified version of a model due to Dornbusch
(1976). We modified the model so as to allow for a finite speed of ad-
justment in asset markets and we showed that the short—run effects of a
monetary expansion depend on the degree of capital mobility. When capi-
tal is highly mobile the exchange           rate must   overshoot its long—run value 1/
but   when capital is relatively immobile the exchange rate undershoots
its   long—run value. The key reason for the non—neutrality of money in
the   short run in this model arises from the assumption that prices are
not   fully flexible. In the next section we analyze the dynamics of ex-
change    rates in a portfolio—balance model in which all prices are assumed
to be fully flexible also in the short run.

                 III. Exchange Rate Dynamics and Portfolio Balance
     In this section we analyze the dynamics of exchange rates and the
overshooting hypothesis within the context of a portfolio—balance model.
Developments of various varieties of the portfolio—balance model which
emphasize the effects of asset substitution on exchange rate determina-
tion are the subject of numerous recent articles [e.g. , Kouri (1976),
Branson (1979), Dornbusch (1978), Girton and Roper (1981), Frenkel and
Clements (1981), and the references therein]. Our purpose is to high-
light the implications of alternative assumptions concerning the degree


  1/ This conclusion is based on the assumption that output is fixed.
Dornbusch shows that when the monetary expansion induces a short—run rise
in output the exchange rate may undershoot its equilibrium level even if
capital is highly mobile. This will occur if          in output raises
                                               the rise

of interest.

of substitution among assets on the dynamics of exchange rates.    It will
be shown that the effects of a monetary expansion on the dynamics of ex-
change rates and in particular on whether exchange rates overshoot or un-
dershoot their equilibrium path depend critically on the specification of
asset choice.  In order to contrast the analysis with the one in the pre-
vious section, we will assume that goods markets clear instantaneously and
that all prices are perfectly flexible. We start with a brief review of
the currency substitution model developed by Calvo and Rodriguez (1977).


                     III. 1.        The Currency Substitution Model

     The Calvo—Rodriguez model of currency substitution analyzes a fully
employed small open economy in which residents are assumed to hold port-
folios of domestic and foreign currencies. The key building blocks of the
model are the specifications of the markets for assets and goods.


                                111.1.1 The Assets Market

     Asset holders are assumed to hold portfolios of domestic money, M,
and foreign money, F.  The value of assets in terms of foreign currency
is denoted by a:

(24)        a    M' + F

where M' denotes the value of domestic currency holdings in terms of for-
eign exchange, i.e., M'   MIS.

     The desired ratio of domestic to foreign money holdings is assumed to
depend on the expected percentage change in the exchange rate which mea-
sures the expected difference between the rates of return on the two as-
sets. The assumption of rational expectations (which in this model am-
ounts to perfect foresight) permits us to identify the expected change in
the exchange rate with the actual change. Using a circumflex () to de-
note the percentage change in a variable, portfolio equilibrium can be
written as

(25)            L(S); L' <      0



which indicates that the desired ratio of domestic to foreign money de-
clines when the domestic currency is expected to depreciate. It will
prove useful to express the portfolio—balance relationship in terms of
its inverse as in equation (25')

(25')   S        (N'/F);   2'        0.

                                 111.1.2 The Goods Market
     The economy is assumed to produce two classes of goods: tradeable
and nontradeable goods. For a given state of technology and factor en-
dowment, the rats of production of the two composite comtdities depend
on their relative price. Denoting the domestic currency price of traded
goods by T and of nontraded goods by N' the relative price that is re-
levant for production decisions is T'N The domestic price of traded
goods is linked to the foreign price of that good, P, through interna-
tional arbitrage so that    =
                                          S.
                                    The small country is assumed to face
a given foreign price of traded goods which, for convenience,
                                                              is normal-
ized to unity. Thus, the relative price which governs the  allocation of
productive resources can be written as s  S/Pr——the "real exchange rate"——
and the output of the two goods can be specified as

          QT   = QT (s);    QT /s >       0
(26)           =            N' <
where      and         denote,   respectively,       the output of traded and nontraded
goods.

     The demand for the two goods is assund to depend on their relative
price and on the value of assets according to

          CT = CT (s,a); 3CT/S <              0, 3CT/a > 0
(27)
          CN = CN (s,a); CN/s >               0,   CN/a >   0

where CT and CN denote, respectively, the demand for traded and nontraded
goods.

     At each point in time the stock of domestic holdings of foreign as-
sets, F, is given, and the assumption that the small country's currency
is not held by foreigners ensures that F cannot be adjusted instanta-
neously. Asset holders can, however, alter the stock of foreign assets
gradually by running a surplus or a deficit in the balance of trade. Thus,


                   —             =
(28)                   CT(s,a)

where '  dF/dt denotes the rate of change in F. Equilibrium in the mar-
ket for nontraded goods requires that the rate of domestic production
equals the domestic demand so that


          QN(s) —                    0.

                                            - 17



Equation (29) implies that there is a specific relationship between the
real exchange rate and the value of assets that is consistent with equi-
librium in the market for nontraded goods. A rise in the value of assets
must be accompanied by a decline in the real exchange rate since the for—
mer creates an excess demand for nontraded goods while the latter induces
an excess supply.   This relationship is summarized by equation (30)

(30)      s     s(a);     s '   < 0.

Since equation (30) must hold at each moment of time due to the assumed
flexibility of prices, it can be substituted into equation (28) in order
to yield a relationship between the rate of change in F and the value of
assets:


(31)      F =   f(a);   f'
                                    Q —C—1)s'      —
                                                       3C
                                                       -—- < 0.
                                (_.I



     The value of assets is related uniquely to the equilibrium real ex-
change rate and thereby to the rates of production and consumption of
goods and to the rate of accumulation of foreign currency. Therefore,
knowledge of the time path of assets is necessary for determining the
time path of these variables. We turn now to study the evolution of as-
set holdings.


                                       111.1.3 Dynamics

     Changes in asset holdings arise from changes in the domestic and the
foretgn asset components of the portfolio:

(32)

Recalling that M' — HIS, it follows that i' M'( ii— S) where 11 denotes
the percentage change in the nominal money supply, i.e., U E 111M. Since
H' a — F, we can express the change in H' as t'    (a — F)(p — S). Thus,
equation (32) can be written as

(33)            (a —    F){     —      (a   F)} +      f(a)
where, using equations (25 ') and (31), L(a_;_F) was substituted for S and
f(a) was substituted for F.

     Equations (31) and (33) characterize the dynamics of the system. As
is clear, in the steady state when          0, f(a)    0 (equation (31))
and p = S (equation 33)). We denote the steady state values of a and F by
  and F and, using equation (30), the implied steady state real exchange
rate is denoted by s. It is also noteworthy that the system satisfies
the homogeneity postulate: a once—and—for—all rise in the nominal quan-
tity of money results in an instantaneous equiproportional rise in the
                                 — 18



money price of nontraded goods and  in the nominal exchange rate (and
thereby in the money price of traded goods). These changes leave all
real variables (including the real exchange rate) unchanged. In contrast
with the discussion in section II where due to the assumed slow price
adjustment a once—and--for—all change in the nominal quantity of money
exerted real effects (by inducing, in the short run a rise in the real
quantity of money), the flexibility of prices which is assumed in the
present section rules out such effects. In the present model, however,
changes in the percentage rate of growth of the money supply are not
neutral in the long run and do result in a gradual transition period.

     Figure 3 describes the dynamics of the system. In Panel I the F =
o and the   = 0 schedules describe combinations of a and F which satisfy
                                                               0 schedule
equations (31) and (33) respectively. The slope of the a =
is drawn on the assumption that (around the steady state)  aa/aa<0.  As is
evident, the system exhibits a saddle—path stability,   and the motion  of
the variables is described by the arrows which are implied by    the signs
of the partial derivatives of (31) and (33) around the steady state. None
of the qualitative conclusions are altered in the case for which à/a >0.
In that case the a = 0 schedule is positively sloped and is steeper than
the saddle path.  In general, along the perfect foresight path (which is
the unique path that converges to the steady state and satisfies the laws
of motion and the initial conditions) a higher value of F is associated
with a higher value of a. Panel II in Figure 3 presents the combinations
of the value of assets and the real exchange rate which satisfy equation
(30). These are the combinations that are, consistent with equilibrium in
the nontraded goods market for which a rise in the value of assets must
be associated with a decline in's.

     Consider a rise in the rate of monetary expansion. From equation
                                                         = 0 schedule and
(33) it is seen that the higher value of i shifts the
hence shifts the saddle path to the right, and results in new higher
steady state holdings of foreign assets.In the new steady state the real
value of assets remains unchanged so as to ensure that F = 0 (equation
(31)). Since the equilibrium real exchange rate is uniquely related to
the value of assets, also the steady state real exchange rate remains un-
changed and thus, production and consumption of both goods remain un-
changed. Finally, since in the new steady state the new rate of monetary
expansion equals the rate of depreciation S, individuals will lower the
desired ratio of domestic to foreign currency holdings which, given the
unchanged value of assets implies that F rises and
                                                   M '  falls.
     The dynamics of adjustment are shown in Figure 3 where it is assumed
                                                                    and
that the initial steady state position was at point A with F0, ,

as the initial equilibrium values, foreign currency
sets, and the real exchange rate, respectively. The schedules that are
drawn correspond to the new higher rate of monetary expansion. Upon the
rise in 3.1 the instantaneous equilibrium jumps to point B along the new
saddle path. Since F cannot change instantaneously, point B is the only
position of short—run equilibrium that is consistent with the perfect
foresight path that converges to the new steady state. At point B the

value of assets falls from a to a1. This decline in the value of assets
is necessary since the rise in the expected relative cost of holding dom-
estic money induces a reduction in the desired ratio of domestic to for—
eign monies which, given the initial value of foreign currency holdings
F0, can be brought about only by a decline in M' and thus in a. Since
at the initial point in time the nominal stock of domestic money M is
given, the decline in M'   MIS is brought about through a rise in the nom-
inal exchange rate S (i.e., 'through a depreciation of the domestic cur-
rency). Finally, as indicated in panel II of Figure 3, equilibrium in
the nontraded goods marke\ implies that when the value of assets falls
to a1 the real exchange /ate rises to s1. Since the real exchange rate
is the ratio of the nominal exchange rate S to the price of nontraded
              follows that S > N•       If the aggregate price level is a
goods N'
weighted average of S and PN , it  follows that the exchange rate changes
by more than the overall price level. This is the overshooting phenome-
non In the Calvo—Rodriguez model.

     The transition toward the new steady state is characterized by the
path between B and C along which s declines (so that S < N' the value
of assets rises as does the value of foreign currency holdings. The mod-
el implies that during the transition period a higher depreciation of the
currency is associated with a trade balance surplus and an accumulation
of foreign assets. This characteristic is typical of the currency sub-
stitution model, reflecting the desired change in the composition of as-
sets .1/

     The key feature of the Calvo—Rodriguez model is the specification of
the portfolio of assets where it Is assumed that the two alternative as-
sets are domestic and foreign currencies. Since the foreign currency
price of traded goods is assumed to be given, the accumulation of foreign
currency is equivalent to an accumulation of claims on stocks of traded
goods. With this perspective the currency substitution model can be spe-
cified in terms of choice and substitution between domestic money and
traded goods.   It Is intuitively clear therefore that following the rise
in the rate of monetary expansion asset holders wish to hedge against the
expected inflation by shifting the composition of portfolios toward the
inflation hedge (traded goods), a shift which results, in the short run,
in a rise in s——the relative price of traded goods.

     This interpretation of the currency substitution model suggests that
when the inflation hedges are stocks of nontraded goods instead of traded
goods, the rise in the rate of monetary expansion might result in an un—
dershooting of the exchange rate as the relative price of nontraded goods
rises. We turn now to the formal analysis of this possibility.




  1/ This characteristic may not be necessary in a model with intertenr
poral utility maximization; see Liviatan (1981).

                 111.2. Nontraded Goods as the Inflation Hedge

     The structure of the model in which nontraded goods are used as the
inflation hedge is very similar to the one described in section 111.1.
In what follows we introduce the minimal modifications.


                                111.2.1 The Asset Market

     In order to sharpen the contrast with the currency substitution mod-
el we assume that the portfolios of assets are composed only of domestic
money and of stocks of nontraded goods which are denoted by N. The value
of assets in terms of foreign exchange is

(34)     a = M   '
                     + N/s
where N/s = PNN/S. As before, the desired ratio of money to inventories
of goods is assumed to depend on the difference between their rates of
return, i.e., on the expected percentage change in the price of nontraded
goods. Assuming that expectations are always realized the desired port-
folio composition depends on N' and analogously to equation (25') the
portfolio-balance relationship can be written as

(35)     P=g(9—); g'<O.
                                111.2.2 The Goods Market

     The specification of production        and consumption is assumed to be the
same as in the previous section and         is summarized by equations (26) and
(27). In the present case, however,         we allow for an accumulation of in-
ventories of nontraded goods which          must equal the excess of production
over consumption of these goods.

                     C,,(s,a)


where N denotes the rate of accumulation of nontraded goods.

     Since in this case we do not allow for capital mobility, equilibrium
in the market for traded goods requires that


(37)    Q.(s) — C.1.(s,a)         0



Equation (37) implies that there is a specific relationship between the
real exchange rate and the value of assets which guarantees trade balance

equilibrium.  A rise in the value of assets raises the demand for traded
goods and therefore, to eliminate the excess demand, it must be accompan-
ied by a rise in the real exchange rate s. This relationship which must
be satisfied at all times can be written as

(38)          =   v(a);    v' < 0.

For later use we note that

(38!)
              =

where 'y denotes the elasticity of the real exchange rate with respect to
the value of assets. Substituting equation (38) into (36) yields a rela-
tionship between the rate of accumulation of nontraded goods and the
value of assets:


(39)        N =    h(a);   h'   (—fl   — —)v'      —           <   0.




                                     111.2.3 Dynamics

        The rate of change in the value of assets can be written, using
equation (34),as

(40)        a = M'M' + (N/s) (N/s)

Noting that
                      N (M/S)(S/PN)
it follows that            = p — '— , and    using equation (35) yields

(41)              =   -g    (v(a)a - 1) -

where (v(a)a/N) — 1 was substituted for M'/(N/s) by using equations (34)
and (38) and where yâ was substituted for  by using equation (38').

        Using equations (39) and (41) in (40) yields

(42)          =
                  {(a ) {p - (V(
                           -                           l)} +
                                                               h(a)

     Equations (39) and (42) characterize the dynamics of the system. In
the steady state N = a = 0, the value of assets is i0, the holdings of non—
traded goods are N0 , and the rate of monetary expansion P equals g(.)——the
rate of change of the price of nontraded goods N• Equilibrium in the
balance of trade implies that    is associated with a specific steady
state real exchange rate      Since in the steady state the percentage
change in the nominal price of nontraded goods equals the rate of monetary
expansion and since the real exchange rate is given at , the percentage
change in the nominal exchange rate S must also equal the rate of monetary
expansion.

     The dynamics of the system are described in Figure 4.     tn   panel   I
the N = 0 and the a = 0 schedules show combinations of a and N which sat-
isfy equations (39) and (42), respectively. The slope of the a = 0 sche-
dule is drawn on the assumption that around the steady state 3a/a < 0.
As in section 111.1 the system exhibits a saddle—path stabililty and the
motion of the variables is described by the arrows which reflect the signs
of the partial derivatives of (39) and (42) around the steady state. When
      > 0the a = 0 schedule is positively sloped and is steeper than the
saddle path. As before, none of the qualitative conclusions are altered
in that case. The key difference between the analysis in Figure 4 and
that in Figure 3 lies in panel II which shows the equilibrium relationship
between the real exchange rate and the value of assets. In contrast with
the currency substitution model, here s and a must be positively related
so as to ensure trade balance equilibrium (equation (37)).

     A rise in the rate of monetary expansion results (from equation (42))
in a rightward shift of the    = 0 schedule and hence of the saddle path.
The new steady state is associated with larger holdings of nontraded goods
whose attractiveness has risen with the accelerated inflation. Suppose
that the initial equilibrium is described in Figure 4 by point A and that
the schedules drawn correspond to the new higher rate of monetary expan-
sion. Since at the initial point in time the stocks of nontraded goods
are given at N, the instantaneous equilibrium is reached at point B with
a lower value of assets a. The reduced value of assets lowers the demand
for traded goods and therefore, to restore trade balance equilibrium, the
real exchange rate must fall to s1 as indicated in panel II.

     The higher expected rate of inflation lowers the desired ratio of
                                                  At the initial moment

money to inventories of nontraded goods M' =

the quantities of M and N are given, and the desired ratio is attained
therefore through a rise in    . Since, however, the value of assets de-
clined and since N/s rose, it follows that the nominal exchange rate S
must have risen (I.e., the domestic currency must have depreciated) so as
to yield a decline in M = MIS. The rise in S must be sufficiently large
so as to more than offset the effect of the rise in N/s on the value of
assets. 1hile both the nominal exchange rate S and the price of nontraded
goods N jump up upon the rise in the rate of monetary expansion, the fact
that the real exchange rate falls to      implies that    > S. Thus, in
this model the exchange rate undershoots the price level.

     The transition toward the steady state is described by the path from
B to C along which the value of assets and the holdings of nontraded goods
increase and the real exchange rate rises toward its initial level. Since
along the path s rises, the nominal exchange rate must rise faster than
the price of nontraded goods.

     The fact that the rise in the rate of monetary expansion results in
an instantaneous rise in the price level which exceeds the rise in the de-
preciation of the currency is consistent with the general principles that
were outlined at the end of the discussion of the currency substitution
                                  — 23




model. In this class of the portfolio—balance model the key factor deter-
mining whether following a monetary disturbance the exchange rate over-
shoots or undershoots the domestic price level is the specification of the
inflation hedge. When the domestic rate of inflation accelerates asset
holders substitute away from domestic money into alternative assets. To
the extent that the alternative assets are traded goods, their relative
price will rise and the nominal exchange rate will overshoot the domestic
price level. To the extent that the alternative assets are domestic non
traded goods, their relative price will rise and the exchange rate will
undershoot the domestic price.

     In this section we analyzed the two polar cases in which the substi-
tutes for domestic money were either foreign currency (or equivalently
traded goods) or stocks of domestic nontraded goods. A more general model
would allow for portfolios which consist of domestic and foreign monies as
well as of domestic goods. The general principles, however, are likely to
be the same. Whether exchange rates overshoot or undershoot the domestic
price level will depend on the relative degree of substitution among dom-
estic money, traded goods, and nontraded goods.   The relative degrees of
substitution will reflect the degree of capital mobility and the quali-
ties of the various assets as hedges against inflation.



                         IV. Concluding Remarks

     In this paper we analyzed the determinants of the evolution of ex-
change rates within the context of alternative models of exchange rate
dynamics. We have examined the overshooting hypothesis in models which
emphasize differential speeds of adjustment in asset and goods markets as
well as in models which emphasize portfolio balance considerations. Rather
than repeating the various results we wish to highlight the main analyti-
cal conclusions. We have seen that exchange rate overshooting is not an
intrinsic characteristic of the foreign exchange market and that it de-
pends on a set of specific assumptions. We have shown that the over-
shooting is not a characteristic of the assumption of perfect foresight
nor does it depend in general on the assumption that goods and asset
markets clear at different speeds. As long as the speeds of adjustment
in the various markets are less than infinite (which is obviously the
case), the key factor determining the short run effects of a monetary e'—
pansion is the degree of capital mobility. When capital is highly mo-
bile, the exchange rate overshoots its long—run value and when capital is
relatively immobile the exchange rate undershoots its long—run value.

     Within the context of the portfolio—balance model we have shown that
the effects of a monetary expansion on the dynamics of exchange rates and
in particular on whether exchange rates overshoot or undershoot their
equilibrium path depend critically on the specification of asset choice,
on the degree of substitution among assets, and on the quality of the
various assets in being an inflation hedge.
