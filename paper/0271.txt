              MALE WAGE RATES AND MARITAL STATUS


                           Lawrence W. Kenny


                              Abstract




        Numerous studies have found that married men earn consider-

ably more than single men of the same education, experience, etc.

There are several possible explanations of this phenomenon. Recent

theoretical developments in the economics of marriage predict that males

with higher wage rates have a greater gain from marriage and are

therefore more likely to marry. Alternatively, one of the benefits of

marriage is specialization in the labor force; married men spend more

hours in the labor force than single males and thus have a greater

incentive to invest in human capital.

        The empirical work in this paper suggests that a large

fraction of the unexplained wage differential between married males and

unmarried males may   be   attributable to the former explanation.

    Numerous studies have found that married men earn considerably more

than single men o the same education, experience, etc. There are several

possible explanations of this phenomenon. Recent theoretical developments

in the economics of marriage predict that males with higher wage rates

have a greater gain from marriage and are therefore more likely to marry.

Alternatively, one of the benefits of marriage is specialization in the

labor force; married males spend more hours in the labor force than single

males and thus have a greater incentive to invest in human capital.

     This paper attempts to ascertain the relative importance of the

selectivity and investment explanations which have been outlined above.

The empirical work accordingly focuses on the determination of wage rates

and on the determination of the number of hours worked.




                                 II. THEORY


     Let us briefly reconstruct the marriage model which was developed by

Becker (1973) and Keeley (1974). It is assumed that both married and

single persons produce some aggregate commodity Z. The total gain from

marriage (C) is the difference between married real income and single real

income,

                              G=zmf —zm —z,
                                         f


where

     2       total real income of m and f when married,
        mf
     Z — real       income of the male (in) when single,

        Zf — real   income of the female (f) when single.

 and the male wage rate therefore in part reflects a selectivity phenomenon.

     A symmetrical argument relates female wages to marital status. Single

females have higher wages than married females partly because single

females spend more hours in the labor market than married females and also

partly because high wage females have not found it worthwhile to marry.

It is surprising to note that in the literature on the determination of

female wages there are few, if any, references to marital selectivity.

     In the empirical analysis that follows, we will try to ascertain what

part of the male wage differential may be ascribed to selectivity and what

part may be attributed to marriage—associated investment. The fact that

some marriage—associated investment may occur prior to marriage and between

marriages makes this a difficult, if not impossible, task. For, as the

number of hours spent working over the life cycle increases (e.g., the

benefits of specialization in marriage increase), the marginal revenue of

investment in human capital increases in each period, whether the individ-

ual is married or single, leading to an increase in investment in human

capital in each period.

     For seyeral reasons, married males face a lower marginal cost of

investment in human capital than otherwise identical single males. A man

is able to borrow at lower cost from a wife than from other sources to

finance investment in human capital; this is partly because alimony reduces

the risk faced by wives when they finance their husbands' investment in

human capital. It is reasonable to assume that the marginal cost of hourly

investment in human capital is an increasing function of the quantity of

investment per hour. A given level of annual investment in training will

then be cheaper to individuals when they are working many hours (e.g.,

married) than when they are working few hours (e.g., unmarried). Thus,

although there is likely to be more annual investment in human capital when
                                                      6


an individual is married, the difference between an individual's annual

rate of investment in human capital while married and an individual's

annual rate of investment in human capital while singlo, other things

equal, provides only a lcwer bound on the                           quantity   of marriageassociated

investment.

          Let   us now more formally specify the relation between wage                     rates and

marital status. The wage rate of individual i in year i                                    may be

capital may be rewritten as

The terms              and           pick up differences across individuals in their

propensity to invest in human capital as well as some of the differences

in investment due to marriage—associated investment. The rest of marriage—

marriage, is captured by the terms (M)                                   and (AAI)tnm Married males

are predicted to invest more resources annually in human capital accumula-

when spread over many hours. The latter argument predicts that the hourly

rate of investment will be less for married males than for single males

(i.e., (td)tnm < 0). The increase in annual investrnei-it b'ought about by

the wife's financing of her husband's human capital accumulation may,

however, cause (tI)                        to be positive.

     As men move through their life cycle, the marginal revenue of invest-

ment in human capital falls and assets accumulate. Moreover, as assets

accumulate, the benefits of financing investment in human capital wit;hin

the marriage decrease. It therefore follows that

The growth in the wage rate over time therefore is positively related to

the growth in previous investment over this period, is negatively related

to the fall in current investment, and is positively related to the change

in wage compensation (D.+k — D             ).       In   particular, if (tI)               is negative,
                                       j                                         t,n,m
then wage growth is predicted to be negatively related to initial marital

status (6) and positively related to final marital status                                          In the

empirical work that follows this section, equation (5) will also be esti-

mated.

      We will now compare people to themselves. We will compare the growth

in wage rates in adjacent married years to the growth in wage rates in

adjacent unmarried years. Suppose that a person is married in years j+k

and j+k+l and is unmarried in years j and j+l. Equation (4) implies that

the annual growth in wage rates in married years less the annual growth in

wage rates in unmarried years equals

The term in brackets is predicted to be positive since (AI)tnm is expected

to fall over t.he life cycle. This specification has the advantage that the

bias brought about by the presence of term individual—specific terms appears

to be negligible, for the term r(X+k — A.)                                   equals zero if labor supply

in period j+k equals labor supply in period j. Moreover, the assumption,

found in equations (2) and (3), that annual individual—specific investment

in human capital varies with current labor supply, may be questioned. The

predictions of equation (7) will be tested in section III.

     It has been argued that marriage leads, through an increase in hours

worked, to higher wages. Knowledge of the relation between the number of

hours worked and wages, together with information about the effect of

marriage on labor supply, will enable us to ascertain what part of the

observed wage differential between married and never—married males is

attributable to differential labor supply. First, some additional struc-

ture must be given to the investment profile.

                          III. EMPIRICAL RESULTS


        The primary data set used in this preliminary investigation is the

seven year Panel Study of Income Dynamics.        Variables are defined in the

 appendix at the end of the paper. The sample consists of males who were

 in the sample for the entire seven year period (1968—1974), who had earn-

 ings in 1973, and whose estimated wage rate exceeded $0.50. Unless other-

 wise specified, all empirical work will refer to this data set.

        The Project TALENT data set has been used to supplement the results

 obtained from the Income Dynamics data set. Project TALENT is a strati-

 fied, random sample of all students in grades nine through 12 in 1960.          I




      3me specification in equation (9) assumes that the rate of invest-
 ment per hour is unrelated to the number of annual hours spent working.
 In future work1 this assumption will be relaxed.

have selected a subsample of the twelfth grade males; observations where

information was missing were deleted. There were follow—up surveys in

1961, 1965, and 1971; the response rate to the 1965 and 1971 surveys was

in the vicinity of 30 percent. It will soon be seen that   the   intermittence

of the folloc—up surveys severely limits the usefulne-s of this data s't

for probing the relation between wages and marital status. Again, all

variable definitions are given in the appendix.



                          A. Labor Supply


     It has been predicted that married men will work more hours than

unmarried men. If married males work many more hours than single male3,

then married males have a much greater incentive to invest in human capital,

and marriage—associated investment in human capital is likely to be an

important component of the difference between the wage rate of married

males and the wage rate of single males. With this in mind, let us turn

to the regressions in Tables 1 and 2, which explain variatioa in the total

number of hours worked in 1973 among those aged 64 dr less.

     Most of the variables have a significant impact on labor supply. A

10 percent increase in the wage rate leads to a 34 hour reduction in the

number of hours worked per year. The number of years of schooling (Eli) is

significantly positive oniy when the log of the wage rate (LW4) is one of

the regressors.4 The positive sign of age (ACEH4) and the negative sign


      4It is puzzling to find that LW4 and EU take on opposite signs. If
art increase in education generates a neutral increase in household produc-
tivity, then labor supply will be unaltered. Under this neutrality assurnp—
don, educational attainment and wages both measure human capital. Borjas
 (1978) offers an explanation of the then inconsistent signs. He shows
that the often observed negative relationship between the wage rate and
labor supply may he spuriously induced by estimating the wage rate as the
ratio of earnings to hours worked.

of age squared (AGE2) imply that the life cycle profile of labor supply

resembles an inverted U; labor supply is estimated to peak around age 36.

Students (STU4=l) are estimated to work nearly 1800 fewer hours per year

than non-students. An additional year of seniority on a given job (EXPCU4)

is associated with approximately 11 more hours of work per year. When LW4

is not one of the regressors, union members OJN4) work significantly fewer

hours than non-union members. Nonwhites (RACE11) work between 101 and 153

fewer hours per year than whites, and individuals who were sick 10 hours

over the 1967—1973 period (SICK) are estimated to work one less hour in

1973.

        Let us now examine the relationship between marital status and labor

supply. Variables measuring the wife's education and the 'presence of

children are found in Table 2 but not in Table 1. Consider first the

regressions in Table 1. As predicted, married males (MARR4=l) work signi-

ficantly more hours than unmarried males. Married males are estimated to

supply approximately 250 more hours per year to the labor force than

unmarried males; this estimate is quite close to Parson's (1977) estimate,

which was obtained from another sample. In the third and fourth regres-

sions, widowers are estimated to work nearly as many hours as married

males. However, the coefficient of W1D4 is estimated very imprecisely;

widowers do not work significantly more hours than the group of divorced,

separated, or never—married males. The MARR4 coefficient is again signi-

ficantly positive in Table 2.     If education increases market productivity

more than household productivity, then men married to more educated women

will have smaller gains from marriage and will work fewer hours than men

married to less educated women. On the other hand, men married to highly

educated women may have more human capital and may therefore work more
                                    16



hours than men married to women with little education.5 Neither the edu-

cation of the wife (EW4) nor the number of children in the family unit

under 18 years of age (CHIL4) significantly affect the husband's labor

supply.

     The marriage coefficient in Tables 1 and 2 may be biased. Married

males may work more hours than single ma1e because they have nore human

capital than single males rather than because of the specialization that

accompanies marriage.6 Some insight into the importance of this bias is

gained by explaining changes over the life cycle in the number of hours

worked.

     The regressions in Tables 3 and 4 explain part of the variation

across individuals in the change in the number of annual hours worked

between 1967 and 1973 (HOUR84). Most of the variables are significant

only in the full sample and in the subsample of those who were married in

1968; variables which are significant in the subsample of those who were

not married in 1968 will be noted. The growth in hours between 1967 and

1973 falls with age; moreover, the coefficient of ACEH4 in Tables 3 and 4

is close to the coefficient that would have been predicted on the basis of

the regressions in Tables I and 2 (i.e., 12 times the coefficient of AGE?

in Tables 1 and 2). The signs and magnitudes of the coefficients of change

in the number of hours sick (SICK84), change in the wage rate (W84), and

change in job tenure (EXPC84) are also consistent with Tables 1 and 2. In

every sample, the change in student status (STUS4) is significantly and

negatively related to the change in labor supply. Married students have a

much greater increase in labor supply when they leave schooi than do

     5Note that this argument assumes a positively sloped labor supply
curve.
                                                                             )
         Again, a positively sloped labor supply curve must be assumed.

unmarried students. Part of this difference may be attributed to the role

that wives play in the financing of their husband's investment in human

capital. The positive sign of change in union status (UN84) is puzzling,

for in the hours regressions, union members are estimated to work fewer

hours than individuals who do not belong to unions.

     Only in one regression in Table 3 does change in marital status

(MARR84) have a significant impact on HOUR84. Males who get married

experience approximately 40 hours greater growth in hours worked than

males who remain single; this difference, however, is insignificant. If

the sample of those who were not married in 1968 is divided into two sub—

samples——those who in 1968 had never been married and those who in 1968

were divorced, widowed, or separated——then the MARR84 coefficients in

comparable but unreported regressions approximately equal 20 and 210 in

the two respective samples; in these small samples, neither coefficient is

significant. Those who marry for the first time appear to experience vir—

tually no increase in time spent working. The coefficients in the third

and fourth regressions in Table 3 imply that males who become separated or

divorced experience significantly less (180 hours) growth in hours worked

than males who remain married. Change in widower status (W1D84) is not

significantly related to the change in labor supply over the life cycle.

    Why   does   male labor supply change so little at first marriage when

the response to other changes in marital status is so great? There are

several possible explanations. A large expenditure is associated with

getting married; this goes to acquiring furniture, taking a honeymoon,

having a wedding reception, perhaps buying a house, etc. If capital

markets are imperfect, then one way to acquire the desired funds is to

increase labor supply prior to marriage. The observations that wedding-
                                 20


related expenditures tend to be smaller in subsequent marriages and that

males are older when they remarry and therefore have assets upon which to

borrow may help to explain the observed asymmetry in labor supply.

     It could be argued that the coefficients in Table 3 result from the

tax on earnings associated with alimony and child support payments; how-

ever, this argument is inconsistent with the Large (although insignificant)

increase in labor supply with remarriage and is inconsistent with evidence

(from unreported regressions) that males who become separated decrease

their the spent in the labor market by nearly 160 more hours than males

who become divorced7

     It could also be argued that differences in human capital rather than

specialization generate the differences in labor supply between married

males and single males which are found in Table 1. The change in hours

worked would then be unrelated to the change in marital status. This line

of reasoning would not explain the fall in labor supply that accompanies

divorce or separation.

     Consider now the marriage and family structure variables in Table 4.

The change in the number of children under 18 in the household (DKID) and

the change in widower status have positive but insignificant coefficients.

MARR84 is significantly negative in the sample of males who were not mar—

ned in 1968 and is significantly positive in the sample of males who were

married in 1968. The change in the wife's education (EW84) is significant

and positive in the former sample and is significant and negative in the

latter sample. Because the wife's education takes on a value of 0 when

the male is not married, EW34 and MARRS4 are highly positively correlated;

the correlation coefficient equals 0.88 and 0.45 in the unmarried and


     7The latter difference is not significant.
                                 21


married subsamples, respectively. The flip-flopping of coefficients across

samples may thus be caused by multicollinearity and may not reflect a

behavioral relationship. The pattern of coefficients would be difficult

to explain if multicollinearity were not a problem.

     Additional evidence on the relation between marital status and labor

supply is found in Table 5. Since the regressions in this table are

similar to regressions which have already been discussed, let us turn

immediately to the marriage coefficients. In the subsample of those who

are not married in 1968, those who are married in 1974 work over 250 more

hours in 1967 than those who are not married in 1974. In the subsample of

those who are married in 1968, future marital status does not have a signi-

ficant impact on current labor supply. These results are consistent with

the imperfect capital markets argument which was put forward earlier in

this paper. Moreover, the regressions in Table 5 are not explained by the

tax on wages which is brought about by alimony payments. Why would single

males who anticipate getting married work additional hours?

     The evidence which has been presented on the relation between labor

supply and marital status suggests the following scenario: prior to mar-

riage, single males increase the number of hours supplied to the market in

order to accumulate savings. Because of the specialization that accompa-

nies marriage, this high labor supply continues through the marriage. With

divorce or separation, there is less specialization in the labor market,

and male labor supply falls. An alternative scenario that appears to be

less supported by the data would explain the observed differences in labor

supply with differences in human capital and with the tax on wages that

accompanies divorce.

                              B. Wage Rates


    Much of the work in 8ection II was devoted to showing how marital

history and marital status may affect wages. Let us first explain some of

the variation across individuals in the level of wage rates. The regres-

sions in Table 6 test the specification implied by equation (4). MARR4

measures current marital status (6 ), and MARRYR and SEC together measure
                                     j
                                                          li—i

                                                          t=O
know exactly how many years these respondents have been married prior to

1968. All that is known is the age of first marriage, how many years the

respondent has been separated, widowed, or divorced by 1968 if separated,

widowed, or   divorced   at the time of the survey in 1968 (a bracketed

answer), and whether or not the marriage in 1968 (if married in 1968) is

the respondent's first marriage. MARRYR incorporates the first two pieces

of information, and SEC, a dummy variable which equals one if the 1968

marriage is not the first marriage, incorporates the third piece of infor-

mation. The error in the measurement of MARRYR is thus expected to

increase with age. In the full sample, the correlation between the number

of years married (MARRYR) and experience (EXP) is quite high. Because of

this high correlation, it is difficult to separate the impact of marriage

from the effect of experience. In younger samples, the correlation

between MARRYR and EXP is lower. Younger samples are used in Table 6 to

take advantage of the smaller correlation between MARRYR and EXP and to

take advantage of the reduced error in the measurement of MARRYR.

     These regressions explain variation in the log of the wage rate (LW4).

The coefficients are both more plausible and more significant in the older

subsample, which has more than twice as many observations as the subsample

of those 29 or younger. In fact, the only two significant variables in

the subsample of males 29 or younger are marital status (MARR4) and dis-

tance from the nearest standard metropolitan statistical area (DIST4),

which takes on a negative sign. In the subsample of males aged 34 or

younger, educational attainment (LII), years of experience on the current

job (EXPCU4), union membership (UN4), MARRYR, and MARR4 have significant

positive signs and race (RACE1) and DIST4 have significant negative signs.

The number of years of full—time—equivalent job experience (EXP), experi-

ence squared (EXP2), SICK, SEC, size of the largest city in the sampling

unit (CITY4), state value of land and buildings per acre in agriculture

(ACND4), county population density (DENS4), the state's average yearly

rainfall (PREC4), the state's average January temperature (JAN4), the

state's average July temperature (JULY4), and JULY4 squared (JULY42) do

not significantly affect wage rates.

     Since the significant results for the most part replicate the results

of earlier earnings functions studies, we will proceed to a discussion of

the coefficients of the three marriage variables. Those who are currently

married (MARR4=l) have significantly higher wages than those who are not

currently married. This may reflect either a positive correlation between
             i—i
MARR4 and ar At —    a,, the unobserved Individual—specific component of
             t=0
investment which is independent of current marital status, or a lower rate

of hourly investment among married males than among single males (I.e.,

(I)jnm < 0).8      Controlling for years married results in only a 20 per

cent drop in the MARR4 coefficients. The number of years of previous

marriage experience (MARRYR) is correctly positive but Is significant only

when MARR4 is omitted from the regression in the sample of those 34 or



     8
      A positive correlation between NARRYR   and   a1r     A1 -   is   also
anticipated.                                              t0

younger. Using the coefficients from the second and fifth regressions, it

is estimated to take between 1.4 and 5.3 years of 2revious marriage exper-

ience to generate the unexplained 98 cent wage differential between married

ma1c aud never—married males found in similar regressions using the fdi

sample.

     There is also weak evidence supporting the expectation that the addi-

tional annual investment that occurs within marriage falls as the number

of years of marriage increases. In the sample of those 29 or younger

(where the mean value of MARRYR equals 5.99), one year of marriage

increases the wage rate by 2.6 percent, while in the sample of tho;e 34 or

younger (where the mean of MARRYR equals 8.02), one year of marriage

increases the wage rate by oniy 1.2 percent. However, regressions using

the natural logarithm of MARRYR instead of MARRYR were less successful in

explaining variation in LW4 than were the regressions reported in Table 6.

     Similar regressions, estimated from the Project TALENT data, are

found in Table 7. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the

wage rate in 1971 (WYEAR11). Years of schooling (EH) is significant and

positive. Recall that this sample comprises but one cohort; therefore,

one additional year of schooling is obtained at the expense oi one year of

on—the—job experience. The number of jobs held between 1965 and 1971

(JOBS), the fraction of the year spent sick in 1961 (SICK1), and race

(RACE) do not significantly affect wages. Those who grew up in rural—farm

or small town areas (RURAL) are more likely than others to be living in

1971 in these areas, where the cost of living is low. It can therefore be

plausIbly argued that the significant negative coefficient of RURAL captures

a compensating wage differential associated with differences in the cost of

living.

    In this sample, a sizable part of the wage differential absociated

with marital sLatus appears to be attributable to differences in invest—

inent. Married males (MARR=l) are estimated to earn 14 percent more per

hour than unmarried males. Huwever, when variables measuring the number

of years married prior to ]971 enter the regression, this coefficient drops

by nearly 50 percent. MARR is significant in both regressions. Our knowl-

edge of the respondent's marital history is extremely limited; we know his

age at first marriage, his marital status in 1965, his marital status in

1971, and the number of marriages in 1971. MARRYR measures the number of
                                        (j—].   •
years of previous marriage experience           I; it equals 28 less the age at
                                        t=O
first marriage and is constrained to be nonnegative. NOMARR1 is also used

to measure the number of years of marital experience. NOMARR1 equals the

nt.mher of marriages in excess of one. As predicted, MARRYR is significantly

positive and NOMARR1 is significantly negative. One year of previous mar-

riage experience increases the wage rate by 1.8 percent. Using th       coeffi-
cients from the second regression, it is estimated to take nearly four years

of previous marriage experience to produce the observed unexplained marital

wage differential. Being married twice is estimated to be equivalent to

losing five to six years of marriage experience; these estimates are quite

close to the actual median time between separation and remarriage.9

Finally, the fourth regression is estimated using a sample in which our

knowledge of marital experience is fairly precise: the sample of once

married, currently married individuals. This regression is quite similar

to the others. Finally, note that unreported regressions using the log of

MARRYR are less successful in explaining variations in WYEAR11 than the

regressions reported in Table 7.

    Returning to the Income Dynamics data, regressions are presented in

Table 8 which attempt to explain differences across individuals in the

increase in wage rates between 1967 and 1973 (W84). The regressions are

based on equation (5) in section II. Wage growth is estimated as a func-

tion of educational attainment (EH), change in union membership (DUN84),

the number of hours sick between 1967 and 1973 (SICK), race (R.ACE1),

change in city size (DCITY84), change in average state January tempera—

tures (DJAN84), a dummy variable indicating whether or not the individual

changed states (DSTATE), experience (EXP), the number of years married

between 1968 and 1973 (MARRYR2), marital status in 1968 (MARR8), marital

status in 1974 (MARR4), and dummy variables measuring changes in marital

status over this period.

     In order to hold marital status in 1968 ()   constant,   the sample has

been split into two groups: those who were not married in 1968 and those

who were married in 1968. Let us first examine the first three regres-

sions, which are based on the former subsample. Surprisingly, a move to a

warmer climate is associated with a significant increase in the wage rate;

DJAN84 is significantly positive)0 The cross sectional evidence, however,

shows that workers are willing to work for lower wages in warmer climates.

The positive coefficient of DJANB4 may be reflecting the migration of pre-

dominantly skilled workers to the sunbelt. Changing states (DSTATE) leads

to a significant increase In wages in the first regression. The marriage

variables support the predictions of equation (5). Those who marry between

1968 and 1974 (NNARR=1) are estimated to experience nearly a $1.00 greater

increase in the wage rate than those who do not marry in this period; the


     101n unreported regressions, the significance of the positive coeffi-
cient of DJAN84 persists even after the distance of the move has been held
constant.

average value of W84 is $2.00. The number of years married between 1968

and 1973 (MARRYR2) also has a significant and positive impact on wage

growth. When final marital status (MARR4) is held constant, an additional

year of marriage is estimated to increase the wage rate by 43 cents. It

should be noted that the significant positive coefficients of NMARR and

MARRYR2 may result from a positive correlation between these variables and

a1. MARR4 has a negative but insignificant coefficient; currently married
males experience a wage growth which is 63 cents less than the wage growth

of males who are not currently married. It therefore would take nearly

four years of .arevious marriage experience to build the unexplained 98 cent

wage differential that is observed between married males and never—married

males. None of the remaining variables are significant.

     The only variable that is significantly associated with wage growth

in the subsample of those who were married in 1968 is educational attain-

ment. Wage growth between 1968 and 1974 increases by 13 cents with every

additional year of schooling. The marital variables often have a plausible,

although insignificant, impact on wage growth. Males who were not mar-

ried for at least one year in the 1969—1974 period (LOSS1) are estimated

to have a 29 cent smaller increase in their wage rate than males who were

married continuously in the period. When MARR4 is held constant, an addi-

tional year of marriage leads to a 17 cent larger increase in wage growth.

The MARRYR2 coefficient in regression (5) is approximately 40 percent of

the size of the MARRYR2 coefficient in regression (2). Since the mean

number of years married is 13 years greater in the latter sample, this

 finding is consistent with the additional annual investnitnt that occurs


      In the subsample of individuals who were not married for at least
 one year in the 1969—1974 period, MARRYR2 is significant at the 10 per
 cent level; its coefficient equals 0.20.

increases. MAR}4 has a positive but insignificant coefficient.                             )
      Additional evidence on wage growth during marriage comes from unre-

ported   regressiDns.    If   widowhood   is not as   anticipated as marital disso—

lution, then m31es who become widowed will experience a greater rate of

wage growth during their married years than males who become s€parated or

divorced.   This    prediction receives weak confirmation.         In the subsample

of individuals who become separated or divorced in the 1969—1974 period,

the coefficient of MARRYR2 approximately equalled 0.17. In the subsample

of males who became widowed during this period, an additional year of

marriage led to more than a 30 cent larger wage growth. However, in these

small samples, neither coefficient is significant.

      The final regression in Table 8 utilizes the full sample. As before,

EFI and DSTATE are significantly positive. MARRYR2 is correctly positive

and is significant. Final marital status (MARR4) is negative and is again

insignificant. The coefficient of initial marital status (MARR8) is nega—

tive and is significant at the seven percent level; this finding lends

some support to the hypothesis that married males invest less per hour in

the accumulation of human capital than single males (i.e.,
                                                                             m
                                                                                 <   0).
      Additional evidence on the determinants of wage growth comes from the

Project TALENT data. Table 9 presents regressions estimating the growth

in wage rates between 1965 and 1971. The average growth in wage rates

over these six years in this young and highly educated sample is close to

$3.   Educational   attainment is the only variable that has a significant

impact on wage growth. Those with a B.A. are           esrimated   to have approxi-

mately $1.00 greater wage growth than high school graduates. The first

three regressions examine the sample of males who were never married in
                                                                                           )

1965. In this sample, those who marry by 1971 experielice a 16 cont greater

wage growth than those who do not marry. As predicted, wage growth is

positively related to MARRYR and is negatively related to NOMARR1. One

year of previous   s'arriage   experience is estimated to increase wages by

seven cents. Current marital status (MARR) has a positive but insignificant

coefficient. The coefficients of regression (2) imply that 10 years of

previous marriage experience would be required to increase wages by 72 cents

(14 percent of the 1971 wage rate). In the fourth regression, the subsample

of never—married males in 1965 who were married once in 1971 and married in

1971 is used. With MARRYR more accurately measured, its coefficient jumps

by more than 50 percent; one year of marriage is now estimated to raise

wage growth by 11 cents. MARRYR is, however, still insignificant. In the

fifth regression those who are unmarried in 1965 and married in 1971 exper-

ience 18 cents greater wage growth than those who were unmarried in both

years. In the sixth regression, males who were married in 1965 and unmar-

ried in 1971 are estimated to have 71 cents smaller wage growth than those

who were married in both years.

     Let us now compare individuals to themselves. A subsample has been

formed from the Income Dynamics data set to test the specification found

in equation (7). Males were included in this data set if in the 1968—19714

period they spent at least two adjacent years married and two adjacent

years unmarried. DIFF equals the average annual wage growth between adja—

cent married years less the average annual wage growth between adjacent

unmarried years.

     If in this sample, married males are approximately the same age as

unmarried males (i.e., k       0) and D.,           —   D .. — D.     + D.   0, then the

Males are estimated to experience an 18 cent greater annual increase in

wage rates when married than when not married; that is, the mean of DIFF =

0.18.    This difference is, however, not significant. The mean of DIFF is

significantly positive at the six percent level in the subsample of males

who become unmarried with age (i.e., k <            0).      It should be noted that

since in this subsample the married years precede the unmarried years, the

significant sign of DIFF may reflect nothing more than the concavity of

the age—wage profile.

        The following regression further tests the specification of equation

(7):


          DIFF =   1.020*   -   .028 k - .00000040 DCITY + .068 DJAN

The average change in city size in married years less the average change

in city size in unmarried years (DCITY), a similar variable for January

temperatures (DJAN), and k do not significantly affect wage growth. The

negative sign of k is predicted by equation (7), but the signs of DCITY
                                    36



and of DJAN are inconsistent with cross sectional results. As retirement

approaches, the benefits of the additional investment in human capital

associated with marriage fall, causing (XI)tm to fall. The significant

and negative sign of the average age in the married years (MACED) is con-

sistent with this expectation.

The decline over the life cycle in the additional investment that occurs In

marriage can be seen in Table 11. The regression estimates that at age 20,

the   annual growth in wage rates is 58 cents greater if an individual is

married than if that same individual is not married. By age 40, the dif-

ference has fallen to 14 cents. Neithe: of these differences, however, is
               12
significant.

       How much of the unexplained wage differential between married males

and never—married males is attributable to differences in labor supply?

In equations (10) and (11), labor suppy and experience arc the principal

explanators of variation across individuals in wage rates and in wage

growth. There is no information in the Income Dynamics data set about the

number of hours worked prior to 1967. Moreover, since this initial stock

of human capital (W5) is unobservable, the coefficients of a regression

estimating equation (10) may be biased. Accordingly, equation (11) rather

than equation (10) has been estimated. The sample consists of the set of

males who reported a wage rate (<$9.98) for regular work on their main job
                            -   13
in 1970 and in 19/4.                 The following regression was estimated:

                           (.015988)         (.00000004)         (.002193)

      The variables HOURA and HTCEXP correspond to the first and second

terms in equation (10), respectively. Both are significant and take on

the predicted signs. Only two of the remaining variables are significant.

Change in union membership (DUNO4) has a significant and positive impact

on wage growth, while changing states (DSTATO) is associated with signif 1—

cantly smaller wage growth.

     What does this regression imply about the wage differential between

continuously married males and never—married males of the same age?

Assume that there is no difference In labor supply between the two groups

In the first two years of experience and that group A (married or about—

to—be—married males) work 250 more hours annually than group B (never—

married males) over the rest of the life cycle. The wage differentials


     13The regression of coefficients obtained from this sample will be
less biased than regression coefficients estimated from a sample in which
wage rates must be estimated.
                                 38



under these assumptions between groups A and B at several points in the

life cycle are shown in the second column of Table 12. A continuously

married male with group A characteristics and 20 years of experience is

estimated to have a wage rate which is 7.4 percent greater than a never

married male with group B characteristics and 20 years of experience.

Thus, over one—third of the unexplained wage differential hetween narried

and never—married males appears to be attributable to differences in labor

supply. The third column in Table 12 is calculated under the assumption

that the difference in annual labor supply between the two groups equals

100 hours rather than 250 hours. The estimated wage differentials urder

this assumption are correspondingly smaller.

                           IV. CONCLUSION


    The evidence presented in this paper suggests that marriage—associated

investment in human capital is a small but important component of the wage

differential that is observed in many earnings regressions. Married males

are shown to work over 10 percent more hours than single males. However,

no significant increase in labor supply accompanies marriage, despite the

fact that males significantly decrease the time they spend working when

they become separated or divorced. The evidence on the extent of the

specialization in the labor market that accompanies marriage Is thus mixed.

Furthermore, reasonable estimates of this specialization are shown to

account for less than one—half of the unexplained wage differential between

married males and never—married males.

     The direct evidence on the relation between marriage and wages Is weak.

Introducing variables measuring the number of years married into earnings

regressions causes marital status coefficients to fall by 20 to 50 percent.

Wages are significantly related to the number of years married in the

Project TALENT data but not in the Income Dynamics data. Furthermore, in

the Income Dynamics data, a significant relationship between wage growth

and the number of years married is found; a sizable wage differential

between married and unmarried males emerges after three and a half years

of marriage. Of course, the significant relationship between wage growth

and the number of years married may reflect a selectivity phenomenon. In

the Project TALENT data, the number of years married is unrelated to wage

growth. Finally, evidence from the Income Dynamics data suggests that the

annual growth in wage rates when an individual is married is greater than

the annual growth in wage rates for the same individual when he is not

married.
