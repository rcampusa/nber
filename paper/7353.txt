        Among the most important changes brought about by the Personal Responsibility and Work
Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) is the imposition of time limits. In this paper, we
analyze a simple model in which a potential welfare recipient chooses how to allocate her time-limited
endowment of benefits so as to maximize her expected lifetime utility. Not surprisingly, the model reveals
that time limits provide an incentive for the consumer to conserve, or bank, her benefits. More interesting
is the prediction that these incentives to conserve one's benefits vary inversely with the age of the youngest
child in one's family. This implies that the reduction in welfare payments that results from PRWORA will
fall disproportionately on families with young children.
        We estimate age group-specific effects of time limits and test the prediction of the model using data
from a welfare reform demonstration in Florida. Subject to some assumptions that are necessary to
distinguish the effects of time limits from the effects of other provisions of the demonstration, we find that
time limits indeed reduce welfare use by the greatest amount among the families with the youngest children.
Moreover, time limits have substantial effects on welfare utilization, reducing monthly utilization probabilities
by 19 percent. Time limits lead families to exit the welfare rolls well before they exhaust their benefits,
suggesting that welfare mothers are rational in the sense of being forward-looking.

I.       Introduction

         The U.S. welfare system has changed dramatically as a result of the Personal

Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA). Among

the most important of the changes brought about by the Act is the imposition of time

limits. Under the old AFDC program, welfare benefits were an entitlement: all poor,

single-parent families with at least one child under 18 years of age were eligible to

receive aid. 1 The duration of welfare receipt was limited only by the age of the youngest

child in the family. Under PRWORA's new TANF program, benefits remain payable

largely to poor, single-parent families with children under 18, but the duration of welfare

receipt is sharply limited. Federal law now allows families to receive benefits for no

more than five years. Many states set stricter limits. 2

         One of the implications of time limits is that the familiar static model long used to

study welfare incentives no longer suffices to analyze consumer behavior. Whereas the

consumer’s problem was essentially static under the old entitlement regime, it is

inherently dynamic under time limits. One of the contributions of this paper is to provide

a theoretical model that embeds the leisure-consumption choice from the static model

within a dynamic framework under which current choices about welfare utilization may

affect future constraints.




1
          Some poor, married-couple families were also eligible under the Unemployed Parent component
of AFDC, but this program never accounted for more than a small fraction of the AFDC caseload (Moffitt
1992).
2
          States can exempt up to 20 percent of their caseload from the five-year time limit. In addition,
states can allow more individuals to continue receiving cash assistance for more than five years as long as
they do not use federal funds for payments past the five year limit. Several states have adopted plans that
use this option. Several other states, including California, eliminate only the adults’ portion of welfare
grants when the five-year limit is imposed, allowing the families to continue receiving the children’s
portion of the grants.
       The model yields both a testable implication and a restriction that is helpful for

identifying the effects of time limits in our empirical work. The testable implication is

that time limits should affect families differently depending on the age of their youngest

child. Families with the youngest children face the longest horizon over which welfare

could be used to smooth consumption in the event of an adverse wage realization.

Therefore they have the greatest incentive to conserve, or bank, their welfare benefits.

This implies that families with the youngest children should be the first to leave the

welfare rolls when time limits are imposed. The model also yields an identifying

restriction, since it implies that families whose oldest children are above a threshold age--

age 13 in the case of a five-year time limit--are unaffected by the imposition of the time

limit. For these families, the time limit amounts to a non-binding constraint.

       For our empirical analysis we use data from Florida's Family Transition Program

(FTP). Subject to a number of identifying assumptions required to isolate the effect of

time limits from the effects of other provisions of the program, we find that families with

younger children indeed exit the welfare roles more rapidly once time limits are imposed.

Moreover, we find strong anticipatory responses to time limits. Our estimates indicate

that, in the absence of other provisions of FTP that tended to increase aid utilization, time

limits would have caused welfare use to fall by 19 percent before any of the families had

actually exhausted their benefits. Contrary to expectation, our estimates suggest that

even relatively disadvantaged aid recipients respond to the time limit.

       By focusing primarily on time limits and using data from a randomized trial, our

analysis differs from a number of recent studies that have estimated the effects of welfare

reform more generally (Blank 1997; Council of Economic Advisors 1997; Wallace and




                                              2
Blank 1999; Ziliak, et al., 1997). These studies focus on welfare caseloads, utilizing

aggregate state-level data measured either monthly or annually. With the exception of

Ziliak, et al. (1997), they generally find welfare reform to have at least a marginally

significant effect on caseloads, as does Moffitt (1999), who analyzes data from the

Current Population Survey (CPS). Their results regarding the effects of time limits are

mixed, and at any rate, they do not (and with aggregate data, can not) disaggregate the

effects of time limits by age. Moreover, one set of authors constrains time limits to have

the same effect as work requirements (a distinct type of welfare reform policy), thus

failing to isolate the effects of time limits even on aggregate caseloads (Ziliak, et al.

1997). Others have been criticized as incorrectly characterizing some states' welfare

reform plans, causing their models to be misspecified (Council of Economic Advisors

1997; Martini and Wiseman 1997).

        To our knowledge, the only other paper to provide both a theoretical and

empirical analysis of the effects of time limits is Swann (1998). 3 Swann's model, like

ours, captures the important dynamic elements of the consumer's problem under time

limits. In most other respects, however, our papers differ substantially. Swann's model is

more general than ours in some dimensions, but ours is more general in others.

Moreover, our focus differs from Swann's. Whereas he uses numerical simulations to

study welfare utilization (and other outcomes) over time, we focus on deriving analytical

results. Perhaps the greatest difference between our studies concerns our empirical work.

Swann uses individual data collected under the old AFDC system to estimate a dynamic

model of welfare utilization, then uses the parameters from that model to simulate how


3
         Bloom et al. (1997, 1998) have studied the FTP program using the data we analyze here, but they
did not attempt to isolate the effects of the time limit from the effects of the other program treatments.


                                                     3
utilization changes in response to time limits. In our empirical work, in contrast, we

compare the behavior of consumers who were actually subject to a time limit to that of

consumers for whom welfare remained an entitlement.

II. The Model

        We begin with a simple model of welfare receipt under time limits, abstracting

from a number of important considerations such as job search, welfare stigma, and

human capital formation. Although incorporating these aspects of the consumer's

problem might add valuable realism to the model, it would also add substantial

complexity. Our goal in focusing on a parsimonious model is not to deny the importance

of other elements of the consumer's problem, but rather to focus on the effects of time

limits per se and derive predictions that can be studied using the experimental data at our

disposal.

        A. The Consumer's Problem under Time Limits

        As was noted in the introduction, aid is available under TANF (and was available

under AFDC) only to families with minor children in the home. This means that the

consumer's period of eligibility for aid, or equivalently, her eligibility horizon, is T

periods long, where T is the number of years until the consumer's youngest child turns 18.

We take T to be exogenous, but note the implications of endogenous fertility below.

        At the beginning of her period of eligibility, the consumer is endowed with an

initial stock of benefits. This stock is denominated in periods of benefit receipt,

consistent with the language of PRWORA. The initial stock, which we denote as N, is

equal to the time limit.




                                               4
        If the consumer works in period t, she receives a gross wage of wt. Wages at time

t are stochastic, however, and unknown until period t begins. We assume that the

consumer gets a new i.i.d. wage draw each period from the known distribution function

F (w). The new wage draw each period captures the observation that employment in the

low-wage sector tends to be fairly unstable, particularly for welfare recipients (Edin and

Lein 1997; Loeb and Corcoran 1999). We assume that wt becomes known at the

beginning of period t, after which the consumer chooses how much to work and, if she

has not already exhausted her benefits, whether to utilize welfare. Of course, the amount

of time she spends working may depend on whether she utilizes welfare. We denote her

hours of work and hours of leisure at time t as ht ( I t ) and Lt ( I t ) , respectively, where It is

the welfare utilization indicator, equal to one if the consumer utilizes benefits at time t

and zero otherwise. Each period the consumer faces a time constraint given by

ht ( I t ) + Lt ( I t ) = L , where L denotes total time available.

        We denote consumption at time t by Ct ( I t ) , the price of which is normalized to

one. We assume that there is no borrowing or saving, which is realistic for a low-income

population (Edin and Lein 1997). Letting τ denote the benefit reduction rate, that is, the

rate at which benefits are taxed as the consumer's earnings increase, the consumer’s

current-period budget constraint is given by Ct (1) = G + wt (1 − τ ) ht (1) if she elects to

receive welfare. We refer to this as the "welfare budget constraint." Her budget

constraint is given by Ct (0) = wt ht (0) if she foregoes welfare, which we refer to as the

"no-welfare budget constraint."

        The consumer's current-period utility function is given by U(Lt , Ct ) and is

increasing and concave in both arguments. We assume that both consumption and leisure


                                                  5
are normal goods. 4 The consumer’s problem is to choose hours of work and welfare

utilization so as to maximize the expected present value of lifetime utility, subject to the

time limit and her time and budget constraints. A formal statement of the consumer’s

problem is:

              T
max           ∑ ρt − 1 E U ( L t , C t )
I1 ,..., IT   t =1
h1 ,..., hT

s.t.          Lt ( I t ) + ht ( I t ) = L
              Ct ( I t ) = (1 − I t ) wt ht ( 0) + I t [G + wt (1 − τ )ht (1)]
              S1 = N
              S t = S t −1 − I t −1           t = 2,..., T
              ST +1 ≥ 0
              wt ~ F ( wt ) i.i.d .

where ρ ε ( 0,1) is the discount factor. The variable St is the state variable, giving the

stock of benefits remaining at the beginning of period t. At time t =1 it is equal to the

time limit, and it must be non-negative at the beginning of period T+1, which is the end

of the consumer's eligibility horizon. In between, utilizing benefits at time t depletes the

remaining stock of benefits by one unit. Thus S t = S t −1 − 1 if benefits are utilized in

period t-1 and St = St-1 if not. This simple stock depletion rule has important implications

for the solution of the model.

              B. The Solution of the Model

              To characterize the solution, let Vt(St ) denote the optimal value of the consumer's

problem starting from time t with remaining benefits St . Vt satisfies the usual recursion

relationship



4
    We further assume that U C             → −∞ as C → 0 , where U C denotes the derivative of the utility
function with respect to C. This final "Inada condition" is not strictly necessary for our results, but it does
help simplify some of the diagrams below.


                                                                6
Vt ( S t ) = max [U ( Lt , Ct ) + ρEVt +1 ( S t +1 )].
             ht , I t



Because St depends on It but not ht, the consumer's problem simplifies considerably. In

each period, the consumer solves a two-part problem. First, she chooses optimal current-

period labor supply along each of the welfare and no-welfare budget constraints. Second,

she chooses whether to utilize welfare so as to maximize expected utility over her

remaining eligibility horizon. In other words, she first solves her current-period

maximization problem subject to each of her possible current-period budget constraints,

then chooses the budget constraint (i.e., decides whether to utilize welfare) so as to

achieve the global maximum. 5

          The solutions to the first-part problem satisfy the usual tangency conditions.

Define the consumer's current-period marginal rate of substitution as a function of her

labor supply and consumption:

m( ht ( I t ), C t ( I t )) ≡ U L ( L − ht ( I t ), Ct ( I t )) / U C ( L − ht ( I t ), C t ( I t )) . Then the consumer's

optimum along the welfare budget constraint satisfies m( ht* ( 0), Ct* ( 0)) ≥ (1 − τ ) wt , where

the inequality holds strictly if (1 −τ ) wt < m(0, G) , that is, if her net wage draw is less

than her shadow price of leisure. The consumer's optimum along the no-welfare budget

constraint satisfies m( ht* (1), Ct* (1)) = wt .

          The second part of the consumer's two-part problem is to choose whether to

utilize welfare so as to solve:

max {U ( L − ht* (0), Ct* (0)) + ρEVt +1 ( S t ), U ( L − ht* (1), Ct* (1)) + ρEVt +1 ( S t − 1)} .
    It




5
          The mechanics of the problem thus are similar to those in Moffitt's (1983) static model.


                                                             7
It proves useful to write the consumer's second-part problem in terms of her current-

period wage realization. To do this, define the consumer's maximized, or indirect, utility

function along a budget constraint defined by non-labor income At and a net wage of Wt

as

          v (Wt , At ) = U ( L , At )                                              if m( 0, At ) > Wt
                       = max [U ( Lt , C t ) | Ct = Wt ht + At ; L = Lt + ht ] if m(0, At ) ≤ Wt .
                            h


Then the second part of the consumer's problem can be written as:

max {v ( wt ,0) + ρ EVt +1 ( S t ), v ( wt (1 − τ ), G) + ρ EVt +1 ( S t − 1)} .
  It



         For low wage realizations, utilizing benefits raises current-period utility.

Utilizing benefits today, however, reduces the stock of benefits remaining for the future.

In the case where S t < T − t + 1 , so the remaining stock of benefits is less than the

remaining number of periods in the eligibility horizon, utilizing benefits today reduces

the expectation of maximized utility beginning in period t +1. In the dynamic model, the

consumer will utilize benefits today only if the current-period utility gain is great enough

to offset the discounted loss in expected future utility, that, only if

v ( wt (1 − τ), G) − v ( wt ,0) > ρ[ EVt +1 ( S t ) − EVt +1 ( S t − 1)] .                              (1)

         Panel A of Figure 1 depicts the consumer's welfare utilization decision. It plots

two functions against the current-period wage realization. The first is the current-period

utility gain that results from current-period welfare utilization, denoted by

δ ( wt ) ≡ v ( wt (1 − τ), G) − v( wt ,0) . The second is the discounted gain in expected future

utility that results from foregoing current-period welfare utilization, denoted by

∆ t +1 ( S t ) ≡ ρ[ EVt +1 ( S t ) − EVt +1 ( S t − 1)] . The current-period utility gain δ ( wt ) is large




                                                           8
for low values of wt , since for a low wage draw, utilizing welfare can raise consumption

substantially. The current-period utility gain from utilizing aid falls as the wage

realization improves. 6 In contrast, the expected future utility gain from foregoing

current-period welfare, ∆ t +1 ( S t ) , is not a function of the current-period wage realization,

and hence graphs as a horizontal line.

        At the wage corresponding to the intersection of these two curves, the consumer is

just indifferent about utilizing welfare in the current period. We term this wage the

                                                                      ~ (S ) .
consumer's reservation wage for welfare utilization, and denote it by wt  t



Algebraically, the consumer's reservation wages satisfies:

   ~ ( S )(1 − τ ), G ) + ρEV ( S − 1) = v( w
v (w                                        ~ ( S ),0) + ρEV ( S ) .                             (2)

Figure 1 shows that the consumer's welfare utilization problem satisfies the reservation

welfare in the current period; for realizations greater than wt   t



period welfare utilization.

        C. Implications

        A number of implications follow from the reservation wage property of the

model. First, the reservation wage is highest in the final period of the eligibility horizon.

At period T, the value of preserving benefits for the next period is zero. Put differently,

at period T the consumer's problem is effectively static, since today's choice does not

                                                                   ~≡w
affect future utility. Denote the final-period reservation wage by w ~ ( S ) for ST > 0.
                                                                       T  T




6
        There is a kink in   δ ( wt ) at wt = m(0, G ) because the consumer will choose not to work for
values of   wt ≤ m( 0, G) . Thus v ( w(1 − τ ), G) is constant (and equal to U ( L , G) ) for



                                                      9
          This notion generalizes. If at any time period t' the remaining benefit stock S t '

(weakly) exceeds the remaining number of periods in the eligibility horizon, then the

consumer's problem is again essentially static, because the period of eligibility will end

(weakly) before the remaining benefit stock can be exhausted. Because this result

provides an important restriction for our empirical identification analysis in Section IV,

we state it as a lemma:

                                    ~ (S ) = w
Lemma: Let S t ' ≥ T − t '+1 . Then w        ~ for t ' ≤ t ≤ T .
                                     t  t



It follows that an entitlement is formally a special case of time limits, since for N = T, we

have S t ≥ T − t + 1 for t = 1,..., T.

          To establish our principal result, we note that the reservation wage in period t

satisfies equation (2),whereas if I t* = 0 , then the reservation wage in period t+1 will

satisfy

   ~ ( S )(1 − τ ), G) + ρ EV ( S − 1) = v ( w
v (w                                         ~ ( S ), 0) + ρEV ( S ).                         (3)
    t +1 t                   t +2 t           t +1 t          t +2 t


Comparing equations (2) and (3), we see that if benefits are not utilized in period t, then

the reservation wage at period t+1 will exceed the reservation wage at period t, provided

that EVt +1 ( S t ) − EVt +1 ( St − 1) > EVt + 2 ( S t ) − EVt + 2 ( S t − 1) , that is, provided that the value

(in expected utility terms) of the marginal unit of benefits falls, the closer is the end of the

eligibility period. But the value of the marginal unit of benefits falls as t rises for a

simple reason: the closer one is to the end of one's eligibility horizon, the greater the

likelihood that the remaining benefit stock eventually will exceed the remaining

eligibility horizon, in which case the consumer's problem becomes static and the marginal



wt ≤ m( 0, G) , but increasing and concave for wt > m(0, G ) , giving rise to a kink.


                                                       10
unit of benefits has a zero shadow price. We state this result in the form of a proposition,

the proof of which is provided in the Appendix:



Proposition (Rising reservation wages): Let S t < T − t + 1. Then provided that I t* = 0 ,

~ (S ) > w
w        ~ ( S ) . In other words, all else equal, the consumer becomes less reluctant to
 t +1 t   t   t


utilize welfare as time passes (i.e., as t rises).



         This result is depicted graphically in Panel B of Figure 1. Since neither ∆ t +1 ( S t )

nor ∆ t + 2 ( S t ) is a function of the current-period wage realization, both graph as horizontal

lines. Since the value of the marginal unit of benefits is lower, the closer the consumer is

to the end of her period of eligibility, ∆ t + 2 ( S t ) < ∆ t +1 ( S t ) . Thus ∆ t + 2 ( S t ) intersects

δ (w) farther to the right than does ∆ t +1 ( S t ) .

         This result is fairly intuitive. Welfare allows the consumer to smooth

consumption in the face of adverse wage shocks. Because of time limits, however, there

are limits to how much smoothing she can do. Early in the eligibility period, the odds of

realizing an adverse wage draw at some point in the future are high. The consumer reacts

by waiting to draw down her benefits. As time passes, however, the odds of adverse

future wage draws fall, so the consumer becomes more willing to utilize her benefits.

         Put somewhat differently, the value of preserving one’s option to draw benefits in

the future is high when the eligibility horizon comprises many periods. As the end of the

eligibility horizon approaches, however, the value of preserving one’s benefits falls. The

consumer can afford to exhibit less reluctance in utilizing welfare.




                                                      11
       This result has two empirical implications that can be tested with data on welfare-

eligible families observed at the time that time limits are imposed. We term these

implications the Exit Hypothesis and the Entry Hypothesis:

Exit Hypothesis: Upon the imposition of time limits, families with younger (youngest)

children will leave the welfare rolls more quickly than families with older (youngest)

children.

Entry Hypothesis: Upon the imposition of time limits, families with younger (youngest)

children will be less likely to enter the welfare rolls than families with older (youngest)

children.

       When time limits are imposed initially, families utilizing welfare receive the same

initial endowment of benefits, but face substantially different eligibility horizons.

Families whose youngest children are very young have long eligibility horizons and thus

have low reservation wages. Families whose youngest children are close to age 18 have

short eligibility horizons and high reservation wages. For families receiving welfare

when time limits are imposed, this means that families with younger (youngest) children

are less likely to continue utilizing benefits than families with older (youngest) children.

For families not receiving benefits, this means that families with younger (youngest)

children are less likely to sign up for welfare than families with older (youngest) children.

       Although the entry and exit hypotheses, as stated, pertain to families involved in

the transition from AFDC to TANF, the implications of the general result appear to be

broader and yield predictions regarding the steady-state age distribution of children

receiving welfare under TANF as compared to AFDC. Under AFDC, entering cohorts of

welfare-eligible families (predominantly families becoming eligible due to an unwed




                                             12
birth or divorce) had no incentive to hoard their benefits. Under TANF, entering cohorts

will have different incentives to hoard their benefits depending on the age of the youngest

child in the family. On average, families with older (youngest) children will be more

likely to use their benefits, whereas families with younger (youngest) children will be less

likely to use theirs. As a result, in an otherwise stationary environment, the move from

AFDC to TANF should raise the average age of (youngest) children receiving aid.

       The rising reservation wage result may have important substantive implications as

well. Taken together, the entry and exit hypotheses indicate that the reductions in welfare

expenditures that result from the imposition of time limits will fall disproportionately on

families with young children. In other words, any reductions in welfare receipt that a

child experiences due to time limits are more likely to occur earlier, rather than later,

during childhood.

       If decreasing welfare payments cause poverty rates to rise, then this may affect

the child's ability and ultimate educational attainment. Guo (1998) studies ability and

achievement tests in the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data.

She finds that poverty in childhood has a strong negative influence on the child's

measured ability, but that poverty in adolescence has little such effect. This is broadly

consistent with findings of Duncan et al. (1998), who study data on educational

attainment from the PSID. They divide childhood into three segments--birth to age 5, age

5 to age 10, and age 11 to age 15--and find that poverty during the earliest phase of

childhood has the greatest negative consequences for the child's ultimate educational

attainment. These results suggest that the incentives arising from time limits may have

adverse consequences for children, particularly in light of findings that welfare families




                                             13
"neutralize" government policy to only a limited extent (Schoeni 1997; Rosenzweig and

Wolpin 1994; Lundberg, Pollak, and Wales 1997).

       Of course, other analysts have argued that welfare receipt is damaging for

children because it encourages them to bear their own children at early ages and rely on

welfare themselves when they grow up (Murray 1984). Indeed, since welfare spells that

begin when children are young last longer, on average (O'Neill et al., 1987), preventing

such spells might be the most effective way to reduce welfare utilization overall. This

line of reasoning would lead one to conclude that time limits may have favorable

consequences for children.

       Our objective in pursuing this discussion is not to take a stand on how time limits

will affect child welfare. Rather, it is to point out that, although the conclusions of these

arguments differ widely, they both suggest that the rising reservation wage result may

have important substantive implications for the well-being of children. Therefore it is

important to test the theory and determine whether it adequately describes the data.

       Before turning to a discussion of our data, however, it is useful to mention how

potentially endogenous fertility might affect our results. Additional births increase the

consumer's period of eligibility by increasing the number of years before the youngest

child in the family turns 18. They have no effect on the family's time limit, however.

Thus additional births increase the family's reluctance to use welfare, all else equal.

III. Florida's Family Transition Program: Background, Data, and Program
Treatments

       Our empirical work focuses on the exit hypothesis, which predicts that families

with younger (youngest) children will spend less time on aid than families with older

(youngest) children when time limits are initially imposed. Our data come from Florida's



                                             14
Family Transition Program (FTP). Although these data have some limitations, they have

two advantages which may help to offset their shortcomings. First, they provide some of

the first individual-level data that permit one to study the effects of time limits. Although

other analysts have studied time limits that were imposed under the states' pre-PRWORA

waivers, most of them use state-level aggregate data. 7 Moffitt (1999) uses data from the

CPS, but he does not analyze the effects of time limits separately from the effects of other

pre-PRWORA welfare reform provisions. The second advantageous feature of FTP is

that it involved random assignment to treatment, which aids in identifying the effect of

time limits.

       A. Background

       Florida's experimental FTP program was implemented in Escambia County

(Pensacola) starting in May 1994. New applicants for cash welfare were randomized into

one of two groups: the experimental FTP group, which was subject to time limits, or the

control group, which was enrolled in the AFDC program. Persons already receiving

welfare were randomized into treatment or control groups at the time of their biannual

recertification interviews. Recruitment into the experiment continued until October 1996.

Bloom et al. (1997, 1998, 1999) provide evaluations of the early impacts of the program

and more detailed information about the data, program operations, and program rules.

       B. Data

       In this paper we analyze data on persons drawn into the experiment between May

1994 and February 1995. This yields a sample of 2,623 persons, 1,312 of whom

participated in the FTP program and 1,311 of whom received AFDC. Sample members

are observed for 24 months beginning with the month after random assignment. In this


7
       This includes CEA (1997), Blank (1997), Ziliak, et al. (1997), and Wallace and Blank (1999).

                                                 15
study we include only single-parent cases, the vast majority of which are headed by

women.

        The data analyzed here come primarily from two sources, Florida administrative

records and a short survey instrument known as the Background Information Form (BIF).

Florida administrative records provide data on monthly benefit receipt. The BIF was

administered to welfare applicants (and re-certificants) at the time they applied (or were

re-certified) for benefits, prior to random assignment. It contains baseline demographic

characteristics.

        C. FTP Program Treatments and Conditions of AFDC Receipt

        Although time limits were arguably the central component of the FTP program,

the program included a number of other treatments as well. Since these other treatments

may affect recipients' decisions about exiting welfare, they may hinder our ability to

isolate the effects of time limits. We describe the full set of FTP treatments in some

detail, as well as the corresponding conditions imposed on AFDC recipients under the

Florida welfare reform waiver. This discussion motivates our approach to estimating the

effect of time limits.

        FTP participants were subject to five different categories of treatments: the time

limit, financial work incentives, enhanced support services, employment and training

mandates, and child care subsidies. Most FTP participants faced a 24-month time limit,

after which their benefits could be, and nearly always were, terminated. Particularly

disadvantaged participants, who make up roughly 40 percent of the sample, received a

36-month time limit. FTP participants also enjoyed relatively generous work incentives:

the first $200 of monthly earnings were disregarded from income in determining their




                                             16
monthly benefits, and earnings in excess of $200 were subject to a benefit reduction rate

of 50 percent. Relative to AFDC recipients, FTP participants had enhanced social

support services, including enhanced employment and training services. The FTP group

was subject to a 30 hour/week employment and training mandate, with exemptions only

for women with children under six months old. Finally, the FTP program provided

subsidies for child care.

        In some respects, conditions facing the AFDC group were the same as those

facing participants in a conventional AFDC program. Most importantly for our purposes,

AFDC recipients faced no time limits. The AFDC group also faced conventional AFDC

work incentives. During the first four months on aid, the AFDC group faced an income

disregard of $120 and a benefit reduction rate of 67 percent After the first four months,

the benefit reduction rate rose to 100 percent, and after the 12th month on aid, the

disregard fell to $90. Thus AFDC participants had lower income than FTP participants

for any given level of earnings.

        In other respects, however, the AFDC group faced conditions quite unlike those

of a conventional AFDC program. As part of Florida's welfare reform waiver, AFDC

participants were subject to the same 30 hours/week employment and training mandate as

the FTP group. Unlike the FTP group, however, AFDC mothers were exempted from the

mandate if they had children younger than three. Furthermore, AFDC recipients were in

principle eligible for the same child care subsidies as FTP participants. Table 1

summarizes the various FTP treatments and the corresponding conditions facing AFDC

recipients.




                                             17
IV. Identification

       On the one hand, the presence of multiple program treatments complicates our

effort to estimate the effects of time limits. On the other hand, since some of these

treatments, such as greater financial work incentives, are components of many states'

TANF plans (Moffitt 1998), it may be useful to learn how those treatments affect

behavior as well.

       Given the number of treatments, however, one might expect that the effects of

time limits could be identified only under a number of assumptions. Therefore we

approach the identification problem as an effort to establish conditions under which the

effects of the time limit are identified. We argue that some of these conditions are likely

to be satisfied either by the rules of the FTP program or as a result of the theory

developed above. Other conditions, however, are more specialized, and as we stress

below, the estimates we provide are valid only under those conditions.

       In section V, we present estimates of the effects of time limits and some of the

other program treatments under the assumptions we develop here. We then attempt to

test some of these assumptions in section VI, acknowledging that the tests are fairly

indirect. Our goal with this approach is not to assert that we can identify the effects of

time limits under general conditions, but rather to use what are among the first available

data on time limits to learn what we can about this new and important feature of the U.S.

welfare system. A more robust analysis will have to await the collection of data more

specifically designed to isolate the effect of time limits.

       The first step of our identification analysis is to determine what is identified by

random assignment to the FTP program. Since the program consists of several different




                                              18
treatments, randomization by itself does not identify the effects of any specific treatment.

Rather, randomization identifies what we term the general program effect: the effect of

participating in FTP rather than AFDC. Because the effects of the specific treatments

may vary with the age of the youngest child in the family, the general program effect may

vary by age as well. Let γ a denote the general program effect for a mother whose

youngest child is a years old (or alternatively, is in age group a).

         Assuming the general program effects to be the sum of the specific effects of time

limits (TL), financial work incentives (WI), enhanced support services (SS), employment

and training mandates (ET), and child care subsidies (CC), we have

γ a = τaTL + τaW I + τ aSS + τ aET + τaCC

where τaj denotes the effect of the jth specific treatment on the ath age group. In general,

there are five specific treatment effects to be identified from each general program effect.

Obviously, the effects of time limits can be isolated from the general program effects

only under a number of identifying restrictions.

         One type of restriction that may aid in identification is age-invariance of a

particular treatment effect. If the effect of the jth treatment does not vary by the age of

the youngest child in the family, then τaj = τ j for all a. A special case of age-invariance

arises when a specific treatment does not vary between the experimental and control

groups. If the jth treatment does not vary between the AFDC and FTP groups, then

τaj = 0 for all a. Some restrictions of this type derive from program rules.

         For example, all aid recipients from both the FTP and the AFDC groups, with the

exceptions of AFDC mothers with children under three and FTP mothers with infants

under six months old, were subject to the same employment and training mandates. Thus


                                              19
τaET = 0 for a ≥ 3 (and for a ≤ 6 months). Similarly, both the AFDC mothers and the FTP

mothers had access to the same child care subsidies, at least in principle. Under this

condition, τaCC = 0 for all a.

        Another important restriction derives from the theory developed in section II.

Our Lemma implies that, for a consumer whose benefit stock exceeds her eligibility

horizon, a time-limited program is equivalent to an entitlement program. Therefore, for

mothers whose youngest children are sufficiently close to their 18th birthdays, time limits

will have no effect on behavior. Put differently, both FTP mothers and AFDC mothers

whose children are above a threshold age will face the same effective time limit, which is

the categorical limit that arises from the requirement that there be a minor child in the

household. For those with a two-year time limit, the threshold age is 16; for those facing

a three-year time limit, the threshold age is 15. Denote this threshold age by a . Then

the Lemma from section II implies that τaTL = 0 for a ≥ a .

        Table 2 helps to illustrate the consequences of these various restrictions.

Corresponding to our approach to the empirical analysis below, we consider the

relationship between the general program effects and the specific treatment effects for

families whose youngest children fall into one of four age categories. The youngest

category, age group 1, consists of mothers whose children are older than six months (0.5

year) and less than 3 years. This is the age range over which employment and training

mandates differ between the FTP and AFDC groups. The oldest category, age group 4,

consists of mothers whose youngest children are older than the threshold age a .

Categories 2 and 3 are intermediate age categories, of which at least two are needed to

estimate whether time limits lead mothers with younger children to exit the welfare roles


                                             20
sooner than mothers with older children. Age group 2 includes families whose youngest

child is 3 to 11 years old; age group 3 includes families whose youngest child is between

12 and 14 or 15, where the upper limit depends on the length of the family's time limit.

       Column (3) of Table 2 simply defines the general program effects as the sum of

the unrestricted specific treatment effects, reiterating that the specific treatment effects

are unidentified without further restrictions. Column (4) imposes the age-invariance

restrictions that τaET = 0 for a > 1 and τaCC = 0 for all a. Column (5) imposes the

restriction from the Lemma that τ4TL = 0 .

       Column (5) reveals that an additional set of conditions sufficient to isolate the

effects of time limits, at least on the two intermediate age groups, is that the effects of the

financial work incentives and the enhanced social support services, τWa I and τaSS , be age-

invariant. These assumptions follow neither from the program rules nor, in general, from

the theory developed in section II. We do not attempt to argue that these conditions hold

generally, but instead provide a set of assumptions under which they hold. In section VI

we provide some evidence on the validity of these assumptions.

       To analyze the effects of the work incentives we draw on the familiar leisure-

consumption diagram long used to study welfare incentives under AFDC. One lesson

that follows from the theory developed in section II is that program features that affect

the current-period budget constraint may affect current-period utilization decisions by

affecting the choice of hours conditional on utilization. This suggests that the current-

period budget diagram may help us to understand how program features such as the

benefit reduction rate influence welfare utilization decisions.




                                              21
       Figure 2 shows how the lower benefit reduction rate facing the FTP group affects

current-period utilization incentives. Under each program, there is a level of labor supply

at which income is the same, whether or not the consumer utilizes welfare. This is

known as the "breakeven" level of labor supply. By increasing breakeven hours from

h BAFDC to h BFTP , and by raising the welfare payment to consumers working less than the

breakeven number of hours, the lower benefit reduction rate under FTP should increase

welfare utilization by providing a greater incentive to combine work and welfare. The

higher earned income disregard under FTP (not illustrated) reinforces this effect.

       The real question for us, however, is whether these utilization incentives vary by

the age of the youngest child in the family. Presumably, utilization incentives would vary

by the age of the youngest child due to interactions between the financial work incentives

and child care costs. Child care costs vary inversely with the age of the youngest child.

Therefore a mother who had the same wage as that depicted in Figure 2, but who had

higher child care costs, would face a lower budget constraint. Thus FTP's financial work

incentives might affect her differently than they would affect an otherwise identical

mother with lower child care costs. If the child care subsides that were available under

FTP were sufficient to equalize child care costs, however, then the two mothers would

face the same budget constraint, and be affected similarly by the financial work

incentives. Thus an assumption sufficient to justify age-invariance of the effects of the

financial work incentives is that the child care subsidies equalized child care costs among

mothers with youngest children of different ages.

       Ideally, we would test this assumption directly using survey data on net child care

expenditures. Unfortunately, no such data exist. Instead, we propose in section VI an



                                            22
indirect test that relies on a simple observation: in order for FTP's financial work

incentives to affect the consumer's income, the consumer must combine work and

welfare. Thus we test for age-invariant financial work incentives by asking whether FTP

affects the consumer's probability of combining work and welfare differently according

to the age of her youngest child.

       Beyond age-invariance of the effects of the financial work incentives, another

condition required to identify the effects of time limits is age-invariance in the effects of

the enhanced social supports. To the extent that these services include valuable training

opportunities, human capital theory suggests that they would be more valuable to

younger mothers than to older mothers. If service utilization were tied to welfare

utilization, then this would give the youngest mothers the greatest incentive to remain on

the welfare rolls. This would tend to mask the effects of time limits, which provide the

youngest mothers with the greatest incentive to leave the welfare rolls. In section VI we

test for age-invariance of the effects of enhanced social services by asking whether,

within the FTP group, young mothers are more likely than older mothers to remain on

aid.

       Under the assumptions that the effects of the financial work incentives and the

enhanced social supports are age-invariant, some of the age-specific time limit effects are

identified, as shown in column (6) of Table 2. Since mothers in the oldest age group are

not affected by the time limit, they serve to identify the sum of the effects of the financial

work incentives and enhanced support services, τW I + τ SS . This in turn identifies the

effect of time limits for the two intermediate age groups, since for them, the gross

program effect is equal to the sum of the effects of the time limit, the work incentives,




                                              23
and the support services. Thus with these assumptions, we can estimate τ2TL and τ3TL and

determine whether τ2TL < τ3TL ( < 0) as the theory predicts.

        Another potential problem with this strategy is that, prior to 1996, child care

subsidies for the AFDC group may have been less generous than those for the FTP group

owing to general budgetary shortfalls facing the State of Florida (Bloom et al., 1998). If

indeed the subsidies available to the AFDC group were less generous than those available

to the FTP group, then our strategy will fail to identify the effects of time limits if the

effects of child care subsidies vary with the age of the youngest child. Fortunately, the

temporary nature of any shortfalls in child care subsidies allows us to present some

evidence as to their effects on our estimates. We return to this issue in section VI.

        We turn now to our main results. These provide consistent estimates of the

effects of time limits under the full set of identifying assumptions that is spelled out in

Table 2. This includes the assumptions based on program rules, the assumption provided

by the Lemma in section II, and the age-invariance assumptions on the effects of the

financial work incentives and enhanced social supports.

V. Estimation and Results

        A. Difference-in-difference estimates

        The central prediction from the model is that the imposition of time limits reduces

time on welfare for mothers of young children by a greater amount than for mothers of

older children. The outcome that we study in the initial portion of the analysis is thus the

number of months on aid during the first two years after entering the program. In the

regression analysis that follows, we also analyze sequences of monthly welfare utilization

indicators.



                                              24
         As suggested above, the randomization that was used to assign participants to the

FTP and AFDC groups simplifies estimation of the general program effects. We initially

compute mean months on aid by age group separately for the FTP participants and the

AFDC participants, and use the difference in these means as estimates of γ a .

Randomization ensures that these estimates are consistent.

         Table 3 presents mean months on aid for AFDC and FTP participants and

estimates of γ a for the four age groups defined above. 8 The estimates of the general

program effects, in the next-to-last column, show substantial age variation, ranging from

-0.30 for the youngest age group to 2.79 for the oldest age group. For the sample as a

whole, the general program effect is -0.13. This overall estimate is consistent with the

finding that, as of mid-1997, the program had had little effect on aggregate months on aid

(Bloom et al. 1998). The small negative effects among the larger, younger age groups

cancel out the large positive effects among the smaller, older age groups, leaving a null

effect overall.

         Under the identifying assumptions spelled out in section IV, the estimate of γ 4

provides an estimate of τW I + τ SS , as shown in column (6) of Table 2. It suggests that the

financial work incentives and enhanced social services raised time on aid by an average

of 2.79 months. This is consistent with the discussion above, where we showed that a

reduction in the benefit reduction rate should increase welfare utilization. This estimate

has a t-statistic of 1.59.


8
         As noted above, the age thresholds for the two oldest groups depend on the length of the family's
time limit. Our classification scheme is based on an imputed time limit, which can be constructed for all
families. The actual time limit, which was determined by county welfare officials, is available only for the
FTP group. When we replace the imputation with the actual time limit for the FTP group, we obtain
similar results.


                                                     25
        Under the full set of identifying assumptions, we can estimate the specific time

limit effects as τˆ2TL = γˆ 2 − γˆ 4 and τˆ3TL = γˆ 3 − γˆ 4 . These simple difference-in-difference

estimates suggest that time limits reduce time on aid by 2.84 months on average among

mothers in the 3-to-11 age group. They reduce time on aid by only 0.40 months on

average among mothers in the 12-to-14/15 age group. This pattern is consistent with the

prediction from the theory: on average, mothers of younger children spend less time on

aid following the imposition of time limits than do mothers of older children. The t-

statistic for τ̂2TL is 1.75 and the t-statistic for τ̂3TL is less than one.

        Under our identifying assumptions, the difference in the age-specific effects of

time limits, τˆ2TL − τˆ3TL , is equal to the difference in the corresponding general program

effects, γˆ 2 − γˆ3 . The difference between γˆ 2 and γˆ3 is -2.44, with a standard error of

1.36. The t-statistic is thus -1.79. The estimates from this initial estimation exercise

follow a pattern that is consistent with the prediction from the theory, and the difference

in the effects of the time limit by age group is marginally significant.

        B. Regression Estimates

        In this section we use regression methods to estimate the effect of time limits on

welfare receipt under the full set of identifying assumptions. The regression approach

has two advantages over the simple difference-in-difference strategy. First, with a

regression we can control for personal characteristics of the experiment participants,

reducing unobservable error that contributes to the imprecision of the estimates. Second,

many of the specific treatments under FTP are actually time-varying. For example,

AFDC mothers who begin the sample period with children under three, who therefore are

exempt initially from the employment and training mandates of the program, become


                                                  26
subject to those mandates once their children turn three. Likewise, children of FTP

mothers who are less than 16 at the beginning of the experiment may eventually reach the

age at which the FTP time limit is no longer binding on their mothers. Mothers whose

youngest children turn 18 during the sample period become ineligible for aid; as a result,

we drop them from the sample starting with the month of their youngest child's 18th

birthday.

        We analyze monthly welfare utilization sequences, so the unit of observation is

the person-month. The model is given by:

y it = α0 + α1 A1 it + α2 A2 it + α3 A3 it + τ1 A1it Ei + τ TL
                                                            2 A2 it Ei + τ 3 A3it Ei + τ4 Ei + X it β + µi + εit
                                                                           TL




for i = 1,..., n and t = 1,..., 24, where n is the number of persons in the sample. The

dependent variable yit equals one if family i utilized welfare in period t, and equals zero

otherwise. The age group dummies are defined as Ajit = 1 if the youngest child in the ith

family falls into age group j at time t and Ajit = 0 otherwise, for j = 1,..., 4. The variable

Ei is the FTP, or experimental, dummy; Ei = 1 if family i is in the FTP group and Ei = 0 if

family i is in the AFDC group. The vector Xit includes a number of exogenous regressors

including the mother's age at time t; a dummy equal to one if she is black and zero

otherwise; a dummy equal to one if she had a three-year time limit and equal to zero if

she had a two-year limit; the number of children in the family; the mother's years of

schooling; the number of months in which the family had utilized welfare during the 24

months prior to random assignment; the number of quarters of employment during the

year preceding random assignment; and a vector of year dummies. Time is measured in

months from the date of random assignment, so t = 0 is the month of entry into the

program. The α, β, and τ terms are parameters to be estimated from the data. Under the


                                                     27
full set of identifying assumptions, this parameterization of the regression model

estimates the effects of time limits for age groups two and three, τ2TL and τ3TL , as the

coefficients on the interactions between the corresponding age group dummies and the

FTP dummy.

        The error term consists of two components, µi and εit. The former is a family

effect, which gives rise to dependence among the monthly observations from a particular

family. Since this groupwise dependence may cause conventional OLS standard errors to

be biased downwards, we employ a Huber-White covariance matrix estimator that

corrects for such dependence. It also accounts for heteroskedasticity, which is an

inherent property of the linear regression estimator when applied to a binary dependent

variable.

        Results of this specification are reported in Table 4. Before proceeding to the

estimates of the effects of time limits, it is useful to consider the coefficients of the other

regressors in the model. The second row of the table shows that recipients who received

36-month time limits have utilization rates that are 4.7 percentage points higher on

average than recipients with the shorter time limit. Black women have higher utilization

rates as well, which is consistent with previous work showing that African-American

women tend to have longer spells of welfare use than others (O'Neill, Bassi, and Wolf

1987). Neither the mother's age nor the number of children she has have much effect on

welfare utilization, but education, past welfare use, and past employment are strongly

related to current welfare utilization. The next three rows show a strong trend toward

declining welfare use over time. Also worth noting is the high level of significance of

most of the coefficients discussed so far, which would lead one to expect that the effects



                                              28
of time limits would be more precisely estimated by this regression model than by the

simple difference-in-difference approach.

       The coefficients on the age-group dummies show patterns of age dependence

within the AFDC sample. The base group is mothers whose youngest children are in the

oldest age group, so the coefficients on the age group dummies measure average

utilization rates relative to that group. Women with the youngest children are 9.4

percentage points more likely to receive aid on average. Women with youngest children

in the 3-to-11 age group are slightly less likely to utilize welfare. Mothers whose

youngest children are in the early teen age group are somewhat less likely to receive aid.

       Our primary interest centers on the coefficients of the interactions between the

age-group dummies and the FTP dummy. Since we include no interaction between the

oldest age-group dummy and the FTP dummy, age patterns within the FTP group are

estimated relative to the oldest group. This means that the coefficient on the FTP dummy

provides an estimate of τW I + τ SS ; the coefficient on the interaction between the youngest

age-group dummy and the FTP dummy provides an estimate of τ1TL + τ1ET ; and the

interactions between the FTP dummy and the second and third age-group dummies

provide estimates of τ2TL and τ3TL , respectively.

       The coefficient on the FTP dummy is positive, indicating that, under our

identifying assumptions, the combined effects of the financial work incentives and

enhanced social services act to raise welfare utilization. As noted above, this accords

with the prediction that higher disregards and lower tax rates raise welfare use by

providing greater incentives to combine welfare with work.




                                              29
         The coefficient on the interaction between the FTP dummy and the youngest age-

group dummy is negative and marginally significant. It shows that the combined effect

of time limits and employment and training mandates reduces aid utilization by 9.5

percentage points relative to families in the same age group who do not face these

constraints. Relative to the mean utilization rate of 51.5 percent, this amounts to a

reduction of 18 percent. 9

         The next coefficient, on the interaction between the FTP dummy and the second

age-group dummy, provides an estimate of the effect of time limits on families whose

youngest children are 3 to 11 years old. This effect is negative, as predicted by the

theory, and significant. Subject to the validity of our identifying assumptions, it shows

that time limits reduce monthly aid utilization by 12.1 percentage points on average

within this age group. This is a sizeable effect. Relative to the mean utilization rate, it

represents a 23 percent reduction. 10

         Under our identifying assumptions, the effect of time limits on families with

children between 12 and 14 or 15 is estimated by the interaction between the FTP

dummy and the third age-group dummy. This coefficient is negative but smaller in

absolute value than the coefficient for the 3-to-11 age group, as predicted by the theory.

It indicates that time limits reduce aid utilization by 3.4 percentage points among families

with youngest children in this age group.


9
          Summary statistics for all variables included in the regression model appear in Appendix Table 1.
10        This coefficient is larger in absolute value than the preceding coefficient, whereas the theory
predicts that the time limit by itself should have a greater negative effect, the younger the youngest child in
the family. Of course, the coefficient on the interaction between the FTP dummy and the youngest age-
group dummy estimates not just the effect of the time limit, but the sum of the effect of the time limit and
the employment and training mandate imposed on this group. The observed pattern in the results would be
consistent with the theory if the employment and training mandates were satisfied largely by participation
in unpaid training activities, which presumably would lead to increased welfare utilization.



                                                      30
       The exit hypothesis predicts that τ2TL < τ3TL < 0 . The difference τˆ2TL − τˆ3TL equals

-0.087 with a standard error of 0.040, yielding a t-statistic of -2.18. The regression

framework has improved the power of this test; it is now significant at the 5 percent level.

The data thus provide evidence that is supportive of the theory.

       This result is fairly robust to alternative specifications of the age relationship. As

one alternative, we split the 3-to-11 age group in two. The coefficient on the interaction

between the FTP dummy and the dummy for the resulting 3-to-5 age group was nearly

identical to that for the interaction between the FTP dummy and the dummy for the 6-to-

11 age group. Although the evidence in favor of the model would have been stronger if

the former coefficient had been more negative than the latter, both coefficients were

significantly different from the coefficient on the interaction between the FTP dummy

and the dummy for the 12 to 14/15 age group. Moreover, when we allowed the effect of

the youngest child's age to be linear between the ages of 3 and 14/15, the coefficient on

the interaction between the FTP dummy and age was positive (as predicted by the theory)

and significant.

       Subject to the validity of our identifying assumptions, our estimates suggest that

time limits substantially reduce welfare utilization among families with young children.

If we weight the estimated age-specific proportionate reductions in welfare utilization by

the fraction of cases in each age group, taking the coefficient on the interaction between

the FTP dummy and the youngest age group dummy as an estimate of the effect of the

time limit on the youngest age group, we calculate that time limits by themselves would

have led to a 19 percent reduction in welfare utilization among the FTP group. This is

particularly striking because our sample period extends only over the first 24 months



                                              31
after the time limit was imposed. This suggests that time limits had a negative effect on

welfare utilization, at least among families with younger children, well before any of the

families in our sample could have actually exhausted their benefits. In other words, time

limits appear to induce families to leave the welfare rolls well before they actually

exhaust their benefits.

       An issue of particular interest is whether these apparent responses to time limits

are concentrated among those recipients who are most able to find and keep a job. A

frequently voiced concern is that welfare reform will lead only the most able recipients to

leave the welfare rolls, with the result that only the most disadvantaged will remain on

aid long enough to actually exhaust their benefits (Duncan, Harris, and Boisjoly 1997;

Moffitt 1998; Sawhill and Zedlewski 1995). To address this question, we divide the

sample according to the length of the time limit received by the mother. Whereas two-

year time limits were the default, women with particularly low levels of education, high

levels of past welfare utilization, or low levels of past employment were assigned a three-

year limit. Since these factors are known to predict lengthy spells on aid (Pavetti 1995),

the length of the time limit provides a useful summary measure of relative disadvantage

within the welfare population.

       Regression results by the length of the family's time limit are presented in Table

5. These regressions include all of the variables reported in Table 4, but we report only

the coefficients on the FTP-age group interactions in order to save space. The

coefficients are fairly similar between the two groups. In both cases, τˆ2TL < τˆ3TL < 0.

Although dividing the sample has rendered most of the coefficients insignificant, the

estimates suggest that responses to time limits are not concentrated among the most



                                              32
work-ready recipients. The relatively disadvantaged group appears to be leaving the

welfare rolls at about the same rate as the relatively more advantaged group.

VI. Evidence on the Identifying Assumptions

       As we have stressed above, our estimates rely on a number of identifying

assumptions. In this section we provide evidence on the validity of some of those

restrictions. The first two involve the age-invariance of the effects of the financial work

incentives and the age-invariance of the effects of the social support services. There is

also a question of whether access to child care subsidies varied between the control and

treatment groups, contrary to the program design. We present some admittedly indirect

evidence on each of these assumptions in turn.

       A. Age-Invariance of the Effects of the Financial Work Incentives

       We first consider whether the effects of the financial work incentives are invariant

with respect to the age of the youngest child in the family. Our evidence stems from a

simple observation: in order for FTP's financial work incentives to affect the consumer's

income, the consumer must combine work and welfare. If, alternatively, she receives

welfare but does not work, then she simply receives the maximum welfare benefit, which

is the same under both AFDC and FTP and is labeled as G in Figure 2. If she works but

does not receive welfare (i.e., works more than h BFTP hours in Figure 2), then again she

receives the same income under both AFDC and FTP. Either way, her behavior is not

affected by the FTP work incentives. Only if she combines welfare and work does she

benefit from FTP's more generous income disregards. Put differently, if the financial

work incentives affect welfare use, then they must do so by affecting probability of




                                             33
combining welfare and work. Thus we test whether FTP affected the probability of

working and receiving welfare in a manner that varies by the age of the youngest child.

       Table 6 presents estimates from a regression in which the dependent variable is a

dummy equal to one if the sample member utilized welfare during a quarter in which she

was employed. Ideally, we would like to know whether she truly combined work and

welfare, that is, whether she worked and received welfare in the same month. Because

Florida’s Unemployment Insurance (UI) system does not reveal when during the quarter

the person worked, however, we cannot determine precisely whether parents were

receiving welfare at the same time they were working. Because we have quarterly

employment data, the unit of observation in Table 6 is the person-quarter, rather than the

person-month as in all of the other tables. The results reported in Table 6 are from a

regression that included all the variables shown in Table 4. Only the coefficients of the

FTP dummy and the FTP-age group interactions are shown in order to save space.

       Although the coefficient on the FTP dummy is only marginally significant, it is

positive as predicted by the theory, suggesting that the financial work incentives did

increase welfare utilization by increasing the probability that the typical FTP mother

combined work and welfare. More important for testing the age-invariance hypothesis,

however, are the interactions between the FTP dummy and the age-group dummies. The

coefficients on these terms vary as to their sign and are exceeded by their standard errors.

They are jointly insignificant as well, with an F-statistic of only 1.03. These estimates

suggest that the financial work incentives increase the probability of combining work and

welfare in a manner that is essentially uniform across the child-age distribution. Thus




                                             34
these results lend some support to the assumption that the effects of FTP's financial

incentives are age-invariant.

       B. Age-Invariance of the Effects of the Enhanced Social Services

       Regarding the effects of the enhanced social services, we noted that the most

likely alternative to age-invariance is that younger mothers would find the services more

valuable than others, and thus be more likely to remain on the welfare rolls in order to

take advantage of them. If so, then an interaction between the mother's age and the FTP

dummy should enter the model significantly and with a negative sign.

       Results are shown in column (1) of table 7, where the dependent variable is once

again the monthly welfare utilization dummy. With the exception of the added variables,

the specification used to estimate these models is exactly the same as that reported in

Table 4. In table 7 we save space by reporting only the newly added variables and the

interactions between the age group dummies and the FTP dummy.

       The coefficient on the interaction is indeed negative but it is no larger than its

standard error. In the second column, we include an interaction between the FTP dummy

and the mother's education on the grounds that the attractiveness of the enhanced training

services might vary by the mother's education level. In the third column, we include

interactions between the FTP dummy and variables measuring the extent of the mother's

employment over the year prior to random assignment and welfare receipt during the 24

months preceding random assignment. We include these variables as proxies for work-

readiness, on the grounds that the attractiveness of the enhanced training services might

vary according to the mother's general employability. None of these interaction terms is

significant. More importantly, although the coefficient on the FTP dummy is sensitive to




                                             35
the inclusion of these interactions, the key coefficients, τ̂2TL and τ̂3TL , are essentially the

same across the different specifications. Thus none of these tests yields evidence

contrary to our assumption that the effects of the enhanced social services are age-

invariant.

        There are two possible explanations for this result. The first has to do with the

manner in which aid recipients were assigned to training activities. These assignments

were made by caseworkers rather than being chosen by the recipient. Even with the

possibility of negotiation between the two parties, aid recipients may not always have

received their desired assignment. The second is that the enhanced training services may

not have been perceived by the FTP mothers as offering valuable opportunities to gain

skills. In this case, there would be no reason for younger, better educated, or more

employable mothers to take greater advantage of these services.

        More direct evidence on use of social services comes from MDRC’s Two-Year

Client Survey (TYCS), which was administered to a sample of about 600 mothers drawn

equally from the AFDC and FTP groups in early- to mid-1997. This survey included

questions about the use of education, training, and employment services by respondents

in the two years following random assignment. If enhanced social services provide a

greater opportunity to mothers with younger children, then FTP should have induced the

largest increase in use of these services for mothers with younger children. Results of the

survey indicate that it did not. Families did increase their use of services, but this

increase does not appear to be related to age of youngest child. For families with children

between 3 and 11 years of age, about 51 percent of the control group used such services

compared to about 73 percent of the program group, an increase of 22 percentage points.



                                                36
However, the increase for other families was quite similar – about 30 percentage points

for families with children 12 to 15 years old and about 28 percentage points for families

with children 16 to 18 years old. 11

         This is consistent with evidence from California’s GAIN program, which also

provided welfare mothers with enhanced employment and training services. As in FTP,

mothers believed to have few job skills were encouraged to increase their human capital

through adult education, while more job-ready mothers were required to enroll in

programs designed to help them apply for and obtain jobs. Also like FTP, GAIN was

evaluated by MDRC using a random assignment evaluation. According to data from that

evaluation, GAIN reduced welfare use by about the same amount for mothers with

younger children as for mothers with older children. In the first 3 years after random

assignment, mothers whose youngest child was 6 to 11 years old reduced their welfare

use by 0.80 quarters (out of a potential 12 calendar quarters over 3 years) and mothers

whose youngest child was older than age 11 reduced their welfare use by 0.68 quarters.

Although families with children younger than 6 were not required to participate in GAIN,

some welfare recipients with young children did volunteer for GAIN. Among mothers

with children between 4 and 5 years old, GAIN reduced welfare use by a similar amount,

0.79 calendar quarters. 12 While these reductions in welfare use are highly statistically

significant, differences across age groups are not.




11
          In addition to use of any activity, the survey contains information on individual activities such as
enrollment in adult basic education and attendance at job club. For no activity were the impacts of FTP
statistically significant different by age of youngest child.

       C. Equal Access to Child Care Subsidies Between FTP and AFDC Groups

       The potential problem regarding access to child care subsidies arises due to

funding shortages which may have caused cutbacks in the subsidies available to AFDC

mothers. Our strategy to investigate this problem makes use of the fact that any such

cutbacks had been restored by the beginning of 1996. Those cutbacks that took place

arose due to general budgetary limitations, and those limitations had ended by the end of

1995. Thus any differences in child care subsidies between the AFDC and FTP groups

existed only in 1994 and 1995. After 1995, this particular treatment did not vary between

the experimental and control groups.

       Thus we ask whether AFDC mothers had higher utilization rates relative to FTP

mothers in 1994 and 1995 than in 1996 and 1997. It would be damaging to our

identification strategy if increased welfare usage within the AFDC group during this time

showed substantial negative age dependence. To address this issue, we first add to the

regression an interaction between a pre-1996 dummy, equal to one in 1994 and 1995 and

equal to zero in 1996 and 1997, and a control group dummy, equal to one if Ei = 0 and

equal to zero if Ei = 1. We then interact this term with the age group dummies to allow

for age-dependence.

       The first column of table 8 reports the coefficient on the interaction between the

pre-1996 dummy and the control group dummy. It indicates that, contrary to expectation,

AFDC mothers actually were less likely to utilize welfare, relative to FTP mothers, in the

early part of the sample period. Results in the second column show no significant age

pattern. Moreover, the coefficients of the age group/experimental dummy interactions

are largely unchanged by the addition of these variables. To the extent that there were




                                            38
differential care subsidies between the AFDC and FTP groups during this time, they did

not lead to greater welfare use on the part of AFDC mothers, nor did the effects of any

shortfalls exhibit an age-dependent pattern. Thus the evidence against our assumption

that child care subsidies were effectively equal between groups is fairly weak.

       Further evidence on this point comes from the TYCS, which was administered to

a sample of mothers drawn equally from the AFDC and FTP groups in early- to mid-

1997.13 Although this survey asked no specific questions about child care utilization, it

did ask a number of questions pertaining to links between child care and work. The

strongest evidence from the TYCS suggesting that there were important differences in

child care subsidies comes from questions posed to women who were neither working

nor looking for work at the time of the TYCS. Among FTP mothers, 7 percent indicated

that an inability to find or afford child care was the reason for their (non-)employment

status. Among AFDC mothers, the corresponding proportion was 17 percent. Since only

20 percent of the FTP mothers, and 27 percent of the AFDC mothers, were neither

working nor seeking employment, however, this means that only 1.5 percent of the FTP

group, and 4.5 percent of the AFDC group, were neither working nor looking for work

primarily due to child care problems.

       Other data from the survey, however, are even less suggestive of important

differences in the level of child care support between groups. One question asked people

who worked less than 30 hours per week why they were not working full time. Five

percent of the AFDC group cited child care as the reason. In the FTP group, the

corresponding fraction was four percent. Another question focused on women who had

worked at some point since program intake, but were not working at the time of the




                                            39
TYCS because they had quit their job. AFDC and FTP mothers were equally likely to

say that they had quit for reasons related to child care.

        In view of the prominence that was given to discussions of child care shortfalls in

the original FTP evaluation (Bloom et al, 1998), it is worthwhile to discuss how these

shortfalls could have had such seemingly little effect on our results. We offer two

possible explanations. First, as noted in the original evaluation report, it took some time

for the FTP program to start running at full efficiency. Thus start-up issues may have

affected the delivery of child care services to FTP participants at the same time that

budgetary shortfalls affected service delivery to AFDC recipients.

        Second, many of the recipients may have had access to free child care, in which

case they would have been unaffected by the availability of subsidies. Although there are

no data on child care utilization for the FTP program, the evaluators of an earlier Florida

welfare reform experiment found that 55 percent of aid recipients had access to free care

from friends or relatives, and that only 15 percent utilized any child care subsidies at all

(Kemple and Haimson 1994). If participants in the FTP program were similarly situated,

then one might expect differences in child care subsidies between the AFDC and FTP

groups to have little effect on welfare receipt.

VII. Conclusions

        One of the important contributions of this paper is the theoretical model.

Essentially, we have taken the static model of welfare utilization, which long served as

the basis for analyzing welfare incentives under AFDC, and generalized it to incorporate

the effects of time limits. The solution to this model reveals that the consumer is most

reluctant to utilize welfare at the beginning of her period of eligibility, but that she


13
        This paragraph and the next borrow heavily from Bloom, et al. (1997, pp. 57-59)

                                                  40
becomes less reluctant as time passes. This has a number of implications for the age

distribution of children leaving and entering the welfare rolls. First, upon the imposition

of time limits, families with younger (youngest) children should be more likely to exit

welfare than families with older (youngest) children. Second, families with younger

(youngest) children should be less likely to enter the welfare rolls than families with older

(youngest) children. Together, this implies that the reduction in welfare expenditures that

results from the imposition of time limits will fall disproportionately on families while

their children are young. For a number of reasons, this result may have substantive

implications for the well-being of poor children.

       Using data from Florida's Family Transition Program, which imposed time limits

in 1994 under welfare reform waivers, we attempt to test the first of these empirical

implications. The data do accord with the theory, in that families with younger

(youngest) children do spend less time on welfare after the imposition of time limits than

families with older (youngest) children. Indeed, our estimates suggest that time limits by

themselves resulted in a substantial decrease in welfare utilization that was concentrated

among families with young children.

       A number of assumptions were necessary to isolate the effects of time limits from

other features of FTP, however. Tests of those assumptions generally failed to reject, but

the tests were indirect. As a result, our empirical results should be taken as suggestive

rather than definitive. An important agenda item for future research is to better isolate

the effect of this new and important feature of the U.S. welfare system.

                       Appendix: Proof of the Rising Reservation Wage Proposition

            To begin we adopt some simplifying notation. Let

                 ~ ( S )) ,
Ft ( S t ) ≡ F ( w                                                                                  (A1)
                   t  t



Ft ( S t ) = 1 − Ft ( S t ) , and

                                                      ~ ( S )] + F ( S ) E[ v( w ,0) | w > w
Eut ( S t ) = Ft ( S t ) E[ v( wt (1 − τ ), G) | wt ≤ w                                    ~ ( S )] . (A2)
                                                        t  t      t   t         t       t   t   t



Equation (A1) is simply notation for the probability of utilizing welfare in period t, given

a remaining benefit stock of St. Equation (A2) defines expected current-period utility at

time t as a function of the remaining benefit stock at time t. Finally, let

E[(u t ' ( S t ' ) | S t ]

denote the expectation of current-period utility at time t' as a function of the remaining

benefit stock at t', given that the consumer had St units of benefits at time t and has

followed the optimal reservation wage strategy in periods t, t+1, ..., t'-1.

            Our objective is to establish that

EVt +1 ( S t ) − EVt +1 ( St − 1) > EVt + 2 ( S t ) − EVt + 2 ( S t − 1) ,

or equivalently, that

EVt +1 ( S t ) − EVt + 2 ( S t ) > EVt +1 ( S t − 1) − EVt + 2 ( S t − 1) .                         (A3)

With the definitions above, we can write

                   T
EVt ( S t ) = ∑ ρ s −t E[u s ( S s ) | S t ] .
                  s= t



Then since EVt ( S t ) gives the maximized value of the consumer's problem starting from

period t with benefit stock St, we have

EVt +1 ( S t ) ≥ EVt + 2 ( S t ) + ρT −t −1 E[uT ( S T ) | S t +1 = S t ] .




                                                              45
Applying similar logic to EVt + 2 ( S t − 1) , we have

EVt + 2 ( S t − 1) ≥ EVt +1 ( S t − 1) − ρT − t −1 E[uT ( S T ) | S t +1 = S t − 1] .

Therefore a sufficient condition for (A3) is

E[uT ( S T ) | S t +1 = S t ] > E[u T ( S T ) | S t +1 = S t − 1] .                               (A4)

         To evaluate E[uT ( S T ) | S t +1 = S t ] , use the recursion formula and the reservation

wage property to write EVt +1 ( S t ) in terms of E[u s ( S s ) | S t +1 = S t ] for s = t+1, t+2,...,T

and collect terms in T. E[uT ( S T ) | S t +1 = S t − 1] can be evaluated the same way.

Simplifying the resulting expressions, using the fact that EuT ( ST ) = EuT (1) for all ST > 1

since benefits have no value after period T, shows that (A4) holds if and only if

EuT (0) + [1-P(utilizing welfare in St periods)] [ Eu T (1) − EuT ( 0)] >

     EuT (0) + P(utilizing welfare in fewer than St -1 periods) [ Eu T (1) − EuT ( 0)] .          (A5)

Expected utility in the final period is equal to EuT (0) , expected utility in the absence of

any remaining benefits, plus the product of the probability of having at least one unit of

benefits at the beginning of period T and the difference in expected utility from having at

least one unit of benefits and having none. The last term is given by [ Eu T (1) − EuT ( 0)] .

Beginning with St units of benefits, the probability of having at least one unit remaining

at the beginning of period T is one minus of probability of utilizing benefits in St periods.

Beginning with St - 1 units of benefits, the probability of having at least one unit

remaining is equal to the probability of utilizing benefits in fewer than St -1 periods.

Simplifying and rearranging terms, (A5) can be re-written as

P(utilizing welfare in St periods) < 1-P(utilizing welfare in fewer than St -1 periods)

or



                                                            46
P(utilizing welfare in St periods) < P(utilizing welfare in St -1 or more periods),

establishing the result.
