Increasing Hours Worked: Moonlighting Responses to a Large Tax Reform

JEL No. H2,J01

                                            ABSTRACT

Moonlighting is increasingly popular in OECD countries, with 5 to 10% of workers holding two
or more jobs. However, little is known about the responsiveness of moonlighting to financial
incentives due to the lack of identifying variation. This paper studies a unique reform in Germany
that allowed workers to hold small secondary jobs tax-free, decreasing the marginal tax rate by
between 19.5 to 66pp. I show that the reform resulted in a dramatic increase in moonlighting that
was not offset by reductions in primary earnings, and that hours constraints is the key determinant
of moonlighting.

     Income tax cuts are a popular approach to increasing working hours of em-
ployed individuals. Recent empirical evidence, however, suggests that this margin
often appears to be unresponsive even to large financial incentives.1 A common
explanation for such weak responses is hours constraints: many jobs only offer a
fixed number of hours, and employers are often unwilling to negotiate changes to
the standard hours offered.2
     Of course, an alternative way for workers to raise their hours is to hold one or
more jobs concurrently with their main job. Currently, multiple job holding, or
moonlighting, rates in OECD countries range from 5% of the working population
in the United States to over 10% in the UK, with disproportionately higher
rates among low-income individuals. The recent proliferation of alternative work
arrangements and flexible-contract job opportunities, many facilitated by digital
platforms such as Uber and TaskRabbit, have the potential to raise these shares
considerably.3
     Little is known, however, about the responsiveness of moonlighting to fi-
nancial incentives or how it varies across income groups: the vast majority of
tax systems do not differentiate between primary and secondary employments,
and simply apply the tax schedule to the sum of earnings. Therefore, changes
in marginal income or payroll tax rates leave the relative wages of primary and
secondary jobs unchanged, providing little scope for identification. This is unfor-
tunate because differential tax treatment of primary and secondary jobs may have
desirable distributional, incentive and revenue consequences. For example, moon-
lighting tax breaks may improve targeting if secondary jobs are predominantly
held by low-income individuals. Furthermore, cutting a low-income worker's sec-
ondary tax rate could provide an equivalent incentive to cutting the worker's
primary tax rate, while at the same time protecting the tax revenue collected on
primary earnings.
     Motivated by these gaps in knowledge, this paper provides the first plausibly

causal estimates of secondary job responses to financial incentives and offers new
insights into the determinants of moonlighting by studying a unique reform in
Germany. Since April 2003, part-time and full-time workers earning more than
e400 per month have been allowed to hold a secondary job tax-free, if earnings
from the secondary employment do not exceed e400 per month. Full income and
social security taxes are due on secondary earnings of e401 or more, resulting in
a large notch at e400.4 This reform has thus exempted small secondary earnings
from employee social security tax and income tax, with total savings ranging
between 19.5% and 66%, depending on one's marginal tax bracket. Using admin-
istrative data on a 2% representative panel sample of wage earners in Germany,
I find four results.
     First, I show that the reform dramatically increased the number of low-paid
secondary jobs. The secondary job holding rate rose sharply after the reform
and continued to grow. Within the first 2 years, the share of individuals holding
secondary employments increased from around 2.3% just prior to the reform to
5%. By 2010, nearly 7% of workers held secondary jobs. Approximately a quarter
of these jobs represented at-the-threshold e400 jobs.
     Second, I find that the observed increase in moonlighting represents a real
increase in working hours and is not driven by shifting of primary working hours
into secondary jobs. I show that primary earnings of individuals with new sec-
ondary jobs did not fall as a result of the reform. While some individuals report
having both regular employment and a tax-free secondary job at the same estab-
lishment, such reports are rare and result in higher combined earnings relative
to the previous year. The increased prevalence of e400-or-less jobs also did not
come at the expense of higher-paid secondary jobs, although some conversion has
occurred. Finally, the increased supply of secondary job workers did not result
in fewer job opportunities for low-income individuals; instead, the number of
small-earnings jobs increased accordingly.
     Third, I show that women, foreign-born individuals, West-Germans, indi-
viduals with no vocational training and in lower-paid primary jobs are over-
represented among moonlighters. For example, individuals with primary earnings
   4
     Employers pay social security taxes regardless of the size of workers' earnings, but the
rates differ slightly (see Section 1.1).



                                             3
between e400-e1000 per month are nearly 2.5 more likely to hold a secondary
job than individuals with primary earnings of e3000-e4000. Furthermore, low-
income individuals responded more strongly to the reform, despite enjoying a
lower tax break.
     Fourth, I find that most secondary jobs are held in low-wage service oc-
cupations and industries: cleaners represent over 20% of secondary jobs, while
salespersons, waiters, drivers, warehousemen, watchmen, and office workers cover
between 5% to 10% each. Importantly, these secondary job occupations do not
vary with individuals' primary earnings: high-income individuals' secondary jobs
are held in similar industries and occupations as low-income individuals. Small
secondary jobs are held at firms that are similar to firms that employ low-income
workers in general. Together, these two pieces of evidence suggest that secondary
job workers are likely to be paid between e7-e10 per hour in their secondary
jobs (Tazhitdinova (2020)).
     To shed light on the economic determinants of moonlighting, I calibrate a
parsimonious labor supply model with hours constraints which yields two in-
sights. First, only individuals whose working hours are lower than their ideal
hours by 25% or more could have been interested in moonlighting prior to the
reform. Second, when the secondary tax rate is zero, secondary jobs become
attractive to individuals with ideal primary hours, as long as they can obtain a
secondary wage similar to their primary wage but not otherwise. However, even
a small deviation from ideal primary hours makes tax-free low-wage secondary
jobs attractive. Since most secondary jobs are of the low-wage type, and since
individuals did not reduce primary earnings upon taking up a secondary job,
the theoretical predictions imply that hours constraints are the primary cause
of moonlighting. Approximately 30-60% of individuals hold secondary jobs for a
year or less, suggesting that most individuals experience temporary constraints
but a nontrivial share of workers experience long-term constraints.
     To gage the economic importance of the estimated responses, I calculate the
approximate fiscal costs and benefits of the reform. I find that the package of
reforms "paid for itself," resulting in a net fiscal surplus due to increased collection
of employer taxes. In 2005, each newly created secondary job generated a small
revenue surplus of e25 or less, increasing to e25-e75 by 2010. However, this fiscal


                                           4
outcome was in large part driven by increased employer tax rate and increased
secondary earnings due to the threshold increase: if one holds mini-job earnings
and tax rates constant at 2002 levels, the revenue gains are significantly smaller or
negative. Importantly, if one calculates the fiscal outcomes based on the causal
estimates described below, the reform resulted in revenue losses in 2005 and
negligible revenue gains in 2010. While low-income workers are overrepresented
among moonlighters, the majority of the tax break went to mid- and higher-
income individuals. However, these tax breaks were well targeted in the sense
that they were given to constrained individuals, as discussed earlier.
     Finally, I complement the descriptive analysis with a causal estimation. Es-
timating the magnitude of the causal effect is challenging because the reform
affected most individuals in Germany. I use several approaches. I start by ac-
counting for aggregate changes that may affect the attractiveness or availability
of small secondary jobs. Next, I use micro data and two plausible control groups
to estimate the magnitude of response. Since none of these approaches present an
ideal quasi-experiment, the estimated participation elasticities should be inter-
preted as "suggestive" of true magnitude of causal responses to the 2003 reform.
All approaches yield similar results, suggesting that approximately half of the
increase in moonlighting can be attributed to individual responses. Considering
that most eligible workers saved between 19.5 to 66 percent on their combined
social security and income taxes, these responses translate into elasticities of par-
ticipation of 0.35-1.48 within 2 years of the reform, and 0.55-2.06 in the long run,
depending on primary earnings. These elasticities are significantly larger than
participation elasticities in primary employment, which are estimated in other
settings to range between zero and 0.25 for men and between 0 and 0.35 for
women (Blundell and Macurdy (1999); Blundell et al. (2011); McClelland and
Mok (2012)).
     The findings of this paper are subject to four caveats. First, the long term
results are more sensitive to unrelated shocks, and thus are less reliable. Second,
increased secondary job holding rates could be due to reclassification of under-
the-table jobs into secondary mini-jobs. While I cannot rule out this channel,
such conversions are not obviously attractive because employers must pay a 21-
30% social security tax on mini-job earnings. Furthermore, about a quarter of


                                         5
secondary jobs are held at firms with 50 employees or more, which are less prone
to cheating. Third, the increased availability of small secondary jobs could be
due to the splitting of full-time jobs. Such splitting is unlikely to be large because
secondary jobs are concentrated in industries that predominantly hire part-time
workers. Nevertheless, the precise origin of new secondary jobs is outside the
scope of this paper. Fourth, the studied policy change was part of a larger package
of Hartz reforms. It is unlikely that the other policy changes ­ that were primarily
aimed at unemployed individuals ­ affected moonlighting directly: we observe no
discontinuous increases in moonlighting except in April 2003. Nonetheless, these
reforms may have had indirect effects; for example, by making small jobs more
readily available. My estimates suggest that at least half of the observed increase
in moonlighting was driven by labor supply rather than labor demand responses.
To derive this bound I compare increases in the number of low-paid primary and
secondary jobs, and find a much smaller increase in the number of e0-to-e400
primary jobs as compared to similar secondary jobs.
     The results of this paper are policy-relevant for the following reasons. First,
secondary tax breaks may result in a cost-effective approach to incentivizing
longer working hours for low-income employed individuals. Cutting one's sec-
ondary tax rate provides an equivalent incentive as cutting one's primary tax
rate but protects the tax revenue collected on primary earnings. This is the case
because tax revenue depends not only on the elasticity of earnings and the mag-
nitude of tax changes, but also on the income base the tax applies to. Moreover,
lower moonlighting tax rates adhere to the Ramsey rule, ensuring that more elas-
tic secondary earnings are taxed less than inelastic primary earnings. Finally, if
secondary jobs are limited to low-wage employments, or if the magnitude of the
tax break is limited, moonlighting jobs will only be attractive to low-income indi-
viduals or individuals who experience hours constraints, thus further improving
the targeting of tax incentives. However, secondary tax breaks are not a viable
policy for incentivizing the labor supply of lowest income individuals, simply
because having a secondary job necessitates having a primary employment.
     Second, the findings show that moonlighters are constrained in their choice
of primary hours (Saez et al. (2012)), and that hours constraints are the pri-
mary cause of moonlighting (Shishko and Rostker (1976); Paxson and Sicherman


                                          6
(1996)). Most individuals moonlight at low-skilled service jobs that are unlikely
to be appealing to workers wishing to expand their skill sets (Lundborg (1995);
Renna and Oaxaca (2006); Panos et al. (2014)). In this study, lack of information
is unlikely to be the key friction restricting workers' hour choices, as many work-
ers took advantage of moonlighting tax breaks, yet did not reduce their primary
earnings. Instead, constraints may be driven by workers' inability to negotiate
desirable hours with the employer or by career concerns.
     Third, the results demonstrate that moonlighting responses cannot be easily
inferred from studies of primary earnings responses. Instead, the large observed
responses in this study are more consistent with recent experimental evidence
that finds large intertemporal or compensated elasticities for individuals with
highly flexible working hours (Angrist et al. (2017), Mas and Pallais (2019)).5 In
contrast, the secondary jobs studied in this paper are of the "traditional" part-
time job type and are likely to offer less flexibility. Individuals who work in a
popular secondary occupation as their primary job exhibit higher moonlighting
rates (conditional on their earnings level), suggesting that job access is important.
Therefore, if flexible work arrangements become more prevalent and decrease the
fixed costs of finding appropriate secondary jobs, we may observe an increase in
the take up of secondary employment (Jackson et al. (2017); Katz and Krueger
(2019a); Katz and Krueger (2019b)).6
     Finally, the results highlight the importance of reducing evasion channels
when designing tax rules. The moonlighting reform in Germany led to genuine in-
   5
       The only other study that estimates elasticity of secondary earnings to taxes is
O'Connell (1979), which finds combined intensive-extensive elasticities of between 0.43 and
0.56. O'Connell (1979) treated primary income as fixed and used a simple variation in marginal
tax rates to estimate responses. Thus, the study is likely to suffer from omitted variable bias
(Weber (2014)). Among a number of recent studies of the 2003 reform (Gudgeon and Trenkle
(2017); Tazhitdinova (2020); Galassi (2018); Carrillo-Tudela et al. (2018)), only Carrillo-Tudela
et al. (2018) provides descriptive analysis of moonlighting. Caliendo and Wrohlich (2010) use
variation in Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) interview months to study the effect on sec-
ondary earnings and find a small increase in secondary employment among males. However,
their identification approach does not allow observing responses beyond the first year of the
reform, and the analysis is limited by the small sample sizes.
   6
      In the studied setting, all moonlighters had regular jobs that provided them with basic
social insurance benefits, including health insurance, alleviating the need for these benefits
through secondary employment. It is unclear whether such jobs would be attractive to individ-
uals not covered by social insurance schemes.



                                               7
creases in working hours because cheating through job splitting was too costly. In
contrast, detaxation of overtime hours in France in 2007 did not increase working
hours because workers were able to easily manipulate hour declarations (Cahuc
and Carcillo (2014)). Furthermore, moonlighting responses can be particularly
large if the secondary job opportunities are from self-employment, making them
harder to tax (Saez et al. (2012)). For example, in the U.S., even though most
digital platform earnings are third-party reported via Forms 1099-K and 1099-
Misc, these earnings can be offset with self-reported business expenses that are
hard to verify (Carrillo et al. (2017); Slemrod et al. (2017); Tazhitdinova (2018)).
Hence, lower effective tax rates combined with flexible working schedules could
make secondary jobs particularly attractive.


1       Institutional Setting and Data
1.1     Institutional Setting
There are two broad categories of employment in Germany: regular jobs subject
to income and social security taxes, and mini-jobs, also known as marginal jobs,
that are exempt from income tax and the employee portion of social security
taxes. From 1999 until April 2003, these mini-jobs were limited to jobs in which
employees earned less than e325 per month and worked less than 15 hours per
week. All other jobs were considered regular, so were subject to the 21% employee
social security tax and to income taxes, with a marginal tax rate ranging from 0 to
53% depending on own and spousal earnings. If individuals held secondary jobs,
the e325 threshold applied to the sum of earnings. Thus, for individuals with
multiple employments, income and social security taxes were calculated based on
the sum of primary and secondary earnings. Employer social security tax liability
barely changed at the e325 threshold, decreasing from the 22% "mini-job tax"
to the 21% regular employer social security tax.
     The Hartz II reforms introduced on April 1, 2003 increased the mini-job
threshold from e325 to e400 and abolished the hour constraint.7 Crucially, the
    7
      Tazhitdinova (2020) studies primary earnings responses to the mini-job threshold. The
distribution of primary earnings and the effect of the threshold increase on primary earnings
are shown in the Appendix Figure A.2.


                                             8
reform made mini-jobs attractive to individuals with regular jobs, by allowing
them to hold one secondary mini-job tax free. Therefore, a worker who earned
more than e400 per month could now obtain a secondary mini-job and pay no
income or social security taxes on his secondary earnings, as long as these earnings
did not exceed e400. Secondary employments that earned over e400 per month
were subject to the usual income and social security taxes on the full amount.
However, the rules allowed workers to occasionally exceed the mini-job threshold.
Employer tax on mini-job wages increased from 22% to 25% in 2003, and further
to 30% in 2006. Employer social security tax, on the other hand, remained at
21% until 2006, at which point it decreased to 19.5%.
     From the perspective of taxes, mini-jobs and regular jobs are similar for
employers. However, several recent studies show that mini-job workers receive
smaller fringe benefits ­ e.g. sick day pay, vacation pay, bonuses, etc. (Bachmann
et al. (2012); Wippermann (2012); Tazhitdinova (2020)); for these reasons, mini-
jobs may be attractive to firms. Finally, Germany did not have a universal
minimum wage until 2015, and while industry-specific minimum wages cover
some workers, they rarely apply to mini-job workers. For more details on the
institutional setting and data, see Appendix A.
     The policy change studied in this paper was part of a larger package of
Hartz reforms implemented in 2003-2005.8 These reforms were introduced with
the goal of reducing unemployment and increasing the efficiency and flexibility
of the German labor market. In addition to the changes described above, the
reforms re-organized employment agencies and the services they provide, reduced
unemployment insurance durations and benefits, relaxed dismissal rules, provided
start-up subsidies for entrepreneurs and liberalized the temporary help sector.
These changes were unlikely to affect the attractiveness of moonlighting because
unemployed individuals were the main target of the reform. However, Hartz
reforms may have changed the availability of small secondary jobs, e.g. because
of laxer dismissal rules.

     For a comprehensive review of the Hartz reforms see Jacobi and Kluve (2006) and Ebbing-
haus and Eichhorst (2006), a brief summary is available in Appendix A.1.




                                             9
1.2    Data
I use the weakly anonymous Sample of Integrated Labor Market Biographies
1975-2010 (SIAB), which provides information on employment, job search and
receipt of unemployment benefits for a 2% sample of wage earners in Germany
(vom Berge et al. (2013)). I focus on the years 1999-2010 because the infor-
mation on mini-job employment is only available beginning in second quarter of
1999. Employment histories consist of end-of-the-year notifications, along with
employer notifications that are submitted when an employee is hired or termi-
nated or when an employment is interrupted. Thus, if no changes are made to
the employment relationship, only one notification is recorded per year. Other-
wise, multiple notifications, precise to the day, are recorded. The data provides
demographic and establishment variables such as gender, age, citizenship sta-
tus, education, occupation, economic activity of the establishment, number of
employees at the establishment, and the median wage. Unfortunately, marital
status and number of children are known only for benefit recipients and those
engaged in job search, while wage and working hours data is not available at all.
Finally, the data does not provide information on self-employment, but this is
largely irrelevant because the studied tax change applies to wage earners only.
     I restrict the sample to individuals in regular and mini-jobs; jobs of other
types, e.g. trainees, are dropped. I study job holding behavior at the quarterly
level. For each quarter, the observation with the largest monthly earnings is
recorded as the main job, and the second highest earnings employment is recorded
as the second job. Therefore, by construction, primary jobs generate the high-
est earnings. To ensure that the identified secondary employment represents an
actual secondary job rather than a temporary job overlap due to job-switching,
I proceed as follows. For each quarter I identify the employment of the longest
duration. I then delete any job records within that quarter that do not overlap
with this employment by at least 15 days. For months of continuous employ-
ment, this procedure identifies the main job and the highest-paid secondary job
held during that month. In months of job switches, employment spells of the
longest duration are recorded. This procedure, therefore, could lead to omission
of very short spells of multiple-job holding in between main jobs. The results,
however, are not sensitive to the choice of the minimum overlap period, which

                                       10
is not surprising considering an average individual works at a secondary job for
approximately 8 months.
     Section 3 provides in-depth descriptive analysis of secondary mini-job holders
and the jobs they hold. Summary statistics and further data details are available
in Appendix A.3.


2     Theoretical Framework
To better understand the incentives generated by the 2003 reform, consider a
simple theoretical framework inspired by Shishko and Rostker (1976). Consider
an individual maximizing utility function

                               1+1/
          A          h1 + h2
 U =c-                                 s.t.   c = (1 - 1 )w1 h1 + (1 - 2 )w2 h2 , (1)
       1 + 1/           A

with hi and wi denoting working hours and wages in job i, respectively. An
unconstrained individual will always hold one job that pays the highest after-
tax wage. Hence, if (1 - 1 )w1 > (1 - 2 )w2 then optimal working hours are
(h                          
  1 , h2 ) = (Aw1 (1 - 1 ) , 0) and vice versa. Therefore, secondary jobs are only
attractive to constrained individuals whose actual hours h     ^ 1 are lower than the
desired hours h   1.
      Now consider a policy change that exempts small secondary jobs from tax
rates, i.e. let 2 = 0 as long as w2 h2  K and w1 h1  M , where K and M
are some government-chosen thresholds. When (1 - 1 )w1 > w2 , unconstrained
individuals will continue to be uninterested in secondary jobs, while constrained
individuals may obtain a new secondary job or increase their secondary earnings
as long as the thresholds allow it.
      Individuals with (1 - 1 )w1 < w2 would ideally like to convert all primary
earnings into tax-free secondary jobs but will not be able to do so because of
the threshold restrictions. The optimal response of such individuals would then
be to take advantage of the policy by substituting some primary earnings with
secondary ones. In the simplest case ­ when the pre-reform earnings exceeded
M +Kw      1
          w2
             ­ the ideal strategy is to hold a secondary job that pays K and reduce
primary hours by K/w2 .


                                         11
     The empirical evidence in Section 3.2 will show, however, that such substitu-
tion may be undesirable or infeasible. For example, many primary jobs are salary
positions that do not allow for hour flexibility or provide workers with important
benefits that secondary jobs may not. Alternatively, reducing one's primary work-
ing hours may be too costly if this can negatively affect career growth, or if the
tax rules change frequently. In this case, individuals may still obtain a secondary
job while keeping their primary hours unchanged if doing so increases utility, i.e.
      ^ 1 , h2 ) - U (h
if U (h               ^ 1 , 0) > 0. Using 2nd order Taylor expansion of f (x) = x1+1/
around x = h     ^ 1 we find

                                                      -1/

U (h               ^ 1 , 0) > 0 being satisfied in the setting of the 2003 reform. I con-
sider individuals with primary wages w1 of between e1000 to e4000 per month
and choose the ability parameter A, so that their ideal working hours are h        1 = 173
hours per month (or 40 hours per week). I then assume that individuals' actual
hours are h   ^ 1 = (1 - )h , so that  measures the deviation from ideal primary
                               1
hours. I consider secondary jobs paying e400 per month, and assume that sec-
         9

ondary wage w2 is the lower of e9 per hour (a typical wage in mini-jobs, see
Tazhitdinova (2020)) or an individual's primary wage.10 Tax rates 1 are based
on the 2002 tax schedule and individuals' optimal earnings w1 h        1 . I then calculate
                                                        ^           ^
the range of elasticities  for which condition U (h1 , h2 ) - U (h1 , 0) > 0 is satisfied.
     The results of this exercise are summarized in Figure 1 and provide two key
insights. First, when secondary jobs are taxed at the same rate as primary jobs,
e9-wage secondary jobs are not attractive unless working hours are too low, e.g.

i.e. whenever  < 1 ­ the first derivative of U (h               ^ 1 , 0) with respect to  is positive,
implying that secondary jobs are more attractive to individuals with suboptimal primary hours.

      Appendix Figure B.3 shows equivalent results but for secondary jobs with w2 = w1 .
Secondary job holding becomes attractive to slightly constrained individuals if they can obtain
a wage similar to their primary job wage.

percent for an individual with elasticity  = 0.25.           Elasticity range restricted to
  (0, 1).       Parameter A is chosen such that each individual's optimal hours are
173 hours per month. The following parameters are used:  = 0, 0.10, 0.25, w1 =
e1000/173,...,e4000/173, h ^ 1 = (1 - )173, w2 = min{w1 , 9}, h2 = e400/w2 .


less than 75% of ideal hours. Therefore, only individuals who work substantially
fewer than optimal hours at the primary job will hold secondary jobs prior to
2003, and these jobs are likely to offer a wage similar to their primary wage.
     Second, when the secondary tax rate is zero, secondary jobs become attractive
to individuals with ideal primary hours as long as they can obtain a secondary
wage similar to their primary wage, even if primary earnings cannot be reduced
concurrently. These individuals will not be interested in secondary jobs if the
secondary wage is too low. However, even a small deviation from ideal primary
hours makes low-wage secondary jobs attractive. When primary hours are lower
than the ideal hours by 25% or more, all individuals find e9-per-hour secondary
jobs attractive.

                                                                                                                                   13
     These results imply that we can gage the presence and magnitude of hours
constraints by observing individuals' job choices. Highly constrained individuals
will hold a secondary job before and after the reform. Individuals with smaller
hour constraints will be willing to take up a low-wage secondary job after the
reform. Individuals with primary hours equal to h     1 but who cannot or do not
want to reduce their primary hours will only be interested in secondary jobs
with similar wage levels as their primary jobs. Finally, completely unconstrained
individuals will reduce their primary hours upon take up of a secondary job.
     Note that constraints need not be of permanent nature. For example, an
individual who experiences a negative income shock may want to earn higher in-
come temporarily. If such an individual is unable to increase his primary working
hours, he may increase his earnings by moonlighting. The results in this section
do not account for non-monetary benefits of moonlighting or potentially high
fixed costs of obtaining a secondary employment. Naturally, the former will tend
to increase moonlighting rates, while the latter will decrease them.


3     Descriptive Evidence
3.1    Take Up of Secondary Jobs
To explore how moonlighting rates changed from 1999 to 2010, Figure 2 shows the
percent of individuals who held secondary jobs paying less than e400 per month,
e400-e1000, or more than e1000 over time. Few individuals moonlighted in
Germany prior to the reform ­ just over 2% held secondary jobs at the beginning
of 2003, and the majority of these employments earned less than e400. Figure 2
shows that secondary jobs with earnings below e400 increased sharply after the
reform and kept growing until about 2009. In the last year of data, 2010, roughly
7% of individuals held secondary jobs. Following the predictions of Section 2, the
relatively low levels of moonlighting ­ despite large tax savings ­ suggest that
either the available secondary jobs offer wages that are too low, or the fixed costs
of moonlighting are too high.
     Importantly, Figure 2 shows that the increase in the number of secondary
mini-jobs cannot be explained by the reduction in the number of secondary jobs

Notes : This figure shows the share of individuals who hold secondary jobs pay-

e1000 per month, among all wage earners with primary earnings of e400 or
more.     The vertical red line identifies the 2003 tax reform. Source : Sample

that paid more than e400, as the number of e400+ secondary jobs was too
small before the reform. Figure 2 shows that secondary employment in the mid-
range, with earnings between e400 to e1000 per month, decreased rapidly after
the reform and have stagnated ever since. The number of these jobs, however,
stabilized quickly, within 2 years. We see a small increase in the number of high-
paying secondary jobs (over e1000 per month) over time, but this increase is very
small in comparison to the dramatic increase in the number of secondary mini-
jobs and does not show a discontinuity at the time of the reform. Finally, Figure
2 shows that unemployment insurance benefit changes that were implemented in
January 2005 and February 2006 did not lead to sharp changes in the number of
secondary jobs (Price (2020)).
    Figure 2 highlights the relatively slow adjustment process. Because mini-
job rules are well-known in Germany, it is unlikely that the slow adjustment

was driven by lack of salience. Instead, it could be driven by firm constraints,
consistent with the findings of Gudgeon and Trenkle (2017) who investigate firms'
adjustment to the mini-job threshold shift from e325 to e400. Gudgeon and
Trenkle (2017) show that it took firms more than 3 years to transform e325 jobs
into e400 jobs.
     Figure 3(a) shows the distributions of secondary earnings in 2002, 2005, and
2010. While approximately 25% of individuals hold e400 secondary jobs, the
rest hold secondary jobs that pay less. Consistent with the notched nature of
tax incentives, we see a steep drop off in the number of secondary jobs that pay
e400 or more.11 Zooming in on that part of the distribution in Figure 3(b), we
see that jobs that pay over e400 were "converted" into e400-jobs; however, this
conversion did not happen for larger jobs, e.g. jobs that pay e1000 or more.12

March 2003.

individuals, individuals with no vocational training, and in lower-paid primary
jobs are all more likely to hold secondary jobs. However, we see no difference
in the propensity to moonlight due to age. The median full-time wage at these
establishments is lower than at an average firm. Secondary jobs are more likely
to be held at small firms with a larger number of mini-job workers. While 27%
of secondary jobs held at very small firms ­ with 5 employees or less, 28% of jobs
are held at firms with 51 employees or more. Comparing these decompositions
with those from 2002 (shown in the Appendix Figure C.4), only two changes are
notable. First, women became more over-represented in secondary jobs than be-
fore. Second, a much larger number of secondary jobs is held at firms with a large
number of mini-job workers than in the past. Otherwise, the demographic com-
position of secondary job holders remained approximately the same. Appendix
Figure C.4 also shows that small secondary jobs are held at firms that are very
similar to firms that employ low-income workers in general. This suggests that

secondary jobs (Tazhitdinova (2020)).
     Occupation and industry compositions of secondary jobs also remained ap-
proximately constant between 2002 and 2010. As shown in the Appendix Figure
C.5, 70% of secondary jobs are held in several occupations: household cleaners,
office workers, watchmen, warehousemen, waiters, drivers, salespersons. Among
these, cleaners represent over 20% of all secondary jobs, while other occupations
range between 5 and 10%. Importantly, while relative shares of these occupations
change across primary income groups ­ e.g. cleaning is less common among high-
est primary income individuals who instead are more likely to moonlight as office
workers ­ nonetheless, the same occupations cover the top 70% for all income
groups. If we break down secondary jobs by firm's industry, approximately 25%
of secondary jobs are help in service industries, and between 5 and 10% in retail,
health, hotels and restaurants, renting and recreation.

in 2002, 2005 and 2010. Individuals are broken down into groups by demographic

many, individuals whose primary occupation is among the top 5 most common
secondary occupations, and finally, individuals of different age groups. While we
see substantial heterogeneity in moonlighting rates, the response to the reform
appears to be relatively similar: moonlighting rates roughly doubled by 2005,
and tripled by 2010.
    Finally, Figure 5(b) shows how the likelihood of holding a small secondary
job evolves over time for individuals who first obtained a secondary job in 1999,
2002, 2004 or in 2006. To construct this figure, I recorded the first year during the
sample period (1999-2010) in which an individual reported having a secondary
job that paid e400 or less. For all subsequent years, I calculate the proportion of
individuals who still report holding a secondary job (with the same or different
employer), thus allowing for breaks between secondary jobs. Figure 5(b) shows
that most secondary jobs are held for a year or less. However, approximately
20% of moonlighters hold secondary jobs for extended periods of time.


3.2    Earnings Substitution and Aggregate Responses
The results of the previous section show that the 2003 reform led to an increased
number of small secondary jobs. In this section I investigate whether this increase
was offset by reduced primary employment or resulted in a crowd out of small
primary jobs.
     Since the 2003 tax reform reduced taxation of secondary jobs but left primary
tax rates unchanged, the reform could lead to an arbitrage opportunity: some
of the increase in moonlighting hours may be offset by lower working hours at
the primary jobs. If this were the case, the observed increase in moonlighting
would not constitute an increase in hours, but merely result in lost revenue.
Such substitution is unlikely to happen in practice. First, employers are not
directly incentivized to split primary jobs because the employer mini-job tax rate
is slightly higher than the employer social security tax rate. Empirically, less
than 1.5% of moonlighters held both a regular and a mini-job with the same
employer. Among these secondary job holders, 61% experienced an increase in
pay when they first started the new secondary job, and for only 6.5%, their
earnings remained within e100 of their previous month's wage. Second, the lack
of high-paying secondary jobs limits the scope of arbitrage. Tazhitdinova (2020)

documents that most mini-job workers were paid an average of e9 per hour in
2006-2010. This hourly wage can be compared, for example, to an unmarried
worker with primary earnings of e2000 per month, whose implied before-tax
hourly wage is approximately e12 per hour and implied after-tax wage is e8,
similar to average mini-job wages. This back-of-envelope comparison suggests
that except for the lowest-earning workers, the reform did not present much of
an arbitrage opportunity. Third, it is unlikely that most secondary job holders
would be able to reduce their primary working hours because they are salaried
or because doing so is costly. Finally, while regular jobs increase one's pension
and unemployment insurance entitlements, secondary mini-jobs do not, making
them an imperfect substitute.
    To provide empirical evidence against substitution, I explore how primary
earnings change upon take up of a secondary job, before and after the reform.
Figure 6(a) shows the percent of individuals who experienced a decrease in pri-
mary earnings from the previous year separately for individuals who obtained a


                                                                                                                20
new secondary mini-job (e0 to e400), who obtained a new high-paying secondary
job (e400 or more), as well as for individuals with no secondary jobs. If indi-
viduals were shifting earnings from primary employment to secondary, we would
observe an increase in the solid curve after the reform, and no similar increase for
dashed curves. No such increase is apparent. Instead, Figure 6(a) shows a similar
evolution of primary earnings changes for all three groups. Appendix D.2 tests
this result formally and considers other measures of primary earnings changes.
     The lack of primary earnings response implies that individuals experience
some form of hours constraint, since as discussed in Section 2, a fully uncon-
strained individual would not obtain a secondary job without reducing his pri-
mary hours. Since the reform led to a noticeable increase in moonlighting, these
hours constraints are likely to be small in magnitude, since if this were not the
case, individuals would have held secondary jobs prior to the reform. The evi-
dence in Figure 5 strongly suggests that most individuals experience temporary
constraints: between 40-60% of secondary jobs are held for a year or less. How-
ever, a nontrivial number of individuals experience long-term constraints ­ ap-
proximately 25% moonlight intermittently for five years, and approximately 10%
moonlight continuously for five years.
     A secondary job tax break could also lead to two other forms of substitu-
tion. First, if labor demand cannot absorb the influx of secondary workers, this
may lead to secondary workers "stealing" jobs from primary workers, resulting
in decreased labor supply of individuals with low primary earnings. Figure 6(b)
provides evidence against this: the number of primary jobs with earnings of less
than e400 has not decreased as a result of the reform. An important caveat
is that the 2003 reform may have led to extensive margin responses within the
primary jobs market: since the mini-job threshold increased from e325 to e400,
individuals who had previously chosen not to work at all might have joined the
workforce. However, such extensive margin responses should only affect the num-
ber of at-the-threshold jobs (e162 to e400), not that of small jobs (under e162).
Figure 6(b) shows a small increase in the number of primary jobs both below and
above e162, suggesting no substitution between primary and secondary workers.
     Second, the increased demand for small jobs may result in the splitting of
larger full-time jobs into multiple mini-jobs. Unfortunately, Figure 6(b) cannot


                                        21
provide convincing evidence against this possibility because, relative to the overall
full-time workforce, the increase in the number of small secondary jobs is small.


3.3    Distributional Effects
Figure 7 helps us to assess the distributional and fiscal impacts of the reform.
I calculate the fiscal gain/cost of the 2003 tax reform as a simple difference
between the tax revenue collected on all secondary jobs that paid e1000 or less
in 2005/2010 and in 2002. For individuals with primary earnings of less than
e400, I calculate the fiscal costs based on individuals whose combined earnings
exceed the mini-job threshold, thus making them liable for income and social
security taxes. Therefore, these calculations account for all changes that occurred
during this period, including changes to income and social security tax rates,
along with mini-job threshold increase, as well as their effects on the magnitude
of secondary earnings, and substitution responses (the observed decrease in the
number of e400+ jobs). Appendix E considers alternative approaches: holding
pre-reform or post-reform tax-rate and threshold constant, or limiting the increase
in secondary jobs to causal estimates of Section 4 (Figure 10(a)-(b)).
     Figure 7(a) shows the secondary mini-job holding rates by primary income
group in 2002, percentage point increase in secondary mini-job holding rates in
2005 and in 2010, as well as the corresponding marginal tax rate in 2002. In the
background, the vertical bars show the relative shares of the population in each
income bin. Figure 7(a) shows that while high-income individuals experienced the
largest tax break, lower-income individuals were most likely to obtain a secondary
job. However, since these individuals represent a relatively small share of the
population, most tax benefits went to the middle-income groups ­ individuals
with primary earnings of e1500-e3000 per month.
     Figure 7(b) shows the implied fiscal gains/losses from the reform. The solid
line shows the revenue change per job created (left scale), while the dashed line
measures the total revenue change (right scale), scaled from a 2% sample. The
results imply that in the two years after the reform, in 2005 the revenue collected
increased for individuals with primary earnings of less than e2000, but decreased
or remained the same for higher income groups. By 2010, the increase in sec-
ondary jobs was large enough that combined with increased employer mini-job

Notes : Figure (a) shows the number of individuals with e0-e400 secondary jobs in 2002
in dashed light blue, the increase in the number of such secondary jobs from 2002 to
2005 in percentage points in light blue, and from 2002 to 2010 in dark blue. The yel-
low curve (right scale) shows the corresponding marginal tax rates in 2002. The vertical
bars in the background show the relative shares of the population in each income bin in
2002. Figure (b) shows the fiscal gain (if positive) or fiscal cost (if negative) of the re-
form. The solid lines measure revenue change per job created, while the dashed lines mea-
sure the total cost, scaled from the data's 2% sample to reflect full population. Source :

tax rate (which increased from 22% in 2002 to 30% in 2010), the reform led to
an overall revenue increase. However, this fiscal outcome was in large part driven
by increased employer mini-job tax rate and increased secondary earnings due
to threshold increase: if one holds mini-job earnings and tax rates constant at
2002 levels, the revenue gains are significantly smaller or negative. Importantly,
if one calculates the fiscal outcomes based on causal estimates of Section 4, the
reform resulted in revenue losses in 2005 and lower revenue gains in 2010. The
observed U-shaped pattern is driven by two factors: a larger percent increase in
secondary job holding rates among lower income individuals and higher average
secondary earnings among high-income individuals: Appendix Figure E.10(b)
shows that average secondary mini-job earnings increase from e250 to e300 as
primary income increases.
     Combining these results with the calibration predictions of Section 2 gen-
erates two insights. First, the package of reforms "paid for itself" and resulted
in a small net revenue increase for all except lowest-income individuals. Since

secondary job holders receive a full tax break, the revenue increase is entirely
due to increased employer mini-job tax revenue. Second, mid- and higher-income
individuals experienced the largest tax breaks, both per person and as a total.
However, these tax breaks were well targeted in the sense that they were given
to constrained individuals, as discussed in Section 3.2. Combining the evidence
from Figure 7(a) with calibration predictions of Figure 1 suggests that beneficia-
ries can be classified into two categories. The heavily constrained individuals ­
who held secondary jobs before the reform and whose working hours are likely
to be smaller than their ideal hours by 25% or more ­ constitute approximately
2-3% of all individuals. These individuals benefited the most, and their utility
can be approximated by the red-circle lines of Figure 1 (c) and (d). Lightly con-
strained individuals ­ those who did not hold a secondary job before the reform
and whose working hours are likely to be constrained by less than 25% ­ represent
4-8% of the population ­ benefited less. Their utility can be approximated by the
orange-triangle lines of Figure 1 (c) and (d). These results suggest that as long
as secondary jobs are limited to low-wage employments or if the tax breaks are
small in magnitude, moonlighting tax breaks will only generate responses among
low-income and constrained individuals.


4    Measuring the Effect of Tax Reform on Take-
     Up of Secondary Jobs
The graphical evidence presented in Section 3.1 provides strong evidence of a
causal response of secondary mini-jobs to the reform: the increase in secondary
mini-jobs is immediate and sharp. However, estimating the magnitude of the
causal effect is more challenging. In this section, I attempt to do so using two
approaches. First, I use aggregate evidence to account for aggregate changes that
may affect the attractiveness or availability of small secondary jobs. Second, I
use micro data and two plausible control groups to estimate the magnitude of
response. Since none of these approaches present an ideal quasi-experiment, the
estimates should be interpreted as "suggestive" of the true magnitude of causal
responses to the 2003 reform.


                                       24
4.1     Aggregate Control Group Estimates
The main threat to identification is the possibility that the number of secondary
mini-jobs increased for some other reasons unrelated to tax incentives. Two
types of such aggregate shocks are plausible. First, a cultural shift or economic
necessity may make moonlighting more attractive. For example, the Hartz IV
reform reduced long-term unemployment benefits in 2005, which may induce
spouses of unemployed workers to seek out secondary jobs. If this were the case,
we should observe an increase in moonlighting rates across all levels of secondary
earnings. This means that we can use the number of high-paying secondary jobs
­ the dashed blue series from Figure 2 ­ as a control group in order to account
for aggregate shocks that affect the appeal of moonlighting in general.13
     Second, mini-jobs may become more readily available because of a demand-
driven shock, thus inadvertently increasing the number of secondary mini-jobs.
For example, Hartz reforms relaxed dismissal rules and reduced taxation of the
temporary help sector, which may have incentivized employers to offer more small
jobs. If this were the case, we should see a roughly proportional increase in the
number of mini-jobs taken as primary jobs or as secondary jobs. This means
that we can use the number of primary mini-jobs ­ the sum of solid curves from
Figure 6(b) ­ as a control group in order to account for aggregate shocks that
affect the availability of less-than-e400 jobs.
     Formally, I estimate

                                    2010              2010
  log(N um Jobsjt ) = 1 +                   2t t +            3t (T reatjt × t ) + it , (4)
                                   t=1999            t=1999


where t measures time in years and j identifies job type. To account for the first
type of aggregate shocks, N um Jobsjt measures either the number of secondary
mini-jobs (defined as secondary employments paying e400 or less) or the number
of secondary high-paying jobs (paying e1000 or more). To account for the second
type of aggregate shocks, N um Jobsjt either measures the number of secondary
mini-jobs (defined as secondary employments paying e400 or less) or the number
  13
     Note that medium-paying secondary jobs cannot be used as a control because the number
of these employments decreased due to tax incentives. See Figures 2 and 3.

of primary mini-jobs (defined as primary employments paying e400 or less). In
both cases, T reatjt equals to 1 for secondary jobs with earnings of e400 per
month or less, and zero otherwise. Specification (4) is estimated on 92 quarterly
observations. Observations from January-March 2003 are not included, so the
2003 point estimate measures the immediate effect of the reform. The results are
shown in Figure 8.

Notes : This figure plots estimates and 95% confidence intervals of coefficients 3t of specifica-
tion (4) multiplied by 2.31 ­ the pre-reform secondary mini-job holding rate in January-March
2003. In both figures, the treatment observations measure the number of secondary e0-e400
jobs. In figure (a), the control observations measures the number of individuals with large
(i.e. e1000+) secondary jobs, while in figure (b) control observations measure the number of
small (i.e e400 or less) primary jobs. The dashed line shows a simple difference between the
secondary mini-job holding rate in a given year minus in Jan-March 2003. Year 2002 is omit-
ted. Specification (4) is estimated on 92 quarterly observations. The vertical red line identi-
fies the 2003 tax reform. Coefficients and standard errors are reported in Table F.6. Source :

    The dashed line in Figure 8 shows the simple difference between the secondary
mini-job holding rate in a given year and the pre-reform rate of 2.31% in Jan-
March 2003, while the solid line shows estimates from (4) scaled by the pre-reform
rate. Both approaches suggest that approximately half of the total increase in
small secondary jobs can be attributed to the causal effect of the reform, implying
an almost 100% increase in secondary mini-job holding by 2010. The results
highlight the importance of accounting for aggregate shocks, but the estimates
must be interpreted with caution. The increase in the number of small jobs and
the increased popularity of moonlighting may have been caused by the reform

                                                                                                                    26
itself; in that case, the estimates shown in Figure 8 represent the lower bound on
the true causal effect.


4.2      Micro Data Control Group Estimates
To estimate the effect of the reform on the take up of secondary jobs using
microdata, I employ a difference-in-differences linear probability model (LPM)
specification:

                                   2010              2010
 P (2nd M iniit = 1) = 1 +                 2t t +            3t (T reatit × t ) + Xit + it , (5)
                                  t=1999            t=1999


where 2nd M iniit is equal to 1 if the individual holds a secondary mini-job and
zero otherwise, while t is an indicator of a given time period. T reat identifies
one of the several treatment groups ­ individuals with primary earnings of e400
to e1000, e1000 to e3000, or over e3000. Controls Xit include demographic
characteristics such as gender, age, state (l¨ ander), occupation, and individual
fixed effects. The coefficients of interest 3t measure an increase in the take up
of secondary jobs as a result of the tax break. Standard errors are clustered by
individual.
     I choose the LPM over a nonlinear model such as a logit or a probit for
several reasons. First, LPM is easy to interpret and the regression results can
be directly compared to graphical evidence. Second and most importantly, LPM
is more suitable for including individual fixed effects because nonlinear models
with fixed effects suffer from the incidental parameters problem (Neyman and
Scott (1948); Lancaster (2000)). Third, the difference-in-differences approach is
harder to interpret within a nonlinear framework. The parallel trend assumption
necessary for causal estimation is hard to justify because of the bounded support
of the outcome variable, and the estimated interaction term is difficult to interpret
(Ai and Norton (2003); Puhani (2012)).
     I use two approaches to assign individuals to treatment and control groups.
First, I assign individuals to treatment and control groups based on their primary
earnings in January-March 2003, the three months before the reform.14 The
 14
      The results are robust to assigning status based on the 2002 earnings level.

control group consists of individuals with primary earnings of e4000 or more,
while the treatment groups consist of workers with primary earnings of e400 to
e4000, broken down by primary income tranches. The identification relies on the
intuition that high-wage individuals are less likely to be affected by the secondary
job tax break because their primary wages are likely to be much higher than
moonlighting wages, even after accounting for the tax break. Therefore, high-
wage individuals' moonlighting decisions should be primarily driven by non-tax
factors that we are trying to control for. Ideally, one would then assign treatment
and control groups based on wage levels, but this information is not available and
for this reason, I use earnings as a proxy for wages. Since high-income individuals
are nonetheless treated, this approach yields a lower bound on the true magnitude
of the response.
     The second approach attempts to find a control group that is not treated.
To do so, I choose individuals with very small primary earnings as a control
group ­ less than e162 per month. By sample construction, these individuals'
secondary jobs are bound by their primary earnings, and therefore their combined
income is limited to e324. Hence, these individuals should not be affected by
the 2003 mini-job threshold increase from e325 to e400, as their cumulative


                                                                                            28
earnings do not exceed e325. The downside of this approach is that the treatment
and control groups must be assigned based on current rather than pre-reform
earnings. The reason for this is that these individuals tend to increase their
primary earnings relatively quickly: within 2 years, only 25% of individuals have
earnings of e162 or less, and approximately 60% have earnings over e400 (see
Appendix Figure F.11). This means that the pre-reform earnings of very low-
income individuals cannot be used to predict individuals' future earnings, and one
must rely on current earnings. On one hand, doing so is advantageous because
the group assignment accurately reflects individuals' contemporaneous incentives.
The downside, of course, is that the same individual might be assigned to a control
group in some years, but to various treatment groups in other years. Treatment
group switches do not affect the validity of the empirical approach, merely the
interpretation of the results. On the other hand, the possibility of selection into
treatment could invalidate my empirical approach; however, Appendix Figure
F.11 shows no changes in relative income group switches as a result of the reform
(see discussion in Appendix F).15
     The treatment and control groups are not perfectly comparable and differ
in many aspects. The necessary identifying assumption is that the likelihood of
secondary employment evolved similarly for individuals in the treatment groups
as for individuals in the control group. Figures 9(a) and (b) investigate the
validity of this assumption and show that prior to the reform in April 2003, the
percent of secondary job holders appears to follow a similar downward trend
for all income groups. High-income individuals, however, are less likely to hold
secondary jobs than individuals with small primary earnings, consistent with
evidence from Figure 4.
     Figure 10 presents the results of estimating (5) separately for individuals
with primary earnings ranging between e400 and e1000, e1000 and e3000,
and between e3000 and e4000. Estimates for all income groups combined are
shown in Appendix Figure F.12. In all estimates, observations from January-
  15
     Another possibility is that individuals with pre-reform income just above e400 may wish to
reduce their earnings in order to qualify for a tax-free primary job. In that case, the e400-e1000
treatment group may be adversely selected. If this were the case, we should see a decreased
mass in the distribution of primary earnings, just above the e400 threshold, after the reform.
Appendix Figure A.2 does not show evidence of such missing mass. See also Tazhitdinova
(2020) for more detailed treatment of primary earnings responses.

March 2003 are not included, so the 2003 point estimate measures the immediate
effect of the reform. Figure 10 confirms the general validity of the parallel trend
assumption by showing no major pre-trends before the policy change in April
2003. Both specifications ­ whether based on pre-reform earnings or based on
current earnings ­ show similar results: the reform resulted in an immediate
increase in moonlighting, followed by a gradual increase over time. For individuals
with primary earnings between e400 to e1000, moonlighting increased by 3-5
percentage points within the first 2 years, and by approximately 4-6 percentage
points by 2010 from a pre-reform mean of 4.15%. For individuals with primary
earnings of e1000 to e3000, the likelihood of secondary job holding increased by
2-3 percentage points in the first 2 years after the reform, and by 2-3 percentage

points by 2010, from the initial level of 2.5%. Finally, individuals with primary
earnings between e3000 and e4000 also increased their moonlighting rates, by
1-1.8 percentage points in the first 2 years and by approximately 1.3 by 2010,
from the initial rate of 1.88. In all specifications, higher-income individuals show
a slightly weaker response than individuals with small primary earnings.


4.3    Discussion and Caveats
The estimated changes in the take up of secondary jobs can be used to estimate
elasticities of participation in the secondary job market. I define elasticities as

                     %P articipation    %P articipation
                                     =                     ,                      (6)
                      %(1 -  )         %(1 - SS - Income )

where SS = 0.21 and Income identify social security and income taxes on the
first dollar of secondary earnings. An appropriate measure of Income would take
spousal earnings into account; however, that information is not available. As an
approximation, I use individual's marginal income tax based on their primary
earnings alone minus a 20% deduction (following the results of Doerrenberg et al.
(2017)). As women tend to have lower earnings than their spouses, this approxi-
mation may result in a small upward bias for women, and the opposite for men.
Thus, it is difficult to accurately predict the direction of the bias, especially tak-
ing into consideration that moonlighters may be negatively selected. The average
Income is 12% for individuals with low primary earnings (e400-e1000), 29% for
individuals with e1000-e3000 earnings, and 36% for individuals with primary
earnings of e3000 to e4000.
     Using 2005 and 2010 to calculate short-term and long-term elasticities, I es-
timate short-term elasticities of 1.48-2.35 and long-term elasticities of 2.06-2.91
for individuals with small primary earnings (e400-e1000). For individuals with
primary earnings of e1000 to e3000, short-term elasticities range between 0.72
and 1.3, while long-term elasticities are 0.91-1.24. Finally, for higher-income indi-
viduals, short-run elasticities are 0.35-0.75 and long-run elasticities are 0.48-0.55.
Most importantly, all elasticities are very similar in magnitude and are signifi-
cantly larger than participation elasticities for the primary jobs estimated in other
settings: between 0 and 0.25 for men and between 0 and 0.35 for women (Blun-

                                         31
dell and Macurdy (1999); Blundell et al. (2011); McClelland and Mok (2012)).
However, elasticities are of comparable magnitude to recent experimental evi-
dence that finds large intertemporal or compensated elasticities for individuals
with highly flexible working hours (Angrist et al. (2017), Mas and Pallais (2019),
Chen et al. (2017)). The results thus imply that moonlighting is highly responsive
to tax incentives.16
     The estimated responses are subject to several caveats. First, the results
should not be interpreted as caused by the tax break alone. Threshold and other
tax rate changes contributed to the observed outcomes. Second, the elasticities
are calculated under the assumption that all individuals who looked for a sec-
ondary job were able to obtain such a job, in other words, that labor demand
elasticity is perfectly elastic. However, if labor demand is less than perfectly
elastic, the estimated response represents a lower bound on the true structural
elasticities of labor supply. Third, as discussed in Section 4.1, Hartz reforms
might have resulted in labor demand increase of small jobs because of the relaxed
regulation. The approach taken in Section 4.1 attempts to account for such ag-
gregate shifts by using appropriate control groups. The approach in Section 4.2
accounts for the demand shifts as long as demand changes affected treatment and
control groups similarly. Since secondary mini-jobs are relatively similar across
income groups (recall discussion in Section 3.1), there is no evidence to suggest
this was not the case. Overall, the results suggest that roughly 50% of the ob-
served increase in moonlighting may be attributed to individuals' responses. The
remaining increase in secondary employment may have happened as a result of
demand shift or any other aggregate changes in the economy.


5      Conclusion
Leveraging a unique reform in Germany that eliminated social security and in-
come taxes on e0-e400 secondary jobs, this paper estimates the effect of taxes
  16
      Unfortunately, the estimated participation elasticities cannot be easily compared to elas-
ticities of taxable income (ETI): the secondary job incentive was limited to e400, and thus
constrained the maximum taxable income change to e400 regardless of pre-reform income.
Therefore, any estimates of ETI are flawed because individuals would have obtained larger
secondary jobs in absence of the threshold, as evidenced by the large bunching in Figure 3.

on multiple job holding. The results show that moonlighting is highly respon-
sive to taxes, with implied participation elasticities that are several times larger
than participation elasticities for primary employment. Secondary jobs are dis-
proportionately taken up by women, foreign-born individuals, individuals with
no vocational training and in lower-paid primary jobs. These moonlighting jobs
are mostly held in low-wage service occupations and industries, irrespective of
primary earnings level. A calibration exercise reveals that hours constraints are
the primary cause of moonlighting: low-wage secondary jobs are unlikely to be
attractive to individuals unless their primary earnings are too low. For most in-
dividuals, these hours constraints are likely to be of temporary nature since they
hold secondary jobs for a year or less.
     The results thus suggest that moonlighting tax-breaks could be effective at
incentivizing longer working hours as they offer two key advantages. First, they
are cost-effective, as they only reduce the tax on highly elastic secondary earnings
and preserve the tax revenue on inelastic primary earnings. Second, the incentive
structure implicitly targets constrained lower-income individuals. However, these
advantages must be weighted against disadvantages. For example, moonlighting
tax breaks cannot be used to incentivize individuals to join the workforce in the
first place, and they may inadvertently incentivize firms to split full-time jobs
into multiple part-time jobs.
     While the studied secondary jobs are of the "traditional" part-time type and
thus are less flexible than typical "gig" jobs, they are similar in that they do not
provide social insurance benefits. Therefore, moonlighting responses are likely to
be stronger if the tax breaks are applied to more flexible and easily accessible
"gig" jobs. However, the targeting of secondary tax breaks may be less efficient
and may result in arbitrage opportunities if some of these gig jobs are of the
high-wage type. For example, digital platforms such as TaskRabbit offer some
high-wage opportunities that the traditional part-time labor market does not.

A      Institutional Details and Data
A.1     Summary of Hartz Reforms
In this paper I evaluate labor supply responses to a tax rule change that was
part of a larger package of reforms known as the Hartz reforms, summarized in
detail in Jacobi and Kluve (2006) and Ebbinghaus and Eichhorst (2006). These
reforms were implemented in four phases ­ Hartz I and II in 2003, Hartz III in
2004, and Hartz IV in 2005 ­ and had three goals in mind.
     The first goal was to increase the effectiveness of labor market services by re-
organizing and improving the effectiveness of employment agencies. For example,
the Hartz I and II reforms introduced voucher systems that allowed individuals
to work with private placement services in cases where public placement service
failed to place individuals within 6 months of unemployment, or be re-trained
by private providers. The Hartz III reforms re-organized the structure of public
employment agencies, and extended the advising and counseling services they
provide.
     The second goal was to reduce unemployment and non-employment by chang-
ing the benefit system and by increasing work incentives. As can be seen in Fig-
ure A.1 below, the unemployment rate was relatively high. The Hartz I and II
reforms introduced "sanction" elements for unemployment insurance recipients,
which made it a requirement for unemployed individuals to actively seek employ-
ment and be obligated to accept any offer of suitable work. The Hartz III reforms
reduced unemployment insurance benefits duration while the Hartz IV reforms
decreased their amounts. Significant for this paper, the Hartz I and II reforms
expanded the mini-job sector by increasing the mini-job threshold from e325 to
e400 and by allowing secondary jobs to qualify for mini-job tax breaks.
     The third goal was to increase the flexibility of the labor markets by dereg-
ulating the temporary work sector and relaxing dismissal/contract rules. The
Hartz III reforms abolished restrictions on the maximum duration of temporary
employment, and increased exemption threshold from dismissal protection from

5 employees or less to 10. It is worth noting that this change was unlikely to have
a large effect on secondary jobs for two reasons. First, as evidenced in Figure 4,
a quarter of secondary workers were employed by small firms who were exempt
from the dismissal rules both before and after the reform. Second, the dismissal
protections set in after a probationary period of six months.
     To summarize, with the exception of the rule change studied in this paper, the
majority of the Hartz reforms affected unemployed or non-employed individuals,
which should have resulted in a labor supply increase in the primary job sector.
The Hartz reforms may have further affected secondary job holding rates via
changes in equilibrium wages or by changing the availability of small jobs.


A.2     Tax Rules
The mini-job tax rules are summarized in Table A.1, while the applicable income
tax rates are available in Table A.2. As summarized in Table A.1, the tax rules
generate a large notch at the e325/e400 threshold for individuals with small
incomes in all years. Figure A.2 shows the distributions of primary earnings in
2002, 2005 and 2010. Each distribution shows pronounced bunching at the mini-

Notes : This table summarizes individual tax rules in Germany. Primary job is defined as
the job with the highest earnings. The income tax rate depends on marital status and one's
primary or total earnings, depending on whether secondary earnings are taxed. In all cases,
employers must pay a social security or mini-job tax that ranges between 19.5% and 30%.


job threshold. Behavioral responses of primary workers are analyzed in Gudgeon
and Trenkle (2017) and Tazhitdinova (2020). Furthermore, for individuals with
small earnings, the reform substituted the social security notch at the e400 mini-
job threshold with a kink. In other words, a worker with primary earnings of e450
per month would pay social security tax on e50 only. The income tax liability
would still be based on the full e450. This change did not apply to secondary
employments (see Gudgeon and Trenkle (2017); Tazhitdinova (2020); Galassi
(2018); Carrillo-Tudela et al. (2018)).
     For individuals with at least one regular job ­ i.e. a job that pays over
e400 per month ­ the mini-job threshold generated a large notch for secondary
earnings starting in 2003. However, because of the prevalence of small e325
jobs in the labor market, some bunching at the e325 threshold is visible in the
2002 distribution of secondary jobs in Figure 3. This bunching has been termed
`aggregate bunching' and represents firms' rather than workers' responses to tax
incentives.

A.3     Data
I use the weakly anonymous Sample of Integrated Labor Market Biographies
1975-2010 (SIAB), which provides information on employment, job search and
receipt of unemployment benefits for a 2% sample of wage earners in Germany
from 1975 until 2010. The 2% sample is comprised of all individuals who were
subject to Social Security (i.e. regular employees), received unemployment bene-
fits according to Social Code books II and III (since 1975), have been marginally
employed (i.e. mini-job workers since 1999), registered as a job seeker, or partic-
ipated in a training measure (since 2000). In short, the SIAB dataset presents a
2% sample of the non-self-employed labor force in Germany. For details, see vom
Berge et al. (2013). Data access was provided via on-site use at the Research Data
Centre (FDZ) of the German Federal Employment Agency (BA) at the Institute
for Employment Research (IAB), and, subsequently remote data access.
     To aggregate the data into the quarterly format I proceed as follows. For
each quarter, the observation with the largest monthly earnings is recorded as the

                                                  42
main job, and the second highest earnings employment is recorded as the second
job. Therefore, by construction, primary jobs generate the highest earnings. A
very small number of individuals hold more than two concurrent employments;
for these individuals, only the two highest-paid jobs are recorded. Earnings from
the same establishment and the same employment category (i.e. regular or mini-
job) are combined in the case of multiple concurrent records. If several jobs have
the same duration, I use the spell with the highest income as the "main" spell. A
very small number of individuals report multiple employment spells of the same
longest duration (typically of less than 3 days) and the same level of earnings.
In this case a random spell is chosen. Summary statistics are available in Table
A.3.

B      Calibration
The calibration exercise is based on the following assumptions and choices. First,
I suppose each individual maximizes

                                 1+1/
              A       h1 + h2
 U =c-                                    s.t.    c = (1 - 1 )w1 h1 + (1 - 2 )w2 h2 , (7)
           1 + 1/        A

with hi and wi denoting working hours and wages in job i, respectively. It can be
shown that an unconstrained individual would like to hold one job that pays the
highest after-tax wage, with working hours (h                                
                                                     1 , h2 ) = (Aw1 (1 - 1 ) , 0) whenever
(1 - 1 )w1 > (1 - 2 )w2 .
    I assume that individuals ideally want to work 173 hours per month, which
is equivalent to 40 hours per week. In other words, I set h              1 = 173. I then
                                         ^               
assume that they actually work h1 = (1 - )h1 and consider  = 0, 0.1, 0.25. I
vary individuals' total earnings h        1 w1 from e1000 to e4000 per month, in e500
increments. This pins down their primary wage as w1 = Earnings/173. Ability
parameter A is then chosen so that their ideal working hours are h             1 = 173, i.e.
                          
A = 173/(w1 (1 - 1 ) ). Tax rates 1 are based on the 2002 tax schedule and
individuals' optimal earnings w1 h        1.
    To construct Figures (a) and (b) I solve for the range of elasticities  that
             ^ 1 , h2 )- U (h
result in U (h              ^ 1 , 0) > 0, where

                                                                             1+1/
                                                                        ^1
                         ^ 1 , 0)  (1 - 2 )w2 h2 - h2 1 + 1 1 h2 A
          ^ 1 , h2 )- U (h
       U (h
                                                                        h
                                                                                    .
                                                   ^1
                                                   h      2h  ^1        A

In both Figure 1 and B.3, w2 h2 = e400. However, in Figure 1 I assume that
secondary wage w2 is the lower of e9 per hour (a typical wage in mini-jobs,
see Tazhitdinova (2020)) or individual's primary wage, i.e w2 = min(e9, w1 ).
In Figure B.3, I assume that w2 = w1 . Figures (c) and (d) plot (U (h     ^ 1 , h2 )-
   ^ 1 , 0))/U (h
U (h            ^ 1 , 0)  100% for an individual with elasticity  = 0.25.

ited to (0,1).       Parameter A is chosen such that each individual's optimal hours
are 173 hours per month.           The following parameters are used:  = 0, 0.10, 0.25,
w1 = e1000/173, ..., e4000/173, h      ^ 1 = (1 - )173, w2 = w1 , h2 = e400/w2 .

C     Additional Demographic Information
Figures C.4(a) and (b) show the demographic characteristics of secondary job
holders and all wage earners with primary earnings of e400+ in 2002. Figures
C.4(c) and (d) show the demographic characteristics of primary job holders with
primary earnings of e400 or less in 2002 and 2010.
     Figure C.5(a) shows the most common secondary occupations in 2002 and
2010 and their respective shares of total secondary jobs in that year. Altogether,
these occupations cover approximately 70% of all secondary jobs. Over time, all
common secondary occupations except for office workers and salespersons became
less common. Interestingly, this pattern is not specific to any particular income
group (not shown). However, the relative shares of each occupation vary across
income groups. Figure C.5(b) repeats this exercise for industries. Overall, we see
that secondary jobs have not changed much as a result of the 2003 reform: most
of these jobs are in service industries and low-wage service occupations.
     Figure C.6(a) shows Venn diagrams of the five most common occupations for
secondary jobs in 2005 among 31-54-year-olds, by earnings level. Among small
secondary jobs, low-skill occupations prevail: doormen and custodians, waiters,
house cleaners, warehouse and transport workers, and office workers represent the
majority of employment. High-paying secondary jobs, on the other hand, consist
of higher-skilled jobs, such as teachers, nurses and assistants, entrepreneurs and
consultants, social workers, and office workers. Interestingly, low-paid secondary
job occupations do not appear to vary greatly with the primary earnings level ­
Figure C.6(b) shows most common occupations among secondary mini-jobs by
individuals' primary earnings, documenting that low-skill occupations are most
common regardless of primary earnings level. Corroborating this finding, Figure
C.7 shows the percent of individuals whose main job occupation matches their
second job occupation. As one would expect from Figure C.6, individuals with low
primary earnings are more likely to have matching occupations than individuals
with higher primary earnings and low-paying secondary jobs. For all income
levels, among individuals with primary and secondary jobs of a similar level of
earnings, 40% have the same occupation. As the earnings differential increases,
this share decreases to 20%. Both probability of a match and most popular
secondary job occupations remain very stable across the years.

Notes : This figure shows the percent of individuals whose occupation in the primary job
matches the occupation in the secondary job in 2000 and 2010. The matches are broken
down by earnings in the primary and secondary jobs respectively. Note that, by construc-
tion, earnings in the secondary job are always lower than earnings in the primary job. Source :

     Finally, Figure C.8 attempts to shed light on whether moonlighting increased
because of the legalization of previously held under-the-table jobs or from the
conversion of contract arrangements into mini-jobs. While such conversions may
be desirable for the employees, they are not obviously beneficial for the employers,
because firms must pay a 25-30% tax on these jobs. If the secondary job holding
rates increased because of such conversions, the average size of firms that employ
secondary workers should increase after the reform. Instead, Figure C.8 shows
a small decrease in firm size as a result of the reform. The number of mini-job
workers (who hold these jobs as primary or secondary) increased while the number
of full-time employees decreased. Overall, Figure C.8 does not provide empirical
support for the evasion channel, but also does not rule it out completely.
     The results of Figure C.8(b) are unfortunately subject to one important
caveat: the data is provided by the firms, who define mini-job workers based on
the official threshold definition. Practically, this means that workers who held
e400 jobs before April 2003 were counted as regular part-time workers, but as
mini-job workers after the reform. In other words, if these firms did not change
the number of workers but were employing workers with earnings between e325
and e400, then Figure C.8(b) would still show an increase in the number of mini-

C.8(b) is somewhat exaggerated.

D.1                What Happened to e400-e1000 secondary jobs?
Figure 3 shows a decrease in the number of e400-e1000 secondary jobs. In this
section, I explore what happened to these workers and to the firms that hired
them.
     In Figure D.9(a), I explore what happens to individuals who held e400-
e1000 secondary jobs in January-March 2003 in the following years. Specifically,
I investigate whether these individuals kept the secondary job after the reform,
and if yes, how much it paid and whether it was with the same employer. I use
a balanced panel of individuals, since otherwise the series suffer from selection
due to differential attrition, and are very hard to interpret. Figure D.9(a) shows
that a large share of individuals with e400-e1000 secondary jobs converted these
jobs into smaller mini-jobs, often with the same employer. However, a nontrivial
number continued holding e400+ jobs.
     In Figure D.9(b), I explore what happened to the establishments that these
individuals worked at. Specifically, I investigate the number of employees ­ total,

                                                                                                   51
full time, and mini-job workers ­ that these establishments report to the social
security agency as of June 30 each year.17 Focusing on the employers, we see a
clear increase in the number of mini-job workers (from 76 on average to around
100), no change in the number of full-time employees, and no change or a small
increase in the number of total employees. The results based on averages suggest
that the reform did not lead to a larger number of workers, and that full-time
jobs were not cut into smaller mini-jobs, but that e400+ part-time jobs were
most likely converted into small mini-jobs.
     The results of Figure D.9(b), unfortunately, are subject to one important
caveat: the data is provided by the firms, who define mini-job workers based on
the official threshold definition. Practically, this means that workers who held
e400 employments before April 2003 were counted as regular part-time workers,
but as mini-job workers after the reform. In other words, if these firms did not
change their policies but were employing workers with earnings between e325
and e400, then Figure D.9(b) would still show an increase in the number of
mini-job workers. This means that firm-provided employment information can
only be used as a suggestive evidence.


D.2      Are Primary Earnings Substituted with Secondary?
To test primary earnings substitution formally, I apply a difference-in-differences
approach to two distinct comparison groups, as in Figure 6(a). First, I compare
changes in primary earnings for individuals who obtained new e0-e400 secondary
jobs to changes in primary earnings of individuals with new secondary jobs paying
more than e400. Since having a secondary job with earnings above e400 does
not lead to a tax break, these individuals constitute a natural control group for
individuals with new secondary jobs that pay e400 or less. Second, I compare
changes in primary earnings for individuals who have obtained new secondary
mini-jobs (e400) to changes in primary earnings of individuals who did not
obtain a new secondary job. Because this second specification relies on almost all
  17
     The downside of the data is that it represents a panel of individuals rather than firms.
Practically, that means that I cannot observe all individuals working at a given firm. Hence,
comprehensively looking at firms that have employed secondary job holders prior to the reform
with monthly pay between e400 and e1000 is not feasible.

T reatit is equal to one for individuals with new secondary jobs paying less than
e400 per month, and zero otherwise. Outcomeit considers several behaviors.
Define P rimaryEarningsit = P rimaryEarningsit - P rimaryEarningsi(t-12) .
First, Outcomeit = P (P rimary Earningsit < 0). In this case, specifica-
tion (8) compares the likelihoods of having an earnings decrease. Next, I set
Outcomeit = P (P rimary Earningsit  [-350, -450])). In other words, I in-
vestigate whether the likelihood of primary earnings decreases of approximately
e400 became more prevalent among new secondary mini-job holders after the
reform. Finally, I consider Outcomeit = P rimaryEarningsit , so Outcomeit
measures the change in primary earnings from 12 months ago for individuals

     If individuals shift earnings from primary to secondary jobs, the coefficients


                                                                                                53
3t will be positive and statistically significant for t >= 2003 in the first two
specifications, and negative and statistically significant in the third specification.
For the identification approach to be valid, earnings changes should follow a
similar trend for individuals with low-paying new secondary jobs, as well as for
individuals with high-paying secondary jobs. This parallel trend assumption can
be verified in Table D.4 and appears to hold approximately.

E        Calculating the Fiscal Costs
The calculations shown in Figure 7(b) (which is equivalent to Figure E.10(d)
                                                                                                                t

                                                                                                                          (or
   t
w¯w2 >400 ) represent average secondary wages in year t = 2005, 2010 of individuals
with secondary jobs paying less or equal to e400 per month (or between e400
and e1000). Similarly, let Nw                    t
                                                   2 400

year t, employee social security tax in year t, and individuals' average marginal
income tax rate, respectively. To construct Figure E.10(d) for each income group,
I calculate the total change in tax revenue as the sum of the following three
elements:
1. Tax revenue collected on all e400 secondary jobs in a given after-reform year
                             t              t                t

                                                        · RSS     );
2. Minus tax revenue collected on all e400 secondary jobs that existed in 2002

For individuals with primary earnings of less than e400, I calculate the fiscal costs
based on individuals whose combined earnings exceed the mini-job threshold, thus
making them liable for income and social security taxes.
                                                                                       t
        Figure E.10(c) is constructed similarly, except RSS                                 = 0 for all t, thus it does
not account for changes in employer tax revenues. Figure E.10(e) is constructed
                                t
similarly, except Nw              2 400
                                           = 0 and therefore the calculations do not account for
the revenue loss due to the reduced number of e400-e1000 jobs. Figure E.10(f)

Notes : Figure (a) shows the number of individuals with e0-e400 secondary jobs in 2002 in
dashed light blue, the increase in the number of such secondary jobs from 2002 to 2005 in
percentage points in light blue, and from 2002 to 2010 in dark blue. The yellow curve (right
scale) shows the corresponding marginal tax rates in 2002. The vertical bars in the back-
ground show the relative shares of the population in each income bin in 2002. Figure (b)
shows average mini-job (e0-e400) and midi-jobs (e400-e1000) by income group. Figure (c)
shows the fiscal costs of the reform not account for fiscal externalities due to increased em-
ployer revenue. Figure (d) shows the total fiscal gain (if positive) or fiscal cost (if negative)
of the reform. The solid lines measure revenue change per job created, while the dashed lines
measure the total cost, scaled from the data's 2% sample to reflect full population. Source :

F     Results: Take-Up of Secondary Jobs
The main threat to using current income to define treatment and control groups
is the possibility that individuals will self-select into a different primary income
group in order to take advantage of the secondary job holding rules. Figure F.11
explores this possibility for individuals who have earned less than e162 in some
year. Specifically, the identification approach will result in biased estimates if
individuals with very small earnings (less than e162) try to take advantage of
the 2003 reform by increasing their earnings above e400 in order to qualify for
the secondary job tax break. Figure F.11 plots the share of individuals who hold
primary employment with earnings of less than e162, between e162 and e400,
etc, 2 years after earning e162 or less. The results show that the likelihood
of moving into higher income groups remained the same after the reform, thus
providing evidence against such selection.

Notes : This figure plots estimates and 95% confidence intervals of coefficients 3t of specifica-
tion (5). The pre-reform rates differ because the treatment groups differ. The treatment group
in Figure (a) includes individuals with primary earnings of e400 to e4000 in Jan-Mar 2003.
The treatment group in Figure (b) includes individuals with contemporaneous primary earnings
of e400+. The dashed line shows a simple difference between the secondary mini-job holding
rate in a given year minus in Jan-March 2003. Year 2002 is omitted. The vertical red line iden-
tifies the 2003 tax reform. Coefficients and standard errors are reported in Table F.5. Source :

Notes : This table lists estimates and 95% confidence intervals of coefficients 3t of specifi-
cation (4). The header for each column group lists the the control group: either the num-
ber of individuals with large (i.e. e1000+) secondary jobs, or the number of small (i.e
e400 or less) primary jobs. In both cases, the treatment observations measure the num-
ber of secondary e0-e400 jobs. Year 2002 is omitted. Specification (4) is estimated on
92 quarterly observations. The vertical red line identifies the 2003 tax reform. Source :
