Liquidity Traps and Expectation Dynamics: Fiscal Stimulus or Fiscal Austerity?

                                            ABSTRACT

We examine global dynamics under infinite-horizon learning in New Keynesian models where the
interest-rate rule is subject to the zero lower bound. As in Evans, Guse and Honkapohja (2008), the
intended steady state is locally but not globally stable. Unstable deflationary paths emerge after large
pessimistic shocks to expectations. For large expectation shocks that push interest rates to the zero
bound, a temporary fiscal stimulus or a policy of fiscal austerity, appropriately tailored in magnitude
and duration, will insulate the economy from deflation traps. However "fiscal switching rules" that
automatically kick in without discretionary fine tuning can be equally effective.

1    Introduction
As is now recognized, a Taylor-type interest-rate rule, when combined with
the Fisher equation, necessarily leads to multiple equilibria. In addition to
the intended steady state at the targeted in‡ation rate = , there is a
low-in‡ation unintended steady state, which in fact is likely to be de‡ation-
ary. See Figure 1, which plots the Fisher equation R = = , where is
the in‡ation factor, R is the nominal interest rate factor and 1 is the real
interest-rate factor for discount factor 0 < < 1. The steady state Fisher
equation arises from the usual household Euler equation for consumption,
when consumption is at a steady state. The interest-rate rule R = 1 + f ( )
is drawn so that it cuts the Fisher in‡ation from below at the targeted steady
state , in accordance with the Taylor principle. The zero lower bound for
the net interest rate R 1 then implies the unintended steady state at L , pro-
vided that the interest rate rule is continuous. In fact, as shown by Benhabib,
Schmitt-Grohe, and Uribe (2001), there is a continuum of perfect foresight
paths, starting from an initial < , which converge asymptotically to L .
The multiple equilibria issue was emphasized in Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohe,
and Uribe (2001) and Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohe, and Uribe (2002), using
perfect foresight analysis, and was studied under adaptive learning in Evans
and Honkapohja (2005), Evans, Guse, and Honkapohja (2008) and Evans
and Honkapohja (2010).

The practical importance of the zero lower bound (ZLB) has become evident
in the US and Europe since the 2007-9 …nancial crisis, as well as in the US
during 2001-3 and in Japan since the mid 1990s.1 Recently Bullard (2010)
has stressed the risk of extended periods of de‡ation. These events have
led to extensive policy debates on the e¤ectiveness of both …scal policy and
quantitative easing when the economy is at the ZLB.
     In principle the multiplicity problem can be eliminated by suitable mone-
tary or …scal policies that ensures that in‡ation never falls below some value
    > L . For example, Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohe, and Uribe (2002) argue
that commitment to an aggressive …scal rule at low in‡ation rates would
eliminate multiple equilibria via the transversality condition and ensure that
under perfect foresight the economy will necessarily be at the steady state.
They argue that in some cases a commitment to su¢ cient monetary expan-
sion at low in‡ation can also be e¤ective. Similarly, Evans and Honkapohja
(2005) argue that in a ‡exible price economy a switch to a money growth rule,
if in‡ation threatens to fall below a threshold > L , will ensure convergence
to      under learning.2 Under perfect foresight this mechanism depends on
policy credibility and wealth e¤ects to eliminate all equilibria except the
steady state. There are however two problems with this approach: (i) it relies
too heavily on perfect foresight, and (ii) the mechanism is “too powerful”:
bad outcomes never happen.
     In this paper we explore policies designed to avoid and escape the ZLB
in New Keynesian (NK) models with agents who form expectations using
adaptive learning rules. We focus on NK models because, from the policy
viewpoint the problem with de‡ation has been associated with declining out-
put, high unemployment and/or stagnation. As we will see, these outcomes
can arise under learning if pessimistic expectations lead the economy into
the “de‡ation trap.”
     Under the learning approach a de‡ation trap is possible. This can most
easily be seen using the one-step ahead Euler-equation (EE) learning ap-
proach, but is also seen under in…nite-horizon (IH) learning. Can wealth
e¤ects, like the traditional Pigou e¤ect, ensure an eventual return to the
steady state? Under EE learning there is no role for wealth e¤ects, so we

(1998), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), and Svensson (2003).

     A discontinuous non-monotonic interest-rate rule, switching to R > = for
  L would also eliminate the multiplicity. However, under learning this rule introduces
instabilities.


                                           3
consider IH learning. In Evans and Honkapohja (2010) we still see de‡ation
traps under IH learning. The transversality condition (TVC) fails to rule
out de‡ationary spirals (lower and lower de‡ation rates) because the per-
ceived TVC is always met along these disequilibrium paths. What about
the direct wealth e¤ects of real money and bonds? In Evans and Honkapo-
hja (2010) these e¤ects also fail because households are assumed Ricardian.
Thus bonds and money are not perceived as net wealth. This raises the ques-
tion of whether wealth e¤ects would be e¤ective in avoiding de‡ation traps
if households do not have Ricardian consumption functions. We investigate
this issue in detail and …nd that wealth e¤ects can eventually return the
economy to the        steady state, but these mechanisms can be slow and in
some cases this e¤ect fails.3
     If wealth e¤ects or lower bounds on in‡ation are not su¢ cient to avoid
the de‡ation trap then …scal policy may be necessary. We therefore focus
on …scal policies. We …rst consider policies that implement a temporary
…scal stimulus or its converse, a policy of temporary …scal austerity, under
the assumption that future taxes adjust to keep the government solvent in
the long-run. Under such policies government spending is increased or de-
creased for a …xed span of time. If designed carefully, these policies can yield
convergence of the economy to the intended steady state, and avoid getting
stuck in the liquidity trap. We show that a …scal stimulus can be e¤ective,
i.e. deliver convergence, if its magnitude is su¢ cient and its duration is su¢ -
ciently short. Interestingly, a policy of …scal austerity, i.e. a temporary cut in
government spending, can also be e¤ective. This however requires the …scal
austerity period to be su¢ ciently long, and the degree of initial pessimism
in expectations to be relatively mild. One disadvantage of …scal stimulus
and …scal austerity policies is that both their magnitude and duration have
to be tailored to the initial expectations, so they require swift and precise
discretionary action.
     Therefore we turn to a second more automatic …scal policy, a “switching
…scal rule,”that ensures a return to the intended steady state . This policy
also eliminates the unintended steady state and ensures that the economy
does not get stuck in a regime of de‡ation and stagnation. An advantage
of this rule is that it is triggered automatically and does not require discre-
   3
     Another mechanism that can prevent a de‡ationary spiral is a lower bound            on
in‡ation due to asymmetric costs of price adjustment. However, it still can lead to falling
output, to stagnation, or to a very slow return to the  steady state. See Appendix.

2       The Model
We start with the same economic framework as in Evans, Guse, and Honkapo-
hja (2008). There is a continuum of household-…rms, which produce a dif-
ferentiated consumption good under monopolistic competition and price-
adjustment costs. There is also a government which uses both monetary
and …scal policy and can issue public debt as described below.
    The objective for agent s is to maximize expected, discounted utility
subject to a standard ‡ow budget constraint:

is also subject to the usual “no Ponzi game”condition.
    Production function for good s is given by

                                                           yt;s = ht;s ;

    We use the Rotemberg formulation in preference to the Calvo model of price stickiness
because it enables us to study global dynamics in the nonlinear system. The linearizations
at the targeted steady state are identical for the two approaches.

                                                                 5

listic competition. Each …rm faces a downward-sloping demand curve given
by

                                    yt;s
                           Pt;s =           Pt :                     (3)
                                    Yt
Here Pt;s is the pro…t maximizing price set by …rm s consistent with its
production yt;s . The parameter is the elasticity of substitution between
two goods and is assumed to be greater than one. Yt is aggregate output,
which is exogenous to the …rm.
   The government’s ‡ow budget constraint is
                                                   1                1
                bt + mt +    t   = gt + mt   1 t       + Rt   1 t       bt 1 ;   (4)

where gt denotes government consumption of the aggregate good, bt is the
real quantity of government debt, and t is the real lump-sum tax collected.
We assume that …scal policy follows a linear tax rule for lump-sum taxes as
in Leeper (1991)
                               t = 0 + bt 1 ;                           (5)
                                        1
where we will usually assume that           1 < < 1. This restriction on
  means that …scal policy is “passive” in the terminology of Leeper (1991)
and implies that an increase in real government debt leads to an increase in
taxes su¢ cient to cover the increased interest and at least some fraction of
the increased principal.
   Initially we assume that gt is constant and given by

                                      gt = g:                                    (6)

From market clearing we have

                                   ct + gt = yt :                                (7)

   Monetary policy is assumed to follow a global interest rate rule
                                             e      e
                            Rt     1=f       t+1 ; yt+1   :                      (8)

The function f ( ; y) is taken to be positive and non-decreasing in each ar-
gument. The rule (8) is a nonlinear forward-looking Taylor rule, where the
nominal rate is set by the central bank as a function of expected in‡ation


                                         6
and expected output.5 We assume the existence of ; R and y such that
R = 1 and f ( ; y ) = R            1. Here    can be viewed as the in‡ation
target of the Central Bank, and y is the natural rate of output, i.e. the level
of output compatible with steady state in‡ation : We assume that             1.
In the numerical analysis we will use the functional form

                                                                    AR =(R          1)       y        y

                     f ( ; y) = (R                 1)                                                     ;                  (9)
                                                                                             y
                                                               1
which implies the existence steady state at ( ; y ). Using R =   ; we
obtain f ( ; y ) = AR = = A 1 : We assume that A > 1. Equations
(6), (5) and (8) constitute “normal policy”.

where t+1;s = Pt+1;s =Pt;s . We now make use of the representative agent
assumption. In the representative-agent economy all agents s have the same
utility functions, initial money and debt holdings, and prices. We assume
also that they make the same forecasts Et;s ct+1;s Et;s t+1;s , Et;s t+1 , as well
as forecasts of other variables that will become relevant below. Under these
assumptions all agents make the same decisions at each point in time, so that
ht;s = ht , yt;s = yt , ct;s = ct and t;s = t , and all agents make the same

rule, which is used in Evans, Guse, and Honkapohja (2008).

   For convenience we make the assumptions 1 = 2 = 1, i.e. utility of
consumption and of money is logarithmic. It is also assumed that agents
have point expectations, so that their decisions depend only on the mean of
their subjective forecasts. This allows us to write the system as
                                          mt =             (1           R t 1 ) 1 ct ;                                             (11)

                                                                          (13)
Equation (13) is the nonlinear New Keynesian Phillips curve that describes
the optimal price-setting by …rms. The term ( t 1) t arises from the
quadratic form of the adjustment costs, and this expression is increasing
in t over the allowable range t        1=2: To interpret this equation, note
that the bracketed expression in the …rst term on the right-hand side is the
di¤erence between the marginal disutility of labor and the product of the
marginal revenue from an extra unit of labor with the marginal utility of
consumption. The terms involving current and future in‡ation arise from
the price-adjustment costs resulting from marginal variations in labor sup-
ply. Equation (12) is the standard Euler equation giving the intertemporal
…rst-order condition for the consumption path. Equation (11) is the money
demand function resulting from the presence of real balances in the utility
function. Note that for our parameterization, the demand for real balances
becomes in…nite as Rt ! 1.
    We now proceed to rewrite the decision rules for ct and t so that they
depend on forecasts of key variables over the in…nite horizon. The IH learning
approach in New Keynesian models was …rst emphasized by Preston (2005)
and Preston (2006), and was used in Evans and Honkapohja (2010) to study
the properties of a liquidity trap.

                                                                   8
2.2       The in…nite-horizon Phillips curve
We start with an in…nite-horizon version of the Phillips curve (13). Let

                                     Qt = (      t       1)     t:                                     (14)
                                       1
The appropriate root for given Q is    2
                                         and so we need to impose Q
  1
  4
    to have a meaningful model. Making use of the aggregate relationships
      1=
ht = yt and ct = yt gt we can rewrite (13) as

                               (1+")=             1                         1
                   Qt =       yt                       yt (yt        gt )       + Qet+1 :

Solving this forward with gt = g; we obtain

                          (1+")=          1                      1
          Qt =          yt                    yt (yt      g)         +                                 (15)

                                                                            1            e
                                                                                        yt+j
                               1 j    e                                           j

                       j=1                                               j=1
                                                                                      yt+j     g

where government spending is assumed to be constant over time. The ex-
pectations are formed at time t and variables at time t are assumed to be in
the information set of the agents. We will treat (15), together with (14), as
the temporary equilibrium equations that determine t ; given expectations
   e
fyt+j  g1
        j=1 . Later, we will consider a case where gt varies over time and then
 e                       e
yt+j g becomes netyt+j       = (yt+j gt+j )e in equation (15).
     In the Phillip’s curve relationship (15) one might wonder why in‡ation
does not also depend directly on the expected future aggregate in‡ation rate.6
Equation (10) is obtained from the …rst-order conditions using (3) to elim-
inate relative prices. Because of the representative agent assumption, each
…rm’s output equals average output in every period. Since …rms can be as-
sumed to have learned this to be the case, we obtain (15). An alternative
procedure would be to start from (10), iterate it forward and use the demand
function to write the third term on the right-hand side of (10) in terms of
the relative price. This would lead to a modi…cation of (15) in which future
relative prices also appear, but using the representative agent assumption
and assuming that …rms have learned that all …rms set the same price each
period, the relative price term would drop out.
  6
      There is an indirect e¤ect of expected in‡ation on current in‡ation via current output.

2.3     The consumption function
To derive the consumption function from (12) we use the ‡ow budget con-
straint and the NPG (no Ponzi game) to obtain an intertemporal budget
constraint. First, we de…ne the asset wealth

                                                  at = bt + m t

as the sum of holdings of real bonds and real money balances and write the
‡ow budget constraint as
                                                                           1
                  at + ct = yt                t   + rt at    1   +     t       (1     Rt 1 )mt 1 ;       (16)

where rt = Rt 1 = t . Note that we assume (Pjt =Pt )yjt = yt , i.e. the rep-
resentative agent assumption is being invoked. Iterating (16) forward and

3        Temporary Equilibrium and Learning
3.1           Equilibrium Conditions
We now assume that agents form expectations using steady state learning,
which is formulated as follows. Steady-state learning with point expectations
is formalized as
                   set+j = set for all j                 1; and set = set         1   + ! t (st     1        set 1 )            (24)

                                                                  11
for s = y; z; nety; . Here ! t is called the “gain sequence,” and measures
the extent of adjustment of estimates to the most recent forecast error. In
stochastic systems one often sets ! t = t 1 and this “decreasing gain”learning
corresponds to least-squares updating. Also widely used is the case ! t = !,
for 0 < !      1, called “constant gain” learning. In this case it is usually
assumed that ! is small.7 Stability of the steady states is examined below
using the simple learning rules just described.
    The temporary equilibrium equations with steady state learning are:

   The state variables are bt 1 , mt 1 , and Rt 1 . The system in general has
four expectational variables: output yte , in‡ation et , income net of taxes zte
and net output netyte . In cases where government spending is constant we
have netyte = yte g, so that it is not necessary to introduce expectations of
net output separately. The evolution of expectations is given by

We note that equation (33) is used below only in cases where the households
are Non-Ricardian.

3.2     The Case of Ricardian Consumers
The preceding derivation of the consumption function assumes households
that do not act in a Ricardian way, i.e. they do not impose the intertemporal
budget constraint (IBC) of the government. For Ricardian consumers we
modify the consumption function as in Evans and Honkapohja (2010).8 From
(4) one has
                  bt + mt +     t   = gt + mt 1 t 1 + rt bt 1 or
                               bt   =    t + rt bt 1 where

                                t   = gt      t    mt + mt 1 t 1 :

    Evans, Honkapohja, and Mitra (2012) state the assumptions under which Ricardian
Equivalence holds along a path of temporary equilibria with learning if agents have an
in…nite decision horizon.

Note that t+j is the primary government de…cit in t + j, measured as gov-
ernment purchases less lump-sum taxes and less seigniorage. Under the Ri-
cardian Equivalence assumption, we assume that agents at each time t expect
this constraint to be satis…ed, i.e.

    A Ricardian consumer assumes that (35) holds. His ‡ow budget con-
straint (16) can be written as:

                        bt = r t bt               1   +        t,
                                                                where
                                                                                       1

The relevant transversality condition is now (35). Iterating forward and using
(21) together with (35) yields the consumption function

In this case we can assume that netyt+j  = yt+j    g. For simplicity, in this

the aggregate output equation

The temporary equilibrium is now given by the Phillips curve (26), the out-
put equation with Ricardian consumption function (38) and the independent
equation for the evolution of debt and money. Note that the Ricardian sys-
tem just depends on expectations of output and in‡ation, so that the paths
of in‡ation and output do not depend on the evolution of bonds and real
balances. The (small gain) dynamics can therefore be described by the E-
stability di¤erential equation using a two-dimensional phase diagram. (See
Evans and Honkapohja (2001).)

Steady states are de…ned by R = 1 + f ( ) together with the the Fisher
                      1
relationship R =        . For A > 1 there are two steady states, (y ; ) and
(yL ; L ) with L < . Local E-stability results for the Ricardian case are
given by Proposition 2 of Evans and Honkapohja (2010): the       steady state
is locally stable under learning, while for small , the L steady state is
locally unstable under learning, with the local learning dynamics taking the
form of a saddle.9
    One can also look at the global learning dynamics using a phase diagram.
For typical parameter value the learning dynamics are as shown in Figure
2. The …gure is constructed with the following parameter values A = 2:5,
    = 1:02, = 0:99, = 0:7, = 350, = 21, " = 1, and g = 0:2. While
A = 1:5 is the usual value for the interest rate rule, we choose A = 2:5 to

     Instability of the low in‡ation steady state under learning and the divergent paths were
earlier described in McCallum (2002), Eusepi (2007), and Evans, Guse, and Honkapohja
(2008). Bullard and Cho (2005) show the possibility of “escape paths” toward the low-
in‡ation outcome.

clearly separate the intended and unintended steady states in the numerical
analysis. Our results are robust to using A = 1:5: The calibrations of the
target in‡ation rate ; the discount factor ; the labor share ; and the
approximate GDP share of government spending, g are standard. We set
the labor supply elasticity " = 1: The value of = 21 was chosen so that the
implied markup of prices over marginal cost at the steady state is 5 percent,
which is consistent with the evidence presented by Basu and Fernald (1997).
Following Sbordone (2002), we set , the parameter governing the disutility
of deviating from the in‡ation target, at       = 17:5(1 + ) = 350. We
                                              e
also assume that interest rate expectations rt+j = Rt+j 1 = et+j revert to the
steady state value 1 for j T . In Figure 2 we use T = 28; which under a
quarterly calibration corresponds to 7 years.10




          Figure 2: Global learning dynamics –the Ricardian case.
    The main features that stand out are …rst, the local stability of the
steady state. There is in fact a “corridor of stability” de…ned by a set of
expectations that converge to the         steady state. (The term “corridor” is
due to Leijonhufvud (1973).) This corridor is de…ned by the region enclosed
within the stable manifold of the unintended steady state (yL ; L ). Second,
we see that convergence to        is locally cyclical. Third, it can be seen that
there is a heteroclinic orbit connecting the L steady state with the steady
state. Finally, we observe that for initial points outside the corridor of stabil-
ity the trajectory of expectations is (at least eventually) led into a de‡ation
trap in which (y e ; e ) fall steadily over time. Along these paths we have
  10
    This choice is roughly in line with data on the aftermath of …nancial crises. See
Reinhart and Rogo¤ (2009).

                                         16
falling actual output and in‡ation, intensifying as de‡ation sets in. Even
though the …nancial wealth of agents is getting very large over time along
such a de‡ationary path, Ricardian agents do not respond by su¢ ciently in-
creasing consumption, as they expect that the increase in their wealth will
be o¤set by future growth in taxes.

3.3    Wealth E¤ects and Non-Ricardian Consumers
We next consider Non-Ricardian consumers. A traditional argument against
the liquidity trap dates back to Pigou (1943) and Patinkin (1965). In prin-
ciple, wealth e¤ects could prevent a de‡ation trap: if declining prices lead
to higher perceived wealth, agents will increase their spending. This can be
investigated numerically. Our simulations indicate that wealth e¤ects can
indeed stabilize the economy at , although in some cases we have paths
that converge to L , accompanied by exploding debt.
     The dynamics under learning when consumers are not Ricardian are given
in sub-section 3.1. These describe the temporary equilibrium, and the adjust-
ment of expectations. Taken together they constitute the dynamic system
that determines the real-time evolution of the economy. Because government
bonds and real balances are state variables that a¤ect consumption and out-
put, expectations y e ; e are no longer su¢ cient statistics for the economy
and it is now not possible to characterize the dynamics of the system using
a phase diagram as in (39) and Figure 2. We therefore directly simulate the
real-time dynamics of the system under learning.
     To illustrate the possibility of wealth e¤ects successfully leading the econ-
omy back to the targeted steady state we provide a numerical simulation.
Assume that initial expectations are pessimistic, with e (0) = 0:9425 and
y e (0) = 0:9925: These expectations are below the low in‡ation steady state
values and therefore in the de‡ation trap region when households are Ricar-
dian. In the case of non-Ricardian households discussed in Section 2.3 the
evolution of output and in‡ation also depend on wealth dynamics. We are
interested in whether these wealth dynamics can lead the economy to the
targeted steady state. We …nd that this indeed is possible, but that there
is sensitivity to the tax policy parameters and to the initial wealth of the
households.
     As an illustration consider the tax function (5) with 0 = 0:05 and =



                                       17
   1
       1 + 0:001, so that …scal policy is passive in the sense of Leeper (1991).11
We set = 0:03 to match the fraction of real balances to consumption (see
(30)), and we set the gain parameter ! = 0:01: The initial values of real
balances and real bonds are m(0) = 0:75 and b(0) = 0:77, which are close to
the values of m and b at the targeted steady state for this tax function.
Figure 3 illustrates the dynamics of in‡ation and output from this starting
point.

       Figure 3: In‡ation, output dynamics with non-Ricardian consumers

    Figure 3 shows actual in‡ation and output on horizontal and vertical axes,
respectively. There is a wide clockwise cycle where in‡ation and output at
…rst overshoot ( ; y ); then spiral below ( L ; yL ) and …nally follow a cyclical
convergent path to ( ; y ). The time paths of money and bonds eventually
also converge to their steady state values. Thus, in this example wealth e¤ects
do lead to eventual convergence to the targeted steady state, in contrast to
the divergent de‡ationary path that would arise with Ricardian consumers.
However, the path in Figure 3 has an extended period of low output and
substantial de‡ation followed by big swings in in‡ation and output.
    Convergence from pessimistic initial expectations to the targeted steady
state appears to be robust with respect to the level of initial wealth (in
  11
    The other parameters are set at their previous values. The value of y = 50 corre-
sponds to the output coe¢ cient of linearized Taylor rule of 0:5 at the intended steady
state.

particular real bonds) for this value of the tax parameter = 1 1+0:001.
We …nd convergence from various starting values of m(0) and b(0); except
for initial bond values b(0) at levels that are very high, for example 20 times
that of GDP or higher. This result however is sensitive to the value of
                                                 1
  . If is decreased, for example to =                1 0:001       0:0091, then
levels of money and bonds eventually explode. The reason is that now …scal
policy is active in the sense of Leeper (1991). At the unintended steady
state, monetary policy is passive, and learning dynamics lead the economy
towards the intended steady state. However, at the intended steady state,
both …scal and monetary policies are now necessarily active, and …nancial
wealth levels will diverge. We have examined this case numerically for non-
Ricardian consumers and found that it leads to instability under learning. In
simulations the economy appears to move around the targeted steady state
for a period but eventually bonds follow an explosive path and the economy
diverges.12
    From a policy perspective, under some circumstances it is possible for
wealth e¤ects to provide a mechanism for the economy to escape from a
de‡ationary situation and to return eventually to the targeted steady state.
However, this mechanism relies on consumers being non-Ricardian and on
appropriate tax policy. Furthermore, the path back to the targeted steady
state is cyclical with wide swings in in‡ation and output.


4      Fiscal Policy
We now examine the role of …scal policy when large adverse expectation
shocks make de‡ation traps and stagnation a serious risk.13 We focus on
changes in government purchases of goods and services, rather than tax
changes with unchanged government spending, because in our set-up, if
households are Ricardian, then tax changes by themselves are neutral. In
practice, tax changes …nanced by changes in government debt can have
  12
     These results are not surprising in view of the (‡exible-price, short decision-horizon)
results in Evans and Honkapohja (2005). In that paper under steady state learning there is
convergence to     but with debt exploding under active …scal policy. In the current paper
with non-Ricardian households the explosive debt path eventually destabilizes in‡ation
and output as well.
  13
     Evans and Honkapohja (2010) show that for some points within the de‡ation trap
region, even committing to zero net nominal interest rates forever may be insu¢ cient for
escaping the in‡ation trap.


                                            19
macroeconomic e¤ects, e.g. if some households are liquidity constrained or
are non-Ricardian.14 However, our objective is to demonstrate that suitable
…scal rules, based on temporary increases in government spending, can pre-
vent the economy from falling into or becoming stuck in the de‡ation trap
and can return the economy to the targeted steady state, even if tax changes
by themselves are neutral. Therefore in this section we focus on Ricardian
households. We will brie‡y return to the non-Ricardian consumers in the
next section.

4.1     Temporary Fiscal Stimulus
A traditional countercyclical policy for an economy facing de‡ation with
declining or stagnant output is a …scal stimulus taking the form of increased
government expenditures above their normal levels for a …nite time horizon,
after which they revert to lower levels. We want to study the e¤ectiveness of
such a policy under the Ricardian assumption that the government remains
solvent in the long run, and that consumers know and expect this. In this IH
learning framework agents know the trajectory of government expenditures,
including the date at which the expenditures will return to lower levels,
and they incorporate this knowledge into their optimal consumption and
pricing decisions. Then the consumption function, aggregate demand and
the Phillips curve re‡ect these forward-looking expectations of the agents.
    More explicitly, we consider a simple case of anticipated changes in gov-
ernment policy. Suppose that there is an initial pessimistic expectations
shock that lowers e (0) and y e (0) su¢ ciently so that the economy is in the
de‡ation trap region. Under normal policy the economy will fail to return
to the targeted steady state. We therefore consider …scal policies in which
there is a temporary increase in g (from its initial steady state level g = g1 ),
taking the form
                                 g0 for t = 0; :::; T0
                         gt =                          ;
                                g1 for t = T0 + 1; :::
where g0 > g1 . Here we assume that the policy is announced at t = 0 and is
credible. Thus agents understand that government spending will be contin-
ued at the higher level g0 through period T0 and that it will be reduced to its
previous level beginning at T0 + 1. We are here studying the economy under

adaptive learning, but with anticipated future policy changes, as discussed
in Evans, Honkapohja, and Mitra (2009).
   For gross output agents are assumed to have expectations given by the
simple adaptive rules described in Section 3. For net output, however, ex-
pectations are given by

                                      yje g0 for j = t; :::; T0
                         netyje =                               ;                               (40)
                                     yje g1 for j = T0 + 1; :::

so that agents incorporate the known future path of government spending
into their forecasts.
    The variables netyje that appear in the Phillips curve (15), and in the
consumption function (37) are now de…ned according to (40). This requires
evaluating the weighted sums of netyje using the appropriate value of govern-
ment expenditures for each j. The computations are straightforward, and
the consumption function is now given by:

                                                 1      (rte )t T0                 (rte )t T0
     ct = (1        ) yt      g0 + (yte   g0 )                     + (yte   g1 )
                                                     (rte ) 1                      (rte ) 1

   For the interest rate rule (9) we set A = 2:5 and y = 50, a calibration
approximately consistent with the standard Taylor-rule parameters.

               4 :png
                        Figure 4: y and    under a …scal stimulus.

    Given a speci…c …scal stimulus, we can proceed as in Section 3.2, except
that we now report real-time dynamics based on the adaptive learning rules
of Section 3. Figure 4 illustrates one example of the dynamics of output and
in‡ation for T0 = 6, and with g0 = 0:21, g1 = 0:2. Thus there is a …scal
stimulus, taking the form of a 5% increase in government spending for six

                                             21
periods. We set initial expectations at y e [0] = 0:9425 and e [0] = 0:993.
These are in the de‡ation trap region, and without the …scal stimulus there
would be falling in‡ation and output. Under the …scal stimulus the economy
instead converges to the intended steady state, though after a wide swing
that takes in‡ation well above the intended steady state.
    An important feature of the policy is that the length of the temporary
…scal stimulus is crucial for its e¢ cacy. For example, if, holding g0 = 0:21,
g1 = 0:2, we set T0 = 1; 2 or T0 37 then the …scal stimulus does not enable
the economy to return to the targeted steady state. In fact, the size of the
stimulus and the degree of pessimism of expectations also matter for the
e¢ cacy of …scal stimulus. We now examine this more systematically.15
    We consider four di¤erent degrees of pessimism of expectations as follows:
    Mild: e = 0:993 and y e = 0:9425.
    Large: e = 0:991 and y e = 0:9425
    Severe: e = 0:985 and y e = 0:9425
    Extreme: e = 0:985 and y e = 0:9.
We …nd that a temporary …scal stimulus always works for a range of govern-
ment spending g0 and length of stimulus T0 . For T0 = 1, a temporary …scal
stimulus works for su¢ ciently large g0 : Often, increasing length of stimulus
T0 somewhat allow the use of a smaller value of g0 to achieve convergence to
the intended steady state.
    Some speci…c results are as follows:
Mild pessimism: g0 = 0:205 yields desired convergence for stimulus of
length T0 = 11; : : : ; 22, while with this g0 , the policy fails if T0 is outside this
range. A smaller value of g0 = 0:204 is never e¤ective while g0 = :25 makes
the T0 range larger.
Large pessimism: A large value of spending g0 = 0:25 delivers desired
convergence for T0 = 1; : : : ; 37. A smaller value g0 = 0:21 fails.
Severe pessimism: With T0 = 1, g0 = 0:34 is e¤ective.
Extreme pessimism: With T0 = 5, g0 = 0:8 is e¤ective.
    Thus, the …scal stimulus must be adequate in size and length to push
the economy out of the de‡ation trap region. The intuition for these results
is that the demand stimulus from a temporary increase in g outweighs the
  15
    Also the parameter T describing statistical forecasting horizon a¤ects the quantitative
results. Through period t + T agents use their forecasts e (t), whereas after t + T , they
                                                                    e          1
assume that the real interest rate has reverted to normal and set rt+j (t) =     for j > T .
We set T = 28 i.e. agents think it will take 7 years for real interest rates to return to
normal steady state.


                                            22
partially o¤setting reduced consumption from the higher present value of
taxes, which for Ricardian households equals the present value of government
spending. A permanent increase in g in this set-up does not lift the economy
out of the de‡ation trap, because the permanently higher taxes exactly o¤set
the increase in government spending. In contrast, a large enough increase in
government spending for a limited period will add enough stimulus to lead
the economy back to the targeted steady state.

4.2     Fiscal Austerity
Perhaps surprisingly, it turns out that a carefully designed restrictive …scal
policy can in certain cases lift the economy out of the liquidity trap, provided
it is applied for a su¢ cient long period of time. We now examine this pos-
sibility for the di¤erent degrees of pessimism of expectations.16 The results
are as follows:
Mild pessimism: cutting government spending to g0 = 0:19 is e¤ective in
moving the economy out of the de‡ation trap when the length of the policy
is in the range T0 33 but this policy fails for smaller values of T0 : A more
severe policy g0 = 0:15 is e¤ective also for T0 28.
Large pessimism: g0 = 0:19 is e¤ective for length T0 67.
Severe pessimism: g0 = 0:15 is e¤ective for length T0 100:
Extreme pessimism: Fiscal austerity is never e¤ective.
    We remark that in terms of the length of policy T0 ; stimulus and austerity
policies have an interesting contrast. The e¢ cacy of the former requires a
limited duration whereas a very long period of the latter is necessary. In
all our examples the e¢ cacy of stimulus policies imply that the austerity
policies of same absolute magnitude and duration are not e¤ective and vice
versa. However, there are also cases for which neither policy is e¤ective for
certain intermediate durations. As an example consider the stimulus policy
g0 = 0:25 under mild pessimism for a forecasting horizon T = 60: A stimulus
policy with T0 25 is ine¤ective in lifting the economy out of the de‡ation
trap as is an austerity policy of g0 = 0:15 for T0 < 28.
    In general, we note that e¢ cacy of austerity policies is more sensitive to
the degree of pessimism of expectations as suggested by the following subtle
intuition. If the economy is in a region in which the ex-ante real interest rate
  16
    In this section the forecasting horizon is set at T = 60: For shorter horizons, for
example for T = 28; …scal austerity seems to be ine¤ective. On the other hand, temporary
…scal stimuli continue to be e¤ective for large values of T:

                                          23

factor is less than      then the consumption function dictates an increase
in consumption ‡ow stemming from a …xed permanent decrease in taxes,
which is larger than the decrease in g. The present value is the same when
                                       1
measured by re , but because re <        , households will substitute toward
current consumption. Formally consider a permanent change in government
spending to g0 < g1 : Then actual output, for given expectations, is given by
               1                                      1
 yt = g0 + (       1)(yte   g0 )=(rte   1) > g1 + (       1)(yte   g1 )=(rte   1);

provided 1 > rte : This e¤ect only holds for a range of e in which monetary
policy delivers a low re . For larger de‡ation rates, however, i.e. e < 0:985,
this policy cannot work for initial expectations in which e (t) falls over time
under normal policy. Thus for su¢ ciently pessimistic initial expectations we
would expect permanent or very long cuts in government spending to fail as
a policy that takes the economy to a steady state.
    The above analysis also implies that under adaptive learning, whether
households are Ricardian or not, a …scal stimulus can give rise to a “…scal
multiplier”quite di¤erent than a policy of …scal austerity, depending on the
magnitude and duration of the policy and on the initial expectations. This
suggests that in an adaptive learning context, results of empirical studies
of the …scal multiplier will be sensitive to initial expectations and to the
duration and magnitude of policies.
    In this section we have shown that the success of the temporary …scal pol-
icy in general depends on …ne tuning the magnitude, direction and duration
of the policy. We next look at an endogenous switching rule for government
spending that eliminates de‡ation and stagnation and that also appears to
have reasonable performance overall.


5    Fiscal Switching Rules
To prevent de‡ationary spirals, or de‡ation with declining or stagnant out-
put, we now explore government spending policies designed to keep in‡ation
above a certain threshold ~ > L : When e > ~ the government sets g = g:
However, if expected in‡ation drops below ~ ; and actual in‡ation would be
below expected in‡ation with g = g, then the government increases g to
achieve an output level y such that realized in‡ation exceeds expected in‡a-
tion et . We will call such a …scal policy rule a …scal switching rule.


                                        24
   To implement this …scal switching policy, we assume that the government
monitors expectations. Given expectations, from equation (25); it can set g
to achieve a level of y:17 From equations (26), (27) and (28) it is apparent
that y can be chosen to attain the required level of in‡ation. This procedure
ensures that eventually e      ~ : We simulate this economy using the same
parameters used in Figure 4 above for Ricardian consumers, except that we
now use the …scal switching rule.18
              Fig50




                   5 :png
       Figure 5: y and      under a …scal switching rule, Ricardian households
    Two further points should be noted about this form of …scal policy. First,
it is not necessary to decide in advance the magnitude and duration of the
…scal stimulus. Second, in contrast to the preceding section we now do not
assume that agents know the future path of government spending. Instead
agents use adaptive learning to forecast the future values of their net income
in addition to forecasts of in‡ation and output.
  17
      In e¤ect the government observes in‡ation monthly, and would be able to adjust
spending in order to maintain ~ < on a quarterly basis. Aggressive automatic stabilizers
may be useful for this purpose.
   18
      The results are essentially unchanged if we modify the interest rate rule so that the
nominal rate now depends on the net output expectations relative to net output at targeted
steady state. An interest rate rule based on net output may appear more appealing because
it would insure that monetary policy does not work against the …scal stimulus when the
economy is subject to a de‡ation trap. However, in our simulations interest rates remain
near zero during the initial …scal stimulus, so using gross rather than net output for the
interest rate rule makes little di¤erence.

                                            25
    We start with the case in which consumers are Ricardian. In contrast
to the economy depicted in Figure 2, the …scal switching rule eliminates the
unintended steady state with the in‡ation rate L : the path starting in the
vicinity of L converges to the intended steady state. This is illustrated in
Figure 5. A strong …scal stimulus generates a steep rise in output and lifts
the economy out of the de‡ation trap and the economy eventually converges
to the intended steady state. For initial expectations in Figure 5, which are
the same as in Figure 4, the dynamics would be unstable without the …scal
switching rule.
        Fig60




              6 :png
  Figure 6: y and      dynamics under …scal switching rule, non-Ricardian
                                 households
    The results with non-Ricardian consumers are similar: the …scal switching
rule eliminates the unintended steady state L : Figure 6, using the same
parameters used for the non-Ricardian case of Figure 3, illustrates these
results.
    As illustrated in Figures 5 and 6, in both Ricardian and Non-Ricardian
cases the …scal switching rule, together with our interest rate rule, yields con-
vergence to the targeted steady state after an initial overshooting of in‡ation
and output. The overshooting arises from the necessary big initial policy
responses that are needed to counteract the initial pessimistic expectations.
We also checked that with this combination of rules there is convergence to
the targeted steady state from even more pessimistic initial expectations.
    In summary, our analysis suggests that one policy that might be used
to combat stagnation and de‡ation, in the face of pessimistic expectations,

                                       26
would consist of a …scal switching rule combined with a Taylor-type rule for
monetary policy. The …scal switching rule applies when in‡ation expecta-
tions falls below a critical value. The rule speci…es increased government
spending to raise in‡ation above in‡ation expectations in order to ensure
that in‡ation is gradually increased until expected in‡ation exceeds the crit-
ical threshold. This part of the policy eliminates the unintended steady state
and makes sure that the economy does not get stuck in a regime of de‡ation
and stagnation. Furthermore, unlike the temporary …scal policies discussed
in the previous section, the switching rules do not require …ne tuning and
are triggered automatically. Remarkably, our simulations indicate that this
combination of policies is successful regardless of whether the households are
Ricardian or non-Ricardian.


6    Conclusion
We have studied how the an economy can fall into a de‡ation or low in‡ation
trap with declining or stagnant output, and explored the design of policies
to avoid such outcomes. Under the perfect foresight view, announced money
growth and/or …scal policies can in principle avoid low in‡ation. The ef-
fectiveness of such policies however depends on the assumption of perfect
foresight, on policy credibility, and on wealth e¤ects to eliminate all equilib-
ria except the targeted      steady state. Furthermore such policies are “too
powerful”under perfect foresight: bad outcomes never happen.
    If we adopt a more plausible adaptive learning view, outcomes with low
in‡ation and output are still possible. We …nd that policies of temporary
…scal stimulus, and in some cases …scal austerity, can eliminate liquidity traps
and can lead the economy back to its intended steady state. However, such
policies require careful …ne tuning of the magnitude, direction and duration of
the policy. A “…scal switching rule”that automatically triggers a stimulus of
high government expenditures when in‡ation falls below a critical threshold is
equally e¤ective in stabilizing the economy, but does not require complicated
and discretionary …ne tuning, and therefore seems preferable.

7        Appendix: Asymmetric Price Adjustment
If the costs of price adjustment are asymmetric and are higher for reductions
in prices, then this can provide a lower bound on de‡ation.19 Consider for
example the case where the cost of price adjustment in the utility function
takes the form
                                  ( s;t 1)2 for s;t
                      Cost =    2
                                    +1 for s;t < ;
where s;t = Ps;t =Ps;t 1 . To examine the implications of asymmetric price-
adjustment costs, we return to the case of Ricardian consumers discussed in
Section 3.2. The temporary equilibrium map for in‡ation is modi…ed to

                                  G2 (yt ; yte ) for G2 (yt ; yte )
                          t   =
                                          for G2 (yt ; yte ) < :

Because the Ricardian case is a forward-looking two-dimensional system with
adaptive learning, one can illustrate the possible results using phase diagrams
showing the expectational learning dynamics. There are three cases:

    1.     > L . In this case          is globally stable, since      <   L   is no longer
         possible.

    2.     < L : The de‡ation trap continues to exist. If L        is small,
                                  e
         however, in the region <   < L there is gradually falling output.

    3.     = L . The stagnation regime. In this case there can be convergence
         to any 0 < y < yL with = L .

     Figures 7 illustrates the phase diagram for the E-stability di¤erential
equations in ( e ; y e )-space for the case  < L in which a de‡ation trap
continues to exist. In this case the targeted steady state    is locally stable
and, as can be seen, the basin of attraction can be fairly large. However,
if output expectations are low, the economy may converge to the trap even
if initially in‡ation expectations are low but above L . The main di¤erence
from the symmetric price-adjustment cost set-up examined in the paper is
that de‡ation is now bounded from below at rate . Thus, in this case,
persistently low and falling output is compatible with steady de‡ation at low
levels.
 19
      See Evans (2012) for the stagnation regime.

                                              28
            Figure 7: asymmetric cost adjustment with        <   L:


     We brie‡y describe the other two cases of asymmetric adjustment costs.
In all cases the targeted steady state is locally stable under learning. If
   = L , there is also a locally stable continuum of steady states at         =
 L =      and y < yL , where yL is the level of output associated with the
usual L steady state. E-stability dynamics indicate that under learning the
economy can converge to any point on the continuum from initial conditions
 e
   (0) & and y e (0) su¢ ciently low. Similar convergence to the continuum
can happen for initial e (0) . and y e (0) su¢ ciently low. In the case > L
the economy under learning is globally stable at the targeted steady state
   . However, for only slightly above L , pessimistic initial expectations
( (0); y e (0)) can lead to extended periods of low output and mild de‡ation
   e

before in‡ation expectations are pulled up towards and a recovery begins.
     As noted, for example, by Bullard (2010), we do observe economies ex-
hibiting extended periods of very low in‡ation or mild de‡ation. The cases
  = L and < L show that steady mild de‡ation is consistent with a de-
‡ation trap region that leads to persistently falling or persistently low levels
of output. The analysis of …scal policy provided in this paper could easily be
extended to the various cases of asymmetric price adjustment.
