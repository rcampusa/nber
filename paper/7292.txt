        Since 1977, and in some cases starting before that, most East Asian countries’ export patterns in
manufacturing have been transformed from industry distributions typical of developing countries to
distributions more like those of advanced countries. The process of change in most cases started with
inward FDI to produce for export in the new industries, particularly by U.S. firms in electronics and
computer-related machinery. The U.S. firms were followed, in electronics, by Japanese multinationals.
Over time, in most cases, the U.S.-owned affiliates turned more to sales in host-country markets and their
share in host country exports declined, although the host countries’ specializations in the new industries
continued.
        U.S. and Japanese firms played somewhat different roles. U.S. firms’ investments were always
distributed more along the lines of U.S. export comparative advantage, far from the previous patterns of
the host countries. The industry distribution of Japanese investments initially followed more the lines of the
host countries’ comparative advantage and Japanese affiliates were less export-oriented than U.S. affiliates.
However, Japanese affiliates have become more like U.S. affiliates in both export orientation and industry
composition.    Their early concentration in textiles and apparel faded and they are more heavily
concentrated than U.S. affiliates and more export-oriented in both electrical machinery and transport
equipment.

Introduction

         FDI is one of the Main avenues for the movement of technology and modern business methods

across national borders. FDI from the more developed countries is presumably more likely to carry

advanced technology than that from developing countries. Developing countries, those in Asia have

been among the more receptive to inward direct investment than those in other regions. Of all the direct

investment by developed countries in the developing countries of Asia, the United States and Japan

account for by far the largest shares, together over 80 per cent of the outward FDI stock from

developed countries at the end of 1996 (OECD, 1998). This combination of reasons is the motivation

for the focus in this paper on the roles of U.S. and Japanese multinationals (MNCs), in particular the

affiliates of these MNCs, in the growth and composition of production and trade in the countries of East

Asia.

         There are two basic types of data with which one can study the role of multinational firms in the

host countries where they operate. One type is home country data on the foreign activities of the

multinational firms based there. The other is host country data on the activities of foreign-owned firms

within their borders. Each type of data has advantages and drawbacks. The home country data have

the advantage of comparability across host countries and coverage of all host countries, although not

always in published form for each of them individually. The U.S. data have a high degree of coverage of

U.S. investing firms and extensive published descriptions of the data. Unfortunately, few home countries

collect such data and among those few, Japan issues data that are deficient in many respects

(Ramstetter, 1996, and Lipsey, Blomström, and Ramstetter, 1998). The U.S. data, despite their high

quality, suffer from the extensive suppression of information for confidentiality reasons, especially for

individual countries, industries, and industries within countries. Because of the suppressions, we

alternate here between two definitions of developing Asia. One is called by that name and covers all

Asia and Oceania except the Middle East, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. The other consists of

eight individual entities, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea (South), Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.

These account for over 85 percent of sales of U.S. affiliates in “Developing Asia.”

        Host country data have the advantage of comparability within each country. There is

comparability between information on foreign-owned firms or establishments and on domestically-

owned ones and among data for establishments owned by different home countries. They are

presumably comparable with respect to definitions, such as those for sales, employment, wages, value

added, and other variables, and also with respect to industry definitions. However, there are differences

from host country to host country in industry coverage, size or type of firm coverage, and in definitions

of concepts and industries, so that regional summations are questionable. For that reason, this paper,

with its concentration on the region, is based mainly on home country data, but some comparisons with

host country data are added in the discussions of individual countries.

        This paper is focussed mainly on the role of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in the

development of the exports of their host countries, with some attention also to their role in the

development of host country production. One reason for this focus is that MNEs play a particularly




                                                                                                       2
large role in trade, larger than in host country production, at least in manufacturing and mining, and

especially larger than in employment. Another reason is that there exists, in comprehensive and long

term series on the trade of individual countries, classified by product, a natural basis for comparison

between the activities of the MNEs and those of other firms within host countries. Some much less

detailed data are available on production in some host countries, covering shorter time periods than

those of the trade data.

        An additional difference between production for export and production for host country

domestic sales is that export production is probably more footloose and less under the influence of host

country governments’ restrictions than production for local sale, although export production can be

influenced by host country incentives. Given that incentives are expensive to host governments, the

pattern of exports may reflect the comparative advantages of the host countries better than the more

easily influenced production for domestic use.

        An earlier examination of the role of multinational firms in developing country trade concluded

that in the late 1960s and the 1970s, when exports of manufactured goods by developing Asian

countries grew by almost 800 per cent, U.S. affiliates were the sources of about 6&1/2 per cent of that

growth, and of an increasing share of exports. Up to 1983, the export growth of these countries was to

almost 20 times the 1966 level and U.S. firms accounted for a little over 6 per cent of the increase.

Over a shorter period, from 1974 to 1983, Japanese firms’ affiliates were responsible for another 7 per

cent, so that the two sets of foreign firms together may have been responsible for about 13 per cent of

the export growth, not an insignificant share but certainly not a dominant one ( Blomström, Lipsey, and

Kravis, 1988).




                                                                                                         3
        The roles of the two countries’ MNCs in developing Asia in these early years become clearer if

we look at the industry distribution of manufactured exports. Between 1966 and 1977, for example,

the Asian developing countries remained predominantly exporters in “Other manufacturing,” mainly

textiles and apparel, which made up half of the enormous growth in their manufactured exports. U.S.

firms’ manufacturing affiliates in these countries played no role in this export growth, and if we judge by

their 1977 share, discussed below, Japanese affiliates could not been very important either. There were

two major changes in export composition. One was a shift out of food products, an industry in which

U.S. affiliates were unimportant, and, by 1977, so were Japanese affiliates. The other was a move into

machinery, which grew from 4 to 14 per cent of exports. More than a quarter of the growth in

machinery exports, and a higher proportion of that in electrical machinery, was in exports by U.S.

affiliates in these countries (Lipsey and Kravis, 1985, Table A-6). The 1977 data suggest that Japanese

affiliates played a negligible role in nonelectrical machinery, but a larger one in the growth of exports of

electrical machinery.




Developing Asia as a Whole in 1977

        The export pattern of developing Asia in manufacturing as of 1977 and the position of U.S. and

Japanese affiliates in manufactured exports at that point are summarized in Table 1. The Japanese

affiliate data are subject to major problems, worse for the industry distribution than for the total, but

serious for the total too, as is explained in Ramstetter (1996) and in Lipsey, Blomström, and Ramstetter

(1998). However, the general outlines of the picture are probably correct.

        The developing Asian countries were, within manufacturing, still predominantly exporters of

Foods and “Other manufactures” in 1977. These industries were the source of over two thirds of their


                                                                                                        4
manufactured exports and, with Metals, three quarters of the total. Electrical machinery had already

reached some importance, at 13 per cent of the total. The specializations of Japanese and U.S.

manufacturing affiliates in this group of countries were different from those of the countries and from

each other. Japanese affiliate exports were relatively larger than U.S. affiliate exports in Transport

equipment, and particularly in Other manufacturing, mainly Textiles and apparel, almost half of Japanese

affiliate exports. U.S. affiliate exports were more concentrated in Electrical machinery, which made up

two thirds of U.S. affiliate exports, and to a smaller extent in Chemicals and Nonelectrical machinery.

         In their relatively large shares in Foods and especially in Textiles and apparel and the rest of

Other manufacturing, the export pattern of the Japanese affiliates was much closer than that of the U.S.

affiliates to the comparative advantage of the host countries. Relative to the exports of the host

countries, those of U.S. affiliates were extremely high in Electrical machinery, and a little high also in

Chemicals and in Nonelectrical machinery, all industry groups of U.S. home-country export

comparative advantage, and also relatively R&D-intensive industries. Thus, one could say that, as of

the mid-1970s, both U.S. and Japanese affiliates, but especially the U.S. affiliates, were pushing the

Asian host countries toward specialization in Electrical machinery. Japanese affiliates differed from U.S.

affiliates in being much more involved in exploiting the traditional comparative advantages of these host

countries.

        U.S. and Japanese affiliates together were responsible for 14 per cent of the region’s

manufactured exports, but the share varied widely across industries. Despite the concentration of

Japanese affiliate exports in Other manufacturing, they were a minor part of total exports in this industry

group. In Electrical machinery, however, the two countries’ affiliates were responsible for over half of




                                                                                                         5
their host countries’ exports, and affiliates accounted for between 10 and 15 per cent of total exports in

Chemicals, Nonelectrical machinery, and Transport equipment.

        The comparative advantages of U.S. and Japanese affiliates relative to their host countries are

described by the ratios in the last two columns of Table 1. Both countries’ affiliates had large

comparative advantages relative to their host countries in Electrical machinery. U.S. affiliates, but not

Japanese affiliates, also had them in Chemicals and Nonelectrical machinery, and Japanese, but not U.S.

affiliates, in Transport equipment and, more surprisingly, in Textiles and apparel.

        The industry distributions of production, as measured by gross product, for U.S. affiliates and of

sales for U.S. and Japanese affiliates are shown in Table 2. There are no comparable data for

production and sales in the region. As was the case for exports, U.S. affiliate sales were more

concentrated in Foods, Chemicals, and Machinery and Japanese affiliate sales in Metals, Transport

equipment, and Other manufacturing, particularly Textiles and apparel. The most extreme

concentrations in industry distribution that were seen for exports, such as for U.S. and Japanese

affiliates in Electrical machinery and for Japanese affiliates in Other manufacturing, are somewhat muted

in production and sales, although they are still visible.

        The difference between the industry distributions for exports and for sales implies that

export/sales ratios, or export orientation, differ among the industries. As can be seen by comparing

Tables 1 and 2, U.S. affiliates were far more export-oriented than Japanese affiliates in Metals and in

both Machinery groups, with Electrical machinery the least focussed on its host-country markets, selling

only 15 per cent or less there. In the Food industry, Japanese affiliates exported a little more than half

of their sales, considerably more than U.S. affiliates did, and in Chemicals, Transport equipment, and

Other manufacturing the export ratios of the two countries’ affiliates were similar. For the most part (6


                                                                                                       6
out of 8 industries), higher shares of an industry in exports by one country’s affiliates were associated

with higher export/sales ratios in that country’s affiliates. U.S. firms’ machinery affiliates’ were the only

group exporting far more than they sold in their host countries. Other high export ratios were found in

Foods, Japanese Electrical and Nonelectrical machinery affiliates, and both countries’ affiliates in Other

manufacturing.

        Thus, by 1977, there was a group of foreign-owned affiliates that had been drawn to

Developing Asia to produce for export and another, smaller group, mainly in Chemicals and Transport

equipment, drawn there by prospects in selling to the host countries themselves. The exporting activities

of the affiliates that did export only accounted for about 14 per cent of the region’s exports because

most of the region’s exports were in Foods, Metals, and Other manufacturing, where foreign firms

seemed to have little advantage over local firms.




The Trade of Individual Countries in 1977

        The export patterns of eight East Asian countries had one common feature in the mid-1970s, as

is shown in Table 3. Exports of Food products and Other manufacturing were more than half of total

manufactured exports in every country except Singapore. But there were also some sharp differences.

In the four NIEs, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, led by Singapore, Electrical machinery

accounted for at least 10 per cent of exports. Malaysia was not far behind, but in the other three

countries, Electrical machinery exports were a minor part of the total, less than 4 per cent.

Nonelectrical machinery was much less important than Electrical machinery but the comparative

advantages seemed to be related. Three of the four countries in which Electrical machinery made up a

large part of exports were also the ones with the largest shares of their exports in Nonelectrical


                                                                                                        7
machinery. However, comparative advantage in Chemicals, the other group in which R&D is relatively

high, appears to be unrelated to that in machinery.

        Thus, even by 1977, the region was dividing into two groups of countries. One, consisting of

four or five countries, was, with the participation of foreign affiliates, moving into the export of

machinery and chemicals. The other group showed little indication of a move away from their traditional

export specializations.




The Growth of the Region’s Production and Exports, 1977-1995

        The story of Developing Asia’s growth over the 15 or 20 years after 1977 is a familiar one.

The eight countries of Table 3 grew more than twice as fast, in terms of their GDP, as the world as a

whole. Their exports of manufactured goods grew to 16 times the 1977 level by 1995 and their share

of world manufactured exports from 6 per cent to 15 per cent (18 per cent if China was added). The

composition of the eight countries’ exports changed drastically, with Foods and Other manufacturing

declining from 68 per cent to 38 per cent and Machinery rising from 17 per cent to 44 per cent (Table

4). While 41 per cent of the increase in exports was in the older sectors Foods, Metals, and Other

manufacturing, more than half of the growth came from the Chemicals and Machinery sectors.

        Another way of describing the export patterns is by the extent to which exports are the product

of industries characterized by high, medium, or low ratios of R&D expenditures to output, recognizing

that the particular products that make up a country’s exports in one of these industries may not

themselves be the ones resulting from the R&D. The U.S. parent companies investing in Developing

Asia, even in 1977, were not only in relatively high R&D industries but, within those industries, were

R&D-intensive relative to other firms. Parents in the Nonelectrical machinery industry with direct


                                                                                                       8
investments in Developing Asia in 1977 were over 50 per cent more R&D-intensive than those with

investments in Europe, the next-highest area in this respect. Parents in the Electrical machinery industry

with direct investments in Developing Asia were almost 40 per cent more R&D-intensive than those

with European investments (Lipsey, Blomström, and Kravis, 1990).

        The exports of the eight developing East Asian countries in 1977 were mostly from industries of

low R&D intensity. The main ones were Foods, Metals, and, within the broad Other manufacturing

group, Textiles and apparel, Lumber and furniture, and Leather and leather products. By 1995, the

export distributions, especially those of Singapore, Malaysia, and Taiwan, were much more tilted

toward high R&D industries. The shares of high R&D industries in the manufacturing exports of

Singapore and Malaysia were far above those in the exports of the United States and Japan, and their

share in Taiwan’s exports was a little above that for those two high-tech leaders. In all the East Asian

countries, except Indonesia, the share of high R&D-intensity industries in manufactured exports was

higher than in such advanced countries in Europe as France and Germany (Table 5).

        What role, if any, did the affiliates of U.S. and Japanese companies play in these

transformations? From 1977 to 1995, the region’s dependence on U.S. affiliates for exporting, never

large, declined. The share of U.S. affiliates in total manufactured exports declined from 7 per cent to

about 5&1/2 per cent. In 1977, U.S. affiliates accounted for more than 4 per cent of East Asian

exports only in Chemicals and Machinery, concentrated in a share of more than a third in Electrical

machinery. By 1995, the two machinery industries were the only ones with U.S. affiliate shares over 4

per cent (Table 6). The role of U.S. affiliates in the region’s exports shrank substantially in both

Chemicals and Electrical machinery, but grew in Nonelectrical machinery to 18-20 per cent. These

changes can also be seen in the shares of U.S. affiliates in the growth of exports, large in both machinery


                                                                                                       9
industries in the first period, from 1977 to 1982, around 15 and 25 per cent, but after that concentrated

in the Nonelectrical machinery sector. In that industry, U.S. affiliates still accounted for about 20 per

cent of export growth in 1989-1995, but the U.S. affiliate share was below 6 per cent in the other

broad industry groups.

        These broad industry group categories and aggregations of countries conceal differences among

individual industries and individual countries. Many of these are hidden in the published data by

suppression rules, but for a few industries we can compare total sales, including both exports and local

sales, by U.S. affiliates in Asian countries other than Japan and Australia, but including New Zealand,

with total exports by the eight East Asian countries. A high ratio of affiliate sales to exports could mean

that the industry is dominated by the U.S. affiliates or it could mean that the U.S. affiliates are producing

for sale in the host country rather than for export. The available information on these affiliate sales ratios

by industry is shown in Table 7. The high ratio for Soaps, Cleansers, and Toilet goods, far over 100 per

cent, indicates that U.S. affiliates in the industry are focussed on host country markets, rather than

export markets. Within Electrical machinery, the U.S. affiliates’ importance is concentrated in

Electronic components and accessories.

        Japanese affiliates accounted for a little less of Southeast Asia’s exports than U.S. affiliates in

each of the years for which we can make a comparison, through 1989 and their share of the region’s

exports also declined. After that, however, their exports and their shares of the region’s exports rose

sharply through 1995, considerably surpassing those of U.S. MOFAs (Table 8). The major differences

among industries were that the Japanese affiliates were a negligible factor in exports of Nonelectrical

machinery, the industry in which U.S. affiliates were most important as exporters in 1995, but were

more important than U.S. affiliates in exports of every other industry group, particularly Transport


                                                                                                       10
equipment and Electrical machinery. The original Japanese share in Textile and apparel exports almost

vanished between 1977 and 1989.

        The region’s dependence on U.S. and Japanese affiliates together as sources of exports

declined between 1977 and 1989 from about 13&1/2 per cent to 10&1/2 per cent, and then rose again

to almost 13 per cent with the large growth in exporting by Japanese affiliates. The combined U.S. and

Japanese affiliate shares fell in four or five of the seven industry groups, most notably in Electrical

machinery, where the affiliates were responsible for over half of exports in 1977 but only 22 per cent in

the mid-1990s, indicating some maturing of the domestic industry. The outstanding exception was

Nonelectrical machinery, where the affiliate share grew to over 20 per cent by 1989 and remained close

to that level in the next six years. Thus, at the regional level, there seems to have been some growing

out of dependence on foreign affiliates, except in the case of U.S. affiliates in Nonelectrical machinery,

mainly involved in computer related products.




Production and Exports in Individual Countries

        Although East Asia has been treated here so far mainly as a unit, there are large differences

among the countries. A separation by country gives a picture of the differences and also provides a

larger number of observations.

         Singapore has been the country most dependent on U.S. affiliates as exporters, with their share

close to 20 per cent in 1977 and 1995 (Table 9). The Philippines are next, still at about 7 per cent, and

in Malaysia these shares were high in 1982 but fell sharply after that. In Hong Kong and Taiwan, and

even more in Indonesia and Korea, U.S. affiliate shares in manufactured exports were low and falling,




                                                                                                          11
although U.S. affiliates were important as exporters in Indonesia’s petroleum industry, not included in

the manufacturing totals here.

        The great importance of U.S. affiliates in the Electronics industry, especially in the early stages

of development of the industry, stands out in the table. At the first appearance of the industry in the data

here, which does not mean the beginning of the industry itself for the earlier entrants, the shares of U.S.

affiliates are very high. They range from 97 per cent in the Philippines (ignoring the anomalous 1982

ratio, which shows the affiliates exporting almost twice the national total), to three quarters in Malaysia

and Thailand in 1982, over half in Singapore and close to 30 per cent in Hong Kong and Taiwan in

1977. Only Indonesia and Korea show no such high ratios, and Indonesia hardly entered the industry.

After those initial high ratios, which suggest that the U.S. firms were the initiators of the industries in

these countries, the role of the U.S. affiliates diminished sharply in the most successful exporting

countries, to 3 per cent in Hong Kong, 6 per cent in Singapore and 7 per cent in Taiwan.

        On a smaller scale, the Chemicals industries went through a similar evolution, although the U.S.

affiliate shares of exports were never as high and the pattern was not as consistent. The shares did

decline from 12 to 3&1/2 per cent in Hong Kong, 18 to 3 per cent in Taiwan, 27 to 1&1/2 per cent in

Indonesia, 8 to 1&1/2 per cent in Malaysia, and 42 to 5 per cent in the Philippines. In this case also,

the affiliates may have been teachers with apt students.

        The major exception to the pattern of receding importance of U.S. affiliates as exporters is the

Nonelectrical machinery industry in Singapore. The industry was already an important exporter in 1977

and the share of U.S. affiliates in 1982, the first year we can calculate it, was over 30 per cent. That

share grew to 37 and 45 per cent in 1989 and 1995 even as the industry’s share in Singapore’s exports




                                                                                                         12
grew steadily from 11 per cent in 1977 to over a third in 1995. In the last period, U.S. affiliates

accounted for almost half of Singapore’s export growth in this industry.

        The declining role of affiliates in the region’s exports does not necessarily mean that there were

similar declines in their role in production. As their export role was declining, U.S. affiliates were being

naturalized, in the sense that they were selling more of their production in host country markets (Table

10). The overall exports/sales ratios for U.S. manufacturing affiliates fell in six out of the seven countries

for which they could be calculated between 1977 and 1995 and also, more often than not, in individual

industry groups within countries. Shifts toward host country markets over time were more common

than shifts toward export markets in each industry in each period in each country, wherever the data

were available. That predominance suggests that production for export preceded production for host

country markets on the part of the U.S. MNEs. Perhaps the MNEs were more knowledgeable about

export markets than about host country markets or perhaps host country markets did not develop until

after production for exports had begun. The export production itself may have stimulated the growth of

host country markets in general or in the same industries.

        Japanese manufacturing affiliates in East Asia have generally been less export-oriented than U.S.

affiliates. About a third of their sales were outside host countries in 1977 (Tables 1 and 2), as

compared with 57 per cent for U.S. affiliates. In 1995, the export/sales ratio for U.S. affiliates was

down to 54 per cent (Appendix Table 2) and those for Japanese affiliates were up to 43&1/2 per cent

in the NIEs and 38 per cent in the ASEAN-4 (Appendix Table 4). Thus the Japanese affiliates have

become a little more like the U.S. affiliates as time passed. Among the major industries, Japanese

affiliates were much less export oriented in Non-electrical machinery than U.S. affiliates in 1995, but

had become considerably more export-oriented in Electrical machinery.


                                                                                                       13
        Some of the country studies in Dobson and Chia (1997) offer a closer look at trade-investment

relations in Southeast Asia, particularly in the two machinery industries. In Singapore, for example, in a

category called “Electronic products and accessories,” which encompasses most of the two machinery

groups in our tables, foreign affiliates accounted for almost 90 per cent of the capital. Over 90 per cent

of sales were exports and constituted almost 80 per cent of Singapore’s manufactured exports in 1995

(Chia, 1997, and Appendix Table 7). U.S. and European affiliates were particularly export-oriented

and each group sent about half its exports to its home region (ibid, Table 2.8). Japanese affiliates, more

involved in consumer electronics, sold the highest proportion locally among all the foreign-owned

operations. Chia concludes that the data demonstrate “…differences in U.S. and Japanese corporate

strategies for offshore production, the former to supply the home and third-country markets, the latter to

supply largely the host and third-country markets…” (p. 449).

        A study of a sample of foreign-owned firms in Taiwan by Tu (1997) covering electronics and

chemicals firms did not find such large differences in export behavior between U.S. and Japanese

affiliates as in the Singapore study but did note two points that help to explain aggregate behavior. One

is the effect of the age of an affiliate. Younger affiliates relied much more than older affiliates on their

home markets; as an affiliate matured, and perhaps as the local market matured at the same time, it

tended to sell more in its local market. This process could be one explanation for the similar tendency

visible in the aggregate data. A more disturbing finding in this study is that affiliates reported as sales to

parents products that were actually shipped to third countries. Such a practice would put into question

the reliability of the division between exports to home countries and exports to third countries (Tu,

1997, p. 75).




                                                                                                         14
          The study of foreign firms in Hong Kong in the same volume, also based on a non-random

sample survey, suggested large differences between U.S. and Japanese firm behavior, as was reported

for Singapore (Chen and Wong, 1997). Japanese affiliates were more tightly tied to their parents in the

sense that more of their exports went to them, while U.S. affiliates sold somewhat more to other

affiliates and much more to unrelated firms. Japanese affiliates were also more dependent on their

parents for “… the supply of capital, machinery, components, and parts…” (ibid, p.91). One gets the

impression that U.S. firms have gone further than have Japanese firms in the division of labor among

affiliates.

          In Thailand, the differences between U.S. and Japanese firms do not appear as large

(Ramstetter, 1997). Both are focussed substantially on their home markets, although that dependence

has been rising for Japanese firms and declining for U.S. affiliates. Japanese affiliates are much more

important than U.S. affiliates, accounting for 22 per cent of Thai exports of non-petroleum manufactured

exports, as compared with 8 per cent for U.S. affiliates. Exports are concentrated in electric and

computing machinery (Non-electrical machinery in the aggregate data), especially on the part of U.S.

affiliates (pp. 122-123).

          Japanese affiliates in the electrical and electronic industries in Malaysia differed from U.S. and

European affiliates in being to a larger extent producers of final products, and much less exporters to

home markets (Sieh and Yew, 1997, pp.138-139). U.S. affiliates purchased few inputs from unrelated

suppliers in third countries but much more from affiliates in those countries, the main reason being that

“… U.S. affiliates as semiconductor producers were higher up on the value-added chain and could use

imports only from their proprietary sources whereas Japanese firms turning out intermediate products

half way down the value-added chain had more procurement options…” (p. 140). One U.S. firm was


                                                                                                       15
described as having “… a no duplication policy, which divided production activities among affiliates in

different locations to avoid duplicating the output of another affiliate…” (p. 140).

        In a study of the location of export production by U.S. and Japanese MNEs Kumar (1997)

distinguished between production for export to the MNEs’ home markets and production for export to

the rest of the world., and found some differences in determinants for the two types and between

Japanese and U.S. firm practices. Although the study is not specific to FDI in Asia, Kumar attempted

to measure the attractiveness of the “…first generation of NIEs…” and of a “second tier,” the

ASEAN-4 and China. One conclusion is that the first generation NIEs were favored by U.S. MNEs

over other locations for production for the U.S. market in 1982 and 1989, but that they had lost their

advantage by 1994. “Favored” in that study means favored beyond the degree expected from the

measured determinants of export production location. These same countries were attractive to

Japanese MNEs in 1989, but not before, and they had lost that advantage by 1994. The explanation

offered is that export-oriented investment was discouraged by the combination of “…rising wages,

appreciating currencies, loss of GSP benefits and MFA quotas…” At the same time, coefficients

representing membership in the “second tier” in equations explaining exports to U.S. and Japanese

markets were increasing over time. Among industry groups, these trends were clearest, and the

coefficients most frequently statistically significant for U.S. affiliates in the Electrical machinery industry,

confirming the impression from the data reported here.

        Kumar also suggests that there are differences in the behavior of U.S. and Japanese affiliates, as

appears to be the case in our data here. His interpretation is that “…U.S. MNEs tend to relocate

production of intermediate products for home consumption, whereas Japanese MNEs seem to shift

production of more finished goods in relatively simpler technology industries. The offshore production


                                                                                                          16
by U.S. MNEs would seem from this more of ‘globalized production’ which links subsidiaries in home

and host countries vertically.” ( pp. 33-34). This picture of the close relationships between parents and

affiliates within U.S. firms fits with the finding in Lipsey (1998) that exports to individual markets from

U.S. affiliates in Asian countries are larger when parent exports to affiliates in those markets are also

large. This phenomenon was particularly noticeable in the Electronic components and accessories

industry, part of the Electrical machinery industry reported on here.




Conclusions

        The composition of manufacturing production and of the manufactured exports of Southeast

Asian countries has been completely transformed over the last 20 years or so. To varying degrees, these

countries went from a pattern of exports within manufacturing fairly typical of developing countries to

one much more like that of highly developed countries. In some cases they have moved quite far up the

scale into R&D-intensive industries, although not necessarily in the more sophisticated sectors of these

industries. Foods, Textiles and apparel, and Other manufactures, mainly labor-intensive products of

industries of low R&D intensity, declined from almost 68 per cent of exports to 38 per cent, and

exports from the Chemicals and Machinery industries rose from 21 per cent to more than half of

exports. In all the countries, the share of exports from R&D intensive industries at least doubled and in

most cases grew much more than that.

        It would be hard to explain these changes by the initial comparative advantages of these

countries in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The decisions to welcome foreign firms as direct investors,

taken at different times and to different degrees among the countries, seem to have been a crucial

element in these developments. Foreign firms, particularly American firms at the beginning, saw a way


                                                                                                      17
to integrate these countries into worldwide networks of production, first in electronics and then in

aspects of the computer industry. Foreign firms supplied the technology and the links to other parts of

the production networks that completed the set of resources necessary for the growth of these

industries. The most typical pattern seemed to be the establishment of affiliates almost completely for

export production, followed by the development of these affiliates over time to produce more for

domestic sale, and by the growth of production by non-affiliated host country firms in the same or

related industries.

        Although this is a general description, each country has its own story. Indonesia does not fit the

pattern except a bit for Chemicals. Korea looks to be a country that transformed almost entirely

without inward FDI, although the paper in this volume by Kim and Huang suggests that there was more

influence from that source than is visible from our data. The smallest countries have been, as we would

expect, most dependent on trade for the growth of these industries.

        U.S. and Japanese firms seem to have played somewhat different roles. U.S. firms were earlier

major investors and their investments and affiliate exports were distributed across industries along the

lines of U.S. comparative advantage, while the industry distribution of Japanese affiliate production and

exports was closer to that of the host countries. Thus the U.S. investments initially did more to drive the

changes in the composition of their host countries’ production and trade. Over time, however, the U.S.

and Japanese affiliates have become more alike in transmitting home country technologies and

comparative advantages, the U.S. firms more in computer equipment, the Japanese more in motor

vehicles, and both in electronics.

        It is a little difficult to match the growth of exports by foreign-owned affiliates in these countries

with the total export growth. Of the two fast-growing machinery sectors, in Electrical machinery, U.S.


                                                                                                        18
and Japanese affiliates alone were responsible for half of exports in 1977 and their share diminished in

the next 20 years. In Nonelectrical machinery, mainly computers and accessories and parts, the share

of the two home countries’ affiliates, chiefly U.S. affiliates, increased substantially between 1977 and

1995.

        By 1995, the two machinery industries’ exports were 30 per cent or more of total manufactured

exports in seven out of the eight countries we cover here. The exception is Indonesia, where

“…investments in export-oriented electronic components by multinational enterprises (MNEs) failed to

take off…because of the lack of a conducive investment climate between 1973 and 1985.” Two

semiconductor investments that had been established by major American firms were closed in 1985-86

(Pangestu, 1997, p.204). In the other seven countries, except for Korea, which seems to have

managed without much inward FDI, the earliest data for the Electrical Machinery industry show large

initial shares in exports for U.S. affiliates alone (we do not have individual country data for Japanese

affiliates). The large early affiliate shares of exports were followed by declines in every case. The data

seem to say that the U.S. affiliates were extremely important in the initial stages of this now major

industry for the region, but have been replaced to some extent, at least in their export roles, by firms

from other home countries, especially Japan, and by local firms. While their role in exports was

declining, U.S. affiliates were shifting their sales to their host country markets to some extent.

        A somewhat similar pattern of initially high U.S. affiliate shares in exports, declining in later

years, can be observed in the Chemicals industry, although the shares were never as high as in Electrical

machinery, and the U.S. affiliates in Chemicals were always much more oriented to their host-country

markets than those in Electrical machinery.




                                                                                                        19
        The major exception to this trend was the Nonelectrical machinery industry, mainly computers

and parts. In this case, the share of U.S. affiliates in the region’s exports grew over time. The industry

was particularly important as an exporter in Taiwan, where it was a larger exporter than Electrical

machinery, and in Singapore, where it was a little smaller. The U.S. and Japanese data are not available

in sufficient industry detail to test whether what appear to be differences in behavior are explainable by

the detailed industry composition of their investments, and the data that do exist are undermined by

differences in consolidation rules, by the extent of transshipments with little value added, and by many

other problems. There do seem to be many individual cases where detailed industry composition is the

explanation, as in the distinction between consumer electronics and semiconductor specializations in

individual countries within the Electrical machinery industry, which seems to explain the extent of

exporting relative to host-country sales.

        The declining share of U..S. and Japanese affiliates in exports of most manufacturing industries

in East Asia does not reflect any withdrawal from the region or decline in affiliate activity. Exports by

U.S.-owned affiliates grew by almost 12 times their original level between 1977 and 1995 and by 20

per cent in 1995 alone. Local sales in host countries grew even faster. Exports by Japanese affiliates

grew by 17 times their original value during the same period and more than tripled between 1989 and

1995. The declines in affiliate shares of exports over time reflect the enormous growth of local firms

and of other countries’ affiliates, particularly the former, and the local firm growth may itself have been

partly a result of the growth of the U.S. and Japanese affiliates.
