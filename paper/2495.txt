I.   Introduction

     Although vector autoregressive (VAR) models have traditionally been

used for forecasting, Sims (1982) has recently advocated their use for

policy analysis.2    Sims argues that his procedures differ "marginally" from

those used for structural models in that "they take account of policy

endogeneity and they avoid constructing behavioral stories about each

individual equation in the model" (Sims, 1982, p. 150).       This added

generality comes, of course, at a cost.      To estimate a reduced form absent

conventional exclusion restrictions,      the number of variables that enter the

estimated reduced form must be very small relative to the number of

variables in the reduced form of a structural model.      Sims argues that a

small set of variables captures most of the information available to the

econometrician about the economy.

     In Fair and Shiller (1987) encompassing tests were used to compare VAR

models to the structural Fair    (1976) model.   The results indicate that VAR

forecasts contain very little information not in the Fair model forecasts

and that the Fair model forecasts contain information not in the VAR

forecasts.   In this sense VAR   models   appear to be dominated by the Fair

model as forecasting devices. The present paper is, however, concerned with

this paper.

(1986) and Bernanke (1986) use VAR models to ask questions about the
structure of the economy, but they impose restrictions on the covariance
matrix of innovations that are analogous to exclusion restrictions.
a different question from the forecasting usefulness of VAR    models.    Even if

VAR models do not aggregate Information as efficiently as do structural

models, they may still be good approximationsof the true reduced form.

This is the question examined here, namely how accurate are the structural

properties of VAR models?     Put another way, the question is how costly Is

the unwillingness to impose a priori restrictions when one attempts to use a

VAR model to uncover structural relationships    in the economy?



II.   The Procedure

      The methodology used in this paper is as follows:    1) data are

generated from a dynamic deterministic solution of a structural model, 2) a

VAR model is estimated using a subset of these data, and 3) the properties

of the VAR model are compared to the properties of the structural model.        If

the properties of   theVAR model are   quite different from those of the

structural model, this is evidence against the VAR model being a good

approximation. If the properties are similar, this is evidence in favor of

the VAR model.

      An important property of this procedure is that it eliminates the

effects of error terms.     Because the data have been generated from a

deterministic simulation,    the VAR model can fail to be a good approximation

only for two reasons. First, if the structural model is nonlinear, its

reduced form equations are nonlinear (and not necessarily analytically

tractable).   The linear or log linear specification   of the VAR model may not

capture these nonlinearities.     Second, and probably more important,    the VAR

model does not use all the predetermined variables in the structural model.

If some of the left out variables are correlatedwith the included
                                                           3

variables, the coefficient estimates of the included variables will be

wrong.         The VAR model will thus not capture the structural model's

properties if and only if the reduced form equations that it estimates are

misspecified. If the estimated reduced form equations are correct (right

functional forms and all relevant predeterminedvariables used), the VAR

model will duplicate the structural model exactly. There are no random

shocks (in the simulated data) to make the VAR model differ from the

structural model if it is correctly specified.                          All the "error" is solely

from the misspecification of the VAR model.

          The case of a linear structural model may help clarify the procedure.

Let the structural model be


(1)       YB    ÷   xr        u

where      Y   is T x m, B is m x       is,   X is T   x   n,    r is   nx   is,   and   U   is T x m.   X   may
include lagged endogenous variables. Some of the equations may be

identities.         The elements of U corresponding to identities are identically

equal to zero.

          The model in       (1)   can be solved assuming certainty equivalence,                     i.e.,   U
     0.    Given estimates of B and r, denoted B and r, given values of the

exogenous variables, and setting U equal to zero, the model can be solved

dynamically over the period 1 through T.                         Let Y and    X    denote these solution

values,        where   X   differs from X if there are lagged endogenous variables in



          Now, assume that m•n is less than                T,   and consider a regression of Y on

X.    This regression will yield              -B as            the estimated coefficient matrix for

X and will result in a perfect fit.                    In other words, the solution data obey
                                              4

YB =   -XI',   or   Y = -XI'B1,   and so the regression of   Y   on   X   will simply give

back -FB1.          This is just a round about way of computing the reduced form

coefficient matrix.         If, on the other hand,   Y   is regressed on a subset of

the variables in X, one will not get back the reduced form coefficient

matrix, and a perfect fit will not be achieved.            The "estimated" reduced

form will only be an approximation to the actual reduced form.                    The "errors'

that are made are not due to any stochastic error terms (since the data were

generated from a deterministic simulation), but are due solely to the

misspecification of the estimated reduced form equations.



III.    The Models

       The model in Fair (1984) is used as the structural model.                  The model

is nonlinear, consists of 29 stochastic equations and 98 identities,                   and has

over 100 predetermined variables. The version of the model used here is

estimated (by two stage least squares) for the period 1954 I                  -   1987 I, 133

observations. The overall data set begins in 1952 I.                  (Some observations

before 1954 1 are needed because of lagged values in the model.)                    The

generated data set was constructed by simulating the Fair model dynamically

for the 1954 I -1987 I period.           The outcome of this simulation is a date set

consisting of solution values of each of the 127 endogenous variables for

each of the 133 quarters.

       Three VAR models are considered in this paper.             Each consists of eight

variables: the real value of government spending (C), the import price

deflator (PM), the three-month Treasury bill rate (R), the unemployment rate

(U), the money supply (M), the nominal wage rate (W), the CNP deflator (P),

and real GNP (Y).         All but the unemployment rate and the bill rate are in
                                                   5


logs.    In the first model, denoted VAR4,              each   of the eight equations

consists of each variable lagged one through four times, a constant, and a

time trend, for a total of 34 coefficients per equation. This model is the

same as the model used in Sims         (1980) except for the addition of the

                                                                   This model is the same as
government spending variable and the bill rate.

the VAR4 model     in Fair and    Shiller (1987) except for the addition of the

government spending variable.

        The second model, denoted VAR2, uses two lags per variable rather than

                                                                      It is of interest to see
fur      for a total of 18 coefficients per equation.

how sensitive the properties of VAR models are to decreasing the number of

lags.

        The third model, denoted VAR4P, has Bayesian priors imposed on the

coefficients of VAR4.        The Litterman prior           that    the variables   follow

univariate random walks has been imposed.                 The standard deviations of the

prior take the form

(2)     S(i,j,k)

where i indexes the left-hand-side variable, j indexes the right-hand-aide

                   k                               is the standard error of the
variables, and         indexes the lag.       s

f(i,i)=l.0,    f(i,j)      .5,   ij,   g(k)
                                              —    k,    and   y     0.1.   These are the values

imposed by Litterman (1979, p. 49).

        The experiments below consist of shocking a particular residual and

                                                                       Because the residuals

            procedure (see Sims (1980), p. 21) is to choose

 here.      The equations were ordered   1)   government spending,      2) import price,

 3) bill rate, 4) unemployment rate, 5) money supply, 6)

 deflator,     and 8) real GNP.    The triangularization        is done by adding the

 contemporaneous value of the government spending variable to equations 2

 through 8, the contemporaneous value of the import price variable to

 equations 3 through 8, the contemporaneous        value of the bill rate variable
 to equations 4 through 8, and so       on.   The equations are then estimated in

 this form.3

          The VAR models are estimated for the 1954 I       -   1987 I period using the
simulated data.       The data used prior to 1954 I are the actual data.           In

addition,      government spending and the import price deflator are exogenous          in
the Fair model, and so the actual data are used for these two
                                                              variables.
          For the results in the next section it is of interest to
                                                                   compare the
multiplier errors that the VAR models make with the standard errors that

could be computed by the model builders.          In other words, it is of interest

to know if the system-response errors are within what the model builders

would expect from their stochastic specifications.               For VAR2 and VAR4 it is

possible to compute standard errors by stochastic simulation using the

procedure in Fair (1980).         Let a denote the n-component vector of

coeffIcient estimates for VAR2 or VAR4, and let         V   denote the n x   n   estimated
covariance matrix for a.      For VAR2 n is 172, and for VAR4 n is 300.           The
coefficient vector includes the coefficients of the contemporaneous

variables in the equations, which enter because of the
                                                       triangularization,
and   V   is a block diagonal matrix because the residuals are not
                                                                   correlated

across equations after the triangularization.        Let a* be a particular draw

of the coefficient vector.        It is assumed that a* is distributed as N(o, V).
                                                                                *
      The standard errors are estimated as follows. 1)       A    value for a       is

drawn from N(a, V).       2) Using this set of coefficient values, the given

equation's residual is shocked and the system's responses are recorded.

This is one trial.       3)   Steps 1) and 2) are repeated J times, where J is the

number of trials.       In step 2) the shock to the residual is the same from

trial to trial; only a* changes. 4)         Given the J values for each variable's

response for each quarter, the variance (and standard error) of the response

can be computed.

      Standard errors were computed for VAR2 and VAR4 below.         The number of

trials for each computation was 500.        This procedure cannot be directly

applied to VAR4P because of the Bayesian setup, and so standard errors for

VAR4P were not computed.



II.   The Experiments and Results

      Once the VAR models were estimated,       three experiments were performed

per model   -   - one in which the error   term in the government spending equation

was shocked, one in which the error term in the import price equation was

shocked, and one in which the error term in the bill rate equation was

shocked.    The experiments were performed for the 1980 I     -   1982 IV period.



The Government Spending Experiment

      The government spending experiment was performed as follows. First, in

each VAR model the estimated residuals were added to all the equations and

taken to be exogenous.        This means that when the model is solved with no
                                          8

shocks, a perfect tracking solution is obtained.        Second, the error term in

the government spending equation (equation 1) was shocked by .016 for the

first quarter (1980 I).     The government spending equation is in logs, and

this is a shock of about 10 billion dollars at an annual rate.          The model

was then solved for the 1980 I    -   1982 IV period.   The difference between the

predicted value from this simulation and the actual value of each variable

for each quarter is an estimate of the effect of the shock on the variable.

     The results of this experimentare presented in Table 1 for the three

VAR models.     The "changes" in Table 1 are the differences between the

solution value after the shock and the actual value.        They are       the

changes from quarter to quarter.      Note first that the initial change in C is

$10.0 billion, but that after the first quarter the changes are different

from the initial change.     This is simply the government spending equation in

each VAR model at work.

     The change in real CNP (Y) in the first quarter in response to this

shock is $6.2 billion for VAR4, $6.4 billion for VAR2, and $7.5 billion for

VAR4P.   The changes in the second quarter are, respectively, $7.7, $7.6, and

$8.9 billion.     The changes become negative between the fifth and seventh

quarters.     The changes in the bill rate are positive except for the last

four quarters for VAR2 and the last three quarters for VAR4P.          The changes

in the money supply are all negative, as are the price changes.         The changes

in the unemployment rate are initially negative and then essentially zero

after about seven quarters.

     The VAR properties in Table 1 need to be compared to the properties of

the structural model.     Remember that the VAR models are misspecified

because they incorrectly omit variables from the reduced form and because

they are not likely to be using the correct functional forms.        The "actual"

values in Table 1 are the properties of the Fair model when government

spending is changed by the amounts of the VAR changes in the table,         Because

each VAR model has a alightly different change in government spending after

the first quarter, the "actual" values differ slightly by model.4

     The actual values vere computed as follows.       First,   the estimated

residuals in the Fair model were added to the equations and taken to be

exogenous. This means that when the model is solved using the actual values

of the exogenous variables, a perfect tracking solution is obtained.

Second,   government spending was changed in each of the quarters by the

amount in Table 1 and the model was solved.        The difference between the

solution value and the actual value for each endogenous variable and quarter

is the estimated effect of the change on the endogenous variable. These

differences are the actual values in Table    1.    As noted above, three

solutions were obtained corresponding   to the three sets of government

spending values.

     The standard errors from the stochastic simulations are also presented

in Table 1 for VAR4 and VAR2.     One should be careful in interpreting what

these standard errors are.     They are the errors that the model builders

could compute from the data.    They are the errors that the model builders

would presumably use in deciding how much confidence to place on the


     4As noted above, both government spending and the import price deflator
are exogenous in the Fair model.  When government spending was changed in
the Fair model for the first experiment, the import price deflator was
changed. One could have, for example, changed PM by the amounts of the VAR
changes in Table 1. It seemed best not to do this, however, since in the
generated data PM is exogenous.  In the world that has been created, the VAR
models erroneously takes PM to be endogenous, and this is simply another
type of specification error whose quantitative importance is being
estimated.

results.     In fact, of course, the errors would be zero if the VAR models

were correctly specified because the data have been generated with no         randor.


shocks.     In other words, if the VAR models were correctly specified, the

coefficients would be estimated exactly and thus the estimated covariance

matrix of the coefficient estimates would be zero.

     The key question is whether the errors in Table 1 are large or small.

Although the errors can be compared to the standard errors, the answer to

this question is in part a matter of judgment.     Do the response properties

of the VAR models seem to be close enough to the actual properties to have

them be a useful policy tool?    For most variables, the answer from Table 1

would seem to be no.    The GNP response is considerably underestimated, and

the price and wage responses are of the wrong sign.     The money supply

responses are generally overestimated, although the interest rate and

unemployment rate responses are fairly accurate.     For GNP, wages, and

prices,    the initial errors are generally larger than the estimated standard

errors.




The Import Price Experiment

     For the second experiment the error term in the import price equation

in each VAR model was shocked by .10 in the first quarter. The import price

equation is in logs, and this is a shock in the import price deflator (PM)

of 10.52 percent.    The results are presented in Table   2.   For VAR4 the

change in PM is 13.09 percent in the second quarter, and it declines to

-2.05 percent by the twelfth quarter.    This is the PM equation at work.        The

changes in PM after the first quarter are slightly different for the other

two VAR models because the PM equations are different.

     To compute the actual values for each VAR model for this experiment,     Pb

was changed in the Fair model in each of the quarters by the amount in Table

2 and the model was solved.    Again, because the changes in PM differ across

VAR models after the first quarter, the actual values are slightly differen'

across models.5

     Increasing the import price of deflator in the Fair model results in an

increase in wages and prices and a decrease in GNP.    The VAR models

underestimate the fall in GNP and the rise in prices and wages.    The

eventual rise in the unemployment rate was completely missed;   the models had

the unemployment falling throughout the period.    The fall in the interest

rate after four quarters (as the Fed in the Fair model lowered interest

rates to help counter the fall in output) was also missed.    The fall was not

predicted to take place until the tenth quarter.
     Some of the estimated standard errors are quite large in Table     2.   For

example, the four-quarter.ahead standard error for GNP for VAR4 is $14.9

billion, which is large compared to the actual effect on CNP of -$17.0

billion,   A   model builder might conclude from the estimated standard errors

that very little confidence could be placed on the results.



The Bill Rate Experiment

     The third experiment, where the error term in the bill rate equation in

each VAR model is shocked, requires a little more explanation. In the Fair

model the bill rate is determined by an interest rate reaction function,

where the Fed is estimated to "lean against the wind," Monetary policy is


     51n this case the government spending variable was not changed in the
Fair model, for reasons similar to those discussed in the previous footnote.
                                        12

thus endogenous in the model; the Fed uses open market operations (variable

AG in the model) to achieve its bill rate target each quarter.    Both AG and

the bill rate are endogenous.     The bill rate is thus endogenous in the

generated data that have been used for the first two experiments. For the

third experiment the bill rate should be exogenous, and so a new data act

waa generated by solving the Fair model with the interest rate reaction

function dropped and the bill rate taken to be exogenous (and equal to the

historical values). Each of the three VAR models was then reestimated uaing

this data set, and these are the versions that were used for the third

experiment.

     The error term in the bill rate equation in each VAR model was shocked

by 1.0 in the first quarter.     This is a shock of one percentage point.    The

results are presented in Table 3.     For VAR4 the bill rate change was 1.0 in
the first quarter, 1.22 in the second quarter, and then gradually lower

after that.   The pattern for the other two VAR models is similar.

and then it gradually diminished after that.

     The actual values for the third experiment for each model were obtained

by changing the bill rate in the Fair model each quarter by the amount in

Table 3 and solving the model.    For these calculations the interest rate

reaction function was dropped from the Fair model and the bill rate was

taken to be exogenous.6 Again, the actual values differ slightly across VAR

models in Table 3 because the bill rate changes differ across models after

the first quarter.

    An increase in the bill rate in the Fair model results in a contraction


     6Neither government spending nor the import price deflator was changed
in the third experiment for the Fair model, which is consistent with the
treatment for the other two experiments.

in CNP from the first quarter on.   All three VAR   models,   on the other hand;

have an expansion in CNF for the first three quarters, before the

contraction sets in.   By the end of the period the contraction is

considerably overestimated by all three models.     The changes for the CNP

deflator are positive for the first ten quarters for the VAR models, wheraas

the actual values are negative. The actual changes in the unemployment rate

are positive from the first quarter on, whereas the VAR models do not pick

this up until the fifth quarter.    The results for the money supply changes

are fairly accurate.




General Remarks

      What should one conclude from the results in Tables 1     -   3?   First,    the

results are generally fairly similar across the three VAR models.           This

conclusion is consistent with the forecasting comparisons in Fair and

Shiller (1987), where the three VAR models performed about the same.

Second, the estimated standard errors are generally much larger for the

import price experiment than they are for the other two.       Clearly, a model

builder using a VAR model for policy analysis would put less confidence on

the response of the system to import price shocks than to government


spending or interest rate shocks.   Third, the VAR models do not appear to be

good approximations.   The errors are generally large, and many misleading

conclusions would be drawn from the responses.    A   partial exception to this

are the results for the money supply, which at times are fairly accurate.



IV.   Conclusion

      This paper has presented a way of estimating how accurate VAR models
                                         14

are likely to be for answering structural questions. The results are

generally quite negative.     The models do not   seeni   to be good structural

approximations.

     The results in this paper are to some extent specific to the Fair

model, and it would be interesting in future work to see how well VAR models

approximate other structural models.     The results are not, however, as

specific to the Fair model as one might at first think.         Although the Fair

model has been assumed to be the "truth" in this study, the methodology is

not based on the assumption that the model is literally the truth.         No

comparison is ever made, or needs to be made, of the actual values and the

Fair-model predicted values. What is needed for the results in this study

to be trustworthy is that the actual way in which the data are generated in

the economy is similar to the way in which the data are generated in a large

scale structural model like the Fair model.       If instead, say, the actual

data are generated from a model like VAR2 or VAR4, then the present results

are not of much interest.     The results in Fair and Shiller (1987), however,

indicate that the data are not generated in this simple way, which thus

provides some support to the present results.

     The forecasting results in Fair and Shiller (1987) and the structural

results in this paper thus call into question the usefulness of VAR models

for macroeconomic purposes.     As forecasting devices the models appear to be

dominated by the Fair model, and as structural approximations the models do

not seem to be very accurate.
