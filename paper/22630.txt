Student Coaching: How Far Can Technology Go?

                                          ABSTRACT

Recent studies show that programs offering structured, one-on-one coaching and tutoring tend to
have large effects on the academic outcomes of both high school and college students. These
programs are often costly to implement and difficult to scale, however, calling into question
whether making them available to large student populations is feasible. In contrast, interventions
that rely on technology to maintain low-touch contact with students can be implemented at large
scale and minimal cost but with the risk of not being as effective as one-on-one, in-person
assistance. In this paper, we test whether the effects of coaching programs can be replicated at
scale by using technology to reach a larger population of students. We work with a sample of
over four thousand undergraduate students from a large Canadian university, randomly assigning
students into one of the following three interventions: (i) a one-time online exercise designed to
affirm students’ values and goals; (ii) a text messaging campaign that provides students with
academic advice, information, and motivation; and (iii) a personal coaching service, in which
students are matched with upper-year undergraduate coaches. We find large positive effects from
the coaching program, as coached students realize a 0.3 standard deviation increase in average
grades and a 0.35 standard deviation increase in GPA. In contrast, we find no effects from either
the online exercise or the text messaging campaign on any academic outcome, both in the general
student population and across several student subgroups. A comparison of the key features of the
text messaging campaign and the coaching service suggests that proactively and regularly
initiating conversations with students and working to establish trust are important design features
to incorporate in future interventions that use technology to reach large populations of students.

1. Introduction


        Policymakers and academics share growing concerns about stagnating college

completion rates and negative student experiences. Between 1970 and 1999, for example, while

college enrollment rates of twenty-three-year-old students rose substantially, completion rates

fell by 25 percent (Turner, 2004). More recent figures suggest that only 56 percent of students

who pursue a bachelors’ degree complete it within six years (Symonds et al., 2011) and recent

research questions whether students who attain degrees acquire meaningful new skills along the

way (Arum and Roska, 2011). Students are increasingly entering college underprepared, with

those who procrastinate, do not study enough, and have superficial attitudes about success

performing particularly poorly (Beattie, Laliberté, and Oreopoulos 2016).


        Much existing research focuses on lacking financial resources among both students and

the institutions they attend as explanations for low completion rates and negative experiences.

The impediments of student resource constraints are highlighted by youth from high-income

families being more likely to attend college, even after accounting for cognitive achievement,

family composition, race, and residence (Belley and Lochner, 2007) and by student average work

hours increasing during recent decades when college prices continued to rise but sources of

financial aid did not follow suit (Scott-Clayton, 2012). Financially constrained students are often

forced to under-invest in higher education or to take on part-time employment, thereby reducing

the time available for schoolwork.1 Resource constraints among less-selective public universities

and community colleges, where there are fewer resources per student, also contribute toward low

completion rates and student dissatisfaction. Completion times have increased most among
1
  Simply providing access to financial aid may not enough, as the application process can be prohibitively complex
for some students. Bettinger et al. (2012) show that providing assistance with the Free Application for Federal
Student Aid (FAFSA) increases both college entry and persistence, while Castleman and Page (2014) demonstrate
that reminding students about the steps to renew FAFSA aid also leads to higher renewal and persistence.

                                                         1
students who start college at these institutions (Bound, Lovenheim, and Turner, 2012), where

increases in student demand for higher education are not fully offset with increases in resources

– something top-tier schools do by regulating enrollment size (Bound and Turner, 2007).


       While the economics of education literature has devoted much attention to the role of

resource constraints, comparatively less attention has been given to understanding the role that

students themselves play in the production of higher education. Yet, at both the high school and

college levels, an emerging recent literature demonstrates the benefits of helping students foster

motivation, effort, good study habits, and time-management skills through structured tutoring

and coaching. Cook et al. (2014) find that cognitive behavioral therapy and tutoring generate

large improvements in math scores and high school graduation rates for troubled youth in

Chicago, while Oreopoulos, Lavecchia, and Brown (forthcoming) show that coaching, tutoring,

and group activities lead to large increases in high school graduation and college enrollment

among youth living in a Toronto public housing project. Structured coaching has also recently

been shown to improve outcomes among college students. Scrivener and Weiss (2013) find that

the Accelerated Study in Associates Program (ASAP) – a bundle of coaching, tutoring, and

student success workshops – in CUNY community colleges nearly doubled graduation rates and

Bettinger and Baker (2014) show that telephone coaching by Inside Track professionals boosts

two-year college retention by 15 percent.


       While structured, one-on-one support services can have large effects on student

outcomes, they are often costly to implement and difficult to scale up to the student population at

large (Bloom, 1984). In this paper, we build on recent advances in social-psychology and

behavioral economics, investigating whether technology – specifically, online exercises and text



                                                2
and email messaging – can be used to generate comparable benefits to one-on-one coaching

interventions but at lower costs among first-year university students.


         Several recent studies in social-psychology find that one-time, short interventions

occurring at an appropriate time can have lasting effects on student outcomes (Yeager and

Walton, 2011; Cohen and Garcia, 2014; Walton 2014). Relatively large improvements on

academic performance have been documented as a result of several types of intervention,

including those that help students define their long-run goals or purpose for learning (Morisano

et al., 2010; Yeager, Henderson et al., 2014), teach the “growth-mindset” idea that intelligence is

malleable (Yeager et al., 2016), help students keep negative events in perspective by self-

affirming their values (Cohen and Sherman, 2014), and help teachers change the tone of

feedback to students in order to build trust (Yeager, Vaughns et al., 2014).2 As a contrast to one-

time interventions, other studies in education and behavioral economics attempt to maintain

constant, low-touch contact with students or their parents at a low cost by using technology to

provide consistent reminders aimed at improving outcomes. For example, several studies have

shown that providing text, email, and phone call reminders to parents about their students’

progress in school boosts both parental engagement and student performance (Kraft and

Dougherty, 2013; Bergman, 2016; Kraft and Rogers, 2014; Mayer et al., 2015). Researchers

have also used text messaging communication with college and university students directly, both

to increase the likelihood of students renewing financial aid (Castleman and Page, 2014) and

improve academic outcomes (Castleman and Meyer, 2016).




2
 While the studies cited above all carefully explain the settings and times in which the interventions are likely to be
effective, there is growing skepticism about the generalizability of some interventions due to recent failed
replication attempts (see, for example, Kost-Smith et al., 2012; Dee, 2015; Harackiewicz et al. (forthcoming))

                                                           3
       We contribute to these literatures by examining whether benefits comparable to those

obtained from one-on-one coaching can be achieved at lower costs by either a one-time, online

intervention designed to affirm students’ goals and purpose for attending university or a full-year

text and email messaging campaign that provides weekly reminders of academic advice and

motivation to students. We work with a sample of more than four thousand undergraduate

students who are enrolled in introductory economics courses across all three campuses of the

University of Toronto, randomly assigning students to one of three treatment groups or a control

group. The treatment groups consist of (i) a one-time, online exercise completed during the first

two weeks of class in the fall, (ii) the online intervention plus text and email messaging

throughout the full academic year, and (iii) the online intervention plus one-on-one coaching in

which students are assigned to upper-year undergraduate coaches. Students in the control group

are given a personality test measuring the Big Five personality traits.


       We find large positive effects from the one-year coaching service, amounting to

approximately a 5 percentage-point increase in average course grades and a 0.35 standard

deviation increase in GPA. In contrast, we find no effects on academic outcomes from either the

online exercise or the text messaging campaign, even after investigating potentially

heterogeneous treatment effects across several student characteristics, including gender, age,

incoming high school average, international-student status, and whether students live on

residence. Our results suggest that the benefits of personal coaching are not easily replicated by

low-cost interventions using technology. As we describe below, coaches were instructed to be

proactive by regularly initiating contact with their students and, whenever possible, to provide

concrete actionable steps for solving a given problem. Our text messaging approach was not able

to replicate this proactive approach. Students had to initiate contact and our team was unable to


                                                 4
“dig deep” into each problem to the same degree as the coaches. We discuss the key challenges –

and potential solutions – to using technology to implement coaching-type support at large scale

in our discussion of the results.


        While our main contribution is assessing the scope for technological interventions to

reproduce the benefits of one-on-one coaching, our paper also makes two more general

contributions. To our knowledge, we provide the first causal analysis of the effects of a large-

scale text messaging campaign on the academic outcomes of college students. The most closely

related to work to ours in this respect is Castleman and Meyer (2016), who analyze the effects of

text message reminders on academic outcomes such as GPA, the number of credits attempted,

and persistence. The authors work with a sample of rural, low-income college students in West

Virginia and find that text campaign participants attempted more credits that non-participants,

although they are unable to make causal claims about the program’s effectiveness because

students were not randomly assigned to participation. In contrast, we randomly assign students

into the messaging treatment, estimating no effects on academic outcomes. We also show that

assigning students to upper-year undergraduate coaches can lead to potentially large academic

improvements without the need for professionally trained coaches, as in the Bettinger and Baker

(2014) study. Instead, a consistent characteristic across a variety of effective coaching studies

appears to be proactive coaches or mentors who regularly contact students to provide support

(Cook et al., 2014; Beattie et al. (2016)).3

intervention in greater detail, explaining how each treatment and control group exercise was

the intervention, while Section 4 presents the results. We discuss the results in Section 5 and

provide concluding remarks in Section 6.




2. Description of the Intervention


           We implemented our intervention across all three University of Toronto (U of T)

campuses, working with a sample of all students registered for first-year economics classes in the

fall of 2015. We cooperated with the instructors of each of these classes, having them agree to

make completion of our online “warm-up” exercise worth 2 percent of students’ final grade.

Students had to complete the exercise in the first two weeks of the fall semester in order to

receive credit.4 The type of online exercise each student had to complete depended on whether

the student was randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups or the control group.

Each student created an account and completed the same introductory survey, in which we asked

several background questions, including the highest level of education obtained by students’

parents, the amount of education they expect to obtain, whether they are first-year or

international students, and their work and study time plans for the upcoming year.


           Students in the first treatment group then worked through an online exercise, designed to

get them thinking about the future they envision and the steps they could take in the upcoming

year at U of T to help make that future a reality. The online module lasted approximately 60 to

90 minutes and led students through a series of writing exercises in which they wrote about their

ideal futures, both at work and at home, what they would like to accomplish in the current year at


4
    We describe our sample, randomization strategy, and balancing tests in the next section.

                                                            6
U of T, how they intend on following certain study strategies to meet their goals, and whether

they want to get involved with extracurricular activities at the university. Varying minimum

word-count and time restrictions were placed on several pages of the online exercise to ensure

that students gave due consideration to each of their answers before proceeding. 5 The exercise

aimed to make students’ distant goals salient in the present and to provide information on

effective study strategies and how to deal with the inevitable setbacks that arise during the course

of an academic year. At the conclusion of the exercise, students were emailed a copy of the

answers they provided to store for future reference. A full description of the online exercise is

available in Appendix A.


        Students in the second treatment group completed the same online exercise but were

additionally offered the opportunity to provide their phone numbers and participate in a text and

email messaging campaign lasting throughout both the fall semester in 2015 and the winter

semester in 2016. The messaging campaign was called You@UofT – a name we chose to

emphasize that the program was geared to provide personalized assistance and help students

reach their individual definitions of success. Students had the opportunity to choose the

frequency with which they received text and email messages, with choices including once a

week, two to three times per week, and three or more times per week. All students who were

randomly sorted into this treatment received email messages, while only those students who

provided their cell phone numbers received text messages throughout the year.6 Students were




5
  Nearly all students took the exercise seriously, writing coherent statements that served as logical answers to the
relevant questions. There were very few instances of students writing random words to hit the word-count minimum,
and the students who did only did so on some questions, not throughout the entire exercise.
6
  A total of 2,024 students were randomly sorted into the messaging campaign treatment and 1,540 (76 percent)
provided their phone numbers.

                                                         7
free to opt out of receiving email messages, text messages, or both at any time after the exercise,

although few chose to do so.


       A full documentation of all of the text and email messages we sent throughout the

experiment is available in Appendix B. Our messages typically focused on three themes:

academic and study preparation advice, information on the resources available at the university,

and motivation and encouragement. Students always received both a text and email message.

Text messages were typically three to four lines in length while emails were longer and provided

more detailed information with which students could follow up. The You@UofT program offered

personalized two-way communication, as both text and email messages regularly encouraged

students to look further into the content and to reach out to us if they had specific or general

questions. Approximately 25 percent of students engaged in two-way communication with our

team via text messages, compared to only 3 percent of students responding via email.


       There was wide variation in the types of response we received from students. For

example, some students asked for locations of certain facilities on campus or how to stay on

residence during the holiday break, while others said they need help with English skills or

specific courses. Some students expressed relatively deep emotions, such as feeling anxious

about family pressure to succeed in school or from doing poorly on an evaluation. We also

received messages of thanks for our appropriately-timed advice or motivation and several

students messaged us to tell us how well they were doing in their courses and how much they

appreciated the communication. No matter the type of message received and when, we attempted

to provide a personalized support service, typically responding to the inquiry within a few hours

(and usually within less than one hour). The You@UofT program served as a virtual coach from

whom students could expect a rapid response at any time. In this sense, the program leveraged

                                                8
technology to provide a personalized coaching service at large-scale to all students while keeping

the cost per-student lower than what is typically incurred with one-on-one coaching.


       To test how the effects of the You@UofT program compare to those of in-person, one-on-

one coaching, a third group of students also completed the online exercise and was offered the

opportunity to participate in a pilot project in which they would be assigned to an upper-year

undergraduate student acting as a personal coach. Coaches were available to meet with students

to answer any questions via Skype, phone, or in person, and would send their students regular

text and email messages of advice, encouragement, and motivation, much like the You@UofT

program described above. In contrast to the messaging program, however, coaches were

instructed to be proactive and regularly monitor their students’ progress. Whereas the You@UofT

program attempts to “nudge” students in the right direction with academic advice, coaches play a

greater “support” role, sensitively guiding students through problems.


       The coaching program was offered only to students at one of the university’s satellite

campuses, the University of Toronto at Mississauga campus. Our coaching treatment group was

established by randomly drawing twenty-four students from the group of students that were

randomly assigned into the text message campaign treatment. At the conclusion of the online

exercise, instead of being invited to provide a phone number for the purpose of receiving text

messages, these twenty-four students were given the opportunity to participate in a pilot

coaching program. A total of seventeen students agreed to participate in the coaching program,

while seven students declined. These seventeen students were assigned to a team of four upper-

year undergraduate coaches, who participated in our program as part of a research opportunity

program. Each coach originally agreed to coach six students throughout the academic year but



                                                9
was eventually responsible for only four or five students as result of seven students declining

participation.


         Our coaches describe providing support to their students on a wide variety of issues,

including questions about campus locations, booking appointments with counsellors, selecting

majors, getting jobs on campus, specific questions about coursework, and feelings of

nervousness, sadness, or anxiety. Coaches and students scheduled their own regular meetings,

approximately half of which occurred face-to-face and half of which occurred via Skype or text

messaging. Since each coach was responsible for only four or five students, they were able to

remember the issues each student was dealing with, proactively reach out to do regular status

checks, and provide specific advice for dealing with each unique problem. The extra time

afforded to coaches with low student-to-coach ratios allowed them to befriend their students,

communicate informally and with humor, and slowly prompt students about their issues through

a series of gentle, open-ended questions until students felt comfortable to open up about the

details of their particular problems. Once trust was established between coaches and students,

students felt more comfortable discussing challenging problems, making it easier for coaches to

provide clear advice.


         Students assigned to the control group were given a personality test measuring the Big

Five personality traits. The test could be completed in approximately 45 to 60 minutes and, at the

conclusion of the exercise, students were emailed their scores in a report describing how they fair

on each of the Big Five traits.7

performance in university.

3. Data Description and Empirical Strategy


         In this section, we describe the data we collected from the experiment and how we

estimate the effects of the three treatments.




    3.1. Data Description


Our experiment is registered with the American Economic Association's registry for randomized

controlled trials. Prior to the experiment, we intended to sort 30 percent of students into the

control group, 20 percent into the online-exercise-only treatment, and 30 percent into the

treatment group that received the text messaging campaign in addition to the online exercise.8

Students were sorted into one of the treatment groups or the control group according to the

randomly-generated last digits of their student numbers, which they provided upon registering

online for our experiment.9 As mentioned, we established the personal coach treatment group by

drawing twenty-four students at random from the group of students that was intended to be a part

of the text messaging campaign. Table 1 shows some basic statistics about our randomization

strategy among first-year students, which indicate that we successfully reached each of our

randomization targets.10 Furthermore, high fractions of students completed each exercise, with

completion rates ranging from 95 to 99 percent.




8
  The remaining 20 percent of students were sorted into an online belonging exercise similar to the exercise that
appeared in Walton et al. (2015). The effects of this treatment will be presented in a separate, standalone paper and
we therefore do not discuss this treatment throughout the remainder of this paper. Students in this treatment are
dropped from the analysis.
9
  Since completing the exercise was a course requirement worth 2 percent of the final grade in introductory
economics, students had a high incentive to provide their real student numbers and complete the exercise.
10
   The table conditions on first-year students because the online belonging exercise mentioned above was only
offered to students in their first year of study. Thus, students registered in second year or above are more likely (than

                                                           11
         Table 2 shows summary statistics for baseline characteristics among students in the

control group along with differences between each treatment group mean and control group

mean for each baseline characteristic. The treatment indicators are never jointly significant in

explaining variation in any student characteristic. The only individual exceptions are that

students in the online-only group are slightly more likely to live on residence and to be fist-

generation students while students in the personal coaching group report having a slightly less

difficult time transitioning to university.


         In terms of the descriptive statistics, approximately half of our sample is female and the

average student 18.5 years old. Approximately half of the students are non-native English

speakers and half are not Canadian citizens. Only 30 percent of students live on residence, but

this fraction is pulled down by the two satellite campuses of U of T, the Mississauga and

Scarborough campuses, which are both commuter campuses. At the main campus, St. George, 40

percent of students live on residence. The main campus also has students with higher incoming

high school average grades: while the average is 87 percent across all students, it is 90 percent at

the St. George campus. Approximately 24 percent of students are first generation and 43 percent

have international status.




    3.2. Empirical Strategy


Since we successfully randomized students into various treatment groups, we estimate the effects

of each treatment by simply comparing mean outcomes in a regression framework. These

estimates are 'Intent to Treat' effects, each representing the average impact from being invited to

the intended pre-randomization fractions) to be in one of the other three treatment groups. We account for this in our
empirical strategy below by including first-year fixed effects in every regression.

                                                         12
complete the exercise, regardless of whether students actually completed or not. Given that

almost all students finished, however, the estimates are likely close to 'Average Treatment

Effects', measuring the average effect from completing the exercise for the entire sample. More

formally, we estimate the following equation:




where the outcome of student who attends campus             is regressed on indicators for each of the

three treatment exercises students were given, campus fixed effects, and a first-year student

indicator. We include campus fixed effects because the coaching treatment was only offered at

the Mississauga campus, which accepts students with lower high school averages who tend to

perform worse in university than students who attend the main campus, St. George. We include

the first-year indicator to account for students who are enrolled in second year and above being

more likely to be in one of the three treatment groups than students in first year, as only first-year

students were randomly assigned to the online belonging exercise that is not analyzed in this

paper. The main parameters of interest are     ,    , and    , which represent the effect of the online

treatment, the online plus messaging treatment, and the online plus coaching treatment,

respectively. As mentioned, we include all students in the analysis, irrespective of whether they

completed the online exercise, provided a cell phone number, or agreed to participate in the

coaching program, implying that our parameter estimates all represent intent to treat effects.


       Our main outcomes of interest are course grades, grade point average (GPA), number of

credits earned, and number of credits failed. When the outcome is course grades, we stack all of

the reported course grades for a given student and run a regression at the course-student level in




                                                   13
which we cluster the standard errors by student. For all other outcomes, we run the regression at

the student-level and report robust standard errors.


4. Results



   4.1. Main Results


Table 3 presents the results from stacked regressions at the student-course level, with course

grades from all courses (fall semester, winter semester, and full-year courses) as the dependent

variable. Standard errors are clustered by student. The results in columns (1) show that neither

the online exercise on its own nor the online exercise and texting messaging treatment had any

effect on course grades. The insignificant effects are not due to statistical imprecision. We can

rule out impacts above 6 percent of a standard deviation using a 95 percent confidence interval.

In contrast, the personal coaching treatment had relatively large effects, boosting the average

course grade by 4.92 percentage points, which amounts to 30 percent of the control group

standard deviation. Reassuringly, including student age and gender as additional control

variables in column (2) does not change the result. Columns (3) and (4) use a student’s course-

specific grade-point relative to the average course grade-point as the dependent variable. While

the coaching effects are not statistically significant, they are substantially larger than the effects

of the online exercise or the messaging campaign, each of which are zero.


       Columns (5) to (14) regress indicators variables for whether students had a grade above

the cutoff indicated in each column header. When all course grades are considered as the

dependent variable, the coaching treatment has the effect of decreasing the likelihood of students

earning extremely low grades. Coaching students are 8 percentage points less likely to earn a


                                                 14
grade below 60 percent. These students are also more likely to earn higher grades, although the

effects are measured more imprecisely.11


         In Table 4, we consider grades from courses taken only in the fall semester as the

outcome of interest. The coaching effects on fall grades are slightly weaker than those on grades

from all courses but coached students still earn higher grades, on average. In Table 5, we show

treatment effects on grades from courses taken only in the winter semester. Here, the coaching

treatment effects are even stronger, as coaching boosts the average grade by 6.7 percentage

points (or 39 percent of the control group standard deviation). Students in the coaching treatment

also tend to earn higher relative grades in their winter courses, scoring approximately 0.43 grade

points higher than the average student in their courses. Columns (5) to (12) show that the

coaching treatment shifted the performance distribution rightward, as coached students are more

likely to earn a grade above 75 percent and are much less likely to earn a grade below 60 percent

in their winter semester courses. It thus appears that the effects of the coaching treatment

strengthened over time. It may be the case that students developed more trust with their coaches

as the academic year progressed and that they learned how to use resources more effectively.


         Figures 1 to 3 show graphically the effects of the coaching treatment strengthening over

time. Each figure shows the treatment-group specific distributions of residual grades, after

campus and first-year effects are removed. Figure 1 reports the residual-grade distributions for

all courses (full-year, winter semester, and fall semester) and clearly shows that the coaching

distribution is shifted rightward relative the control group distribution and the distributions for

the online and texting treatments. Indeed, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejects that the coaching

11
  Including as additional controls those variables that statistically differed between the control group and the online-
only or coaching students (living in residence, first-generation student, and university transition difficulty) results in
very similar point estimates as those reported here.

                                                           15
distribution is the same as the control and texting distributions at the 1 percent level and the

online-only distribution at the 5 percent level. Contrasting Figures 2 and 3 shows that the

strongest coaching effects emerge in the winter semester, as the coaching distribution’s

rightward shift relative to the other distributions is much more pronounced in the winter semester

in Figure 3 than in the fall semester in Figure 2.12


         Table 6 shows treatment effects on other academic outcomes with one observation per-

student and student-level regressions. The dependent variables are constructed using outcomes

from all courses. The coaching treatment causes a 0.35 grade-point increase in student GPA,

equivalent to approximately 35 percent of the control group standard deviation. Coached

students failed fewer credits and earned more credits, on average, than students in the control

group. As with stacked grade outcomes, there are no detectable effects on GPA or the number of

credits failed or earned from the online exercise treatment or the text messaging campaign.

Although we do not report these results separately, the effects of the coaching treatment on these

outcomes are again stronger in the winter semester than in the fall semester.




     4.2. Heterogeneous Treatment Effects


In this section, we explore heterogeneous treatment effects across different student subgroups

and across the three U of T campuses. As mentioned above, only twenty-four students are in the

coaching treatment. We therefore investigate the heterogeneous effects of coaching along with

the other treatments only for completeness; with a sample size of only twenty-four students, we


12
  Note that the coaching group density for fall grades in Figure 2 does not have overlapping mass with the other
densities in the left tail of the grade distributions. Thus, while the coaching program does not cause a pronounced
shift of the grade distribution in the fall, it does appear to prevent students from earning extremely low grades, as the
grade distribution is truncated at a residual grade of -14.6.

                                                           16
lack the necessary power to meaningfully distinguish potential differences in the effects of

coaching across different subgroups.


         Table 7 shows treatment effects on all course grades across a variety of student

subgroups. The effects of the online-only and text messaging treatments are not statistically

significant for any type of student, with the lone exception being a small positive effect of the

online-only treatment on students whose mother tongue is English. We find that coaching effects

are stronger for men, students who are 20 years of age or older, first-generation students, and

students who are not in first year. Given the small coaching treatment sample size, however, we

are hesitant to push these results further without investigation on a bigger a sample of students.


         We also investigate whether there are heterogeneous treatment effects across the three U

of T campuses. Tables 8, 9, and 10 show the effects of the three treatments on grade outcomes

from all courses at the St. George, Scarborough, and Mississauga campuses, respectively. The

effects of the coaching treatment are only reported among students attending the Mississauga

campus, as only these students were randomly offered the coaching service. Table 8 shows that

neither the online exercise nor the text messaging campaign had any effect on student grade

outcomes at the main campus, St. George. Table 9 shows similar patterns at the Scarborough

campus, where there are also no significant effects from either the online exercise or the text

messaging program.13


         Table 10 shows the effects of the three treatments on grade outcomes from all courses at

the Mississauga campus. The estimated effects of the online exercise and the texting campaign

are larger on this campus than those found in the pooled sample and at the other two campuses

13
  Tables 8 and 9 show treatment effects on all course grades. While we do not report the results, there are also
virtually no effects on grades from full-year courses, winter courses, and fall courses at both the St. George and
Scarborough campuses.

                                                          17
separately. Columns (1) and (2) show that the online exercise boosts course grades by 1.93

percentage points, on average. The estimate is significant at the 10 percent level and implies that

the online exercise increases grades by 11 percent of the control group standard deviation. This is

a relatively small effect when compared to the coaching treatment, which increases grades by

5.95 percentage points or 35 percent of a standard deviation. The online exercise also boosts the

likelihood that students earn a grade above 80 percent and decreases the likelihood of earning a

grade below 60 percent, but the effects are again smaller than those from the coaching treatment.


       In sum, there is robust evidence that the neither the online exercise nor the text messaging

campaign were effective at improving students’ academic outcomes, both in the general

population and across various student subgroups. The lone exception may be the positive effects

of online exercise among students at the Mississauga campus, although these effects are small

relative to the coaching treatment. They are also larger in magnitude than the effects of the text

messaging treatment, calling into question whether their statistical significance is due to real

treatment effectiveness or random chance. In contrast to the one-time online intervention and the

consistent-contact text messaging campaign, we find economically and statistically significant

effects of the personal coaching treatment and a wide variety of academic outcomes. We discuss

the potential reasons why the coaching treatment was more effective than the other two

treatments and how the text messaging campaign can be adjusted to improve its effectiveness in

the following section.




5. Discussion




                                                18
        We find that neither the one-time online intervention nor the text messaging campaign

have significant effects on student outcomes while personal coaching boosts students’ grades and

GPA by approximately 35 percent of a standard deviation. The key disadvantage of our coaching

programs – and others like it – is that it is costlier to implement and scale-up than one-time

online interventions or interventions that rely heavily on technology for constant contact with

students.


        Although our upper-year coaches participated in the experiment as part of a research

opportunity program (for course credit), such students would typically require at least $20 per-

hour from the university to provide coaching services. With each of our coaches devoting

approximately seven total hours per-week to coaching, this conservative wage rate implies that

the coaching program would regularly cost over $13,000 to service seventeen student

participants. In contrast, after the initial setup costs, the online intervention is done at no

additional cost and the total cost of the messaging campaign that serviced more the 1500 student

participants was approximately $1,200 for the entire academic year. Given the large differences

in relative costs, it is worth discussing the key differences between the coaching treatment and

the text messaging campaign, with the goal of learning how to modify the texting initiative to

increase its effectiveness.14


        A common characteristic across many successful coaching programs is regular student-

coach interaction facilitated either by mandatory meetings between coaches and students or

proactive coaches who regularly initiate contact (Scrivener and Weiss, 2013; Bettinger and


14
  An alternative way to reduce the costs of one-on-one coaching is to recruit upper-year undergraduates to volunteer
their time as coaches, with the promise of gathering valuable experience to place on a resume. Universities can help
make this type of volunteer work attractive by creating a system that official recognizes students volunteer
investments. The U of T Co-Curricular Record, for example, is designed to give students explicit credit for their
experiences outside of the classroom (https://ccr.utoronto.ca/home.htm).

                                                        19
Baker, 2014; Cook et al., 2014; Oreopoulos et al. (forthcoming)). Indeed, having proactive

coaches is the key difference between our coaching service and that offered in Angrist, Lang,

and Oreopoulos (2009), which was also conducted at the Mississauga campus of U of T but

resulted in negligible effects. In that study, one treatment arm had student coaches email once a

week and offer to meet at a student service office. In contrast, this study had student coaches

aggressively initiate contact and build trust with students over time, in person and through text.

Our coaches were able to clearly understand the problems students were facing through a series

of open-ended gentle questions. Upon understanding the problem, the coaches could provide

clear advice, resulting in most conversations ending with students knowing at least one specific

action to take to help them solve their current problems.


       Our text messaging campaign sent weekly messages of academic advice, resource

information, and motivation, but we did not initiate contact with individual students to

specifically ask how they were doing or whether they wanted to talk about something specific.

The text messaging team often did invite students to reply to our texts and share their concerns,

but we were unable to do this from the perspective of a coach – that is, we did not present

ourselves as a real person (with a name) and we did not try to establish a rapport with the

students. Our inability to reach out to all students and softly guide the conversation likely prevent

us from learning the key details of their specific problems. Although we would provide answers

and advice to the questions we received, we did not have as much information on the students’

backgrounds as our coaches did, and thus could not tailor our responses to each student’s specific

circumstances.


       Our coaches were also able to build trust with their students by often fulfilling a support

role for them. Figure 4 provides an example of how the coaching service was far more effective

                                                 20
than the text messaging campaign in this respect. The text messages attempted to “nudge”

students in the right direction, rather than provide tailored support. The left panel of Figure 4

shows three consecutive text messages, in which we provide a tip on stress management, an

inspirational quote, and a time-management tip around the exam period. As shown in this

example, it was very often the case that students would not respond to such messages. In

contrast, the student-coach interaction in the right panel of Figure 4 shows our coaches offering

more of a supportive role to students rather than trying to simply nudge them toward a certain

path. The coach starts by asking an open-ended question, to which the student responds and

guides the conversation forward. In this particular example, the coach assures the student that

they will be available to help with a pending deadline and shows a genuine interest in the events

in the student’s life.


        Coaches also kept a record of their evolving conversations with each student and were

able to check in with students to ask how previously discussed issues were being resolved.

Although we kept a record of all text message conversations we had with students, a lack of

resources did not allow us to regularly check in with students to see how previous events had

unfolded. A lack of these regular check-ups likely prevented us from helping students effectively

with the problems they told us about and from establishing the trust required for students to share

additional problems.


        In sum, the two key features that distinguish the coaching service from the texting

campaign are that coaches proactively initiated discussion with students about their problems and

were able to establish relationships based on trust in which students felt comfortable to openly

discuss their issues. Our coaches being able to slowly guide the conversations and inquire about



                                                21
previously discussed events likely contributed in large part to establishing the required trust

between students and coaches.


       Future work that attempts to improve academic outcomes in higher education with

interventions that use technology to maintain constant contact with students should keep in mind

that simply nudging students in the right direction may not be enough. A more personalized

approach may be required, in which coaches or mentors initially guide students through a series

of gentle conversations and subsequently show a proactive interest in students’ lives. These

conversations need not necessarily occur during face-to-face meetings, but the available evidence

suggests that they should occur frequently and be initiated by the coaches. While such an

intervention is likely to be costlier than the text messaging campaign in this study, it is also likely

to be more effective than the current messaging campaign but still less costly than the

personalized coaching treatment analyzed here.




6. Conclusion


       Building on recent insights from social psychology and behavioral economics, we

estimated the effects of the following three treatments on students’ academic outcomes: (i) an

online exercise designed to affirm students’ values and goals in university, (ii) a two-way text

and email messaging campaign that provided students with academic advice and motivation, and

(iii) a one-on-one coaching program in which students were matched with upper-year

undergraduate students acting as coaches. We found no effect from either the online exercise or

the messaging campaign, across the general student population and many student subgroups. In

contrast, we found large and significant effects from the coaching program, which increased


                                                  22
average course grades by 0.3 standard deviations and GPA by 0.35 standard deviations. Coached

students also failed fewer credits and earned more credits, on average.


       Contrasting the designs of the text messaging campaign treatment and the coaching

treatment, we argued that coaches being proactive in contacting students was a critical feature of

the program’s success. Coaches were also better able to keep an account of previously discussed

issues, subsequently inquire about how those issues were being resolved, and build the required

trust that made students feel comfortable enough to keep returning for help.


       We intend to test these conjectures in ongoing work, which features another phase of the

experiment where the text messaging treatment has been modified to more closely reflect the

coaching program studied here. Our support team has expanded to include ten “virtual” coaches

who are each assigned 80 to 100 students. Each virtual coach will regularly engage with their

students via text and email, refer back to previously discussed events, and provide consistent

support throughout the academic year. We also intend to expand the sample size of the personal

coaching treatment and again test how far technology can go in replicating the effects of one-on-

one coaching. These interventions are attractive because they are relatively inexpensive and

scalable, and can be implemented across a wide range of settings. With continued research, there

exists real potential for developing a consensus around the types of student services that are most

effective for improving student progress and well-being.

This figure presents residual grade distributions using grade outcomes from all (full-year, winter, and fall) courses.
To construct the figure, we stack course grade outcomes for all students from all courses, regress course grades on
campus and first-year fixed effects, and obtain the residuals from this regression. The figure shows the density of
these residuals for each of the three treatment groups and the control group.

This figure presents residual grade distributions using grade outcomes from fall courses only. To construct the
figure, we stack course grade outcomes for all students from all fall courses, regress course grades on campus and
first-year fixed effects, and obtain the residuals from this regression. The figure shows the density of these residuals
for each of the three treatment groups and the control group.
