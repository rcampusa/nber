This paper revisits capital-skill complementarity and inequality, as in Krusell, Ohanian, Rios-Rull
and Violante (KORV, 2000). Using their methodology, we study how well the KORV model
accounts for more recent data, including the large changes in labor's share of income that were
not present in KORV. We study both labor share of gross income (as in KORV), and income net
of depreciation. We also use non-farm business sector output as an alternative measure of
production to real GDP. We find strong evidence for continued capital-skill complementarity in
the most recent data, and that the model continues to closely account for the skill premium. The
model captures the average level of labor share, though it overpredicts its level by 2-4 percentage
points at the end of the period.

1         Introduction

This paper studies capital-skill complementarity as developed by Krusell et al. (2000), here-
after referred to as KORV. There are two important and related reasons to revisit this
hypothesis. One is that KORV analyze data from 1963-1992, which is well before recent con-
cerns about rising inequality. Another is because information, communications, and other
advanced technologies that form the conceptual basis for the KORV production function
have advanced enormously since 1992.1 To put this in perspective, we note that in 1992,
the internet was largely unknown, only one out of four homes had a personal computer,
the most popular business software was Lotus 1-2-3, and smart phones, online commerce,
and portable document formatting (PDF) had not yet arrived. To the extent that these
and related technological advances complement skilled labor more than unskilled labor, we
would expect that the KORV hypothesis would continue to be quantitatively important in
the post-1992 data.
        We update the KORV dataset up to 2019. We estimate the parameters of the model, in-
cluding the substitution elasticity parameters, using their same two-stage SPMLE technique,
in which parameters are chosen to minimize the distance between data and model moments
involving labor's share of income, the ratio of labor income paid to skilled workers to that of
unskilled workers, and an ex-ante rate of return equality (arbitrage) between different types
of capital goods. As in KORV, the wage premium is implied by estimated parameters and
data.
        This analysis allows us to address several questions about inequality and the capital-skill
complementarity hypothesis. Will the KORV model account closely for the skill premium in
post-1992 data? Will the parameter estimates be similar to the original estimates? If not,
how will they change, and why? Along which dimensions will the model perform better,
or worse? How will the large post-1992 changes in labor's share of gross income affect the
    1
    The growth rate of relative price of equipment capital, a proxy for the inverse of equipment-specific
technological progress, has averaged -6.6 percent per year after 1992, compared to -4.3 percent observed
during 1963-1992.


                                                   1
analysis?
   Regarding labor share, we analyze the model using both labor share of gross income,
which is the measure that has declined, and labor share of income net of depreciation, which
has not declined as much, and which is now being analyzed widely within the literature.
KORV only considered gross labor share since there were no large changes in depreciation
during the years they studied, and thus there was no need to consider both.
   Our main finding is that the KORV model continues to fit the data quite well, with high
substitutability between unskilled labor and capital, and relative complementarity between
skilled labor and capital.
   The size of the relative complementarity between skilled labor and capital is modestly
smaller than in KORV. This is driven largely by the post-1992 movements in labor's share,
as the estimated parameters from the original KORV period imply a significant increase in
labor's share of income outside of the original data period. Neither gross nor net labor share
exhibits such a rise in observed data. The estimation thus chooses a somewhat smaller,
though still highly significant, complementarity between skilled labor and equipment capital
to attenuate this increase: 0.76 when gross labor share is used, and 0.72 for net labor share,
compared to 0.67 in KORV (gross labor share).
   We find even a bit stronger complementarity with net labor share, suggesting the decline
in gross labor share reflects a compositional shift of the capital stock towards more rapidly
depreciating equipment. The model with (KORV's definition of) net labor share outperforms
the baseline model with gross labor share as it has a bit better fit of the skill premium, it is
more consistent with the observed rates of return on equipment capital, and it can correctly
capture the long-term stability of (net) labor share.
   As a robustness check, we estimate the model using non-farm business sector gross and
net labor shares. A strong capital-skill complementarity between skilled labor and equipment
capital prevails in this case too, and the model's fit of data improves slightly relative to the
baseline case with KORV's definition of gross labor share, particularly for the skill premium.

erature. Section 3 presents a short description of data construction and a data summary.

Section 6 concludes.



2     Related Literature

Our paper contributes to several strands of literature. Krusell et al. (2000), whose elasticity
estimates have been used widely, is the most obvious. Previously, Polgreen and Silos (2008)
revisited the KORV study and, using data through 2004, they found that capital-skill com-
plementarity is extremely robust to the price series used. In a more recent study, Maliar
et al. (2020) re-estimated the KORV model with data through 2017. They also found that
the capital-skill complementarity framework remains remarkably successful in explaining the
U.S. data, particularly the skill premium. Despite the similarities in findings, our estima-
tion gives a closer match of the original KORV results and a closer fit of the U.S. data. In
particular, our estimates of ex-post rates of return are in line with standard measures of
these returns, while those estimated by Maliar et al. (2020) are too high, averaging around
35-40 percent. We also assess the sensitivity of our results to various definitions of the labor
share, particularly differentiating between gross and net (of depreciation) labor shares, and
analyzing both real GDP and real non-farm private business output.
    The paper also relates to the literature on factor income shares. Labor's share of gross
income in the U.S. has been declining in recent years (see for instance, Karabarbounis and
Neiman (2014b) and Armenter (2015)). Explanations of the declining trend include trade
and offshoring (Elsby et al. (2013)), foreign direct investment in inflows and mechanization
(Guerriero (2012)), structural change and heterogeneity (Alvarez-Cuadrado et al. (2015)), a
global productivity slowdown (Grossman et al. (2018)), and increasing concentration within
industries (Dorn et al. (2017)). Our paper relates to those that connect the declining labor



                                               3
share to technological change, including Orak (2017), who links the decline in labor's share
to technological change and the resulting shift in occupational composition of the workforce;
Eden and Gaggl (2018), who attribute half of the decline to the rise in the income share
of ICT capital, using a framework distinguishing between ICT and non-ICT capital; Eden
and Gaggl (2019), who show that more than one quarter of the global decline in the labor
share can be explained by a change in capital composition that works through automation;
and vom Lehn (2018), who explains the decline with replacement of workers engaged in
routine (repetitive) occupations (job polarization). Analyzing the KORV model after 1992
allows the model to confront these observations and analyze their quantitative importance
in estimating the production function parameters.
        There are also several studies suggesting that the decline in labor's share is not significant
once some factors, such as the housing sector (Rognlie (2015)), capitalization of intellectual
property products (Koh et al. (2015)), and depreciation and taxes (Bridgman (2014)), are
netted out.2 Sherk (2016) argues that the decline in labor's share reflects how increased
depreciation of capital and the income of the self-employed are accounted for. Given these
issues regarding gross and net income, we construct a measure of net labor share to use in
the analysis, which is indeed more stable than the gross labor share.3 Using net labor share
leads to a higher estimated complementarity between skilled labor and equipment capital
and a modestly better fit for the data, while producing a labor share more consistent with
its data counterpart in terms of its long-run stability.

We focus on U.S. time series of capital and labor between 1963 and 2019.

     Note that Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014a) analyze labor share of gross income and of income net of
depreciation, but they conclude that there is a declining trend in both labor share series on a global scale.
However, Bridgman (2014) and our study focus solely on U.S. data.

     KORV's measure of gross labor share already excluded self-employment.

3.1      Capital data

We collected the equipment (including intellectual property products) and structures invest-
ment series from National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) and we used the perpetual
inventory method (PIM) following the formula below:


      F inal inventory = Beginning inventory  (1 - Depreciation rate) + investment.


      We obtain structures investment from NIPA Table 5.2.5, then use the implicit price
deflator of GDP retrieved from FRED to generate real investment levels for each year.4 The
quarterly data is transformed into an annual series via simple averaging.
      As Krusell et al. (2000) point out, NIPA data on capital equipment stock tends to over-
state price changes because it does not adequately account for increases in quality over time.
Therefore, we need a quality-adjusted equipment capital price series to deflate the invest-
ment in nonresidential equipment capital and intellectual property products when deriving
the equipment capital stock series. We take the consumption deflator provided by DiCe-
cio (2009), and multiply it with the relative price of equipment, also drawn from DiCecio
(2009) to obtain the deflator of equipment investment, which are constructed following the
procedure pioneered by Cummins and Violante (2002).56
      When constructing the capital stock series, we use time-varying depreciation rates, which
we calculate from the NIPA tables by dividing the current cost capital consumption series
by current cost capital stock series. Alternatively, we also use constant depreciation rates as
in KORV, but recalibrate those using the most recent data.

3.2    Labor inputs and wage rates

As in Krusell et al. (2000), we specify skilled and unskilled labor based on educational
attainment. The data are drawn mainly from the Current Population Survey (CPS) March
Supplement - now called the Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement - integrated
by IPUMS (Flood et al. (2015)) for the years 1963-2019. We use all of the person-level
data, excluding those who are younger than 16 or older than 70, unpaid family workers,
and those working in the military. Although we also drop the self-employed from our wage
sample, we use them when constructing labor input series. We also drop the observations
of those who report working less than 40 weeks a year and/or 35 hours a week. Finally,
we exclude individuals with allocated income, those with hourly wages below half of the
minimum federal wage rate, and those whose weekly pay was less than $62 in 1980 dollars
to remove outliers and misreporting. Detailed description of the construction of labor input
and hourly wages is in the Appendix A.1.


3.3    Labor share

We construct our labor share series using the BEA NIPA tables. To facilitate comparison
with Krusell et al. (2000), we use their definition of labor share, which is constructed in a
manner similar to what Cooley and Prescott (1995) describe. As such, we define labor share
as the ratio of labor income (wages, salaries, and benefits) to the sum of labor income plus
capital income (depreciation, corporate profits, net interest, and rental income of persons).
This is our benchmark definition and is called the "KORV definition." As an alternative,
we also use the non-farm business sector (NFBS) labor share, which is the most commonly
used definition in the labor share literature. The data construction is in Appendix A.2
and we also report some of the findings with this alternative definition in Appendix C. As
shown in Figure 3.1, although the (gross) labor share was nearly flat in KORV's data, it has
been trending down since then (though our data has some level differences, possibly driven
by data revisions). Apart from level differences, both KORV and NFBS series show this

                                             6
pattern, though the decline is less pronounced for the NFBS labor share.

                              Figure 3.1: Gross Labor Shares




   While the declining labor share has been considered one of the most striking features
of the recent U.S. economy, some claim that the decline reflects increased depreciation of
capital (see, for example, Sherk (2016)). To analyze how netting out depreciation affects our
findings, we construct an alternative measure of labor share that subtracts depreciation from
gross income, which we use to construct labor share of net income. As seen in Figure 3.2,
these net measures of labor share do not exhibit a significant trend decline, though they are
volatile.


3.4     Summary of the data

Figure 3.3 presents the evolution of the labor data over the 1963-2019 period, along with a
comparison to the original KORV data. Skilled labor input (panel a) has been continuously
rising since the early 1970s, while unskilled labor input (panel b) declined by almost 25
percent over the 1963-2019 period. These patterns are largely in line with what KORV


                                             7
                                 Figure 3.2: Net Labor Shares




documented for the 1963-1992 period, though there is a level shift in skilled labor input
(reflecting data revision) beginning from 1982 in our update relative to KORV. Of note,
other studies replicating KORV data, including Polgreen and Silos (2008) and Maliar et al.
(2020), have documented a similar level shift. The wage-bill ratio, which is the ratio of income
share of skilled labor to that of unskilled, has continued to increase (panel c). Finally, income
inequality has continued to widen since KORV's study, with the skill premium rising from a
normalized level of about 1.2 in 1992 (the final year of KORV) to about 1.5 in 2019 (panel
d).
      Figure 3.4 presents the evolution of the capital data over the 1963-2019 period, together
with a comparison to the original KORV data when applicable. Consider first panel a,
which shows the growth rate of the relative price of equipment capital, the (inverse) proxy
for technological progress. The decline in the relative price of equipment capital accelerated
during the late 1990s and early 2000s, which is commonly cited as the "IT Boom" period.
Since then, the growth rate of relative price of equipment capital has averaged about -6.6

percent per year, compared to the -4.3 percent observed during the period of original Krusell
et al. (2000) study. This indicates faster technological progress in equipment after 1992,
which coincides with a rising depreciation rate (panel b) and an acceleration of the increase
in the stock of equipment capital (panel c). By 2019, the stock of equipment capital is more
than eighty times larger than its 1963 level, whereas the stock of structures is only about
4.7 times larger in 2019 than in 1963 (panel d). Even so, our stock of structures has a
more rapid growth pace relative to original KORV data, including during the time period of
original KORV study, reflecting data revisions.

4     Model

4.1    Model environment

We use the same theoretical model as Krusell et al. (2000). There are four factors of pro-
duction: structures (kst ) and equipment (keq ) capital, and skilled (s) and unskilled (u) labor
inputs. These inputs are combined using a nested CES aggregate production function that
allows different substitution elasticities between unskilled labor input and the composite out-
put of equipment capital and skilled labor input, and between equipment capital and skilled
labor input.


                                              10
   There are three final goods in the economy: consumption (c), investment in structures
capital (ist ), and investment in equipment capital (ieq ). Consumption and structures capital
are produced using the same constant returns to scale technology, and prices of both are
normalized to 1. There is equipment-specific technological change in which one unit of the
final good that is invested in equipment produces qt units of equipment capital, where qt is
equipment-specific productivity.
   Perfect competition guarantees that:

                                                           1
                                                 peq,t =      .                                              (4.1)
                                                           qt

where, peq,t is the relative price of equipment capital, which is used as the (inverse) proxy
for technological progress.
   Given competition and constant returns to scale, the aggregate resource constraint for
this economy is as follows:

                                     ieq,t
                 Yt = ct + ist,t +         = At G (kst,t , keq,t , hu,t , hs,t ; u,t , s,t ; ) ,             (4.2)
                                      qt

where Yt is the final good, hu , and hs are raw unskilled and skilled labor units, respectively.
Similarly, u and s are efficiencies of these labor types. At denotes neutral technological
change. Finally,  is the set of model parameters, which is detailed below.


4.2    Production technology

Following Krusell et al. (2000), we use the CES aggregate production function below:



                                                                                                      1-
                                                                                                       
                                                                                      
  G (kst,t , keq,t , hu,t , hs,t ; u,t , s,t ; ) = kst,t µut + (1 - µ) keq,t + (1 - )st
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                           . (4.3)


   The elasticity of substitution between unskilled labor input and equipment capital is the


                                                      11
same as the substitution elasticity between unskilled and skilled labor inputs.7 In equation
(4.3), ut and st , efficiency hours for the respective skill group, are defined as follows:


                                                  ut = eu,t hu,t                                         (4.4)

                                                  st = es,t hs,t .                                       (4.5)


       The model has the following set of parameters to be estimated:   {, , , µ, }.
Here, µ and  are parameters governing the factor shares. The parameter  is the income
share of structures capital. The parameters  and  are the key parameters as they govern
the elasticities of substitution between equipment capital and the two types of labor input.
Following Krusell et al. (2000), we define the elasticity of substitution between unskilled
                                                                                                     1

       >   1-
              ).   This implies that equipment-specific technological progress increases the relative
demand for skilled labor input, while the relative demand for unskilled labor would fall.


4.3        The model skill premium

Given perfect competition, the firm's problem is:


                            t = Yt - rst,t kst,t - req,t keq,t - wu,t hu,t - ws,t hs,t ,                 (4.6)


where, rst,t and req,t are the rental rates of structures and equipment capital, respectively.
Similarly, wu,t and ws,t denote the wage rates of unskilled and skilled labor at time t.
   7
     Krusell et al. (2000) argue that an alternative nesting that would restrict the elasticity of substitution
between unskilled labor and equipment capital to be the same as that between skilled labor and equipment
capital is not consistent with data. Orak (2017) reports a similar finding.
   8
     Note that this definition assumes that all other factors are constant. Polgreen and Silos (2008) report
that capital-skill complementarity prevails even when the Allen and Morishima elasticities of substitution
are used instead, though at significantly varying magnitudes.



                                                        12
   The skill premium at time t is:

                                                    w st   M P Ls,t
                                           t =           =          ,
                                                    wu,t   M P Lu,t

where M P Ls,t and M P Lu,t are marginal products of skilled and unskilled labor inputs,
respectively.
   As presented in Krusell et al. (2000), the skill premium in this model is as follows:

                                                                       -
                                                                                    1-

                                                                            hu,t           s,t
             t =                                           + (1 - )                                   .       (4.7)
                       µ                        st                          hs,t           u,t

   When we log-linearize equation (4.7) and differentiate with respect to time, we obtain:



                                                                      capital-skill complementarity effect

                                                                            keq,t

                                                                             st

where, gj,t denotes growth rate of variable j at time t.
   As shown in equation (4.8), Krusell et al. (2000) decompose the growth in the skill
premium into three components. The first component, the relative quantity effect, shows
that when  < 1, relatively faster growth in skilled labor supply reduces the skill premium.
The relative efficiency effect depends on the sign of  . When  > 0 ( < 0), relatively faster
growth of skilled labor efficiency drives the skill premium higher (lower). Finally, when there
is capital-skill complementarity, meaning that  -  > 0, faster growth in equipment capital
relative to the supply of skilled labor input increases the skill premium. This effect would
get smaller (larger) over time if  < 0 ( > 0).

5     Quantitative Analyses

5.1     Estimation Strategy

We estimate the model between 1963-2019, compared to 1963-1992 in Krusell et al. (2000).
We use the same empirical methodology as Krusell et al. (2000). This includes a two-stage
simulated pseudo maximum likelihood (SPMLE) procedure to estimate most of the model
parameters. Appendix B describes this in detail.
    There are two stochastic elements to close the model and ensure that the likelihood is
well-defined. One element involves introducing stochastic components into the two labor
inputs. Following Krusell et al. (2000), we specify the stochastic process as:


                                          t = 0 + t + t ,                                           (5.1)


where, t is a 2 × 1 vector of the log of labor efficiencies for skilled and unskilled labor at
time t,  is a 2 × 1 vector of efficiency growth rates, 0 is a 2 × 1 vector of constants that
correspond to the initial levels of efficiencies (and average efficiency levels in the absence of
trend growth), and t is a 2 × 1 vector of labor efficiency shocks, which have a multivariate
normal distribution with zero mean and covariance matrix . We set  = 0 as Krusell et al.
(2000) did.
    The relative price of equipment capital is the second stochastic element. This price affects
the rate of return to investment in equipment capital. Krusell et al. (2000) hypothesized a
risk neutral investor in which arbitrage equates the ex-ante expected returns on structures
and equipment investments. This "no arbitrage" condition is given as:

                                                    qt
              qt At+1 Geq,t+1 + (1 - eq,t+1 )E            = At+1 Gst,t+1 + (1 - st,t+1 ),           (5.2)
                                                   qt+1

where, Geq,t+1 and Gst,t+1 are derivatives of function G (kst,t , keq,t , hu,t , hs,t ; u,t , s,t ; ) with
respect to equipment and structural capitals at time t + 1, respectively, and st,t and eq,t

                                                   14
are the corresponding depreciation rates at time t. The first term on the left hand side
is the marginal product of equipment investment, and the second term is undepreciated
equipment capital, adjusted by the expected change in its value. The right hand side terms
are analogues.
   Equation (5.2) is one of the three equations used in the estimation. We adopt the
assumptions of Krusell et al. (2000) regarding this equation: there is no risk premium,
                                                                                                 qt
tax treatments for these two types of capital are the same, and (1 - eq,t+1 )E                  qt+1
                                                                                                       =
(1 - eq,t+1 ) qtq+1
                 t
                    +   t   with   t   is assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and
variance  2 .
   The other two equations used in the estimation are as follows:

                                                          ws,t hs,t
                               wbrt (Xt , u,t , s,t ; ) =                                          (5.3)
                                                          wu,t hu,t
                                                          ws,t hs,t + wu,t hu,t
                            lsharet (Xt , u,t , s,t ; ) =                       ,                  (5.4)
                                                                    Yt

   where the wbrt is the wage-bill ratio and lsharet is the labor share, both of which are a
function of observable factor inputs Xt = {kst,t , keq,t , hu,t , hs,t }, unobservable labor efficiencies
u,t and s,t , and a set of parameters  = {, , , µ, , u0 , s0 ,  ,  , eq , st }. This is a
non-linear state space model with three observation equations Zt = f (Xt , u,t , u,t , t ; ),
and two state equations t = 0 + t (one for skilled and one for unskilled labor efficiency).
Here, Z is a 3 × 1 vector of observables, corresponding to equations 5.2 to 5.4. The right
hand sides of the equations are the model counterparts.
   As in Krusell et al. (2000), we calibrate some of the parameters. Depreciation rates
are calibrated using the NIPA tables for the capital stock and capital consumption. Unlike
Krusell et al. (2000), we use time varying depreciation rates in our benchmark analysis. We
find that the depreciation rate of structural capital averages 0.0278, while the depreciation
rate of equipment capital averages 0.1483 over the 1963-2019 period, beginning with 0.1311
in 1963 and rising up to 0.1706 in 2019. For simplicity, we assume the future depreciation


                                                     15
rates in the case of time-varying depreciation are known.
       Following Krusell et al. (2000), we estimate an ARIMA model for the relative price of
equipment capital to calibrate  , where  is set equal to (1 - ¯eq ) times the standard error

                                                                 ^t = 2.12 - 0.001t -
of the residuals of the ARIMA model. The resulting regression is q
                                             qt-1
0.48^
    qt-1 + 0.58    t-1   +   t   with q
                                      ^t =    qt
                                                    and  = 0.0233.9 This regression gives us  = 0.020.
Furthermore, because µ, , u0 , and s0 are scaling parameters, we normalize s0 as Krusell
et al. (2000) do, setting it equal to 2.
       The remaining parameters are estimated using the two-stage SPMLE method of Krusell
et al. (2000), which is discussed in more detail in Appendix B. In the first stage, to allow for
the possible dependence of labor input on shocks, we follow Krusell et al. (2000) and regress
the labor inputs on factors that could potentially affect labor quality, which are the current
and lagged stocks of both types of capital, lagged relative equipment capital price, a time
trend, and the lagged value of leading business cycle indicator of the Conference Board. The
fitted (instrumented) values are then used in the SPMLE stage.
       As in KORV, we chose the value of  that minimizes the joint sum of squared deviations
between the skill premium and its model counterpart and between the ex-post returns on
structural and equipment investments. Note that we do not view this parameter as having
economic interest, as it was introduced to ensure a well-behaved likelihood.10


5.2       Findings

This subsection presents the baseline results, which use KORV's definition of gross labor
share for comparability, and include the BEA's time-varying depreciation rates. As a ro-
bustness check, we also estimated the model using constant depreciation rates. The findings
are very similar and thus are reported in the Appendix C.
   9
       When we estimate the ARIMA model for the 1963-1992 period, we obtain the following regression:
q
^ t = 2.85 - 0.001t + 0.55^
                          qt-1 - t-1 + t with  = 0.0243, which gives us  = 0.021.
    10
       As the working paper version of Krusell et al. (2000) notes, if  is estimated jointly with the rest of the
parameters, the algorithm chooses a very large value as it helps fit the difference between the two rates of
return to capital in the mid-1970s when the relative price is extremely volatile. This, however, worsens the
fit of the skill premium.

                                                          16
   Table 5.1 presents the estimated parameters for 1963-1992, the original period of KORV,
using both the original KORV data and revised data. Column I reports the estimates of
KORV. Column II is our replication using the original KORV data. Figure C.1 in the
Appendix, should be compared to figures 5-8 in Krusell et al. (2000), as it presents the
model fit from this case. The estimated parameters and the model's fit are both very similar
to KORV.

        The values in parentheses are standard errors.



   As seen in Table 5.1, , the parameter governing the elasticity of substitution between
equipment capital and skilled labor input, and , the share of structures capital in pro-
duction, is about the same in all three cases. Our estimate of  , the parameter governing
the elasticity of substitution between equipment capital and skilled labor input, is slightly
different with revised data from KORV and from our estimates using their original data.
KORV's estimated elasticity was 1.67, compared to our estimate of 1.70 using their original
data (case II), and 1.77 with revised data (case III).
   Figure 5.1 presents the model's fit for 1963-1992 using the revised data (case III in
table 5.1). Panels a-d shows that the model predictions are broadly in line with the data.
Setting the shocks to labor efficiency to zero, panel d shows that the model captures the
rise in the skill premium in late 1960s, the decline until the 1980s, except for an increase


                                                   17
in the early 1980s, and the large rise thereafter. Regarding the labor share, the model
fails to capture the volatility observed in the data and instead predicts a fairly stable labor
share (panel b). Despite this, the model captures a sizable component of its long run trend,
predicting a decline until the early 1980s and a slight increase afterwards. Both the data
and the model have the same average labor share of 69.2 percent.

             Figure 5.1: The model's fit for 1963-1992 period with updated data




These charts are produced using the observed factor inputs and the parameters estimated using data for
1963-1992. The shock terms are set to zero when producing the charts. KORV's definition of gross labor
share is used in the estimation. While panel a runs through 1991, the rest of the panels plot the data and
the model fit for the entire 1963-1992 period.


   The elasticity parameters estimated by Krusell et al. (2000) have been used extensively in


                                                   18
the inequality literature. To determine their empirical fit after 1992, we kept these parame-
ters constant from case II in Table 5.1, but projected the model through 2019, extending the
original KORV data with the growth rates of variables since 1992. Figure 5.2 shows these
results. As seen in panels c and d, the model does remarkably well regarding the wage-bill
ratio and the skill premium until recently. Consider the skill premium, as shown in panel d.
Although the parameters are obtained with data until 1992, the model predicts the rise in
the skill premium until the early 2000s, as well as the slowdown in its growth rate until mid
2010s. However, the model with the original KORV parameter estimates fails to capture the
pickup in the skill premium in the last few years.
   The model fails to capture the ongoing decline in (gross) labor share, as it predicts a
counterfactual rise of labor's share up to about 78 percent by 2019, from an average value
of 69.2 percent. Similarly, the model does not equate the ex-ante expected rates of returns
of structural and equipment capital after the 1990s.
   To understand why the original model parameters predict a large rise in the labor share,
we conduct several counterfactuals which are presented in figure 5.3.
   Consider first the green dotted line, which is generated by keeping the skilled and unskilled
labor inputs constant at their 1992 levels. The figure shows that keeping these inputs fixed
generates an even larger increase in the labor share.
   Consider now the blue and black lines, which are generated by keeping the growth rate of
equipment capital during the post-1992 period at its average rate over the 1963-1992 period,
and by keeping equipment capital fixed at its 1992 level, respectively. These counterfactuals
show that the model's failure to track labor share results from the enormous rise in the stock
of equipment capital, which was not matched by a similar rise in the share of the skilled
labor input that would be implied by the original KORV elasticities.
   Given the large post-1992 changes in the data, it is natural to reestimate the model and
these key elasticities with data through 2019. Table 5.2 reports the parameters estimated
over 1963-2019.

The chart is produced using parameters estimated using the original KORV data until 1992. The shock
terms are set to zero when producing the charts as in KORV. Blue area represents the out of sample dates.
The solid line is the original KORV data up to 1992 and our we then extend it afterwards. The red dashed
line is produced using the observed factor inputs. In counterfactual 1, we keep skilled and unskilled labor
inputs constant at their 1992 levels. In counterfactual 2, we keep the growth rate of equipment capital during
the post-1992 period at its average rate over the 1963-1992 period. Finally, in counterfactual 3, we keep
equipment capital fixed at its 1992 level.


    As seen in Table 5.2, the parameters  and  are almost unchanged from what Krusell
et al. (2000) report and what we estimate for the 1963-1992 period. However, , the param-
eter governing the elasticity of substitution between equipment capital and the skilled labor
input shows somewhat less complementarity than in Krusell et al. (2000), -0.309 compared
to -0.517, which we obtain using revised data for 1963-1992.
    From a technological perspective, the finding that equipment capital and skilled labor be-
came somewhat less complementary since the early 1990s may reflect the fact that equipment-
specific technology is now replacing jobs involving skilled labor (e.g. artificial intelligence,
machine learning).
    The optimization algorithm chooses a somewhat lower complementarity between skilled

labor and equipment capital to attenuate the model's rising prediction of labor's share of
income, as a very high complementarity substantially increases skilled labor's productivity
and thus labor's share.
   Nonetheless, significant capital-skill complementarity is still estimated. Table 5.3 com-
pares our elasticity estimates to those of Krusell et al. (2000).

   Figure 5.4 presents the model's fit for 1963 to 2019. Compared to using parameters
estimated for the original KORV period (Figure 5.2), the model estimated through 2019
gives a much better fit of the labor share (panel b) as the counterfactual rise in the labor
share is attenuated. Although the model misses the volatility of labor share, particularly the
fall since the early 2000s, the average labor share in the model and data are both about 68
percent.
   The model estimated over 1963-2019 also improves the fit of the no-arbitrage condition, as
ex-post rates of return move together for both types of capital (panel a), though the model's
predicted ex-post rates of return are a bit higher than what empirical studies suggest. To
compare, Marx et al. (2019) report that return on U.S. productive capital has increased from
6 percent in 1980s to around 10 percent in late 1990s, before falling back to around 8 percent


                                                22
by 2010 and remaining there. In contrast, our model predicts return on capital to rise to a
little above 10 percent since early 2000s.

                       Figure 5.4: The model's fit for the 1963-2019 period




These charts are produced using the observed factor inputs and the parameters estimated employing data
for the 1963-2019 period. The shock terms are set to zero when producing the charts. KORV's definition
of gross labor share is used in estimation. While panel a runs through 2018, the rest of the panels plot the
data and the model fit for the entire 1963-2019 period.


    The model continues to capture the large changes in the skill premium, which include
the rise until the early 1970s, the fall until early 1980s and the rise thereafter, together
with a slowdown in the rise since the early 2000s until recently. This indicates that the
KORV model, and the hypothesis of capital-skill complementarity more broadly, remains


                                                    23
quantitatively important over 1963-2019, a period with remarkable growth in the relative
supplies of skilled and unskilled workers, and a period with enormous technological change.
       The results with constant depreciation rates, along with capital stocks constructed using
these constant rates, are almost unchanged from the baseline estimation (see Table C.1),
suggesting that our assumption on depreciation rates has no substantive impact on our
findings. Because the resulting model fit is nearly the same as those presented in Figures 5.1
and 5.4, we do not report them.
       Estimation with non-farm business sector labor share
       The findings are very similar when using non-farm business sector output rather than
real GDP. We use this measure of output as an alternative because it is frequently used in
the literature on income shares. Although the parameter estimates change slightly in this
case, as seen in Table 5.4, capital-skill complementarity remains sizable and significant, as
in the baseline case, which uses KORV's definition of the labor share.11

       As seen in Figure 5.5, the model fit improves slightly for the skill premium (see figure C.2
in Appendix C for 1963-1992 version of the model fit). This is also observed in the smaller
normalized root mean squared model errors (NRMSEs) for the skill premium compared
  11
    The only parameter that is considerably different from the baseline case is --income share of structural
capital. This is driven by the level difference between KORV and NFBS labor shares.

with that of the baseline model for the 1963-2019 period (columns II and I, respectively, in
Table 5.5). The model fit improves for the ex-ante no-arbitrage condition too, though ex-
post rates are even larger than in the baseline case. In terms of the labor share, using NFBS
gross labor share brings no improvement to our results, as can also be seen in Table 5.6,
which reports a larger NRMSE for the 1963-2019 period for this case than in the baseline
case with KORV's definition of gross labor share.

5.3      Estimation with Net Labor Share

This section presents model results when labor share is measured using income net of de-
preciation. As discussed earlier, gross labor share shows around a five percentage points fall
(our baseline), while net labor share does not have any obvious trend change, given higher
deprecation.
      When using net labor share in estimation, we change the profit function as follows:


            t = At Gt - (rst,t + s,t )kst,t - (req,t + peq,t eq,t )keq,t - wu,t hu,t - ws,t hs,t ,


where rt is the rental rate of capital net of depreciation. In this case, the labor share equation
is:
                                               At Gs,t hs,t + At Gu,t hu,t
                              lsharet =                                          .                   (5.5)
                                           At Gt - peq,t eq,t keq,t - st,t kst,t




                                                      26
The wage-bill-ratio equation does not change:

                                                        Gs,t hs,t
                                               wbrt =             .                                    (5.6)
                                                        Gu,t hu,t

The no-arbitrage condition is now written as follows:

  1                                                 peq,t+1
         (req,t+1 + peq,t eq,t+1 )+(1 - eq,t+1 )E              = (rst,t+1 + st,t+1 )+(1 - st,t+1 )+ t , (5.7)
 peq,t                                               peq,t

which is very similar to that in the model with gross labor share:

            1                                       peq,t+1
                   At+1 Gkeq,t+1 + (1 - eq,t+1 )E              = At+1 Gkst,t+1 + (1 - st,t+1 ) + t .
           peq,t                                     peq,t

   Table 5.7 presents the parameter estimates with net labor share, together with our
baseline parameter estimates for comparison. The capital-skill complementarity remains
quantitatively important and significant. The parameter  is estimated to be slightly more
complementary with equipment, -0.380 compared to -0.309, delivering a lower elasticity of
substitution between skilled labor and equipment capital, 0.72 in contrast to 0.76 for gross
labor share.

       Figure 5.6 presents the model fit with net labor share for the 1963-2019 period. The
model fit for the skill premium and wage-bill ratio improves slightly, especially for the latter
period relative to our baseline case with gross labor share (see Table 5.5). Moreover, the
model is consistent with the observed lower rate of return on equipment capital over the last
two decades. Without the challenge of having to fit the persistent negative trend in gross
labor's share, the model captures the relative stability of (net) labor share, with an average
net labor share of 80.5 percent, compared with 80.7 percent in data.
       To analyze the model fit for labor share, we compare normalized RMSEs for both gross
and net income, for the KORV income definition, and for non-farm business income.12 Ta-
ble 5.6 presents these statistics. As the table suggests, once the RMSEs are corrected (nor-
malized) to account for different levels of labor share definitions, all versions do similarly for
both periods. Yet, for the original period (1963-1992), the models with gross labor share
gives the smallest deviation from the data, while for the full period (1963-2019), models with
KORV's definition, both on gross and net terms, slightly outperform the model with NFBS
labor shares.
       In summary, all the different cases studied in this paper confirm that capital-skill com-
plementarity remains important, though it has weakened somewhat over time. The model
with KORV's definition of net labor share slightly outperforms the others, given that it has
a bit better fit of the skill premium, it is empirically consistent with the observed rates of
return on capital, and it captures the long-term stability of (net) labor share.



6        Conclusion

This paper analyzes capital-skill complementarity as a quantitatively important determinant
of U.S. wage inequality, using data through 2019, compared to Krusell et al. (2000), which
used data only through 1992. A major change in the post-1992 data is increased depreciation,
  12
    The estimation results and the model fit with non-farm business net labor share are presented in Table C.2
and Figure C.3 in Appendix C.

These charts are produced using the observable factor inputs and the parameters estimated employing data
for the 1963-2019 period. The shock terms are set to zero when producing the charts. KORV's definition of
labor share, net of depreciation, is used in estimation. While the panel a runs through 2018, the rest of the
panels plot the data and the model fit for the entire 1963-2019 period.

which in turn has reduced labor's share of gross income. We therefore used both labor's share
of gross income, as in the original KORV analysis, and also labor's share of net income. We
also used two definitions of income, the original KORV measure, and non-farm business
income, which is frequently used in the income share literature.
   We find that capital-skill complementarity continues to be a critical determinant of U.S.
wage inequality, irrespective of which definition of income is used to measure labor's share.
Labor's share of income does influence the degree of estimated complementarity between
equipment and skilled labor, but it does not have a sizeable effect on the model's ability
to account for the skill premium. The findings indicate that capital-skill complementarity
remains a quantitatively important determinant of U.S. wage inequality.

A      Data description

A.1     Construction of labor inputs and wage rates

We use all of the person-level data, excluding the agents who are younger than 16 or older
than 70, unpaid family workers, those working in the military, who were not in the labor
force the previous year, and who did not report their education level. Following Domeij
and Ljungqvist (2019), we included the self-employed when constructing labor inputs, even
though we excluded them from our wage sample. This gave us a better match of original
KORV data, but excluding or including the self-employed from the labor input construction
did not have any significant effect on our findings. In our wage sample, we also dropped the
observations reporting working less than 40 weeks a year and/or 35 hours a week. Following
Domeij and Ljungqvist (2019), we also dropped individuals with allocated income, those
with hourly wages below half of the minimum federal wage rate, and those whose weekly
pay was less than $62 in 1980 dollars from our wage sample.
    For each person, we record their personal characteristics: age, sex, race; employment
statistics: employment status (empstat), class of worker (classwly), weeks worked last year
(wkswork1 and wkswork2), usual hours worked per week last year (uhrsworkly and shr-
sworky); income: total wage and salary income (incwage) and CPS personal supplement
weights: asecwt. Then, each person is assigned to one of 264 groups created by age, race,
sex and skill (education). Age is divided into 11 five-year groups: 16-20, 21-25, 26-30, 31-35,
36-40, 41-45, 46-50, 51-55, 56-60, 61-65, 66-70. Race is divided into three: white, black,
others; sex is divided into male and female, and education is divided into four groups: below
high school, high school, some college and college graduates and beyond.
    Following Krusell et al. (2000), we did not do any correction for topcodes. Alterna-


                                              33
tively, we also adjusted topcoded income variables using the "revised income top-codes files"
published by Census Bureau to swap top-coded values in 1976-2010 CPS files with these
revised values. This procedure replaces the top-coded values with new values based on the
Income Component Rank Proximity Swap method, which was introduced in 2011. With
this method, we had the top-coding methodology consistent and comparable for most of the
years in our sample. Because the main results remained unchanged in this alternative case,
we reported only findings without corrections for topcodes, for the sake of comparability
with Krusell et al. (2000).
   For the CPS years after 1975, CPS has usual hours worked per week and weeks worked
last year. Thus, calculating the annual hours for a person is straightforward: we simply
multiply weeks worked last year by usual hours worked. Hence, for CPS years 1976 and
afterwards, total hours are:


                        hoursi,t-1 = wkswork 1i,t-1 × uhrsworki,t-1


where i is individual observation and t is the CPS year.
   For earlier years, we need to do two adjustments. First, weeks worked are available only
as intervals and we need to approximate a scalar value for each interval. Fortunately, both
the intervals and actual weeks are available for years after 1975. Therefore, we calculated
the average weeks worked after year 1975 for each interval and replaced the earlier years
with those values.
   Second, we have to use "hours worked last week" variable as a proxy to usual hours
worked per week last year. However, there are many agents who were not employed the
week before the survey or who were employed but not at work for some reason, despite
reporting a positive income for the previous year. Rather than dropping those observations,
we replaced the hours they worked per week with the average of the hours worked by the
people in their group in that particular year. We also paid attention to whether the person



                                             34
was employed part time or full time when doing this replacement.
   Hourly wage is calculated as:

                                              incwageswappedi,t-1
                              wagei,t-1 =
                                                  hoursi,t-1

Later, observations with weeks worked less than 40, weekly hours less than 35, hourly wage
is less than half the minimum wage, and weekly pay less than $62 in 1980 dollars are dropped
to smooth out the effect of outliers and misreporting. Following this, for each groups and
year, we calculate group weights as: µg,t =             µi,t , where i  g is set of groups. Then,
                                                   ig
average hours and wage measures for each group and year are calculated as follows:

                                                   µi,t × hoursi,t-1
                                              ig
                              hoursg,t-1 =
                                                         µg,t
                                                    µi,t × wagei,t-1
                                               ig
                               wageg,t-1 =
                                                         µg,t

   To aggregate across groups into aggregate task groups, we follow Krusell et al. (2000)
and use the group wages of 1980 as the weights. We have total hours:


                          Nt-1 =         hoursg,t-1 × µg,t × wageg,80
                                   g G


and average hourly wage is:

                                         hoursg,t-1 × µg,t × wageg,80
                                   g G
                          Wt-1 =
                                                    Nt-1




                                               35
A.2     Labor share

A.2.1   Gross labor share

As the baseline, we followed KORV's definition of labor share, which we constructed from
the BEA National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) Tables 1.10 and 1.17.5. To calcu-
late the gross labor share, we first constructed capital's income share following Cooley and
Prescott (1995) as the ratio of the sum of unambiguous capital income (net interest and
miscellaneous payments (domestic industries), rental income of persons with capital con-
sumption adjustment, corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption
adjustments (domestic industries)) and depreciation (consumption of fixed capital) to the
difference between gross domestic income and proprietors' income. We then subtracted this
ratio from 1 to obtain the gross labor share.
   An alternative measure uses the non-farm business sector labor share, defined as "total
employee compensation in the non-farm business sector excluding self-employment income"
divided by "gross value added in the non-farm business sector excluding self-employment
income." It is constructed using NIPA Tables 1.3.5, 1.12, 1.13 and 6.2. To construct the
numerator, we take "compensation of employees, domestic industries (NIPA Table 6.2, line
2)" and subtract the following items from it: farm compensation (Table 6.2, line 5), federal
general government compensation (Table 6.2, line 88), state and local general government
compensation (Table 6.2, line 93), compensation of households (Table 1.13, line 43), compen-
sation of institutions (Table 1.13, line 50). To obtain the denominator, we take "gross value
added in the non-farm business sector (Table 1.3.5, line 3)" and subtract "sole proprietors
income in the non-farm business sector (Table 1.12, line 11)" from it. The labor share still
demonstrates about 3 percentage points decline, a little less than about 5 percentage points
seen when the KORV's measure of labor share is considered.
   In short, when calculating the alternative labor share, we subtract farm and government
compensations from both the numerator and denominator from the KORV's measure. Eco-



                                                36
nomically, the difference between KORV's definition and the alternative measure of labor
share is the sectors: the former takes the whole economy while the latter focuses on the
non-farm business sectors.


A.2.2    Net labor share

Our first measure of net labor share is comparable to the first measure of gross labor share
(the KORV version), only excluding consumption of fixed capital from the numerator and
denominator when calculating the income share of capital. The alternative net labor share
measure is the non-farm business sector labor share net of depreciation. To build it, we only
replace the "gross value added in the non-farm business sector (Table 1.3.5, line 3)" with "net
value added in the non-farm business sector (Table 1.9.5, line 3)." We see a slight increase
in this measure of labor share over years after taking into account the effect of depreciation.
The surge around 2000 is largely attributed to an increase in employee compensations, and
a stable series of value added.



B       Estimation technique

The estimation process entirely follows from Krusell et al. (2000). The process is a simulated
two-stage pseudo-maximum likelihood estimation (SPMLE) method developed by White
(1996). Here, we are providing a brief description borrowed from KORV. Further details can
be found in the original paper, particularly in the working paper version.
    In the first stage, we first treat the skilled and unskilled labor input as endogenous,
and project them onto a constant, current, and lagged stocks of capital equipment and
structures, the lagged relative price of equipment, a trend, and the lagged value of the
U.S. Commerce Department's composite index of business cycle indicators. Then in the
second stage, we use the fitted values of skilled and unskilled labor input from the regression
                                                       ~ t as consisting of the stocks
in stage 1 to estimate the model. We define the vector X



                                              37
of equipment and structures and of the instrumented values of skilled and unskilled labor
       ~t =
input: X                         ^ s,t , h
                 kst,t , keq,t , h       ^ u,t , where h
                                                       ^ s,t and h
                                                                 ^ u,t stand for the fitted values for skilled

and unskilled labor.
      In the second stage, we use the instruments and the instrumented values of the labor
input series in SPMLE to estimate the parameters of the model. This proceeds as follows:
given the distributional assumptions on the error terms, for each date t observation, we
generate S realizations of the dependent variables, each indexed by i, by following two steps:


                                       Step 1: i           i
                                               t = 0 + t + t
                                                                                                       (B.1)
                                                       ~ t ,  i , i ; 
                                       Step 2: Zti = f X     t t



      In Step 1, a realization of t is drawn from its distribution and used to construct a year t
value for t . In Step 2, this realization of t , together with a draw of t allows us to generate
a realization of Zt . By simulating the model, we obtain the first and second moments of Zt :


                    ~t;  =         1      S       ~ t , t
                                                        i i
                 mS X              S      i=1   f X       , t ; 
                                                                                                       (B.2)
                      ~t;  =         1     S                    ~t;                  ~t; 
                 VS   X            S -1    i=1     Zti   - mS   X       Zti   - mS   X


      On the basis of these moments constructed for each t = 1...T , we can write the second-
stage objective function as:

                              T
                                                                               -1
  2      T~t,  = - 1
       Z ;X                                    ~t; 
                                       Zt - mS X                      ~t; 
                                                                   VS X                     ~t; 
                                                                                    Zt - mS X
                  2T         t=1                                                                       (B.3)
                                   ~t; 
                      - log det VS X


      The SPML estimator ^ST is defined as the maximizer of equation (B.3). Following Krusell

et al. (2000), we compute the standard errors using Theorem (6.11) in White (1996).
      Standard errors:
The computations of the exact asymptotic standard errors take into account the first-stage
parameter uncertainty in the instrumental variable estimation. Define the set of potentially

                                                           38
endogenous variables as X T and the set of instruments as W T in the first stage. Clearly,
the projection in the first stage can be regarded as a special case of maximum likelihood
                                                                       1
estimation, and we denote the first-stage likelihood function as           X T ; W T ,  , where  is
the parameters of this first-stage likelihood function. The second-stage likelihood function
is   2        ~ T W T ,  ,  , where X
         ZT ; X                     ~ T W T ,  is the linear projection of X T in the space

of W T , and the "*" parameters denote the pseudo-true values.
     Let  and  denote the first and second derivative with respect to . The Hessian
matrix and information matrix are as follows:

     Theorem 6.11 in White (1996) establishes that the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix
of ^T is var ^T       -1
                   = H22

                                                 H11        
                                                     H21 + H21  -1

compute the asymptotic variance of our simulation-based estimates of the parameters, we
replace in the above expressions  by ^T as well as  and ^T by ^ST .

                       Figure C.1: Replication with original KORV data




These charts are produced using the observable factor inputs and the parameters estimated employing the
original KORV data, which covers the period between 1963 and 1992. The shock terms are set to zero when
producing the charts. While the panel a runs through 1991, the rest of the panels plot the data and the
model fit for the entire 1963-1992 period.
