                                         I. INTRODUCTION

    Predictability, both in the time series and the cross section of stock returns, has been the
focus of much research in the field of empirical finance. At the time-series level, the main
finding is that variables like the price-dividend ratio and term premia can predict stock
returns variation at long horizons.1 As for the cross section of stock returns, predictability
translates into the use of conditioning variables to improve on the performance of the CAPM
and Consumption CAPM (CCAPM) versus their unconditional counterparts. These two
strands of the literature connect because lagged instruments that are shown to predict market
returns are natural conditioning variables for tests of the cross section.2
    Extant economic explanations for the time-series and cross-sectional predictability are
notably sparse and detached from one another. Time series predictability is obtained by
either investors’ learning about some unobservable fundamental process as in Timmermann
(1993, 1996) and Veronesi (2000) or cyclical variations in investors’ risk aversion as in Camp-
bell and Cochrane (1999) and Barberis et al. (2001). Instead, at the cross-sectional level,
the theoretical models concentrate either on portfolio constraints (Cuoco (1997)) or the ex-
ploitation of growth options’ opportunities (Gomes et al. (2000)). A notable exception is
Berk et al. (1999) who construct a model of firm’s investment with implications for the cross
section and that yields interest rates as predictors of market returns.
    In this paper we propose and test a different economic mechanism that generates stock
return predictability both at the time-series and at the cross-sectional level, namely, fluctu-
ations in the fraction of consumption funded by sources other than dividends from the stock
market. The intuition is straightforward. In addition to the dividends paid by competitively
traded stocks, investors have an endowment flow of consumption good. As the fraction of
consumption funded by this endowment fluctuates, the relationship between stock returns
   1
     This evidence has survived a decade long effort to tackle many of the econometric issues that are relevant
for evaluating these effects “at reasonable if not overwhelming levels of statistical significance,” (Campbell
(2000), page 9.) Furthermore, predictability is not unique to the standard US data set, but it can be found
in many other countries as well (see Campbell (1999), Table 12, panel B). For a summary see Cochrane
(1997 and 2000).
   2
     See Cochrane (1996), Ferson and Harvey (1999), and Lettau and Ludvigson (2000b) for recent contribu-
tions in this direction. For example Ferson and Harvey (1999) state that “simple proxies for time variation
in expected returns, based on common lagged instruments, are also significant cross-sectional predictors of
returns.”



                                                      1
and consumption growth varies as well, thereby generating changes in the risk premia in-
vestors require to hold stocks. Clearly some portfolios will be more sensitive than others to
these fluctuations and as a consequence will demand different premia, generating the desired
cross sectional predictability.
    An obvious candidate for this additional source of consumption is labor income and it is
to this interpretation that we restrict ourselves throughout the paper. Labor income, after
all, accounts for more than 80% of total consumption on average and, as shown in Figure
1, varies between 75% and 90%. At the aggregate level it is rather intuitive that periods
characterized by a high labor-income to consumption ratio should also imply a low expected
excess return: Since most of consumption is not stemming from the stock market, investors
do not need to require a high premium. A similar intuition holds at the cross-sectional level.
    To formalize this intuition we write a minimal extension of the standard Lucas (1978)
exchange economy to accommodate, in a tractable model, the possibility of multiple sources
of consumption. In our set up investors receive both dividend income from many risky
securities and “other income,” such as labor income. By concentrating on the “fractions”
of dividends and wages to consumption, and under conventional preferences, we can solve
for stock prices in closed form and obtain simple formulas for stock returns. As mentioned,
our first finding is that the ratio of labor income to consumption is the main determinant
of the predictability of stock market returns because of the intuitive mechanism developed
above. In addition, we also obtain a stochastic beta representation for the cross-section of
stock returns as well as intuitive formulas for the “betas” themselves. These “betas” are
indeed mainly affected by the labor income to consumption ratio with a sensitivity that is
asset specific and depends on the characteristics of the underlying dividend process.
    We test the main predictions of the model by running predictive regressions using both the
ratio of labor income over total consumption and/or the dividend price ratio as explanatory
variables. Our first main empirical finding is that for the overall sample 1946-1999 the ratio
of labor income to total consumption performs much better than the (log) dividend price
ratio to forecast future returns. For example, the R2 of the one year predictive regression
is 6.1% (against 3.9% for the log dividend-price ratio) and it reaches 34.6% for the four
year ahead regression (against 20.7% for the dividend price ratio.) Since this result may be
driven by the inclusion of the 1995-1999 period in the data sample (which witnessed a low
dividend price ratio and high returns,) we also run regressions over the more conventional
1952-1994 data period where it is known that the dividend price ratio is working well (see

                                              2
e.g. Campbell et al. (1997)). In this case the dividend price ratio is performing better
than the wages-to-consumption ratio, but the latter is still a significant regressor at long
horizons where it still produces a good forecasting power: The R2 is 3% for the one year
ahead regression but it reaches 22.6% for the 4 year ahead regression.
    Interestingly, the inclusion of both regressors – either linearly or in a multiplicative fashion
– dramatically improves upon the predictive power of the regression at every horizon. For
example, in the 1952-1994 sample the (adjusted) R2 ranges between 25.1% at the one year
horizon to above 60% at the four year horizon. This finding is indeed fully consistent with
our model, which implies that both expected returns and the dividend yield are non linear
functions of the labor income to consumption ratio. It follows that the dividend yield may
proxy for the non linear relation between expected returns and this ratio and it is then not
surprising that it improves the predictability.
    The cross-sectional implications of the model, that is, the stochastic beta representation
for the expected returns of individual securities, are investigated next. Roughly, we test
whether conditioning the CAPM and the CCAPM by the share of labor income to consump-
tion improves the fit on the cross section relative to their unconditional counterparts.
    To test these hypothesis we use a set of portfolios that has become standard in the
literature, the 25 Fama and French (1992, 1993) portfolios, which are portfolios sorted by
size and book to market. A novel feature though is that we use a longer sample period than
the one originally used by these two authors and others after them. Whereas the standard
sample period is 1963-1998 in this paper we use the 1946-1998 period, but we also report
results in the more restricted sample.
    As many have noted before us, the standard CAPM explains little of the cross sectional
variation in stock returns. The adjusted R2 is only 10%, that is, the unconditional CAPM
can only explain 10% of the cross sectional variation in returns. In contrast the inclusion of
the returns on the market portfolio scaled by the fraction of labor income to consumption
considerably increases the explanatory power of the CAPM. In this case the adjusted R2 is
43%. We show that this cross term is significant and it’s relevance robust to several specifica-
tions. Furthermore when the fraction of labor income to consumption enters independently
the adjusted R2 is as a high as 61%, a notable improvement over unconditional versions of
the model.
    We test whether the results are present in the more standard period of 1963-1998. They
are. In this case the specification suggested by our model can explain as much as 54% of the

                                                 3
cross sectional variation in returns whereas the unconditional CAPM explains a puny −2%.
     We also test whether our specification is robust to the “dating convention” advocated by
Jagannathan and Wang (1996) which provides investors with an information set consistent
with the release of data by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In an environment where
human capital is a tradable asset investors need to know it’s price in order to form their
optimal portfolio. Jagannathan and Wang (1996) argue that that it is not reasonable to
assume that investors posses information on data collected by the BEA and that is released
with delay. Our results are robust to this dating convention. Furthermore we show that the
role of labor income growth in tests of the cross section as a proxy for human capital returns
depends critically on the dating convention adopted by the researcher.
     Because this paper shows evidence pertaining to both the time series of the aggregate
market and the cross section of stock returns it naturally relates to the two strands of the
empirical asset pricing literature that have respectively dealt with these two issues. Our
work though presents important differences with these two bodies of evidence.
     First, the early predictability literature documents the forecasting power of either prices
scaled by dividends or earnings and of various interest rate measures.3 More recently Lettau
and Ludvigson (2000a) (LLa henceforth) manipulate the budget constraint to show that
the consumption to total wealth ratio, which includes labor income and financial wealth,
contains information about stock returns.
     Our paper adds to this literature by providing yet more evidence on the predictability of
stock returns. A critical difference between our work and previous empirical research though
is the fact that our predictive variable is neither a version of the stock price scaled by either
dividends or earnings nor some other financial variable like the term premium, but rather a
pure macroeconomic variable. Furthermore, it does not need to be estimated as in LLa as
it is directly observable. Finally it is important to emphasize that our testable implication
does not result from basic manipulations of either the definition of returns (Cochrane (2001),
page 395-6) or the budget constraint as in LLa.
     Second, the present paper adds to a literature that emphasizes the role of labor income
in the cross section of stock returns. References on human capital and asset returns go as
  3
    Campbell and Shiller (1988a and b), Fama and French (1988a and b), Hodrick (1992), Lamont (1998)
document the predictive power of prices scaled by dividends and earnings. Campbell (1987), Fama and
French (1989), Hodrick (1992), and Keim and Stambaugh (1986) show the forecasting power of interest rate
measures.


                                                   4
far back as Mayers (1972) and Fama and Schwert (1977) and, more recently, authors like
Jagannathan and Wang (1996) and Campbell (1996) have included human capital returns to
improve on the definition of the market portfolio. For instance, in tests of the cross section,
Jagannathan and Wang (1996) find that the inclusion of human capital in the definition of
the market portfolio considerably improves the ability of the CAPM to explain the cross
section of portfolios sorted by size and beta.
    In a different direction Lettau and Ludvigson (2000b) (LLb henceforth) explicitly model
the discount factor as a function of current information and show that the ratio of consump-
tion to total wealth, a variable shown to predict market returns in LLa, is an important
instrument for tests of the conditional CAPM and CCAPM. In particular they show that
their version of the conditional CAPM and CCAPM provides a remarkable fit to the 25
Fama and French (1993) portfolios.
    As already emphasized our conditioning variable is not a version of the price scaled by any
other variable, whether it be earnings, dividends, or consumption itself. In this sense it is free
from the concerns advanced by Berk (1995), namely, that because returns are mechanically
related to prices, ratios that have prices either in the numerator or denominator are in turn
automatically related to returns. For this reason these ratios cannot identify whether they
correlate with the cross section because they proxy for economically meaningful forces or
some other reason, like misspricing effects.
    We close this introduction by pointing out that our framework does not attempt to resolve
other long standing issues in the field of empirical asset pricing, such as the equity-premium
puzzle or the risk-free rate puzzle. Rather, it illustrates how alternative sources of income
other than dividends may have a role to play in accounting for the empirical properties of
stock return data. As a consequence, and to offer a clear picture of the economic forces at
work in our set up, we depart from the recent trend of investigating alternative preference
specifications to match the moments of stock and bond returns to focus on the well known
iso-elastic case. Clearly a full account of empirical properties of returns require additional
ingredients like variation in the investors attitudes towards risk, as in Campbell and Cochrane
(1999) or Barberis, Huang, and Santos (2001) but we do not attempt such a comprehensive
exercise here.
    Section II contains the model and discussion of the assumptions. Section III provides the
results that motivate our empirical strategy. Data description and the empirical results are
reported in section IV. Section V concludes. Proofs, tables, and figures are in the appendix.

                                          II. THE MODEL

    Consider a standard pure exchange economy populated by identical investors whose util-
ity function is4
                                 U (Ct , t) = e−φt log (Ct ) ,
where Ct denotes consumption at time t. There is a riskless asset in zero net supply that
pays a continuous rate of return rt . There are n − 1 risky assets in positive net supply that
pay a continuous dividend rate Dti for i = 2, 3, , . . . , n, and that trade competitively at a
price Pti . Agents are endowed with an additional source of income other than dividends from
these competitively traded financial assets. In accordance with our empirical strategy below,
we assume that this other income springs from a human capital asset that pays a continuous
wage rate wt .5 For ease of notation we will sometimes denote wt by Dt1 .
    The problem of the investor is then the usual one:
                                          Z ∞                
                                   max
                                     i
                                       E0        U (Ct , t)dt
                                       Nt ,Ct      0

subject to the standard dynamic budget constraint
                     n                                     n
                                                                      !
                     X                                     X
                           Nti   dPti + Dti dt +                 Nti Pti rt dt + (wt − Ct ) dt,
                                              
             dWt =                                 Wt −
                     i=2                                   i=2

where Nti denotes the number of shares of stock i held by the investor and Wt is his total
wealth at time t.
     A rational expectations equilibrium is then a set of price functions Pti , allocation process
Nti , and consumption process Ct such that agents maximize and markets clear, that is,
Nti = 1 for all i = 2, 3, . . . , n and Ct = wt + ni=2 Dti .
                                                     P

     As already mentioned, our emphasis is on the general payoff structure available to the
investor rather than the more traditional concerns on preferences. A basic requirement in
modeling this general payoff structure is that dividends and wages add up to an aggregate
consumption process that is consistent with the observed behavior of the US time series,
which is roughly a random walk. Once this requirement is met, the proposed endowment
structure will also naturally embed the standard endowment economy of Lucas (1978).
  4
   In appendix we extend these results to the general CRRA case.

   A fully rigorous account of labor income in an asset pricing framework should accommodate the endoge-
nous labor supply decision. We abstract from this effect in the present paper.

   We start then by modeling consumption growth as
                                         dCt
                                             = µc dt + σc dBt ,                                    (1)
                                         Ct
                                                                                               0
where µc is a scalar and σc is a 1 × n vector of constants and Bt = (Bt1 , . . . , Btn ) are n
independent Brownian motions. The specification of µc is flexible and in particular it can
be time varying to reflect any weak autocorrelation in consumption growth that may be
observed in the data.
   In order to model dividends and wages define first the share of these dividends and wages
over consumption:

                                    wt                   Dti
                        sw    1
                         t = st =         and sit =              for i = 2, ..., n,                (2)
                                    Ct                   Ct
By construction then wages and dividends will add up to the consumption process in (1) if
Pn j
  j=1 st = 1. To illustrate the economic forces at work we propose a simple process for the
share dynamics and leave for the appendix the description of a richer, but equally tractable,
model. In particular we assume that:

                                dsit = a si − sit dt + sit σi (st ) dBt
                                                 
                                                                                                   (3)
where                                                    n
                                                         X
                                       σi (st ) = νi −         sjt νj ,                            (4)
                                                         j=1

νi for i = 1, 2, . . . , n are n dimensional vectors, and st = (s1t , . . . , snt ). Our choice for the
functional form of the volatility function (4) guarantees that both sit > 0 and ni=1 sit = 1.
                                                                                         P

    We model then these shares as a mean reverting process with a common reversion speed,
a, and conditional expected value given by

                                 Et siτ = si + sit − si e−a(τ −t) .
                                                     
                                                                                                   (5)

If a particular “tree” is contributing little to consumption compared to its unconditional
level, as expressed by it’s low sit , then one should expect a high positive growth rate of this
share. In the future a larger percentage of consumption will come from asset i.
    But, as it is intuitive, what is critical in the valuation of any of the available assets is
whether on average they grow when consumption does. It can be easily shown that the

                                                   7
covariance between consumption growth and share growth is given by

                                  st Ct             j=1

with θi = νi σc0 . The parameters θi ’s, that regulate the covariance between consumption
growth and the growth of the share of consumption produced by asset i, will play an im-
portant role in the formula for asset returns, and for this reason we elaborate on them
further.
    First, equation (6) shows that the constants θi are not identified as we can add a constant
to all of them without changing any of the covariances. For this reason we can renormalize
them and we find it convenient to set θ1 = 0. Second, since the fraction of consumption
generated by wages sw                                                   i
                      t is by far the largest component of all st ’s, it is convenient to find a an
expression for the covariance in (6) that makes explicit the dependence on sw   t . By substituting
              i
                      P      j
the identity st = 1 − j6=i st in equation (6) and rearranging terms we immediately find that

       We use equations (6) and (7) repeatedly throughout.


                                           III. RESULTS

   In this section we describe the asset pricing implications of the model introduced in the
previous section. We derive first the equilibrium price dividend ratios for both individual
assets and the market portfolio. Then we explore the implications for the market asset
returns and the cross section of stock returns.

III.A Equilibrium prices
    In our set up, as in others, labor income is a tradable asset6 and we abstract from any
effect that market incompleteness may have on asset prices. For this reason the standard
asset pricing formula applies:
                                        Z ∞                
                                 i           Uc (τ, Cτ ) i
                               Pt = Et                  D dτ .                           (8)

Given our assumptions on preferences and dividends, Uc (τ, Cτ ) = e−φτ Cτ−1 and Dτi = siτ Cτ ,
equilibrium prices are:

where7 we used equation (5). The expression for the price dividend ratio of asset i now
follows trivially from equation (11):

                                   Dti      φ   φ+a       st
    That is, the price-dividend ratio of asset i depends on the share of consumption that the
representative consumer derives from asset i. In addition, the price dividend ratio of security
i depends on the “distance” of its current level sit from its long-run average si .
    Equation (12) extends naturally to the price dividend ratio of the market portfolio. Define
PtM = ni=2 Pti and DtM = ni=2 Dti . Then it is straightforward to show that:
       P                    P

                                                                          t )              (13)
                   Dt        φ    φ+a                1 − st        φ

    Equation (13) has a strong intuitive appeal. The first term of the expression, φ1 , is the
standard price dividend ratio in one endowment economy with log utility function. The
second term, ψ(sw t ), corrects for the presence of an alternative source of income other than
dividends from the market portfolio.
                                       w
    Notice that ψ(sw                          w
                     t ) = 1 only if s = st . That is an economy in its steady state yields
a price dividend ratio that is no different than the usual one. Deviations form this steady
state generate movements in the price dividend ratio of the market portfolio. For instance,
                                                                               1
if sw < sw
         t then the price dividend ratio is higher than it’s long run level, φ . There are two
reasons for this. First, if swt is relatively high investors are less exposed to fluctuations in
the stock market, and hence they require a lower compensation to hold it, and this, in turn,
  7
      The inversion of integrals between (9) and (10) is possible because φ > 0 and siτ ∈ [0, 1].

                                                         9
translates into higher prices. Also, a high share of labor income to consumption signals that
future aggregate dividend growth is going to be above that of consumption as sw    t will mean
           w
revert to s . This further reinforces the positive effect on the price dividend ratio.
    Equation (13) then captures an alternative source of variation in the price dividend ratio
to the ones that have been emphasized in the literature.8 As the share of labor income
to consumption ratio varies the price dividend ratio will vary unambiguously. In the next
section we explore whether the intuition carries to the aggregate market returns.

III.B Market returns
       The excess stock returns of the market portfolio, dRtM , is defined as:
                                               dPtM + DtM dt
                                      dRtM =                 − rt ,
                                                   PtM
where the risk free rate can be easily proved to be equal to:9

                                          rt = φ + µc − σc σc0 .

   In appendix we show that a straightforward
                                                 application of Ito’s lemma together with
                                    M dCt
                  M
the fact that Et dRt = covt dRt , Ct yields the following expression for the expected
excess return of the market portfolio:
                                                       w X       n

                      M

                                                                                      (14)

    In the standard “one tree” economy the conditional expected excess return of the market
portfolio is simply σc σc0 . Whether the level of the conditional expected excess return is above
or below this benchmark depends on the covariance between wage income share growth and
consumption growth, which, from equation (6), equals − nj=1 sjt θj (recall that θ1 = 0.) If
                                                               P

this covariance is negative, then the premium is higher than in the standard case as the
market tends to pay in the presence of consumption growth. If on the other hand the
covariance is positive the expected excess return is lower than σc σc0 as the market provides
a natural hedge against weak consumption growth.
   8
      For instance Campbell and Cochrane (1999) emphasize changes in the degree of risk aversion as a source
of variation.
    9
      Recall that we allow for time varying µc and hence the dependence of the risk free rate on time. If µc
is constant consumption growth is completely i.i.d.

                                                    10
      As equation (14) shows, there are two sources of variation in expected excess returns:
changes on the distribution of dividends across the market portfolio and fluctuations in sw            t .
What is the economic intuition behind each source of variation?
      To gain some insights on the impact of cross sectional variation in the distribution of
dividends across the market, nj=2 sjt θj , assume that the share of labor income to consump-
                                P

tion, swt , stays constant and that we “redistribute” an amount δ away from share st to share
                                                                                              i

sjt . Then the change in conditional expected excess return is given by:
                                                  

where the last equality follows from equation (6). The expected rate of return of the market
portfolio will rise if the covariance of asset j is higher than that of asset i. This is only
natural, as dividends are redistributed towards the asset whose share growth covaries more
strongly with consumption growth and hence the overall market is more strongly correlated
with consumption growth.
    Variations in the share of labor income to consumption is the second source of fluctuations
in expected market returns. Unlike before though, it is not possible now to hold distributional
                                                                  Pn j
effects fixed, as changes in swt necessarily result in changes in   j=2 st θj . An example then
could be helpful here.
    Assume that θj = θ for all j = 2, 3, . . . , n, that is, that the share growth rates have
                                                                    Pn j                  w

    Equation (15) shows that the instantaneous expected return depends non-linearly on the
fraction of consumption produced by labor income sw  t = wt /Ct . Its functional form shows

this result, notice that when st = 0, then Ct = j=2 Dt = Dt and hence we are in the

that in the log utility case Et dRtM = σc σc0 is indeed standard. More puzzling at first is
                                         

that this model implies that Et dRtM = σc σc0 when sw

                                                                       w)
sit = 0 for all i = 2, .., n which from (11) entails PtM = Ct a(1−s
                                                                  φ(a+φ)
                                                                          . Since we would also have
Ct = wt , we obtain that the price is perfectly correlated with wages (and hence consumption),
yielding the result. Of course, both these limit cases are extreme, given that, as shown in
Figure 1, sw  t lies comfortably in the interval (0.75, 0.9). In this case, what is the relationship
                      
between Et dRtM and sw        t ? In the simplified example of equation (15) where θj = θ for all
j = 2, 3, . . . , n, we can see that the denominator of the second term is always positive, hence
the behavior of expected stock returns depend on the sign of θ. To gain intuition on the likely
sign of this term, recall again that sw            w                 w
                                           t (1 − st ) θ = −cov (dst , dCt /Ct ). If wages are much
smoother than dividends, we can imagine that an increase in dividends is accompanied by an
increase in consumption and hence a decrease in sw        t = wt /Ct (if wages do not move much).
This induces a natural negative covariance between consumption growth and the changes in
sw                                                                                    w
  t . Indeed, evidence (not reported) shows a negative covariance between dst and dCt /Ct .
Since sw            w
         t (1 − st ) is positive, this implies θ > 0. This in turn yields a negative relationship
between expected returns and the labor share sw                w
                                                      t when st is in the relevant range (0.75, 0.9).
The economic intuition of this result is clear: as sw     t increases, consumption becomes fueled
by labor income only, decreasing the covariance between consumption growth and dividend
growth. This in turn translates into a lower covariance between consumption growth and
returns, generating a lower risk premium.
III.C The cross section of stock returns
   Similar arguments to the ones used in the previous section yield a closed form solution to
the conditional expected rate of return of asset i. Let PtT W = PtM + Ptw the value of the total
wealth portfolio, that is, the portfolio that comprises the value of the market portfolio PtM
and the value to human capital Ptw . Notice that the latter can be computed from equation
(11) for i = 1. If we denote by dRtT W the excess return from the total wealth portfolio,
                                                                        
standard equilibrium conditions require Et [dRti ] = covt dRti , dRtT W which in turns implies
the “beta” representation
                                Et dRti = βi (st ) Et dRtT W ,

    The conditional beta of each asset i with respect to the total wealth portfolio depends on
both the share of labor income to consumption sw         t and on the distribution of shares across
                       P        j
the stock market j6=1,i st . The coefficients on each of this common “factors” depend on
the relative position of sit with respect to its steady state value, si . For instance, in the
case where θi = θ for all i = 2, 3, . . . , n, βi (st ) varies as a function of just sw        i
                                                                                      t and st (the
second
      term      in (17) vanishes). The reason for this is as follows: In this case we recall that
        dsit dCt
covt si , Ct = θsw                                         i                  w
                          t . If θ > 0, conditional on st , an increase in st results in a higher
         t
conditional expected rate of return as a result of the increase of the covariance between
consumption growth and share growth. The degree to which changes in sw             t affect the beta
                                                       i     i                  w
βi (st ) of asset i depends also on the value of st . If st ≈ 0 changes in st do not affect the
required return, as asset i does not contribute to consumption and does not covary with its
growth.
    Given that the return on the total wealth portfolio is not directly observable, from (16)
we obtain a formulation more suitable for the empirical analysis. Define first:
                                                        Ptw
                                          Φ(st ) =             ,
                                                     Ptw + PtM
where st = (s1t , s2t , . . . , snt ), and again Ptw is the price of the human capital asset. Then the
return on the total wealth portfolio is given by:

                              dRtT W = Φ(st )dRtw + (1 − Φ(st )) dRtM ,                          (18)
                                                                                                          
where dRtw is the rate of return on the human capital asset. Given that Et [dRti ] = covt dRti , dRIT W
we can use the definition of the return on the total wealth portfolio, equation (18), to obtain:

               Et dRti = Φ(st )covt dRti , dRtw + (1 − Φ(st )) covt dRti , dRtM .
                                                                            
                                                                                            (19)

Then equation (19) implies that the conditional expected rates of return on both the human
capital asset and the market are given by:

                       [Et [dRtw ]   Et [dRtw ]]0 = ΣwM [Φ(st )    (1 − Φ(st )]0 ,               (20)

                                                     13
where ΣwM as the variance-covariance matrix of dRtw and dRtM . From equation (20) we can
get an expression for [Φ(st ) (1 − Φ(st )]0 that we can readily substitute back into (19) to
obtain the beta representation:

                        Et dRti = βiw (st )Et [dRtw ] + βiM (st )Et dRtM ,
                                                                     

where βiw (st ) and βiM (st ) are the multiple regression coefficients:
                                          −1
           [βiw (st ) βiM (st )]0 = ΣwM         × covt dRti , dRtw     covt dRti , dRtM
                                                                                        
                                                                                               .

    Versions of equation (21) have been the focus of much research lately. For instance,
Jagannathan and Wang (1996) test a version the above equation where they also extend
the definition of the market portfolio to include returns in human capital and where their
conditioning variable is the properly defined default premium, shown to forecast business
cycles. More recently LLb have tested a similar equation in a different set of test portfolios
where the conditioning variable is the consumption to wealth ratio, a conditioning variable
that they show predicts future market returns.
    Our version of the conditional CAPM has the advantage of unambiguously specifying the
set of conditioning variables that could improve the performance of the conditional CAPM
and CCAPM, namely, the shares of dividends and wages over consumption. We return below
to the question of how to derive a specific test of our model.
    We can derive along very similar lines the conditional Consumption CAPM which is given
by:                                                                  
                               i      c            c            dCt
                           Et dRt = β1i (st ) dt + β2i (st ) Et                          (22)
                                                                  Ct
         c                               c
where β1i  (s) is a function of st and β2i (s) is the regression coefficient of dRti onto dCt /Ct .
As before we delay the specific test on this model to the empirical section.
    What is the intuition behind these results? Recall that we have established earlier that
movements in the share of labor income to consumption together with variation in the dis-
tribution of shares across the market result in variations in the conditional expected rate
of return on the market portfolio. These changes are likely to affect alternative portfolios
differently as they will display varying sensitivities to the share of labor income to consump-
tion for example. This is what provides a role for this variable in tests of the cross section
of stock returns.

                                      IV. EMPIRICAL TESTS

    In this section we test the main predictions of our model. We start by providing a brief
description of the data set employed. We then test the implications for the time series
behavior of the aggregate market portfolio. Last we explore whether our version of the
conditional CAPM and CCAMP provides a better description of the cross section of stock
returns.
    We emphasize that in what follows we concentrate in the role of the share of labor income
to consumption, sw  t , as a predictive and conditioning variable and leave the effects of the
cross sectional distribution of dividend shares for future research. There are two main reasons
for this. We are interested in the role of labor income, a variable that has proved to play a
considerable role in recent asset pricing tests (Jagannathan and Wang (1996), LLa and LLb,)
and that seems a clear first order effect given the large percentage of consumption it funds.
Another reason is our emphasis in bringing in conditioning information that is “purely” non
financial as it provides a sharper view on the links between macroeconomics and financial
markets.
IV.A Data description

   The financial data we use is standard. We consider returns on the value weighted CRSP
index, which includes NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ, as our measure of financial asset re-
turns. Dividend price ratios are also obtained from CRSP and the risk free rate is the 90-day
Treasury bill.
   For both consumption and labor income we use data from the National Income and
Product Accounts (NIPA). Following the literature (see LLa), we define consumption as
nondurable plus services excluding shoes and clothing. The argument behind this idea is
that the theory applies to the flow of consumption and it should not include additions or
replacements to the stock of durable goods. As it is also traditional we assume that total
consumption is proportional to consumption of non durables plus services and we choose
a constant of proportionality to be the long term ratio between total consumption and
consumption of non durables plus services. This ratio is estimated to be 1.15.
   The labor income series is as in LLa. It is constructed by adding to wages and salaries,
transfer payments plus other labor income and subtracting personal contributions to social
insurance and taxes.10 Both the consumption and labor income series are quarterly.

French (1993). These portfolios are formed by intersecting 5 portfolios sorted by size with
other five portfolios sorted by book-to-market. We convert the returns to quarterly data
producing a time series covering 1946 to 1998.

IV.B Predictability of aggregate returns
IV.B.1 Forecasting regressions
    We test first the forecasting power of the ratio of labor income to consumption. Recall
that the main prediction of our model postulates that the high share of labor income to
consumption, sw t , predicts low future returns. For this reason we run regressions of returns
on lagged values of sw t . We also rerun the standard predictability regression to check its
performance during our sample period and frequency. Finally we run two additional regres-
sions that try to asses whether the role of the share of labor income to consumption in the
predictability regression is robust to the inclusion of the price dividend ratio. That is we
estimate:

                      rt,t+K = α1 + β1 (K)swt + εt+k                                                  (23)

where rt,t+K is the cumulative log return over K periods. For each regression, Tables II-IV
report the point estimate of the included explanatory variable, the Newey-West corrected
t−statistic for the null hypothesis that the coefficients are zero, and the adjusted R2 .
    We start discussing our results for the whole sample period at our disposal, 1946-1999.
The first row of Table II-A shows that the ratio of labor income to consumption sw        t is
statistically significant at any forecasting horizons between one quarter and four years. The
sign of the regression coefficient is negative, giving support to the view expressed in the
previous section that positive innovations in sw t lead to low future returns. The explanatory
power is also high, ranging from 6.1% for the one year regression to 34.6% for the four year
the Bureau of Economic Analysis. For an update visit, http://www.bea.doc.gov. See also footnote 11.

regression.
     We compare these results with those of the standard predictability regression, equation
(24). In this case, the dividend price ratio is never significant at any horizons and the
predictive power is rather low, ranging from 3.9% at the one year horizon to 20.7% at the
four year horizon. As we will see below, this poor performance of the dividend-price ratio
to forecast future returns is partly due to the inclusion of the period 1995-1999 in the data
sample. Indeed, during this period the dividend price ratio was extremely low and yet returns
have been record high.
     Recall that, as shown in equation (13), the dividend price ratio is a non linear function of
sw . Including the dividend price ratio then may proxy for any non linearities in the relation
between returns and sw . When both ratios enter linearly (regression (25)) both regressors
are significant and the predictive power ranges from an adjusted R2 of 16.2% at the one year
horizon to an R2 of over 61% at the four year horizon. Interestingly, a similar result obtains
when we only use the interaction factor sw × log (D/P ) in the regression (regression (26)).
In this case again the coefficient is highly significant and the R2 ranges from 13.4% at the
one year horizon to over 50% at the four year horizon.
     As shown in Figure 1, the first two years of our sample, 1946-7, showed a remarkable
drop in the ratio of labor income to consumption. The special circumstances of those years
may account for that event. We reran the predictability regression excluding those eight
initial data points and we report the results in Table II-B. The short term predictability of
our variable improves slightly but overall the estimates are very similar.
     Other researchers using quarterly data, like LLa, concentrate on the period starting in
1952. In order to check the validity of our empirical findings, Tables III and IV report results
for two subsamples of the data starting in 1952.11 The first is the standard sample 1952:01-
1994:04, that will enable us to compare our results to others in the literature.12 Indeed the
second line in Table III shows that during this period the dividend price ratio was doing
  11
      We point out that the main result of this paper (that the labor income to consumption ratio forecast
future returns) accidentally underwent an out-of-sample test. Until April 26th, 2000 data on compensation
of employees and other series from the Bureau of Economic Analysis were only available for the period
1959:01-1999:04. The BEA news release on April 26th, 2000 also included the revised data for the 1946:01
- 1958:04 period. Our result held well also when the first period was included.
   12
      See for example Campbell, Lo and MacKinlay (1997, page 269, Table 7.1), who use monthly data. These
authors estimate the predictability regression in three different sample periods, 1927-1994, 1927-1951, and
1952-1994. As already mentioned, data for macroeconomic time series is available only from 1946.


                                                    17
extremely well in predicting future returns. Our results using quarterly data are comparable
to the ones reported in Campbell et al. (1997) who instead used monthly data. For instance,
for the one year and four year horizons they obtain R2 ’s of 18.8% and 41.7% respectively,
matching our results almost to the point. The use of quarterly data then does not seem to
be producing any particular bias in the results.
    As can be seen in the first line of Table III, the ratio of labor income to consumption is now
only a significant predictor at horizons of two years or more. The R2 is 3% for the one year
regression but rises to 22.6% for the four year regression. Interestingly, however, when both
the dividend price ratio and the wages-to-consumption ratio are included – either in linear
fashion as in regression (25) or in a nonlinear one as in regression (26) – the performance of
the predictability regression improves considerably, with R2 ranging between 25.1% for the
one year regression to above 62.7% for the four year regression.
    We can compare the results in Table III with those in Table IV, where the same exercise
is carried out for the sample period 1952:01-1999:04. We include these results to show the
dramatic decrease in the predictive power of the dividend price ratio due to the impressive
stock market surge of the 90’s (see e.g. Cochrane (1997) for a similar point) and to show how
the labor income-to-consumption ratio still works well. Indeed, we see that over this sample
period the dividend price ratio is never significant at any horizon and the R2 of the predictive
regressions does not go above 7% at any horizon. Instead, the wages-to-consumption ratio
is performing quite well: The coefficients are statistically significant at all horizons and its
predictive power ranges between 7.4% at the one year horizon to 35.4% at the four year
horizon. As before, using both ratios greatly improves upon the predictability regression:
using regression (25) for example we obtain R2 ranging from 19.6% at the one year to above
56% at the four year horizon.
    How does our model perform when confronted with the extraordinary stock market of
the 90s? Figures 2 and 3 plot the time series of wages-to-consumption ratio, dividend price
ratio and the four year cumulative stock return. As it can be seen in Figure 2, the dividend-
price ratio and the cumulative four year return started moving in opposite directions at the
end of the 80’s. As already mentioned this is at the heart of the failure of the standard
predictability regression (equation (24)) in our sample. However Figure 3 shows that the
negative relation between the cumulative four year return and the ratio of labor income to
consumption held well even in the last part of the sample. Still, our model cannot reconcile
the very low dividend price ratios observed in the 90s with the high expected returns during

                                               18
the same period because low sw  t imply relatively high dividend price ratios rather than low
ones.
    This is not unique to the model proposed in this paper. Barring bubbles, the low dividend
price ratios and high expected returns observed in the 90s can only be rationalized with
expectations of very high dividend growth or an impressive string of unexpected positive
shocks to returns. Notice though that in the context of the model presented in section II
there is still no room to simultaneously obtain low shares of labor income to consumption
with low dividend price ratios. This though is an unfortunate feature of the log utility case
and it can be proved that under more general preference specifications the dividend price
ratio of the market portfolio depends on the entire distribution of dividend payments across
the market.
    The negative relation between the share of labor income to consumption and future
stock returns has received subsequent support in a recent research by Lettau and Ludvigson
(2001c). They isolate the permanent and transitory shocks of the cointegrated vector formed
by consumption, labor earnings, and financial wealth. There are two permanent shocks of
which only the “first” affects consumption. The second one they term income neutral as it
does not result in any significant impact on consumption but rather “causes labor income
to increase and asset wealth to decrease.” A positive income neutral shock then results in
an increase in the ratio of labor income to consumption which is followed by low financial
returns as postulated in this paper.13
IV.B.2 Spurious regressions tests
    Table I reports standard unit root tests. As can be seen, most series used in this paper
are close-to-unit root series and hence there is a justified concern that the results about the
time-series predictability may be due to spurious regressions.14 In this section we tackle
this problem by performing tests of spurious regressions as presented by Richardson and
Stock (1989) and Torous and Yan (1999). We describe the procedure in detail in Appendix
II, but, roughly, the test amounts to generate, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, the
empirical distribution of the estimated regression coefficient under the null hypothesis that
the population coefficient is zero. Such a distribution is reported in Table IX and we compare
  13
     See Lettau and Ludvigson (2001c) pages 24-25 and their Figure 2.

     Aside from the original article by Phillips (1986), the reader is referred to Chap. 18.3 in Hamilton (1994)
for a lucid exposition of the spurious regression problem and for other references.

the estimated coefficient in Tables II-IV to the cutoff points for the preferred confidence level.
    For the sample period 1946-1999 the estimated coefficients reported in Table II-A are
extremely close to being statistically significant at the 10% level for the one quarter, one
year, and two year regression. For example, the one quarter ahead predictive regression
yields a coefficient β (1) = −.308 while from the simulations, the 90% confidence interval
is [−0.309, 0.282]. For the three and four year regression both coefficients are statistically
significant at the 10% level. For instance for the four year regression the estimated coefficient
is given by β (16) = −4.902 while the 90% confidence interval is [−4.441, 4.129].
    In contrast the dividend price ratio is never significant at the 10%. This is partly due to
the fact that the correlation between returns and dividend price ratio, ρ, is much higher in
this case (around −.96) than in the case where the predictive variable is the labor income
to consumption ratio (in which case ρ ≈ −.02). As explained in the appendix, a higher
correlation ρ makes the distribution of β (K) even more “non-normal”. For example, using
the dividend price ratio for the one quarter and four year regression we obtain β (1) = .022
and β (K) = .475 respectively while robust confidence intervals are [−0.0027, 0.0598] and
[−0.048, 0.7655] respectively.
    Looking at the regression where both the share and the log dividend price ratio enter
linearly the estimated coefficient on sw is significant at all horizons. For instance, for the
one quarter predictability regression the estimated value of the coefficient is β (1) = −.467,
whereas the 90% confidence interval is given by [−.424, .363] . Once again, the dividend price
ratio is never significant at this level of statistical significance.
    The results are even stronger when the sample is restricted to the period 1948-1999 (see
Table II-B). The estimated coefficients for the univariate regression with sw are all significant
at the 10% level with the exception of the one year ahead regression, which is, in any case,
extremely close to the cut-off value. All of them are statistically significant in the regression
where the dividend price ratio enters linearly.
    Overall, this section confirms from a statistical point of view that the predictive regression
results obtained in the previous subsection section are unlikely to be spurious, and it lends
further credence to the hypothesis of an economic relation linking returns on the aggregate
market portfolio and the share of labor income to consumption.

IV.C Cross sectional Regressions

   In this section we test the implications of the model for the cross-section of stock returns,

                                               20
which was developed in section III.C. Recall that the model has predictions for both the
conditional CAPM and the conditional Consumption CAPM. We derive first specific testable
implications and then conduct the empirical analysis on two sets of tests portfolios.
IV.C.1 Cross-sectional Implications
    The starting point of our tests of the conditional CAPM is the beta representation given in
expression (21). This conditional beta representation implies that both βiw (st ) and βiM (st )
are (complicated) functions of all the state variables, namely (s1 , .., sn ). We argue though
that the share of labor income to consumption is the most important common component
driving the variation in “betas” and the conditional expected rates of return as it is, by far,
the largest share. Furthermore, and as shown in equation (17), the beta of the total wealth
portfolio is “almost” linear in sw t . By analogy with this we approximate the βiw (st ) and
βiM (st ) in the two beta representation by:

                 βiw (st ) ≈ βiw1 + βiw2 sw
                                          t   and βiM (st ) ≈ βiM 1 + βiM 2 sw
                                                                             t .

In this case (21) becomes

                      Et [dRi ] = βiw1 Et [dRtw ] + βiw2 Et [sw    w
                                                              t dRt ]

                                  +βiM 1 Et dRtM + βiM 1 Et sw         M
                                                                      
                                                                   t dRt

We can condition down this expression to obtain

                    E dRti = βiw1 E [dRtw ] + βiw2 E [sw    w
                          
                                                       t dRt ]

                              + βiM 1 E dRtM + βiM 2 E sw      M
                                                              
                                                          t dRt    ,                      (27)

which is the version of the conditional CAPM that we test below. Notice that the coeffi-
cients βijk for j = w, M and k = 1, 2 are no longer regression coefficients as in a standard
Conditional CAPM formulation. However, for the purpose of this paper we can test the pre-
dictions of our model by checking the improvement in the fit of the cross-sectional regression
when we impose βij2 6= 0 for j = w, M . Indeed, by using a standard Fama-MacBeth (1972)
procedure, the restricted case would imply a model with a “beta” that is independent of sw  t ,
while the latter allows for a stochastic beta relationship.
    Similarly the starting expression for our tests of the conditional Consumption CAPM is
(22) , and, as before if we assume, βic (st ) ≈ βi1

and it is this last expression that we test in the empirical section.
IV.C.2 Empirical Results
    In this section we test equations (27) and (29) in the set of test portfolios introduced by
Fama and French (1993). In what follows we compare different specifications by reporting
R2 , both adjusted and unadjusted, in the different regressions, but the reader should bear in
mind that we have only 25 (cross-sectional) observations, the Fama-French portfolios, and
that, as a consequence this statistic should be interpreted with caution.
a. Tests of the CAPM
    Tests of equation (27) require an estimate of the return to human capital, which is not
observable. We follow Jagannathan and Wang (1996) and LLa and proxy the return on
human capital as the growth rate of wages ∆ log (wt ).15
    Table V presents the main results of this section. There we test several empirical spec-
ifications that are consistent with the theoretical implications developed above. For ev-
ery specification we report the estimate, the t-statisitic, and the Shanken (1992) corrected
t−statisitic (in brackets). The last column reports the R2 and, below it, the adjusted R2 (in
brackets). Our discussion centers around the adjusted R2 .
    Panel A reports the results for our test of the conditional CAPM as given by expression
(27). The first line shows the weak performance of the unconditional CAPM. The beta on
the value weighted return is not statistically significant, enters with the wrong sign, and the
R2 is a just 10%, that is, the unconditional CAPM only explains 10% of the cross section of
stock returns. The second line shows that adding the excess return on labor income Rw does
not help much, given that the adjusted R2 drops to 6%. A better definition of the market
portfolio does not seem to improve the dismal performance of the CAPM.
    Next we include the interaction term sw RM , that is, we assume that βiM 2 in (27) is
different from zero. Because sw is slow moving, the joint presence of sw RM and RM can
  15
    Our model yields a precise method to compute those returns by applying the pricing formula (11) to
labor income. However, we found a correlation of about 90% between the two measures and the results were
similar. For consistency with these other studies, we use the growth rate of wages as measure of return to
labor.

                                                   22
result in severe multicollinearity problems. For this reason we include only the component
of sw RM that is orthogonal to RM . As shown in line 3, conditioning market returns by
the variable sw dramatically improves the cross-sectional fit to an adjusted R2 of 43%. The
coefficient is strongly significant and positive. This sign is not easily interpretable as, recall,
this only reflects the premium associated with the orthogonal component. As we shall see,
the strong significance and explanatory power of the this term will be robust to different
specifications and sample periods, lending credence to the mechanism emphasized in this
paper. Surprisingly, the coefficient on RM is now significant, but this is not stable across
specifications. We share with many other studies16 the negative sign in the market premium.
    Adding labor income further improves the fit to an adjusted R2 of 47% though the
coefficient is not significant and enters with the wrong sign (see line 4.) Line 5 drops sw RM
in order to purely measure the impact of labor income, and it’s scaled counterpart, on the
cross section of stock returns.17 The scaled factor is strongly significant and negative. As in
the case of sw RM , this result is fairly stable throughout. Interestingly, the fit is fairly high,
and the adjusted R2 is 32%. Finally line 6 is the full specification as presented in equation
(27). All coefficients are strongly significant, with the exception of the coefficient on Rw , and
the adjusted R2 achieves a robust 49%. The top two panels of Figure 4 offers a quick visual
impression of the ability of the share of labor income to consumption to properly rearrange
the set of tests portfolios.
    In summary, the introduction of the share of labor income to consumption as a scaling
variable considerably improves the performance of the CAPM. As already mentioned, we
emphasize that our conditioning variable is not a financial variable and it is free of the con-
cerns voiced by Berk (1995). He expressed that because returns are mechanically related to
prices, ratios that have prices either in the numerator or denominator are in turn automat-
ically related to returns, independently of whether they proxy for economically meaningful
forces or not.
    Table V also includes t−statistics using the correction in the computations of the standard
errors proposed by Shanken (1992). This correction takes into account the fact that the
betas are estimated rather than fixed.18 In particular Shanken (1992) showed that under the
  16
     See for instance Jagannathan and Wang (1996) and LLb
  17
     As emphasized above in order to avoid multicollinearity problems we include only the component of
s R that is orthogonal to Rw . We follow this practice throughout.

assumption that asset returns have a conditional joint distribution with constant covariance
matrix, the Fama-MacBeth procedure overstates the precision of the estimated parameters.
As LLb note, the size of the correction is much larger when using macroeconomic factors
than when using purely financial variables. Indeed, notice that for the standard CAPM there
is essentially no difference between the uncorrected and the corrected t−statistic associated
with RM , whereas there is a much stronger correction when the share of labor income to
consumption enters into the different specifications.19
    Panel B of Table V reports similar regression results for the case where also sw is entered
in the cross-sectional regression as an independent factor. Although our test, as shown
in equation (27), does not imply this regression, the results are nonetheless interesting to
understand the effect of the labor-to-consumption ratio on the cross-section of stock returns.
The first line in Panel B reports the CAPM regression where only sw is added as explanatory
variable and we see that the adjusted R2 jumps to 45% (against 10% for the unconditional
CAPM). Adding the scaled return on the market portfolio sw RM increases the adjusted R2
to 52% while when also the scaled return to labor is included the adjusted R2 increases to
61%.
b. Robustness and comparison with related work
    Our use of the sample period 1946-1998 is novel and the reader may have some concerns
as to whether the results are robust to the more standard period 1963-1998, which was the
one used originally by Fama and French (1993) and more recently by LLb. We show next
that the results do indeed improve for this truncated sample.
    Table VI reports the results for the sample period 1963-1998. First notice that the
adjusted R2 for the standard CAPM has collapsed to a dismal −2% as compared to 10%
in the full sample. The very poor performance of the unconditional CAPM in this sample
period and tests portfolios is indeed consistent with previous findings.20
    As in the previous sample, the addition of the scaled market portfolio results in a remark-
able improvement in the ability of the CAPM to explain the cross section. The coefficient is
strongly significant and the adjusted R2 is 46%. Again the role of sw RM is robust through-
  19
     However the Shanken (1992) corrected t−statistics should be interpreted with caution. As Jagannathan
and Wang (1998) show, “the standard errors obtained from the Fama-MacBeth procedure need not neces-
sarily overstate the precision of estimates,” whenever the the assumption of conditional homoskedasticity is
violated.
  20
     For instance LLb, Table 1, line 1, report an adjusted R2 of −3% for the unconditional CAPM.


                                                    24
out the various specifications. Adding labor income further improves the fit to 55% and the
coefficient is now significant. Finally line 6 reports the full specification, which reports a
slight improvement of the cross sectional fit over the sample period 1946-1998 (from 49% to
55%.) As before panel B shows the results where the variable sw is included independently
and again the results are very similar. Once gain, panels C and D of Figure 4 plot the
unconditional and conditional performance of the CAPM in the 1963-1998 sample period.
    A puzzling result of Table VI is that adding labor income growth as a proxy for the
returns on human capital does not result in any improvement on the ability of the CAPM
to explain the cross section of stock returns (see line 2.) This is all the more surprising in
light of recent findings by LLb in the same set of test portfolios. These authors report an
adjusted R2 of 54% when they include labor income growth to improve on the definition of
the market portfolio.21 What is the reason behind this difference? The answer lies in the
dating convention used in the construction of the labor income series.
    Jagannathan and Wang (1996) use a dating convention that involves lagging the labor
income series one month to account for the one month delay in the release of the data by
the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The argument is that investors need information about
the price of the human capital asset in order to form their optimal portfolios and that it is
not reasonable to assume that they posses such information prior to it’s release. LLb appeal
to this argument to also use a lagged labor income series.
    Unlike Jagannathan and Wang (1996), who use a monthly data set, we only have quar-
terly data. We lag the labor income by one quarter in order to provide agents with an
information set comparable to that used by Jagannathan and Wang (1996). This time series
has a correlation coefficient of .88 with the one used in LLb for their cross sectional study.22
    Table VII contains the results where the labor income series has been lagged. In order to
ease the comparison with LLb we report the results for the sample period 1963-1998. Clearly
the only lines that are different with respect to Table VI are those that involve Rw . Notice
that indeed now the return on human capital is a significant variable that greatly improves
the performance of the CAPM. The adjusted R2 goes from −2% in the case of the standard
unconditional CAPM to 17% (see lines 1 and 2.) Furthermore, and as also found by LLb
  21
     See their line 2 in Table 1. Jagannathan and Wang (1996) report a similar finding albeit in a different
set of test portfolios and, most importantly, using monthly data.
  22
     This dating convention in the case of quarterly data may be “too much.” Still there is no alternative to
this procedure when the data’s frequency is quarterly.


                                                     25
and Jagannathan and Wang (1996), it enters with the right sign. A quick impression of this
improvement can be obtained from panel C of Figure 5.23
    Interestingly the main difference with respect to Table VI is that now scaling Rw with
the share of labor income to consumption improves the performance of the CAPM to an
adjusted R2 of 54% as opposed to the 27% found with the unlagged labor income series (see
line 5 in both Tables VI and VII.) Finally the full specification (line 6) is very similar to the
previous one and the adjusted R2 is 57% (see panels B and D of Figure 5.)
    In summary, the role of sw is then robust to different sample periods and alternative
assumptions about the investors’ information set. Furthermore most of the improvement
comes from scaling returns, RM and Rw , by the share of labor income to consumption, as
prescribed by our model, a variable that is not automatically related to returns by construc-
tion.24 Importantly it also has a significant explanatory power when it enters independently.
c. Tests of the CCAPM
    Table VIII reports tests for the unconditional and conditional CCAPM as given by ex-
pression (29). As can be seen from panel A results for the period 1946-1998 are disappointing.
The share of labor income to consumption does not seem to play any role in improving the
appalling performance of the CCAPM. Only in the full specification is the share of labor
income to consumption significant but the adjusted R2 is just 2% (see panels A and B of
Figure 6.)
    The picture improves substantially in the sample period 1963-1998 (see panels C and D
of Figure 6.) The inclusion of sw results in significant coefficient and an adjusted R2 of 15%.
Scaling consumption growth does not seem to add any explanatory power to the CCAPM
by itself. In contrast the full specification shown both sw and sw ∆c as significant regressors
and the adjusted R2 improves to a more respectable 30%.25



  23
      Interestingly, in the sample 1946-1998 labor income does not improve the performance of the CAPM.
See panel A of Figure 5.
   24
      This robustness is important in light of recent work by Menzly (2001) who shows that tests of the
conditional CAPM may suffer from a low power problem. In particular he shows that “most portfolios
constructed using US postwar returns data have little ability in distinguishing between an economically
meaningful scaling variable and a random variable with no economic content.”
   25
      As in the case of the CAPM we only include the orthogonal component, that is, the part of sw ∆c that
is orthogonal to sw and ∆c.

              V. FURTHER TESTS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

We propose a simple general equilibrium model to show that changes in expected returns
may be generated by changes in the relative importance of various sources of income. In
our model, total income is funded by dividends and labor income that grow stochastically
over time. We show that equilibrium expected returns change as the fraction of total income
funded by labor income fluctuates over time, because the latter affects the conditional co-
variance between equilibrium returns and consumption growth. We then obtain a new and
simple testable implication, namely, that the ratio of labor income to consumption should
help predicts stock returns. This is strongly confirmed in the data. The regression of stock
returns on lagged values of this ratio produces statistically significant coefficients and ad-
justed R2 that are larger than those generated when using the dividend price ratio as a single
explanatory variable. Notice that differently from the dividend price ratio, our variable is a
pure macroeconomic variable that is constructed with no reference to financial variables and
it is in this sense that we provide a powerful test of our theory.
     We derive and test a version of the conditional CAPM and the conditional consump-
tion CAPM, where the variable we use to condition is the aforementioned ratio. Tests are
conducted on the 25 Fama-French portfolios. We find that when we use our labor-income
to consumption ratio as conditioning variable, the CAPM does a substantially better job
in capturing cross sectional variation in returns. The result is robust to alternative sample
periods and dating conventions regarding the returns on the human capital asset. Results
for the Consumption CAPM are more disappointing.
     In addition to the robustness tests performed above, a previous version of the paper
contained others that further confirmed the share of labor income to consumption as an
economically meaningful variable.
     First we checked the robustness of our results to alternative specifications of the variable
 w
s . For instance the model proposed in this paper implies that total consumption equals
total income in equilibrium. As a consequence, the same relationships that hold for the labor
income to consumption ratio should also hold for the labor income to total income ratio.26
  26
    For coherence with the labor income series (which is net of taxes), we took the total disposable income
as a measure of total income. It is worth reminding the relationship between total income and disposable
income in the national accounts (NIPA tables). We have Total Personal Income equals Compensation of
Employees plus Proprietors Income plus Rental Income plus Personal Dividend Income plus Personal Interest



                                                    27
These regressions showed that the ratio of labor income to disposable income ratio has a
very good predictive power for future returns in all subsamples, although the results were
not so strong for the one quarter ahead predictive regression.
    We also performed a direct test of our theory. Essentially the economic model that
motivated our empirical investigation entails that the covariance between returns and con-
sumption growth moves over time due to the change in the ratio between labor income and
total consumption. In order to test whether the ratio between labor income and consump-
tion predicts the level of covariance between returns and real consumption growth, we first
obtained an estimated time series of the latter by fitting a bi-variate GARCH(1,1) model to
data from 1946-1999. We then ran a regression of the estimated covariance versus past co-
variances and the share of labor income to consumption. Again the share of labor income to
consumption obtained as a significant predictor of changes in the covariance between returns
and consumption growth.27
    We also tested the cross sectional implications of our model the alternative set of test
portfolios used by Jagannathan and Wang (1996), which were portfolios sorted by size and
beta.28 In the full specification of our model the adjusted R2 was 18% and rose to 55% when
the share of labor income to consumption was independently included. Furthermore tests
of the CCAPM in this set of tests portfolios resulted in adjusted R2 as high as 38%. These
results were also robust to alternative dating conventions concerning human capital returns.
    In conclusion, we find a substantial support for the economic model proposed in this
paper, that is, that the time variation in the relative importance of the various sources of
income has an important effect on the required expected return. Furthermore, our model
is also fully consistent with a recent body of of evidence uncovered by Martin Lettau and
Sydney Ludvigson documenting that cyclical variation in the consumption to wealth ratio
affect future expected returns. Although our model is presented in the log-utility case for
simplicity, which implies a constant consumption to wealth ratio, the same results of this
paper can be obtained with higher degrees of risk aversions, as shown in the appendix. In
this case, one can show that the consumption to wealth ratio is a non-linear but decreasing
function of the labor income to consumption ratio. Hence, this model predicts that the
Income plus Transfer payments to persons less Personal Contribution to Social Insurance. Finally, Disposable
Income equals Total Income less Personal Taxes.
  27
     Of course, and as emphasized in the introduction, our model cannot explain the level of this covariance.
  28
     The sample period in these portfolios is 1963-1990.



                                                     28
consumption to wealth ratio should also be a predictor of future returns, a finding that is
well documented in LLa.

Notice that also that for all i, Xti < Cti . Hence, all the integral below exist as long as the expected
present value of future consumption can be computed, which in turn is ensured by choosing φ
sufficiently large. Let X
                        e u = Et (Xu ). Since Σ(s)

                                      Appendix II. Spurious regression tests

   We describe the particular spurious regression tests as presented in Torous and Yan (1999),
who closely follow Richardson and Stock (1989). Suppose that we have the pair of series

                                             yt+1 = a + bxt + ut+1                                          (52)
                                            xt+1 = α + φxt + vt+1                                           (53)



                                                             37
where yt = log (Rt ) is the log return and where εt = (ut , vt )0 is a martingale difference sequence
such that E [εt ε0t |εt−1 , εt−2 ...] = Σ and such that ut and vt have only contemporaneous correlation
ρ = Corr (ut , vt ). Tourus and Yan (1999) study the asymptotic distribution of the least square
estimator obtained by regressing the long-term return yt+1 (K) = K
                                                                           P
                                                                             i=1 yt+i onto the predictive
variable xt under the null hypothesis that there is no relation between yt and xt but through
the contemporaneous correlation of the series. That is, the null-hypothesis is H0 : b = 0. They
show that indeed the for given K, the estimated β (K) is consistent as T → ∞, but its Newey-
West adjusted t-statistic tβ(K) has a non-standard distribution which depends on the correlation
ρ between ut and vt . If ρ = 0, then tβ(K) has indeed a standard normal distribution. They also
show that if the number of non-overlapping intervals does not grow to infinity with T , that is if
T /K → c, constant, then β (K) is no longer consistent and tβ(K) has a non-standard distribution
that depends on both ρ and c.
    In order to check the robustness of our results, we take the suggestions contained in Torous and
Yan (1999) and obtain more robust confidence intervals for the coefficient β (K) in our predictive
regressions by means of Monte Carlo Simulations. More specifically, we perform the following
exercise: Let xt in equation (53) be any of the regressors used in the forecasting regressions, i.e.
the labor-income to consumption ratio sw,t , the (log) dividend price ratio log (Dt /Pt ), both of them
or the interaction term sw,t log (Dt /Pt ). For each of them, we first compute the parameters α and φ
in equation (53) from a time-series regression and the matrix Σ = E [εt ε0t ] to take into account the
correlation between ut and vt (recall that if the correlation ρ = 0, then β (K) is indeed consistent
as T → ∞ and tβ(K) is indeed distributed as a standard normal distribution. In this case all the
results in the previous section hold.) Given our sample size T = 216 for the period 1946-1999,
we simulate 10,000 paths of the system (52)-(53) under the null hypothesis that b = 0. For each
sample, we compute the predictive regressions as in equations (23)-(26) and obtain a distribution
for β (K). This is tabulated in Table VII. We repeated the experiment using both the estimations
of the relevant parameters of (52)-(53) and the sample sizes corresponding to the periods 1952-1999
and 1952-1994 and obtained extremely similar cutoff values for β (K), which we do not report for
brevity.

Notes for Tables V, VI and VII: The tables present estimates of cross-sectional
Fama-MacBeth regressions using the 25 Fama-French portfolios. In parenthe-
sis we report the uncorrected Fama-MacBeth t−statistic. The Shanken (1992)
corrected t−statistic are reported in brackets. The unadjusted and adjusted (in
brackets) R2 are reported in the last column. sw RM denotes the component of
sw RM orthogonal to RM . Similarly sw Rw denotes the component of sw Rw or-
thogonal to Rw . Panel A reports the specifications that are supported by the
model introduced in section II. Panel B reports results where the variable sw is
introduced independently.
Table V shows the results for the sample period 1946-1998. Table VI shows the
results for the sample period 1963-1998. Table VII shows the results for the sam-
ple period 1963-1998 and using the dating convention advocated by Jagannathan
and Wang (1996).

Notes for Table VIII: This table presents estimates of cross-sectional Fama-
MacBeth Regressions using the 25 Fama-French portfolios. In parenthesis we
report the uncorrected Fama-MacBeth t−statistic. The Shanken (1992) cor-
rected t−statistic are reported in brackets. The unadjusted and adjusted (in
brackets) R2 are reported in the last column. ∆c denotes consumption growth,
sw is the share of labor income to consumption, sw × ∆c denotes the component
of consumption growth scaled by the share of labor income to consumption that
is orthogonal to ∆c.
