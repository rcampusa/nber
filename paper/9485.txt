                                           ABSTRACT

Delays at the border for customs clearance are seemingly a central feature of the trade regime in the
CIS states. Here, we argue that with queuing costs being endogenously determined in such
circumstances tariff liberalization (even in the small economy case) can be welfare worsening since

tariff revenues are replaced by resource using queuing costs. On the other hand, corruption can be
welfare improving if queuing costs are replaced by resource transferring bribes. We also show how

added distortions between perishable and non-perishable, or between light and heavy goods can also
arise. We show these outcomes using a simple general equilibrium model, and explore the numerical
implications using Russian data. The orders of magnitude are both significant and opposite in sign
to conventional analyses.

1.        Introduction

         In a number of lower income and transitional economies it is common for there to

be significant delays at the border when achieving customs clearance. This can be due to

complex customs formalities, which sometimes are continually changing, capacity

constraints given limited facilities, and/or corruption at the border. In some African

economies, there are reported delays of 3-6 months to achieve customs clearance2,

although this is perhaps extreme.

         Our paper begins with the observation that if such delays are significant and the

length of the delay is endogenously determined, then trade liberalization through tariff

reductions that increases the length of the queue can be welfare worsening. Tariff

reductions, as have occurred in the CIS states, thus appear to be bad policy without first

addressing customs clearance issues. We show this for small open economy cases in a

simple general equilibrium model where there is a physical constraint on the volume of

imports which can be admitted. We then analyse extensions where corruption occurs,

and finally where some imports are perishable. We apply our analysis to data on Russian

trade for the late 1990s, with the results emphasizing the themes that not only is it best to

deal with border and administrative delays first before engaging in trade liberalization,

but also the quantitative orders of magnitudes for the costs involved can be large.

2.     A Model of Trade with Border Delays

      The role and significance of border delays for trade liberalization in a number of

economies around the world is reflected in anecdotal evidence on their importance in the

trade of Russia and other former Soviet Union countries. Hare (2001) in a recent piece

on trade policy in CIS transition economies says “It is often asserted that inadequate

physical infrastructure – roads, railways, and the like – inhibits trade, though solid

evidence for this is lacking. More often, the real barrier to trade is again institutional,

taking the form of unreasonable customs delays at many borders in the transition

economy region, accompanied by widespread demands for bribes to expedite the

movement of goods.”

      The precise length of these delays and even/or how precisely they arise is

unfortunately poorly documented in the literature but their impact on trade is

unquestionable. There is some suggestion in the literature that continual changes in

customs legislation and uncertainty as to how they are to be implemented is a key factor.

Equally, these delays are also thought to reflect the time taken for negotiations between

officials and importers over valuation, which it is thought can fall dramatically through

the use of negotiation intermediaries. Bribes seem to be involved in this process. These

and other issues in the Russian case are discussed in Beilock (2002), and Wolf and

Gurgen (2000). Delays in the range of weeks or months for clearance are often claimed

in anecdotes, with six weeks being an approximate mean figure suggested to us for

Russia in conversations although this varies substantially with the port of entry and

transportation mode.




                                               2
A Simple Model

        The purpose of our paper is to focus on the interactions between border delays

and trade liberalization in light of their seeming importance in these cases. We formalize

these interactions in a model of a simple pure exchange economy which is small and a

taker of prices on world markets and engaged in trade. For expositional simplicity of

structure, we assume for now there is no production and all goods are traded (these

features can be changed in numerical application). The world prices for the N goods we

take as given by the π iw . Tariff rates ti apply to imports (ti = 0 for exports), and we

assume the direction of trade is predetermined.3

       In this economy, domestic prices depart from world prices on the import side both

due to tariffs and queuing costs at the border Tq(π). For simplicity, we assume these costs

are the same for all goods, and that units for goods are denominated in comparable

physical terms (e.g. tons). Thus, if M goods are imported and (N-M) exported, and the

direction of trade is unchanged,

              π id = π iw (1 + ti ) + T q (π ) (i=1………..M).                          (1)

Tq is assumed to be indexed and so is homogeneous of degree one in π and is

endogenously determined.

        The economy has market demand functions, ξ i (π d , R, Q ) , and non-negative

endowments, wi, for each of the N goods, where πd denotes the N dimensional vector of

domestic commodity prices. R defines tariff revenues, and Q represents endogenously

determined queuing costs (denominated in units of the good being imported). These

3
 This is a standard assumption in most theoretical trade models, although numerically the direction of trade
can change when trade policies change. See Abrego, Riezman, and Whalley (2000) for a recent discussion
of the likelihood of this assumption being false in comparisons between free trade, customs unions, and


                                                     3
demand functions are non-negative, continuous, homogeneous of degree zero in πd and

satisfy Walras Law, i.e., at all price vectors πd


              ∑ π (ξ (π                      )           )
                N

                               i

                                       , R , Q − wi = 0 .                                   (2)
               i =1


Assuming there is a single representative consumer in this economy their budget

constraint is given by


              ∑ π id ξ i (π d , R, Q ) = ∑ π id wi + R − ∑ T q (π )(ξ i − wi ) .
               N                                 N                M
                                                                                            (3)
               i =1                              i =1             i =1


       For simplicity, border delays are assumed to reflect a constraint on the volume of

imports that can be processed over the period of time covered by the model (e.g. one

year). Thus, for now, we consider this to be a physical constraint rather than one

reflecting corruption or other considerations. If C represents the administratively

determined capacity constraint on imports, then


              ∑ (ξ (π                  )     )
               M

                               , R, Q − wi ≤ C                                              (4)
               i =1


                                                  M                             M
where R denotes tariff revenues                  ∑ π iwt (ξ i − wi )i , and Q = ∑ T q (π )(ξ i − wi ) denotes the
                                                  i =1                          i =1


queuing costs.

       In this simple model, if the capacity constraint on imports is binding then queuing

costs Tq(πw) are determined in equilibrium along with domestic prices π d , tariff

revenues, and domestic demands ξ i . The effect of tariff liberalization will be to lower

tariff revenues and increase queuing costs. In the case where tariff rates are uniform

across commodities, tariff reductions simply generate a corresponding increase in


Nash equilibria.

queuing costs. Since the latter use real resources, tariff reducing trade liberalization will

typically be welfare worsening.



Model Extensions

      This simple model can be extended in a number of ways which capture additional

mechanisms through which border delays and trade liberalization can interact.



Corruption

      One is the presence of corruption. This can be modelled simply in this framework

as the ability of customs officials to extract a bribe for allowing passage of goods. We

assume that there is a bound to the bribe, which for simplicity we take to be the ability of

an official to send the importer to the back of the line in the event a bribe is not paid. If

we assume that officials can only do this once, since otherwise they would reveal

themselves as corrupt officials if they repeat the denial of clearance, this means that the

bribe that can be extracted by the official is within epsilon of the queuing costs Tq. For

simplicity, we take the bribe paid to equal Tq, which will now change relative to the no

corruption case.

      The discussion above suggests that the queuing costs in the formulation above are

halved, with bribes making up the remaining difference between world and domestic

prices for imports. Thus, if B represents the bribe paid per unit import

             π id = π iw (1 + t i ) + T q + B                              (5)

and by construction B=Tq.




                                                5
      This also means that in equation (4) the real resource loss from queuing is halved

and exports increase, since fewer export earnings are needed to cover queuing costs.

Corruption in this case is thus socially desirable since real resource costs are now

partially replaced by a transfer of income to government officials.



Perishability

      A further elaboration on the basic model can be used to show how differential

impacts of queuing on different commodities can result. One way this can happen is if

perishable commodities are more adversely affected by queuing than non-perishable

commodities. Differential impacts of border delays across commodities are the end result

with added distortionary costs.

      We can capture this by defining a variable γ i which represents the fraction of goods

shipped which actually arrive, where γ i ≤ 1 , and (1 − γ i ) is the perish rate for good i. We

can then make γ i a function of the time spent queuing so as to capture the feature that

perish rates increase with queuing time.

      Thus, for each unit shipped and paid for, only γ i units actually arrive; or,

                     π iw (1 + t i ) + T q
            π id =                                                         (6)
                              γi

      and

            γ i = 1 − λT       q
                                                                           (7)

where λ is a constant, and so perish rates increase with queuing time.

      With this formulation, differential impacts of queuing by commodity result and

even uniform tariff liberalization now has differential impacts by good.


                                               6
Other Extensions

      Various other extensions to this basic model can also be made, which for space

reasons we do not elaborate on in any detail. We can use a model with production rather

than a simple pure exchange economy with endowments. We can also incorporate non

traded as well as traded goods. Both of these are standard in numerical general

equilibrium models of actual economies (see Shoven and Whalley (1992)), although

neither changes the basic analytical structure in which queuing costs are endogenously

determined.

      We can also modify the model set out above for cases in which different

commodities incur different queuing costs per unit weight due to differing administrative

procedures. This could arise with valuation procedures being more complex for, say,

components for electronic products compared to basic commodities such as coal. This

can be done by building in different factors of proportionality into the analysis for

queuing costs for the various quantities imported. Again, the essential structure of the

model remains unchanged.




                                              7
3.     Some Calculations Using Russian Data

      Using this simple framework, we have made some calculations using Russian data

to explore the possible quantitative orders of magnitude involved with analysis of trade

liberalization that incorporate border delays. The delays reported in the Russian case

appear to be lengthy and a major restraint on trade. These calculations thus serve to

underline the point that if tariff reforms occur with no attention being paid first to

administrative considerations and border delays, liberalization can be welfare worsening

rather than welfare improving as is usually the case in conventional models rather than

providing accurate point estimates of actual impacts. Importantly, they suggest that there

are costs rather than benefits from trade liberalization in such cases and they can be

substantial.

      To apply the model set out above to the Russian case, we use CES demand

functions and in addition specify the model so as to also include both a non-traded goods

sector and two traded goods so that distortions between perishable and non perishable

imports can be analysed. All model variants thus include four goods (an exportable, two

importables, and a non traded good).

      We use the standard applied general equilibrium modelling approach of calibration

to a base case data set, followed by counter factual equilibrium analysis (see Shoven and

Whalley (1992)). To make our calculations of the impacts of trade liberalization

incorporating border delays we have constructed a benchmark equilibrium data set for

Russian trade, consumption, and endowments (taken to equal production) by averaging




                                              8
data for 1997, 1998, and 19994. These are years during which there was substantial

variation in Russian trade performance due to the 1998 financial crisis, and using

averages in this way partially mitigates extremes in any one years data. We use tariff

data from World Bank sources for 19995, which suggests an approximate average tariff

rate across all imports of 10%. We assume an average border delay of 3 weeks in

customs clearance (6 weeks is the figure often claimed). This is the basis for an

approximate estimate that with non-delay shipping times from Western Europe of 3 days

and formal transportation cost in the range of 5% (see Hummels (1999) for a recent

discussion of the size of transportation costs in trade), delay costs could be in the range of

30% of the value of imports. We use this estimate as the base case value in our

computations, making some modifications in the perishability case.

      We use calibration methods and this data to determine both share and elasticity

parameters in preferences. For the case of CES preferences, demands are given by

                                   αi I
              Xi =                                               (i=1…..N)           (5)
                       (π ) ∑α (π )
                                 N
                           d σ                  d 1−σ
                          i                 j   j
                                 j =1



where αi are CES shares, σ is the substitution elasticity, and income, I, is given by


                                                ( )(ξ
                   N                    M
              I = ∑ π id wi − ∑ T q π i                     − wi ) .
                                                    w
                                                        i                            (6)
                   i =1                 i =1



      In this case, the import demand elasticity, ηim , for import good i is given by

                                                       Xi
             η im = (− σ − S i (1 − σ ))                                ( i=1…..N)         (7)
                                                  ( X i − Wi )

                                                                 9
where Si is the income expenditure share on good i.

       These elasticities are not constant and so direct calibration is not possible. The

convention in calibration literature is to use a literature estimate and choose σ so that the

implied point estimate of the elasticity in the neighbourhood of the benchmark

equilibrium is literature consistent. If share parameters on imported goods are large, then

negative values of σ can result from calibration if import demand elasticities in the

neighbourhood of one are used. This is common in general equilibrium trade models,

since the majority of estimates in the literature are around one (see Erkel-Rousse and

Mirza (2002)). Not recognizing the significance of non traded goods can result in this

problem since expenditure shares on traded goods are smaller in models with non traded

goods than without them, and is one reason for including them in the model.

       Using GAMS(1996) solution software, we calibrate both the basic model and

associated variants to the averaged 1997-1999 benchmark data set. We then evaluate the

effects of tariff reform for each model variant by computing counterfactual equilibria

which we also compare to the base case. We also use a model variant where no border

delays are present, which we term the conventional case. In this event, gains from tariff

liberalization occur.

       We classify the trade data into importables and exportables based on the sign of net

trade flows by commodity. We use equation (5) to calibrate model share parameters from

data on consumption and prices, choosing units for goods in the model such that world

prices are one. Equation (5) is used jointly in calibration with equation (6) which

determines σ given shares, once import price elasticity values are assumed.6 Our

6
 We calibrate to the import price elasticity of the first import good, and since share parameters on the two
imports are similar these two import price elasticities are very close.


                                                     10
calibrations yield share and elasticity parameter estimates for the basic model variants for

assumed values of import price elasticities lying between –1 and –2 (one is the most

frequently used in empirical trade models) as set out in Table 1.

      Using models parameterized in this way, we have generated two sets of results

which allow us to analyse the interactions between trade liberalization and border delays.

In Table 2, we show welfare and trade impacts of liberalization in the basic model with

border delays and in two model extensions which incorporate corruption and

perishability. These estimates are reported for the three values of assumed import price

elasticities used in calibration in Table 1.

      Results in Table 2 show negative welfare effects of trade liberalization measured in

terms of the Hicksian equivalent variation as a percentage of income in all cases. These

costs become larger as the assumed price elasticity rises since as both substitution

elasticities and share parameters change the evaluation of utility pre and post

liberalization changes. Larger impacts on queuing costs across these cases reflect the

different share parameters generated by calibration. Costs are smaller in the with

corruption cases, for high elasticities and larger for smaller elasticities. The real resource

corruption cases, and in that sense corruption is good in the model. But changes in

queuing costs are comparable. Perishability raises costs slightly for all import price

elasticity cases. Import volumes only change in the perishability cases.

      The second set of results in Table 3 compares those from the basic model with

border delays to those from a more conventional model with no border delays. To make

this comparison, we use a case for a conventional tariff model where there are no queuing

costs in the base case, so that in this model relative price effects of tariff liberalization

come into play as tariffs are eliminated and no queuing costs enter. In the comparable

border delay model, the capacity constraint on imports remains. A tariff equal to the

combined queuing plus tariff wedge in the base model is applied to the conventional

model. We then consider a reduction in this tariff by 10 percentage points. In both of

these cases, we use an import price elasticity of minus one in calibration. As Table 3

indicates, the signs of welfare effects are reversed between models, and the absolute

values of effects are different.

      These simulation results thus clearly show how trade liberalization can be welfare

worsening in the presence of border delays. Tariff reductions have little or no impact on

domestic prices because of the capacity constraint on processing imports. More queuing

results in added real resource costs, rather than generating revenues as is true with tariffs.


                                               13
The presence of corruption tends to weaken these effects since lowered tariffs now

increase transfers to corrupt officials with smaller effects on aggregate incomes.

Perishability considerations affect the costs of liberalization through more product loss,

and added queuing results. And the differences relative to a conventional trade

liberalization model are in sign.

      In sum, this analysis and the simulations reported point to the significant role that

border delays can play in influencing the effects of trade liberalization. Without prior

attention to administrative procedures and customs clearance, trade liberalization can

become welfare worsening by increasing queuing costs. Trade liberalization in CIS states

that does not first deal with administrative delays can thus be viewed as potentially

counterproductive.
