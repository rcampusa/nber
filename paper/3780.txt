               HOW VALUABLE IS PATENT PROTECTION?
    ESTIMATES BY TECHNOLOGY FIELD USING PATENT RENEWAL DATA


                             ABStRACT


    This   paper presents quantitative estimates of the private
value of property rights conferred by patent protection for
different technology fields and countries of ownership. The
measures are derived from parametric estimation of a model of

patent renewal, using a new data set on patent renewals in France
during the period 1969-1987. The results show that patent
protection is a significant, but not the major, source of private

returns to inventive activity and that its importance varies

sharply across technology fields. The paper quantifies the
equivalent subsidy to R&D generated by the patent system,
characterizes variations in the value of patent rights across

technology fields, countries of ownership and time, and explores

the determinants of those differences.

       This paper provides empirical estimates of the importance of the

patent system as a source of economic returns to inventive activity. In the

literature on intellectual property rights, and from a public policy

perspective, two central questions are whether the patent system is a

quantitatively important incentive mechanism and whether its importance varies

across different, broadly defined technology areas (Levin, Klevorick, Nelson

and Winter 1987).     Patents are one of several alternative devices to

appropriate the gains from invention, and the decision to patent presumably

rests on the comparative effectiveness of these devices.           To a first

approximation, the private value of the patent system can be measured by the

incremental returns from inventions protected by patents, above and beyond the

gains that would be appropriable by the second—best means.

       The basic empirical difficulty is that there are no active markets in

patents where direct valuation of patent rights can be observed.           The

available evidence on the importance of patent protection is based exclusively

on survey data (Taylor and Silberston 1973; Mansfield, Schwartz and Wagner

1981; Levin, Klevorick, Nelson and Winter 1987). This literature points to

two main conclusions: first, that patents are not the exclusive or even

primary device for protecting inventions in most industries, and second, that

reliance on patents is much greater in some industries (especially

pharmaceuticals) than in others.

       This paper contributes econometric evidence to the discussion. The

empirical analysis is based on the model of patent renewal developed by

Schankerman and Fakes (1986). In most countries patentees are required to pay


                                      1
 annual fees in order to maintain patent protection. On the assumption that

 the renewal decision is based on the private returns generated by the patent

 right, patent renewal data can be used to infer the private value of patent

protection. The analysis in this paper is based on a new and extensive data

set on patent renewals •   containing virtually   all patents applied for in France

during the period 1969—1982.       The renewal data are disaggregated both by

technology field and country of origin, which allows one to investigate

variations in the importance of patent rights across these dimensions.

        Patent renewal data can only inform about the private value of patent

rights. Nonappropriable (social) returns are presumably not relevant to, and

hence cannot be revealed by, the patentee's renewal decision. Beyond that

limitation, however, two important points should be kept in mind in

interpreting results based on patent renewal data.            First, there is an

important distinction between the valuation of the patent system before and

after the decision to patent (ex ante and ex post valuation). The renewal

decision is required only after the decision to apply for a patent. As

Horstman, MacDonald and Silvinski (1985) emphasise, the patent application

itself reveals private information about the invention. Once this information

has been disclosed, it may be very difficult to appropriate rents without

patent protection.     Hence, the willingness to pay to maintain patent

protection after disclosure will be greater than before the decision to patent

is taken. On this account, the estimates in this paper represent an upper

bound to the private returns generated by the patent sytem ex ante. On the

other hand, Judd (1989) has emphasised that the patent system may generate

private returns by discouraging competition at the invention stage merely by

offering the possibility of a patent, even if no patent is actually taken out

by the winner. Hence patent renewal data may not fully capture the private




                                        2
gains due to strategic responses and may underestimate the private value of

the patent system.

       The paper is organised as follows. Section 1 describes the data set.

The patent renewal model and stochastic specification are summarised in

Section 2. Section 3 presents the empirical results for the four technology

fields (pooling the countries of origin). This material includes parametric

estimates of the patent renewal model (Section 3.l) the distributions of the

value of patent rights (Section 3.2), computations of the equivalent subsidy

to R&D conferred by patent protection (Section 3.3), and movements over time

in patent counts and patent values (Section 3.4). Section 4 presents the

empirical results allowing for differences across countries of origin within

each technology field. This material includes parametric estimates of the

model and the implied differences in mean value across countries of origin and

over time (Section 4.1), and some evidence on the determinants of these

variations (Section 4.2). Concluding remarks sumniarise the main empirical

findings.




                                      3
 Section 1. DescriDtion of the Data Set



        The data set was constructed from computerised files of individual

 patents from the French Patent Office (see Schankerman 1990 for details). The

 data cover all patent applications in France during the period 1969—1987,

 disaggregated in three dimensions: the technology field to which the patent

 is assigned, the country of origin, and the date the patent application is

 filed (cohort). For each technology field/country cell   •   the   data set contains

 the number of patent applications per cohort, the number of patents granted

per cohort during each of the years subsequent to application cohort date, and

the number of patent renewals per cohort at each available age.

     Each patent is assigned by the patent examiner to one primary technology

group according to the International. Patent Classification (IPC). Assignment

is based on the function of the invention (e.g.. conveyer belts would be

classified as industrial transport apparatus), which may differ both from an

industry of origin and industry of use criterion. The patent is identified

by the country of the owner (normally but not always the inventor), which I

refer to hereafter as country of origin. The countries of origin include

Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States. The raw

data contain seventeen technology groups that account for the bulk (over 90

percent) of patent applications in France. For this paper the groups are

consolidated into four major technology fields: pharmaceuticals, chemicals,

mechanical, and electronics. This categorisation is designed to capture the

broad distinctions between patents based on fundamentally different types of

technologies.                                                 -




     information   on patent renewal fees was obtained directly from the French

Patent Office.     Renewal fee schedules were changed frequently during the

sample period, but the prevailing schedule applied to all patents regardless


                                       4
of cohort, technology field, or country of origin.     The renewal fees start

at very low levels and rise monotonically as the patent ages. By age nineteen

(the last age in the sample) the renewal fee is about $400 per patent (in 1980

U.S. dollars).'

       The pattern of renewal rates varies across technology fields and

countries of origin, but certain features do emerge.       To conserve space,

Figure 1 presents the age path of renewal rates for each technology field,

averaged over countries of origin excluding Japan. Figure 2 provides the

renewal rates for patents from Japan.     There is substantial attrition as

patents age, with about fifty percent of patents dropping out before they

reach age ten.    This general feature holds for all technology fields and

countries of origin. For all countries of origin, except Japan, renewal rates

for pharmaceuticals and chemicals are generally higher than for mechanical and

electronics patents. The differences summarised in Figure 1 are particularly

clear for France and the United Kingdom, while for Germany and the United

States the renewal patterns are very similar across technology fields (not

shown in the figure). This ranking of technology fields is sharply reversed

for patents of Japanese origin, where renewal rates are highest in electronics

and lowest in pharmaceuticals. The differences in renewal patterns across

countries of origin are presented in Figures 3—6. In each technology field

the renewal rates are much higher for patents from France and Japan than for

the other three countries. Japan particularly stands out in the mechanical

and electronics fields.

     These rankings of renewal curves provide some limited information about

the value of patent rights, without resorting to parametric estimation of the

patent renewal model. In a study of nonparametric methods for patent renewal

data, Pakes and Simpson (1989) develop a test of the null hypothesis that the

value distributions for different groups of patents are identical. The test


                                      5
 is based on a comparison between the mortality rates at each age in different

 groups of patents (facing the same renewal fee schedules).        I apply this

 nonparametric (chi—square) test to variations among countries of origin and

 technology fields. Let     1r   denote the mortality rate at age a for patents

 from cohort c, where i and j represent the country of origin and technology

 field respectively. The null hypothesis that the value distributions do not

 differ across technology fields is equivalent to the restriction 1i: 1r —

 for   all .t.   To test for differences across countries of origin, the null

hypothesis is H: irU —    it for all j.
          Table 2 summarises the test results. Under the null hypothesis, the

expected value of the x/d statistic is unity. The hypothesis that the value

distribution is the same for all technology fields is rejected decisively for

each country of origin (Panel A). The hypothesis that the value distribution

is the same for all countries of origin is also strongly rejected for each

technology field (Panel 8). These results show that there is both within—

technology field and within—country of origin variation in value

distributions.2 The parametric specification of the patent renewal model in

Sections 2 and 4 will allow for differences in these dimensions.

       Prior to 1968 there was no effective screening of patent applications in

France. The French Patent Office was not legally bound to impose substantive

criteria of acceptability, and all patent applications that met certain

minimal procedural guidelines were granted. In 1968 a new patent law imposed

substantive criteria and instructed the French Patent Office to enforce them.

Table 1 shows that this patent reform was associated with dramatic changes in

grant rates (computed as the ratio of cumulated grants from a given cohort to

the number of patent applications for that cohort).          Two facts are of

particular importance. First, there was a very sharp decline in the grant

rate over time for each technology field and country of origin. Second, there


                                          6
are systematic rankings of technology fields and countries of origin in terms

of grant rates.     Reading across the rows in the table, the ranking of

technology fields (in descending order) is pharmaceuticals, chemicals,

electronics, and mechanical. This ranking holds for each country of origin

and the differences in the grant rates are large. Reading down the columns,

the typical ranking countries of origin (within a given technology field) is

Japan, France, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom.

     These findings yield two testable implications. First, if the decline

in grant rates reflects more stringent screening that weeds out low value

patents, it should raise the mean value of patent rights in the population of

granted patents over time. Second, higher grant rates for a country of origin

within a given technology field should be associated with a larger mean value

of patent rights, provided the patent screening criteria do not depend on

which country is applying for the patent.3 These hypotheses are investigated

in Section 4, using estimates of mean value from the patent renewal model.



Section 2.   Mode]. of Patent Renewal




     The empirical work is based on the model developed by Schankerman and

Pakes (1986). Consider an agent who holds a patent. Let c denote the cohort

of the patent and a denote the age of the patent. In order to keep the patent

in force the patentee must pay an annual renewal fee, and failure to pay

terminates patent protection permanently. The renewal fee varies with the age

and possibly the cohort of the patent.      Let {Cac}..i   denote the sequence of

renewal fees (in real terms) at different ages. The (annual) economic returns

to holding the patent at age a (in real terms) is denoted by R.. These

returns include any economic benefits to the patentee that would not have

accrued in the absence of the patent protection.           The sequence (R.)1 is


                                        7
 assumed to be known with certainty by the patentee at the time the patent is

 applied for (when patent protection begins).                  The decision problem is to

maximise the discounted value of net revenues accruing to the patent by

choosing an optimal age at which to stop paying the renewal fee. Formally,

 the agent chooses the lifespan of the patent, T, to



                           TICI
                                 Max

where $     is   the discount factor and N is the statutory limit to patent

protection. Provided the sequence of net revenues                         is non—increasing

in age, the condition for renewal of the patent at age a is that the annual

returns to holding the patent cover the renewal fee,


                                                                                      (2)


Since renewal fees are increasing in age, a sufficient condition for this

renewal rule to be optimal is that the returns to holding a patent decay over

time .

     If    the sequence of returns were the same for all patents in a given

cohort, then patents would be cancelled at the same age and the renewal curve

would be degenerate.       Since this is not consistent with observed renewal

curves, the model allows patents in a given cohort to differ in their initial

revenues (representing them as random draws from some distribution), but

assumes that the sequence of decay rates is the same for all patents. Under

these assumptions, the condition for renewal of a patent at age a can be

written:             > ce,, II   d      where          i—6 .           Let F(L;e) be the
distribution function of initial revenues, where e, denotes a vector of

parameters that characterises the distribution and may be different across




                                                   8
cohorts of patents.       Then the proportion of patents in cohort c that is

renewed at age a,         is

                                     1 dF(R0;O) = 1 — F(z.;O)                     (3)




where           —    J C'.       .        Given an assumed functional form for the

distribution of initial revenues, equation (3) provides the

relationship between the sequence of renewal proportions predicted by the

model and the unknown parameters (the vector e and (6.}) The estimation

problem is to choose those parameter values that make the predicted renewal

proportions as "close" to the observed proportions as possible.

        On the basis of a comparison among alternative functional forms, the

lognormal specification for F(R;8) is used.5 The data set contains four

dimensions that must be incorporated in the parameterisation of the model.

Denote the country of origin by .1, the technology field by j, the cohort by

c, and the age of the patent by a.              Assume that initial revenues distribute

lognormally and let lower case letters denote the logarithm of upper case

ones.      Then we have r —              N(4.o))    where N(m) designates the normal

distribution. In logarithmic form, the decision rule is to renew a patent at

age a if and only if r2 a ln                -       d Equivalently,


                      xi_ ii             —p'+lnC,-L      lndj

                                                                                  (4)
                     rocoJCjUc




        The left hand side of (4) has a standard normal distribution, so the

proportion of patents that has dropped out by age a is given by


                                     =              = i-t(4.)                      (5)

 general form of the model,

                                       '-

                                                aj
 where y a '(l — Ps).
        Given only data on renewal rates for each of the cells defined by the
 four    dimensions, one cannot allow the parameters for the lognormal

distribution and decay rates to be completely free. Some simplification of

the parameterisation in (6) is required. The model is estimated separately

for each technology group, so all parameters are allowed to vary across

technology groups.     I also permit the mean value of patent rights for any

given technology group to differ across cohorts and countries of origin. For

the lognormal distribution, the mean of initial revenues depends on p and a

but the coefficient of variation depends only on c.6                 The procedure followed

here is to allow for the parameter p         to   be specific to the cohort and country

of origin, but to maintain a common value of a.                      This is equivalent to

allowing for a proportional rescaling of initial revenues of all patents in

a given cell —   the mean may differ but the coefficient of variation is common.

Section 3 reports the empirical work based on data pooled across countries of

origin for each technology group —          that   is, imposing the constraint 45     —


for   all i.   Section 4 explores the empirical differences across countries of

origin, permitting p to be freely parameterised.                 The decay rate is assumed

to be common to different countries of origin within a given technology group

and constant over time.      However, the decay rate is permitted to differ in

1974 and 1980 in order to capture the impact of the major oil price shocks

during those years. These effects are year—specific and apply to any patent

that is in force during those years. regardless of patent age.7


                                             10
        The stochastic specification allows for two disturbances. The first is

an error tern in the renewal rule (4), ,,                that   is assumed to have zero mean

and constant variance, o. The second disturbance is a binomial sampling

error in the observed renewal proportion,                       The variance of the sampling

error is given by P.(l—P.)/A. where A is the number of patents in cohort c.

This is introduced because some observed renewal rates are based on cells with

relatively few observations (especially recent cohorts in pharmaceuticals).0

Letting u. denote the composite disturbance and incorporating these

specifications, the model can be written

Note that 6 is the baseline decay rate applicable in all years except 1974 and

 Section 3. Empirical Results by Technology Field



 3.1       Estimates of the Patent Renewal Model




         Table 3 presents the empirical results for different versions of the

model, separately for each technology field (pooled across countries of

origin).     To facilitate discussion, I focus first on a comparison across

different specifications, and then turn to the parameter estimates in the

preferred specification and compare across technology field. Regression (1)

for each technology field refers to the model with a constant decay rate and

no cohort—specific variation in p   (i.e.   p —   p   for all c, which is called the

no—effects model). Regression (2) allows for a completely free sequence of

cohort effects in p,          and is called the fixed effects model. The null

hypothesis that there are no cohort effects in p is rejected in each

technology group. The computed test statistic TI varies between 3.5 and 5.5

depending on the technology group, compared to a critical value at the 0.05

level of 1.75 (2.18 at the 0.01 level). This implies that significant changes

have occurred in the mean value of patent rights during the peflod 1969—1982

in all technology groups.     These changes are discussed in more detail in

Section 3.4.

       Regression (3) refers to the fixed effects model that allows for the

decay rate to differ during the years of the large oil price changes, 1974 and

1980. The null hypothesis that the decay rate does not change during these

years is strongly rejected in each technology group.               The computed test

statistic T2 is around ten or more, compared to a critical value at the 0.05

level of 3.0 (4.6 at the 0.01 level).         Since the parameters            and 6
represent year effects (regardless of patent age) ,      this   evidence reflects the


                                      12
fact that the dropout rate for all cohorts of patents was abnormally high

during 1974 and 1980. Interpretation of these oil price effects is discussed

later in this section.

     Consider next the comparison of parameter estimates across the technology

groups. For this purpose I focus on the model with cohort effects in p and

oil price effects in 6, but the conclusions all hold for the model without oil

shocks. In all technology fields the parameters estimates have the expected

sign and are statistically significant (6 in pharmaceuticals and chemicals

being a marginal exception).         The estimates of a indicate that the

distribution of initial revenues exhibits both substantial dispersion and

skewness,   the degree of dispersion is illustrated by the coefficient of

variation, which varies from 2.6 in pharmaceuticals to 16.2 in electronics.

The degree of skewness is illustrated by the ratio of the mean to the median

of initial revenues, which for the lognormal is exp(½ a2). This ratio varies

from 2.4 in pharmaceuticals to 16.2 in electronics.               Note also that

differences across technology fields in p   are   positively correlated with those

in a, so that technology groups with higher mean and median levels of initial

revenues also have greater dispersion and skewness. The estimates of the rate

of decay in returns from holding patents also vary substantially across

technology groups.   The rates of decay in the pharmaceutical and chemical

sectors are similar to each other and rather low, on the order of 5 percent

per year, but in the mechanical and electronics technology fields the decay

rate is between 10 and 15 percent.

     In summary, a sharp picture emerges from these results.              The key

empirical finding is that the parameters segregate the technology groups into

two distinct categories.      The first, comprised of pharmaceuticals and

chemicals, is characterised by comparatively low values of p, a and 6. The

distribution of initial returns to holding a patent in these sectors exhibits


                                      13
low median and mean returns, less dispersion and skewness, and a slow rate of

decay in privately appropriable returns.       The second field, composed of

mechanical and electronic patents, is characterised by larger values of p. a

and 6.   The distribution in these sectors exhibits higher median and mean

returns, a greater degree of dispersion and skewness, and a much faster rate

of obsolescencej' The implications of these parameters for the distribution

of the value of patent rights are considered in Section 3.2.

     The estimates of the decay rates for 1974 and 1980 provide strong

evidence that the oil price shocks reduced the value of the stock of patents

in force. The point estimates of 674    imply that the contemporaneous returns
to holding a patent declined by between 39 and 65 percent in 1974, and the

estimates are precise. The decline associated with the second oil price shock

in 1980 is somewhat smaller but still substantial, varying between 21 and 39

percent. These parameters may seem unreasonably large, but it is important

to remember that they measure the effect on current returns to holding a

patent, not the discounted value of the stream of returns. The parameters can

be used to deduce the impact on the discounted value of returns —   that   is, on

the value of the patent rights (see Appendix I for the method). In this form

the estimates of 674 and 5 imply that the oil price shocks reduced the

discounted value of patent rights for the stock of patents in force by about

24 percent in 1974 and 18 percent in 1980. The estimated impact is almost

identical in each of the four technology groups.12

     To put this finding in perspective, note that the average decline in

Tobin's—Q for the manufacturing sector in five major OECD countries was about

21 percent in 1974—75 and 13 percent in 1980—81 (see Chan—Lee 1986). Hence,

the econometric evidence from the patent renewal model indicates that the

downward revaluation of the stock of patent rights due to the oil price shocks

was large, roughly similar to (if not greater than) the observed decline in


                                       14
the stock market valuation of (physical and intangible) capital at the

manufacturing level.

     As described in Section 1, the ranking across technology fields by patent

renewal rates is very different for patents applied for by Japan than for

other countries of origin. To check whether the inclusion of Japan affects

the two—way grouping of technology fields, the fixed effects model with and

without oil price effects was re—estimated on data excluding patents from

Japan. The results (not reported to conserve space) show that the exclusion

of Japan does            change the key finding that there are two distinct

categories —   pharmaceuticals   and chemicals in one, mechanical and electronics

in the other —   or   the main characteristics of the parameters in each category.

The main effect of excluding Japan is to lower the estimate of p.              The

estimate declines by about 0.15 in the pharmaceuticals, chemicals and

mechanical groups, but by about 1.0 in electronics. Since the mean value of

initial revenues is a (exponential) function of p, these results suggest that

Japanese patents in France are more valuable than those from other countries,

especially in electronics where the difference may be very large. To address

this issue more fully, Section 4 presents empirical estimates of the model

allowing for differences across all countries of origin.




3.2 Estimates of the Value of Patent Rights



     In this section the parameter estimates from Table 3 are used to derive

the distribution of the value of patent rights. The net present value of

patent rights for a single patent is V — It0 E1[(1_6/(l+i)]t where R0 is the

initial returns from holding the patent, i is the discount rate, and V is the

optimal lifespan of the patent. The lognormal distribution on It0 induces a


                                          15
distribution of these values. The parameters p, a and S can be used to

generate the quantiles of the distribution of V and their standard errors by

simulating the value distribution.'3

     Table 4 presents the distribution of the value of patent rights for the

1970 cohort of patents in each technology field. The value of patent rights

includes all net returns accruing from the date of application until the

optimal expiration date. The distribution is generated for the model with oil

shocks to the decay rate since that model is favored by the data, but the main

conclusions also hold for the model without oil shocks.

     The most prominent feature of the distributions is the sharp skewness in

each technology field. Most patents have very little private value. The

median value of patent rights (in 1980 U.S. dollars) is only $1631 in

pharmaceuticals, $1594 in chemicals, $2930 in mechanical, and $3159 In

electronics (excluding Japan). The value of patents rights rises sharply with

the quantile, especially in the mechanical and electronics technology groups.

There are some highly valuable patents in the tails of the distributions, as

shown by the upper quantiles, and these patents account for a large fraction

of the total value of patent rights for the 1970 cohort in eacl3 technology

group. The top one percent of patents accounts for about 15 percent of the

total value of patent rights in pharmaceuticals and chemicals, and about 25

percent in mechanical and electronics (excluding Japan). The top five percent

of patents accounts for about 40 percent of total value in pharmaceuticals and

chemicals, and more than 50 percent in the mechanical and electronics

groups." The quantiles of the distribution are estimated quite precisely in

pharmaceuticals and chemicals. The precision is worse for the mechanical and

electronics technology fields, especially in the upper five percent of the

tail. Nonetheless, the estimates indicate clear differences across technology

fields in the mean value of patent rights. The mean value is estimated to be


                                       16
$4313 in pharmaceuticals, $4969 in chemicals, $15,120 for mechanical patents,

and $19,837 in electronics (excluding Japan).         The estimates in Table 4

confirm that the technology fields break down into two distinct categories.

Both in terms of the mean value and the degree of skewness in the

distributions, there is clear evidence that pharmaceutical and chemical

patents fall into one category and mechanical and electronics patents into

another.

       A comparison of the last two columns in Table 4 also shows that

including electronics patents of Japanese origin raises the mean value of

patent rights for that technology field by a factor of three and greatly

reduces the precision of the estimates. A more detailed look at differences

across countries of origin is provided in Section 4.



3,3 Equivalent Subsidy to R&D



     The estimates of mean value can be used to obtain the total value of

patent rights for a given cohort of patents in each technology field. A

comparison between the total value of patent rights and the R&D expenditures

used to produce those patents provides an estimate of the subsidy rate to R&D

conferred by the patent system (hereafter, the equivalent subsidy rate). This

section presents estimates of the equivalent subsidy rate for each technology

field for the 1970 cohort of patents.

     Suppose for argument that all inventive output is patented, inventions

have no private value unless they are patented, and that the level of R&D is

adjusted until It earns a normal rate of return at the margin.          For the

marginal patent, the ratio of the value of patent rights (discounted at the

cost of capital) to R&D would equal unity —   i.e.,   a 100 percent subsidy rate

since patent protection is the only source of returns to invention. In fact


                                        17
 the equivalent subsidy rate will be less than unity, because some inventions

are not patented and those that are retain private value even without patent

protection. As such, the equivalent subsidy rate is a summary index of the

"importance" of patent protection, Of course, the equivalent subsidy rate

computed for an entire cohort of patents will be an upper bound to the

marginal subsidy conferred by patent protection, if there are diminishing

returns to R&D.

      The total value of patent rights is obtained by multiplying the

estimates of mean value from table 4 by the number of patent applications.

To construct the measure of R&D, one requires a concordance between the

industrial classification of available R&D data and the technology

classification of patents, and a procedure to apportion the R&D performed by

each country of origin to the patents it holds in France (see Appendix 2 for

details). The 1970 data on R&D are used since the lag between R&D and patent

applications is very short (Fakes and Schankerman 1984; Hall, Criliches and

Hausman 1986).    Computations are done for company—funded and total R&D

performed by business enterprises.

      Table S summarises the results. The estimated subsidy rate to total R&D

is 15.6 percent, and 24.2 percent for company—funded R&D (averaged over

technology fields).'617   Hence patent protection generates perhaps as much

as a quarter of the private returns to inventive activity. Of course, this

means at least 75 percent of the private returns to invention are obtained

from sources other than patents. This finding is consistent with qualitative

survey evidence that firms rely on many methods to appropriate the rents from

invention (for example, see Levin et.al. 1987). The size of the (average)

equivalent subsidy rate is also consistent with quantitative survey evidence

of specific inventions, Mansfield et.al. (1981) report that patent protection

raises imitation costs by about 11 percent (median estimate).           In a


                                     18
competitive R&D market without patent protection, these costs would be

dissipated through additional imitation. With patent protection, these costs

presumably accrue to the patentee and hence represent the value of the patent

right. Therefore, the average subsidy rate obtained from the patent renewal

model should be similar to the increase in the costs of imitation, and it is

(15 versus 11 percent).

        The importance of patent protection as a source of returns to R&D varies

widely across technology fields. The equivalent subsidy rate varies from 4.0

percent in pharmaceuticals to 21.4 percent in electronics (using total R&D).

These variations are due to differences in the mean value of patent rights

(since there is little variation in the ratios of the number of patents to R&D

— see   rows 3 and 4). On this measure, the patent system appears most effective

in the mechanical and electronics technology groups, and least effective in

pharmaceuticals and chemicals.

        This ranking is sharply at odds with the conventional wisdom that patent

protection is important for pharmaceuticals and chemicals but not for the

mechanical and electronics sectors. All available survey evidence points to

this conclusion (for example Taylor and Silberston 1973; Mansfield et.al.

1981; Levin et.al. 1987). How can one reconcile the rankings based on survey

evidence with those derived from the patent renewal model? The main sector

requiring explanation is pharmaceuticals, since survey evidence indicates that

patents raise imitation costs for drugs by 30—40 percent (Mansfield et.al.

1981; Levin et.al. 1987).      The equivalent subsidy rates for mechanical and

electronics patents (13.9 and 21.4 percent) are actually not that different

from estimates of the increase in imitation costs due to patents in these

sectors (7—15 percent).

   The main explanation for pharmaceuticals lies in the institutional

context. There has been strict price regulation of patented pharmaceutical


                                        19
 products in France since 1945.         Every patentee (regardless of country of

 origin) must obtain governmental authorisation to market any pharmaceutical

 invention.       For ethical drugs the authorisation involves agreement on an

 administered price which applies to all reimbursed purchases in the private

 and public sectors.18         For "parapharmaceuticals" the regulation is less
 formal —   the   authorities fix "recommended prices" for manufacturers which are

normally respected. This governmental price regulation would certainly be

expected to reduce the private value of patent rights for pharmaceutical

patents. This reduction in mean value occurs for two reasons.           The whole

distribution of the value of patent rights will be shifted to the left since

price regulation applies to all pharmaceutical patents.          Price regulation

should also reduce the skewness of the distribution of appropriable returns,

since huge rents on important products would presumably be disallowed.       This

further reduces the mean value of patent rights.        In the extreme case where

price regulation allows for only a normal return to R&D costs, patent

protection would be worthless and the equivalent subsidy rate would fall to

zero. Effective price regulation may be an important determinant of the low

equivalent subsidy rate for pharmaceuticals.

     There is a second explanation also due to price regulation.              The

procedure to compute the R&D costs for pharmaceutical patents held in France

may overstate the true costs, and hence understate the true subsidy rate. R&D

for each country of origin is allocated to its patents held in France in

proportion to the ratio of its exports (to France) to total sales.           This

corresponds to the profit maximising allocation of common R&D costs for a

monopolist (patentee) selling in a number of markets with the same price

elasticity.       However, price regulation in France raises the effective price

elasticity facing the patentee and lowers the profit maximising allocation of

R&D to the French market. While some form of pharmaceutical price regulation


                                         20
for pharmaceuticals exists in a number of countries, it is effectively absent

in the largest market, the United States.

        It is not possible to assess the quantitative importance of these two

factors without more information on the demand structure and regulatory price

determination.        But they underscore the important point that the

effectiveness of patent protection depends on the broader institutional

setting, including other forms of regulation impinging on an industry.



3.4 Patent Counts and Mean Value

        It is common practice to use the number of patents as an indicator of

patented (more broadly, inventive) output.     The validity of this practice

depends on whether the mean value of patents varies over time, and whether

those changes are correlated with movements in patent counts. The value of

patents themselves cannot be measured directly, but there is good reason to

expect that the value of patent rights would be correlated with it.       This

section sununarises movements in the mean value of patent rights over time for

each technology field, and characterises the relationship between the quantity

and uqualityu of patents.

         Figures 7—10 present indices of the number of patent applications,

mean value and total value of patent rights for each technology field

(normalised in 1969).'° There are two distinct subperiods 1969—1976 and 1977—

1981.     During the first period the number of patent applications declines

about fifteen percent in each technology field, except pharmaceuticals where

it rises by about the same amount. The mean value of patent rights shows a

modest decline, except for the cohorts immediately after the major oil shock

(1973 and 1974) where it falls sharply in each technology field.

         The number of patent applications in France fell sharply during the

second period, by about ninety percent in pharmaceuticals and fifty percent


                                      21
 in the other technology fields. These declines had little to do with a fall

 in real inventive output, however, reflecting instead the introduction of the

 European Patent Convention in 1978. The European patent conferred protection

 for an invention in multiple designated member countries, the application fee

 depending on the number of countries specified by the patentee. The effect

was to reduce the cost of multiple applications for the same patent. The data

set used in this paper contains French national patents but excludes European

patents with France as a designated state. Hence, any self—selection into

European patents would register as a decline in the number of patent

applications in France. The evidence in the figures indicates that a process

of self—selection is at work. The sharp break in the path of patent

applications occurs in 1977, just when the European Patent Convention became

effective. The drop is especially severe in pharmaceuticals and chemicals,

but even in the mechanical and electronic technology groups there is evidence

of an accelerated decline at that time.2°

        It has been argued in the literature on intellectual property that

patents taken out in multiple countries are more likely to be higher value

patents (Soete and Wyatt 1983; Basberg 1983).      Since the European patent

economises on multiple applications, the introduction of this option should

have lowered the mean value of national patents applied for in France. In

fact the opposite occurred. There is a sharp increase in the mean value of

patent rights in each technology field which occurs quite abruptly in 1977,

though in pharmaceuticals and chemicals there is some more gradual increase

beginning in 1975. This striking negative covariance between movements in

patent counts and mean value, and their timing, strongly suggest that the

process of self—selection into European Patents is not random with respect to

the value of patents.      The evidence supports the hypothesis that the

relatively low valued patents were taken out as European Patents.


                                     22
Section 4.         EnMrical Results by Technology Field and Country of Origin



4.1         Estimates of the Patent Renewal Model



          The nonparametric tests reported in Section 1 indicated that there are

variations in the value distributions both across technology fields and

countries of origin.          This section presents results from a parametric

specification of the patent renewal model that incorporates differences across

countries of origin as well as technology fields. There are two reasons to

conduct this analysis. The first is to check whether allowing for differences

across countries of origin changes the basic empirical characterisation of

technology groups presented in Section 3.           The second is to measure the

differences across countries of origin in the mean value of patent rights and

to explore the determinants of those differences.

          The specification used in this section allows for a completely

unrestricted sequence (Pc)-1 for each country of origin, but imposes the same

value of a and iS. This is equivalent to allowing for a proportional rescaling

of initial revenues of all patents (for a given cohort) in different countries

of origin.         The specification permits the time path of mean values over

cohorts to differ for each country of origin but imposes a common coefficient

of variation.

          Table 6 presents the empirical results (for brevity, the estimate of p

for   the 1970 cohort is reported) for the model with oil shocks, but the

conclusions also hold for the baseline model. The estimates of p do vary

across countries of origin. The restriction that there are no differences,

      —   /4 for   all i, is decisively rejected for each technology group. The

computed F(52,S85) statistics are all larger than twenty (see test Tl),

compared to a criticial value at the 0.05 level of 1.4. Nonetheless, the


                                         23
 estimates of the other parameters (a, 6, 6 and 680) are very close to the

 constrained estimates presented in Section 3.1.     The point that should be

 emphasised is that the empirical characterisation of different technology

 fields in terms of mean value, dispersion, skewness, and decay rates does not

 depend on whether one allows for variations across countries of origin. Since

 the parameters a and 6 do not vary within a given technology group, the

 ranking of countries of origin in terms of mean value is given by the ranking

 in terms of p. For each country of origin the estimates of p in Table 6 imply

 the same ranking of technology groups in terms of the mean value as the one

obtained from the constrained specification in Section 3.1 —     in   descending
order, electronics, mechanical, chemicals and pharmaceuticals.

     Test T2 examines the hypothesis that the differences across countries of

origin in the mean value of patent rights are stable over time.            This

hypothesis implies the parameter restriction p —    p — jk•2' The computed
F(48,585) statistic is less than two in the chemicals, mechanical and

electronics technology groups and about five in pharmaceuticals, compared to

a critical value at the 0.05 level of about 1.4. Hence the time paths of mean

value do differ across countries of origin, but the evidence is strong only

for pharmaceuticals.

     The parameter estimates in Table 6 are used to produce (by simulation)

the entire time paths of mean values for each technology field and country of

origin. To summarise this information, Table 7 presents index numbers for the

mean value of patent rights for the 1970—72 and 1979—81 cohorts (normalised

by the United States). The table reveals a systematic ranking of countries

of origin in terms of mean value. The typical ranking in descending order is

Japan, France, the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom.           The

dominance of patents of Japanese origin in the mechanical and electronics

technology fields is particularly striking. It is interesting to note that


                                     24
the ranking in terms of mean value is the same as the ranking of patent

renewal curves (see Figures 3—6).

      These variations in mean value, however, do not necessarily reflect

differences in the underlying quality of patented inventions produced by the

various countries of origin. There is some selection process that determines

which patents are applied for in France, so the mean value of the observed

sample of patents from each country of origin can differ from the

unconditional mean. Presumably foreign applicants are more self—selective

than domestic ones. The table shows, however, that (apart from Japan) the

mean value of French patents is generally higher than for foreign applicants.

This suggests that at least part of the strength of Japanese patents is real,

not simply an artifact of selection. Without modelling the selection rule,

it is not possible to quantify this effect.



4.2     Exploring Variations in Rean Value



      This section presents some evidence on the determinants of the variations

over time and across countries of origin in the mean value of patent rights.

It was shown that the fraction of patents granted declines sharply over the

sample period and differs systematically among countries of origin (within a

given technology group). Since the sample used for the empirical work is

designed to exclude "involuntary attrition", variations in the grant rate

should affect the mean value of patents that are eventually granted.        The

first hypothesis is that variations over time in the grant rate reflect

changes in the stringency of the patent screening process and that stringent

screening weeds cut the low value patents.22       This hypothesis implies a

negative correlation across cohorts between mean value and grant rate, for a

given technology group and country of origin.23         The second hypothesis


                                      25
concerns the comparison across countries of origin, given the cohort and

technology group.     It is reasonable to assume that the patent screening

criteria do not depend on which country is applying for the patent. Hence,

differences across countries of origin in the grant rate will reflect

differences in the distribution of the value of patent rights and should be

positively correlated with mean value. The third hypothesis is that there is

a negative correlation across cohorts between the number of patent

applications and mean value, holding grant rates constant. Such correlation

could be the result of self—selection of lower value patents into the European

patent after 1978, but it could also arise from an underlying tradeoff between

quantity and quality of patents in the search process generating inventive

output.24 These three hypotheses are tested here in the context of reduced

form relationships and no structural interpretation should be given to the

parameters.

     The following specification is used


              in    = a0   •   a1 10ijc6.5c + a2 0.jc°.j. + a3 ln   +            (8)



where V, 0 and A denote mean value, grant rate and the number of patent

applications, respectively. The subscripts i, j and c denote the country of

origin, technology field and cohort, respectively, and a dot denotes an

average. The disturbance 6jjc        is   assumed to be independently and identically

distributed. The hypotheses imply a1 > 0, a2 C 0, and a3 'C 0. The estimates

of the mean value are taken from the model with oil shocks (Table 6).

Equation (8) is estimated by ordinary least squares for each technology field

separately and pooled (including intercepts for each technology field).

     Table B presents the results.                All three hypotheses are strongly

supported by the evidence in each technology field, and together they account

for between a third and half of the variation in mean value. The estimate of

                                             26
1 confirms that, given the cohort, countries of origin with higher grant

rates have larger mean value and the effect is large, The estimate of 02

indicates that, given the country of origin, higher grant rates for a cohort

are associated with lower mean value, with a semi—elasticity of about (minus)

unity. The estimate of a3 confirms that there is an inverse relation between

mean value and the number of patent applications, with an elasticity of about

—0.15. The parameters are estimated quite precisely, and their similarity

across technology fields is striking.      The null hypothesis of homogeneity

across technology fields is not rejected —    the   F(9,240) statistic is 1.57,

compared to a critical value at the 0.05 level of 1.92.

     This evidence indicates that the patent screening process is not random

(in relation to value of patent rights), and suggests that data on grant rates

may be a useful supplementary indicator of the mean value of patents. It is

important in this context, however, to distinguish between variations over

time and differences across countries of origin in the grant rate.



Concluding Remarks

       This study provides econometric evidence on the private value of

patent rights for different technology fields and countries of origin. The

findings are derived from parametric estimation of a model of patent renewal,

applied to data on patents held in France during the period 1969—1987. The

main empirical findings can be summarised as follows. The distribution of the

private value of patent rights is sharply skewed in all technology fields,

confirming previous research using aggregate data (Schankerman and Pakes

1986). Most of the value of patent rights is accounted for by highly valuable

patents in the tail of the distribution. There are sharp differences across

technology groups, however, which fall rather neatly into two categories. The

value distributions for pharmaceuticals and chemicals are characterised by a


                                      27
low mean, less dispersion and skewness, and slow rates of depreciation.

Patents in the mechanical and electronic fields exhibit larger mean value,

greater dispersion and skewness, and faster depreciation. The property rights

generated by the patent system confer sizeable economic rents on patentees.

On the average these rents are equivalent to subsidy rate to R&D of about

15 percent. Hence patent protection is a significant source of returns to

inventive effort, but it does not appear to be the major one. This confirms

survey evidence that firms rely on a variety of mechanisms other than patents

to protect inventions. The importance of patent protection varies sharply

across technology fields, equivalent to a subsidy to R&D of 5—10 percent in

pharmaceuticals and chemicals but 15—20 percent for mechanical and electronics

patents. The surprising unimportance of patent protection in pharmaceuticals

is ascribed to effective price regulation of ethical drugs in France and hence

may not generalise to other countries.

       There were substantial movements over time in the mean value of patent

rights and the number of patent applications in each technology field. An

abrupt decline occurred in patent counts and a closely timed rise in the mean

value of patent rights during the late 1970s. These changes were due mainly

to systematic self—selection of low valued patent applications into European

Patents, but more effective screening by the French Patent Office also

contributed to the increase in mean value. The two oil price shocks in 1974

and 1980 had large negative impacts on the private value of patent rights, on

the same order of magnitude as the decline in the value of firms registered

in the stock market.

       There are systematic differences across countries of origin in the

mean value of patent rights. Japan and France have the largest mean value in

each technology field, followed by the United States, Germany and the United

Kingdom. Patents originating in Japan are substantially more valuable than


                                      28
for other countries and the difference is most striking for electronics

patents. It was not possible with the available data to determine how much

of these variations in mean value is due to differences in the quality of the

inventions and to self—selection in the application process. Variations in

the mean value of patent rights are correlated with patent grant rates across

countries of origin and over time.     This finding suggests that the patent

screening process is not random and that patent grant rates may be a useful

supplementary indicator of the value of patents.

       In terms of future research in this area, the most important task is

to conduct empirical studies of disaggregated patent renewal data for other

countries. tThe key question is whether the rankings of technology fields and

countries of origin found in this paper are confirmed in other national

markets, If so, such evidence would demonstrate the usefulness of patent

renewal data and establish empirical regularities relevant to economic policy.

If not, the task will be to identify the economic factors (including

institutional considerations) that account for variations across national

markets.

[1)    The renewal fee schedule was changed almost annually —   in   1968, 1970,

       1972, 1974—1975, 1977—1981 and 1981—1987. Nominal fees are converted

       to real terms using the CDP deflator for France. The schedules of

       renewal fees (in real terms) are quite similar across cohorts.

       Analysis of variance reveals that the between—cohort dimension

       accounts for only about 20 percent of the total variance, the

       remaining 80 percent being between—age (within—cohort) variance.

[2]    Some additional nonparametric tests are summarised here (details of

       test statistics are omitted for brevity).      First, ifpatents of

      Japaness origin are excluded, the hypothesis that the value

      distributions are the same across the remaining four countries of

      origin is rejected in all technology fields except electronics. This

      indicates that Japan is an outlier in the electronics field (see also

      the parametric estimates of mean value in Section 4).          Second, the

      tests in Table 2 were conducted using a finer disaggregation of

      technology fields, viz., the fifteen groups comprising the four broad

      technology fields used in this paper.         Not surprisingly, the

      hypothesis that the value distributions are the same across these

      fifteen technology fields is rejected for each of the five countries


                                    30
      of origin. The hypothesis that the distributions are the same across

      countries of origin is rejected in 12 of the 15 technology fields (11

      of 15 If Japan is excluded). Hence, some of the observed differences

      across countries of origin may be due to the fact that countries

      specialise in different technology fields but the available

      disaggregation in the data is not fine enough to capture it. These

      nonparametric findings are generally consistent with those of Pakes

      and Simpson (1989) using Scandinavian data.

[3)   Strictly speaking, under the stated conditions a higher mean value

      would not ensure that the grant proportion would be larger. It would

      be guaranteed if the distribution of the value of patent rights for

      that country of origin stochastically dominates.

[43   The condition that the sequence (R.C—C.C) is non—increasing in age is

      sufficient but not necessary for the renewal rule in (2) to hold. It

      needs only to hold in the neighbourhood of the optimal cancellation

      age.    Specifically, there must exist a T for which Ra,C.C > 0 for aCT

      and         C 0 for OT, where T is the last age at which the patentee

      pays the renewal fee.     The net revenues R—C may be increasing in

      some interval before T.

[5]   1 experimented with the Pareto, Weibull, and lognormal distributions.

      The comparison is based on two different measures of statistical fit

      suggested by Amemiya (1981): 1. the sum of squared differences between

      P and       where P.C is the estimate of P0 implied by the parameters

      of the model, and 2. the weighted sum of squared differences between

      P• and       using as weights the binomial sampling variance of P,

      around its true value, P.(l—P.)/& where A is the number of patents

      in cohort a.     The comparison is made for each technology group

      separately (pooling across countries of origin). using a specification


                                     31
      that allows for the mean value of patent rights to differ across

      cohorts (maintaining the same coefficient of variation) and for a

      constant decay rate. The lognormal fits better than the Weibull in

      all four technology groups according to both fit criteria. In most

      cases the lognormal also fits better than the Pareto. In those cases

      where the Pareto is marginally superior, the parameter estimates for

      the Pareto are not economically sensible (they imply that the renewal

      rate rises with renewal fees and that the depreciation rate is

      negative).

16)   For the lognormal distribution, the median, mean and coefficient of

      variation of initial revenues are given by exp(p2), exp(p+½ g2)              and

      (exp(a2)—l)'. See Johnson and Kotz (1971).

[7)   Two   remarks     are in order.     First, the patents studied here provide

      legal protection only for sales made in France (whether domestic

      production or imports).           This applies to all countries of origin,

      including France.            In this context, the assumption that the decay

      rate is the same for all countries of origin within a given technology

      group does not seem severe.                   Second, I also experiment with

      specifications that allow the effect of the oil price shocks on the

      decay rate to persist for several years.             See note 12.

[8]   Because the model in (6) is nonlinear in P, allowance for the

      sampling error requires linear approximation to yield a tractable

      form. The true dependent variable is y —              'r1(1—P$.     The observed

      renewal proportion is P1, —               +    where v. is a binomial sampling

      error with zero mean and variance P(l—P.3/A. Substituting into y

      and taking a linear approximation to the nonlinear function ',               Yet

       squares.     Then       is regressed against a constant and F.(l—P.0)/A

       using ordinary least squares and the fitted value is retrieved, F..

        The model is then re—estimated using F" to perform generalised

       nonlinear least squares.

[l0}   The data set does not contain the number of patent applications

       rejected each year for a given cohort, so it is not possible to remove

       patent   rejections from the raw data.           Hence some of the observed
       attrition of   patents reflects involuntary dropouts due to the granting

       procedure, but these nonrenewals are not explained by the model of

       patent renewal and should be purged.             Schankerman (1990) presents

       evidence that the effect of patent rejections is minimal after age

       three, so estimation of the patent renewal model is conducted on the

       sample of patents that survive to age three.              Renewal rates are

       normalised by the fraction of patents that renew at age three for the

       associated cohort (that is,                   This procedure should also take

       care of the learning effects in the patent renewal decision,

       documented by Fakes (1986). Fakes shows that patentees learn about

       the sequence of returns at early ages and hence do not behave

       according to the simple renewal rule in equation (2), but these

       learning effects are completed within three to four years.

(11]   The point estimates of the parameters are not consistent with the

       stochastic dominance of the distribution of the initial returns for

       any technology group.      For the lognormal, the a—quantile of revenues,


                                          33
       R, is given by exp(p+U a) where Ua is the a—quantile of the standard

       normal distribution.          The ratio for two different groups k and 1 is

               — expQLk—,Lf+U(ak—aI)).       For stochastic dominance of group k and

       .1, this ratio must exceed unity for all a C           (0,1).    It is easily

       verified that the necessary and sufficient conditions for this to hold

       are      >     and 0k — a9.

[12)   The specification reported in the text forces the oil price shock to
       affect only the current decay rate, so the downward revaluation of the
       value of patents occurs fully during the year of the shock.           In order
       to   check whether the large estimated effect is due to this restrictive
       assumption,    I estimated a    version of the model that permits the effect
       of    the oil shocks to persist for three years —         i.e., incorporating
       separate     decay rates for each year during 1974—1976 and 1980—1982.

       A comparison is made between the cumulative depreciation         during those
       three   year periods implied by this extended model with that implied by

       the estimates reported in the text.              The parameters in the more

       flexible version imply an even larger (long run) reduction in the flow

       of returns to patents (in some cases by as much as 50 percent larger),

       so the conclusion stated in the text is conservative.               Second, a

       model with a completely free sequence of decay rates for different

       years was also estimated.           It provides evidence of jumps in the decay

       rate after the two oil price shocks, but the individual estimates are

       very imprecise.

[13]   While the distribution of R0 is lognormal, the distribution of V is

       not since lognormality is only preserved under multiplication of

       random variables. The procedure to generate quantiles is based on

       drawing 50,000 random numbers from a lognormal distribution

       parameterised by t and         a.     For each draw, the estimate of 6 and


                                             36
       observed renewal fees are used to compute the optimal expiration date

       according to the renewal rule (equation (4) in Section 3.1), and the

       associated net value of patent rights for that draw is generated.       In

       this way the entire distribution of the value of patent rights is

       simulated. Simulations based on perturbations of p, a and 8 are used

       to compute numerical derivatives of the quantiles with respect to

       parameters and standard errors for the quantiles are constructed by

       the delta method. The generalisation for the model with year—specific

       decay rates 874 and         is   straightforward.

[14]   The fraction of total value in the top percentile of patents is given

       by ó.I V99/V where V99 denotes the value for the top percentile and

       V is the mean value for all patents in the cohort.              This is a

       conservative estimate since it assigns the lower bound value Vgg to

       all patents in the top percentile.            For the top five percent of

       patents, the figure is computed using values for the 0.95, 0.975 (not

       reported in the table) and 0.99 quantiles as follows:         (0.025 V95 +

       0.015   V975 + 0.01 V.99.        The specific estimates in percentage terms

       for the top one (five) percent of patents are 12 (34) in
       pharmaceuticals, 14 (38) in chemicals, 21 (50) for mechanical, and 24

       (55) for electronics excluding Japan.               Inclusion of Japan in

       electronics raises the figure by about five percentage points.         The

       estimates based on the model without oil shocks are almost identical.

[15)   As noted in Section 1, the grant rate is much larger for
       pharmaceuticals and chemicals than for the other technology fields,

       for each country of         origin.      The conventional wisdom is   that
       inventions in these technologies are more "patentable" because of the

       nature of patent law.        An alternative explanation is that patent

       examiners screen patents according to some fixed cutoff (defined in


                                           35
       terms of "inventive step") which is correlated with patent values, and

       that the distributions of patent values in pharmaceuticals and

       chemicals stochastically dominate those in the other fields. However,

       the estimates of mean values in Table 4 are not consistent with this

       second explanation (see also footnote 11).                     Hence the evidence

       suggests, albeit indirectly, that differences in grant rates do

       reflect a systematic bias in patent law that favors "patentability" of

       inventions in pharmaceuticals and chemicals.

(161   The subsidy rates reported in the text are based on the mean values

       from the fixed effects model with oil shocks (Table 4). If the model

       without oil shocks is used, the subsidy rate for company—funded R&D

       (total R&D) varies from 3,4 (3.3) percent in pharmaceuticals to 24.8

       (15.0) percent in electronics.              The main conclusions in the text are

       unchanged.

[17]   Using aggregate patent renewal data for France, Schankerman and Pakes

       (1986) estimate a subsidy rate on company—funded R&D for the 1970

       cohort of 6.8 percent.            They measure the value of patent rights for

       patents that survive until age five and include returns accruing from

       age five of the patent.            In the present study the parameters of the

       model are estimated using patents that survive until age three, but

       the mean value of patent rights is simulated using these parameters to

       characterise the entire population of patents and to include all

       returns from the date of application.                To make them comparable, the

       subsidy rate reported here must be multiplied by I               (l—6)/(l+i)i   P5,

       where P5 is the proportion of patents that survive until age five.

       Using 6 —   0.1,   i —   0.1   and P5 —   0.7   (sample mean), the average subsidy

       rate for company—funded R&D reported in the text translates to 6.2

       percent.


                                             36
(18]   The specific guidelines for setting prices have changed over time.

       Prior to 1972, prices were set to compensate the patentee for the

       basic raw materials and capital investment, plus some allowance for a

       "profit margin".   Since 1972 prices are set more informally, with no

       explicit allowance either forproduction or R&D costs, but economising

       on health costs is an officially stated objective.       I would like to

       thank Ms Virgine Perotin of the Centre d'Etude des Revenu et des Couts

       (CERC) in Paris for helpful discussions of pharmaceutical regulation

       in France.

(191   The mean values for each cohort are based on the parameter estimates

       frm the   fixed effects model with oil shocks. The time paths of mean

       and total value are similar for the model without oil shocks, except

       that the declines in mean value for cohorts 1973—1975 are less sharp.

       The electronics sector includes patents originating in Japan1 but this

       does not affect the time path.

(20]   To measure how much of the overall decline in patent applications is

       due to the European patent, I computed (using other data sources) for

       each technology group the total number of patent applications

       applicable to France in 1982, including both national patents and

       European patents with France as a designated country. The results

       show that all of the decline in Figures 7—10 is due to self—selection

       into European patents, except in pharmaceuticals where about a quarter

       of the decline can be explained in this way. See Schankerman (1990)

       for details.

(21]   The logarithm of the mean level of initial returns for country of

                                        for                       +         The

                                                                            r

       time paths for countries .1 and k are the same if and only if r —

       is independent of a.   This is the condition given in the text.


                                     37
[22]   It is not necessary that patent examiners themselves screen

       systematically according to patent values.           Even if they randomly

       reject some fraction of applications, self—selection by potential

       patentees on the basis of expected profitability of patenting

       (including the probability of rejection) would generate the same

       result.

[23]   One alternative hypothesis is that variations in the grant proportion

       are due to differences across cohorts in the underlying distribution

       of the value of patent applications, in which case the expected

       correlation would be positive.        It should also be recalled that grant

       fractions are defined here as the percentage of applications of a

       given cohort that are eventually granted (not those granted in a

       particular year). so that granting lags do not directly affect these

       grant fractions or their relationship to mean value.

[24]   The first evidence of an inverse relationship between patent counts

       and mean value (neglecting grant fractions) was reported in
       Schankerman and Pakes (1986).              For more discussion of the
       interpretation of this finding, see ?akes and Simpson (1989).

Notes.     The top figure in each cell refers to the average for the
           1970—1972 cohorts, the lower figure for the 1979—1981 cohorts.
           To minimise truncation bias for later cohorts, the number of
           grants in the last available year must be less than five percent
           of cumulated grants from that cohort (this required deleting
           cohorts after 1982).

Notes,

       Figures refer to the private value of patent rights (in 1980 U.S.
       dollars), measured from date of patent application.    They are
       simulated using parameter estimates for the lognormal patent renewal
       model with fixed cohort effects and constant decay rate in Table 3.
       The discount rate is set at 0.10. Estimated standard errors in
       parentheses are computed by the delta method.

Notes.

      All estimates are from the lognormal patent renewal model, allowing
      for binomial sampling error and constant variance renewal error.    The
      model allows for a full set of cohort/country of origin interactions
      for it and year effects in 6 for 1974 and 1980. Estimated standard
      errors are in parentheses.

Notes.

       These index numbers are computed from simulated mean values based on
       the parameter estimates presented in Table 6. Mean values are
       averaged for the 1970—72 and 1979—81 cohorts to remove transitory
       variations.
