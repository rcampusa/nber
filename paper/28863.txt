Does Pain Lead to Job Loss? A Panel Study for Germany

                                         ABSTRACT

The cross-sectional association between pain and unemployment is well-established. But the
absence of panel data containing data on pain and labor market status has meant less is known
about the direction of any causal linkage. Those longitudinal studies that do examine the link
between pain and subsequent labor market transitions suggest results are sensitive to the
measurement of pain and model specification. We contribute to this literature using large-
scale panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) for the period 2002 to
2018. We show that pain leads to job loss. Workers suffering pain are more likely than others to
leave their job for unemployment or economic inactivity. This probability rises with the
frequency of the pain suffered in the previous month. The effect persists having accounted for
fixed unobserved differences across workers, is apparent among those who otherwise report
good general health and is robust to the inclusion of controls for mental health, life
satisfaction and the employee's occupation.

1. Introduction
It is well-known that job loss negatively affects subjective wellbeing. It lowers life
satisfaction beyond what could be expected purely from the income loss (Winkelmann and
Winkelmann, 1998), and it has a long-term scarring effect on psychological wellbeing
(Clark et al., 2001). Whereas people become habituated to most life events such as
marriage, divorce, widowhood and the birth of a child, such that wellbeing returns to its
baseline level, there is little evidence of adaptation to unemployment until one gets back
into work (Clark et al., 2008). Job loss also results in deteriorating physical health, resulting
in an increased number of visits to physicians, taking more medication and spending more
time in bed sick than employed individuals (Linn et al., 1985). Job loss also leads to
physiological dysregulation, as indicated in biomarkers post layoff (Michaud et al., 2016).

However, recent research indicates that the links between health and job loss are bi-
directional. For example, Andreeva et al. (2015) find that, while layoff increases mental
health problems, those with pre-existing depression have a higher likelihood of job
displacement. Similarly, Clark and Lepinteur (2019) find that, whilst unemployment early
in life impacts life satisfaction at age 30, one's emotional health in childhood protects
adults from unemployment at age 30. Böckerman and Illmakunnas (2009) also find those
with poor self-assessed health have higher probabilities of subsequent unemployment. As
they put it: "persons who have poor health are being selected for the pool of the
unemployed" (2009: 161).

A related literature points to a strong correlation between being out of the labor force and
the experience of physical pain. For instance, Krueger (2017) finds pain incidence in the
United States is twice as high among men not in the labor force (NILF) compared with
men in the labor force including the employed and unemployed. There is a similar, though
slightly smaller differential, among women. Using Gallup Daily Tracker data for the
United States over the period 2010-2017 Blanchflower and Bryson (2021) show the
unemployed suffer greater pain than the employed across the life-course, with pain
incidence being highest among the NILF from age 30 onwards. They find that in the rest
of the OECD pain incidence is higher among non-workers than workers from one's mid-
30s.

Despite the literature showing poor health can raise subsequent unemployment
probabilities, and the recent studies finding a correlation between pain and joblessness,
studies examining the potential impact of pain on subsequent joblessness are scarce. We
contribute to this literature by analyzing data for Germany. First, we present cross-
sectional evidence to show that the incidence of pain reported by Germans places them in
the middle ranks of the pain expressed across countries. Then we analyze panel data from
the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) for the period 2002 to 2018. We find pain
leads to job loss. Workers suffering pain are more likely than others to leave their job for
unemployment or economic inactivity. This probability rises with the frequency of the
pain suffered in the previous month. Those reporting suffering pain `always' over the
course of a month are 4-5 percentage points more likely than those suffering no pain to be
found unemployed or economically inactive a year later. The effect persists having
accounted for fixed unobserved differences across workers. It is also apparent among those
                                               2
who otherwise report good general health and is robust to the inclusion of controls for
mental health, life satisfaction and the employee's occupation. Furthermore, the
relationship between physical pain and subsequent job loss is stronger among workers who
are underemployed, that is, those who work substantially fewer hours than they wish to.
The effect size is more than double that found for people who work closer to their desired
hours.
The remainder of the paper is set out as follows. Section Two reviews the existing
literature, focusing on studies examining links between pain and labor market transitions.
Section Three presents our data and approach to estimation. Section Four presents our
results and Section Five concludes.

2. Literature
The recent literature indicates a strong association between physical pain and joblessness:
the unemployed and those who are not in the labor force (NILF) report a higher incidence
of pain than those in employment, both in the United States and across the rest of the OECD
(Blanchflower and Bryson, 2021). In a cross-sectional study of patients with chronic pain
in Quebec four pain diagnoses (musculoskeletal, myofascial, neuropathic and visceral)
were all correlated with unemployment, as was pain intensity (Giladi et al, 2015). 1 The
issue is particularly salient in the United States where those who suffer physical pain have
poorer quality of life than others and are more likely to face deaths of despair (Case and
Deaton, 2015, 2017, 2020). Atlas and Skinner (2010) note that pain is much greater among
low education and income groups in the United States. However, despite the potential
bidirectional association between pain and joblessness, there is little evidence as to the
effect of pain on subsequent unemployment. As Giladi et al. (2015: 655) state: "the
direction of association between chronic pain...and unemployment cannot be determined
from [cross-sectional] data.... Future research using longitudinal designs is needed to
determine the nature of the relationship between pain....and unemployment status".

High levels of pain have been linked to increased opioid use in the United States (Krueger,
2017). If successful at alleviating pain, opioid use might be positively associated with
labor market participation. In fact, the opposite is the case: county-level opioid prescription
rates are causally linked to lower employment-to-population rates and higher
unemployment rates, perhaps resulting from their narcotic side-effects and high risk of
dependency (Harris et al., 2020). In contrast, Garthwaite (2012) and Bütikofer and Skira
(2018) find Cox-2 inhibitors are positively associated with workplace attendance, but these
are not addictive, suggesting that the alleviation of pain can increase labor supply if
narcotic side-effects are absent. In a similar vein, Watson et al. (2004) have shown that
the alleviation of chronic lower back pain suffered by the unemployed through a pain
management rehabilitation programme can aid their return to work.


1
 Other cross-sectional studies identifying an association between pain, or chronic pain, and unemployment
or joblessness include Johannes et al. (2010) and Landmark et al. (2013). Krueger and Mueller (2012) report
evidence of an association between unemployment and the emotion of being `in pain' in the American Time
Use Survey. Hoang and Knabe (2021) replicate their finding with the ATUS and note that "the unemployed
appear sadder and more in pain than the employed".

                                                    3
As noted in the introduction, some longitudinal studies confirm that unemployment
adversely impacts psychological function. For instance, in a small prospective study, men
who became unemployed made significantly more visits to their physicians, took more
medication, and spent more days, sick in bed than did employed individuals matched on
age and race, even though their diagnoses did not differ, leading the authors to conclude
that "the unemployed [were] becoming more anxious, depressed and concerned with bodily
symptoms than those who continued to work" (Linn et al., 1985: 504).

Conscious of the potential for poor health and unemployment to affect one another over
the life-course, Virtanen et al. (2013) examine health status as a predictor of the occurrence
of unemployment between age 31-42, conditioning on earlier periods of unemployment.
They find that among their small cohort of individuals in Northern Sweden there is health-
related selection into unemployment in early middle-age, irrespective of unemployment
earlier in the life course, including a significant association between musculoskeletal pain
and subsequent prolonged unemployment. However, musculoskeletal pain and the simple
occurrence of unemployment were not statistically significant.

Any effect of pain on labor market transitions is liable to vary with the intensity of the pain
and the duration over which it is felt. In their study based on patients attending pain clinics
in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, Von Korff and Dunn (2008) show that their
Pain Risk Score, based on pain intensity, pain-related activity limitations, depressive
symptoms, number of pain sites and number of pain days was a better predictor of
unemployment or being unable to work six months later than pain days alone.

Perhaps the most robust evidence of a clear link between pain and subsequent
unemployment is the study by Kaspersen et al. (2015), involving a 14-year follow up
examining the impact of health on the subsequent risk of unemployment. Having
conditioned on a very wide range of physical and psychological health problems they find
musculoskeletal pain has an independent effect in raising the time spent in unemployment
over the subsequent 14 years. However, the effect was confined to those reporting three
or more musculoskeletal pain symptoms and, even here, the results were sensitive to model
specification (p. 316). It is possible that some studies with coarser pain metrics might miss
such effects.

The evidence for Germany, which is the setting for our study, largely consists of analyses
of the GSOEP data we use. Results tend to correspond with the evidence we have from
other countries. Entry into unemployment ­ including job loss associated with plant
closures ­ leads to a decline in subjective wellbeing (Kassenboehmer and Haisken-DeNew,
2009; Winkelmann and Winkelmann, 1997). This is even the case among Germans who
suffer unemployment just prior to retirement: involuntary unemployment between the last
job and retirement causes a loss of life satisfaction after retirement which exceeds that
which could be explained by the loss of income due to reduced pensions (Hetschko et al.,
2019).

In his GSOEP study for the period 1991-2008 Schmitz (2011) challenges the idea that there
is a causal link between unemployment and subsequent poor physical health. Using fixed


                                              4
effects panel estimation and plant closures as a source of exogenous variance in
unemployment he finds no negative effect of unemployment on health satisfaction, mental
health (captured by GSOEP's Mental Component Summary Scale (MCS)) or hospital
visits). 2 He concludes that the correlation between ill health and unemployment is driven
by selection of ill individuals into unemployment. But this conclusion is challenged by
Stauder (2019). He also uses fixed effects models to estimate health outcomes of
unemployment in GSOEP, but for the period 2002-2014. He confirms there is selection of
unhealthy people into unemployment, but he also finds physical health deteriorates with
unemployment, but only after some time spent unemployed ­ not around the time of
unemployment entry or shortly afterwards. The Physical Component Summary (PCS)
Scale provided in the GSOEP data that he uses as his dependent variable incorporates
physical pain experienced in the four weeks prior to interview. 3 None of these studies
considered the consequences of pain for subsequent unemployment in Germany.

3. Germany in context
Before presenting our results on the links between pain and later unemployment and
joblessness, it is worth considering the labor market and pain experiences of Germans
during the course of our study, relative to the experience of those in other countries.

Chart 1 indicates that the experience of unemployment was rather different in Germany to
most other countries in the OECD. Prior to the Great Recession of 2008 Germany was
experiencing higher unemployment rates than other OECD countries. It peaked in 2005,
falling rapidly in subsequent years, only ticking up a little during the Great Recession
before continuing its downward trajectory until the COVID-19 Pandemic hit in 2019. Ever
since 2009 Germany's unemployment rate has been considerably lower than the OECD
average, and lower than the rates for the United States and Great Britain. We account for
trends in aggregate German unemployment in our models with the incorporation of GSOEP
wave dummies.

The relative health of the German labor market is also apparent in international
comparisons of employment rates. Table 1 shows in Germany these have risen by 11
percentage points between 2005 and 2019, during which time they rose only 3 percentage
points across the OECD and in the United Kingdom and were static in the United States.
At the beginning of the period employment rates in Germany were 65 percent ­ identical
to the OECD average ­ but by the end of the period they were 8 percentage points higher.

How does Germany compare to other countries in terms of the incidence of pain? Here we
have evidence from three surveys: the International Social Survey Program (ISSP),

2
  An earlier study by Marcus (2013) had come to a different conclusion, finding unemployment after plant
closures was linked to a health deterioration in the unemployed and their spouses.
3
  However, Stauder (2019) finds poorer mental health predicts selection into unemployment but does not
deteriorate with length of time in unemployment. In contrast, Gebel and Voßemer (2014), who also analyse
GSOEP, find mental health deteriorates with unemployment, whereas physical health does not. Stauder
(2019: 71) notes that the difference in results is explained by Gebel and Voßemer's focus on change between
two points in time, with the second time point being shortly after unemployment entry, so their results are
consistent with his own. He says that the same estimation differences also account for the difference between
Schmitz (2011) and his own findings on the links between unemployment and physical health.

Eurobarometer and the Gallup World Survey. Blanchflower and Oswald (2019) examined
data from the 2011 sweep of the International Social Survey program. 4 They didn't report
individual country rankings, but they were as follows where "very often" and "often" were
coded as 1, zero otherwise, ranked from highest to lowest. Those in the United States
report the highest incidence of pain, while Germany ranks 14th from 29 countries. 5

In Eurobarometer data for December 2005 to January 2006 previously analyzed by
Blanchflower (2009) respondents across 31 countries were asked: 'During the past four
weeks how much if at all, has pain interfered with your activities? Extremely, quite a lot,
moderately, a little and not at all?'. We re-examined these data and once again found found
that Germany ranked in the middle of the pack of countries in its reported level of pain. 6

Turning to the Gallup World Poll, Table 2 indicates that 22.5% of Germans said they'd
experienced pain the day before, putting Germany joint 29th (with Norway) out of 37
countries, well behind Chile in first spot where 36.8% of respondents reported pain in the
previous day. So Germany does not seem to be an outlier in pain terms.

In Table 3 we go a step further running pain equations using the Gallup World Poll, first
for all OECD countries pooled (column 1) and then for Germany only (column 2). Those
in pain are those who in response to the question "Did you experience the following
feelings during a lot of the day yesterday...physical pain?" responded "yes". Compared to
those in employment, the unemployed were significantly more likely to experience pain ­
by 4.5 percentage points ­ but the coefficient is half the size in Germany and is not
statistically significant. The jobless (those identified as Out of the Labor Force, or OLF)
also had a higher probability of experiencing pain than the employed, both in the pooled
data (.076 t=43.59) but also in Germany (.05, t=7.59). Having accounted for demographic
characteristics and labor market status, those in Germany were significantly less likely to
report pain in the previous day when compared to the United States reference category (-
.076, t=16.43) ­ 11th lowest among the 36 countries in the study. 7

  We took these data and regressed the pain variable on the full set of country dummies, with lowest ranked
first and the ranking was as follows, noting the ranking was similar when controls for education, gender and
labor force status were added. 1st=Ireland; 2=Netherlands; 3=Denmark; 4=Luxembourg; 5=UK; 6=Spain;

23=Czech Republic; 24=Slovenia; 25=Croatia; 26=Lithuania; 27=Romania; 28=Latvia; 29=Slovakia;
30th=Poland.

  Broadly speaking, the correlates of being in pain are similar in Germany as they are in the pooled country
regression, the exception being self-employment where pain is higher than for the employed in the pooled
country equation but lower in Germany.

                                                     6
The importance of pain for people's welfare and their expectations about the future are
captured in columns 3 and 4 of Table 3 which show for the pooled countries of the OECD
and Germany respectively the association between pain and expectations regarding life
satisfaction in five years. In both equations the experience of physical pain lowers
expectations about future life satisfaction, with the effect being a little larger in Germany
than in the OECD as a whole (-.0876 compared with -.0699). These results are notable
given that they are independent associations having controlled for feels of stress and worry,
health problems and Cantril's Ladder which captures how people currently feel about their
life relative to the best possible life they could have.

4. Data and Estimation
For our investigation of physical pain and subsequent job loss we make use of the GSOEP.
This longitudinal survey is long-running and nationally representative containing much
information pertinent to our study. 8 Information regarding the frequency of physical pain
has been collected since 2002 and thus our study covers the time period between 2002 and
2018. The estimates we present are for individuals aged between 18 and 70 who were in
paid work at the outset: results are similar when we restrict the sample to prime age
workers. 9

4.1: Measures of Unemployment and Joblessness
We estimate models for unemployment, defined as the respondent's main activity being
available for and actively seeking work, and a broader measure of joblessness which
identifies those who do not have paid employment or self-employment, whether they are
available for or seeking work, or not. This wider joblessness metric captures transitions
into joblessness where pain may preclude individuals from being available for or seeking
work. This wider category does not include those who leave the labor market for retirement
or maternity leave.

Shifts from paid work to unemployment or joblessness capture the extensive margin along
which physical pain may affect labor supply. But it is also possible that physical pain will
affect the intensive margin of hours adjustments, just as the literature above indicates it can
affect absence rates. We therefore estimate two sets of additional models. In the first set
we estimate models for all workers where the dependent variable is a dummy variable
capturing a reduction of 10 or more hours in paid employment, and the second set where
the dependent variable captures a change from full-time to part-time employment. Finally,
in a further set of models, we try to identify associations between experiencing pain and
subsequent underemployment where workers are working 5 or more fewer hours than they
would ideally like to be working and compare this to the situation where the amount of
hours worked, is closer to the stated ideal amount.

4.2: Measure of Pain
Cognizant of the finding in the literature that pain outcomes are highly variable across time
(Von Korff and Dunn, 2008) we use the ordinal measurement of time spent in physical

8
 More information about the GSOEP can be found in Goebel et al. (2019).

 They are also robust to confining estimates the employees only having dropped the relatively small number
of self-employed.

                                                    7
pain over a four-week period prior to interview. The pain question is asked every two
years. Respondents identify whether they have suffered any physical pain over that period
and, if so, how often. The five-point ordinal scale runs from 'never' to 'always'. Table 4
indicates the proportions in each category have remained roughly constant over the period,
although there has, in general, been a gradual increase in the proportion reporting pain
often or always, from 10.5% in 2002 to 13.2% in 2018.

4.3: Estimation and Model Specification
We run linear estimation models for the (0,1) outcomes of unemployment, joblessness, and
cuts in hours. Initially we first present raw correlations between the experience of pain and
the outcome of interest, before conditioning on real household income, male, marital status
(5 dummies), education (3 dummies), age, and a full set of region dummies (16 dummies).
All estimates incorporate a full set of dummy variables capturing the survey waves.

OLS estimates, which simply pool the data across individuals, are supplemented by person
fixed effects models which capture the association between pain and subsequent labor
market transitions within person, thus controlling for fixed unobserved differences across
individuals which might otherwise bias our estimates of the association between pain and
subsequent unemployment and joblessness.

We modify our baseline estimates in a number of ways to establish how robust any pain
association might be with subsequent labor market transitions. First, we assess the
persistence of any pain effect over time: it is possible that physical pain may result in a
short-term job exit but does it last into the longer-term? To assess this, we consider whether
physical pain leads to unemployment in both of the two waves subsequent to its reporting,
rather than our baseline of looking at the following year.

Second, it is possible that the experience of pain is simply proxying for poor health in
general. To control for this, we test the sensitivity of results to the incorporation of self-
assessed general health, measured at the same point as the pain variable, to capture the
independent effect of pain over and above general health problems.

Third, in the same spirit, we control for individuals' mental health and their subjective
well-being since it is possible that those who say they are experiencing pain, or frequent
pain, may be individuals who are simply unhappy or experiencing mental health problems
which might be the underlying cause of a move to unemployment or joblessness. If the
pain effects persist having controlled for these potentially confounding time-varying health
measures it provides greater confidence that we are isolating pain-related effects.

Fourth, it is possible that pain is associated with the occupation that the respondent was
performing, and that it is this, rather than the pain itself, that makes an individual
susceptible to unemployment or joblessness. We tackle this potential issue by adding
occupation dummies to our estimates to isolate pain effects conditional on the occupation
an individual performs.




                                              8
Fifth, we run estimates for older and younger workers separately in the expectation that
pain effects may be weaker for younger workers who may be more reliant on their current
jobs for income than older workers, making it harder for them to switch to unemployment,
or reduce their hours, when compared to older workers who may have greater resources to
draw on, or early retirement options or welfare entitlements which are not available to
younger workers.

Finally, we consider whether the relationship between physical pain and subsequent job
loss differs where workers are initially underemployed, that is, those who work
substantially fewer hours than they wish to. We investigate underemployment to inspect
if this has a systematic association with the link between pain and subsequent job loss. In
doing so, we assess this relationship for two subsamples: those who work at least five hours
fewer than what they would like to, the underemployed; and those whose actual working
hours are closer to their desired hours. Relatedly, we report findings regarding how pain is
associated with a subsequent reduction in hours worked for those that stay employed.

Turning to our investigation of the links between pain and job loss in GSOEP, Table 5
examines whether the frequency of pain felt whilst in paid work leads to unemployment.
Those suffering pain, are more likely to become unemployed, with the magnitude of the
effect rising with the frequency with which pain was experienced. In the absence of
controls those who reported always being in pain were 4.5 percentage points more likely
to have become unemployed a year later than those who had been experiencing no pain
(column 1). The size of the effect falls by 1 percentage point with the addition of controls
(column 2), and by a further percentage point when one introduces person fixed effects to
account for potential biases arising from fixed omitted unobserved differences across
workers (columns 3 and 4). But, even in the most stringent estimates in column 4 which
incorporate baseline controls and person fixed effects pain is strongly and significantly
associated with subsequent unemployment.

A very similar story emerges in Table 6 when we examine transitions into joblessness,
whether the person is unemployed or not. The size of the pain coefficients is a little larger
than in Table 5 indicating that the pain experienced takes them out of the labor market,
either through sickness, disability or other circumstances that make them not available for
work.

We also investigate if pain leads to persistent unemployment i.e., if the individual reports
being unemployed in the two years subsequent to when they were in work and reported
their frequency of pain. In comparison to Table 5, the dependent variable for the estimates
of Table 7 equals one if the newly unemployed are unemployed in the subsequent year too.
The lagged pain coefficients in the pooled OLS analysis indicate that pain while in work
leads to persistent unemployment. However, the coefficients for pain fall with the
introduction of person fixed effects and become statistically non-significant.

The link between physical pain and subsequent job loss is maintained when accounting for
various aspects of health and well-being when in employment prior to job loss. For brevity
we report in Table 8 the lagged pain dummy variables obtained via pooled OLS estimation


                                             9
(the equivalent of column 2 in Table 5) when lagged general health, lagged mental health,
and very low life satisfaction is controlled for. These variables, measured when individuals
were in paid work, are themselves predictive of a shift to unemployment but the association
between lagged pain and subsequent unemployment is robust to their inclusion. The results
are also robust to the inclusion of person fixed effects in these models.

Given that occupation may be systematically linked with physical pain, we test the
robustness of our baseline results by controlling for the occupation individuals were
working in in the previous year. Table 9 shows our baseline estimates are robust to this
additional control, although the coefficients are a little smaller than in regressions that don't
account for occupation (Table 5), suggesting there is a link between pain and what people
do at work.

If workers suffer pain, they may be forced to leave work, at least temporarily, because they
are incapacitated. For others the decision may be more marginal and may partly reflect the
costs and benefits of leaving their job. These, in turn, may depend in part on how old you
are. It is possible that younger workers face the greatest life-time penalties from
unemployment if spells unemployed severely affect career progression, whereupon we
may find the effects of pain on unemployment are greater for older workers. To see
whether this is the case Table 10 reports OLS and person fixed effects coefficients for two
subsamples: those aged from 18 to 50; and those aged from 51 to 70. The OLS estimates
do suggest that the association between pain and subsequent unemployment is greater for
older workers (column 2 versus column 1). The pain coefficients in the fixed effects
models suggest a similar picture, though the coefficients for the most intense pain are not
quite statistically significant at conventional levels. 10

Underemployment has been shown to have risen around the world in the years after the
Great Recession including in Germany (Bell and Blanchflower, 2021). Underemployment
in Europe is measured by the extent to which desired and actual hours differ, or by some
measure referring to part-time workers who can't find full-time jobs. 11 Finally, then, we
consider whether those who are initially underemployed are affected differently by pain.
Columns 1 and 2 in Table 11 demonstrate that among individuals who are underemployed,
in the sense that they are working at least 5 fewer hours than they would like, those `always'
feeling pain are 6-9 percent more likely to subsequently experience job loss than those in
a similar situation reporting no pain. This contrasts with those who work within five hours
of their desired working hours, where this percentage is about 3 percent (columns 3 and 4).

While not the focus of our investigation, subsequent job loss, we have also found that
physical pain, in the situation where an individual remains in employment, predicts
changes in work hours. Importantly, full-time workers reporting frequent pain are more
likely to become part-time employees than those reporting less pain. Similarly, workers

10
   In both cases the p-value is less than 0.15.
11
   Such hours-based measures are not available for the United States. The measure of underemployment that
is available is based upon those who report that they are part-time for economic reasons (PTFER). Bell and
Blanchflower (2021) use this to construct a variable U7 which simply divides PTFER by employment. They
show that empirically this explains slow wage growth post 2008 while the unemployment rate plays no role.

                                                   10
reporting frequent physical pain are more likely to reduce their hours by at least ten
(approximately one standard deviation for working hours in our sample) in the next period.

The results we present here are robust. As mentioned previously, all results presented are
for workers aged between 18 and 70, though the results are very similar - coefficient sizes
are often slightly larger - for prime age workers. Furthermore, results are robust to taking
into account potential attrition bias via inverse probability weighting.

5. Conclusions
The cross-sectional association between pain and unemployment is well-established. But
the absence of panel data containing data on pain and labor market status has meant less is
known about the direction of any causal linkage. A few small-scale studies have found
that the alleviation of pain can increase labor supply. Those longitudinal studies that do
examine the link between pain and subsequent labor market transitions suggest results are
sensitive to the measurement of pain and model specification. We contribute to this
literature by revisiting this issue using large-scale panel data from the German Socio-
Economic Panel (GSOEP) for the period 2002 to 2018. We also set these results in context
using data from the International Social Surveys, the Gallup World Poll and the
Eurobarometer Survey. Germany has typical levels of pain. As our literature review
indicates, the GSOEP is a data set that features heavily in the examination of links between
health and unemployment, but no previous studies used it to examine the consequences of
pain for subsequent unemployment.

We show that pain leads to job loss, and this result is robust to model specification, the
measure of joblessness we use, and to some sub-population analyses. Workers suffering
pain are more likely than others to leave their job for unemployment or economic inactivity.
This probability rises with the frequency of the pain suffered in the previous month. Those
reporting suffering pain `always' over the course of a month are 4-5 percentage points more
likely than those suffering no pain to be found unemployed or economically inactive a year
later. The effect persists having accounted for fixed unobserved differences across workers.

There is also some evidence that the effect persists for two years, although this becomes
statistically non-significant when controlling for person fixed effects. It is also apparent
among those who otherwise report good general health and is robust to the inclusion of
controls for mental health, life satisfaction and the employee's occupation. The
relationship between physical pain and subsequent job loss is stronger where workers are
initially underemployed, that is, those who work substantially fewer hours than they wish
to. The effect size is more than double that found for people who work closer to their
desired hours.

The impact of pain appears to be broader than just on job loss as shown here. Blanchflower
and Bryson (2021b) have examined evidence from a British birth cohort. The National
Child Development Study (NCDS) has continuously followed all the individuals born in a
single week in March 1958. Chronic pain ­ defined as aches and pains lasting for more
than three months at age 42 ­has an impact on back pain and depression as well as on the



                                            11
probability of holding a job more than a decade later at age 55. Chronic pain, the authors
find, also impacts general health and well-being years later.

Our results appear compelling and should prompt further examination into the complex
relationship between pain and job loss. Here we only consider one aspect of pain, namely
its frequency in the month prior to interview. This proves important since effects differ
with pain frequency, but there are other dimensions of pain, such as its duration and
location, which are worthy of investigation. In addition, just because there is a link between
workers experiencing pain and subsequent job loss does not mean that we can discount the
bi-directional nature of the relationship, something that is worthy of further investigation.

The availability of longitudinal data files seems important if we are to understand the
mechanism by which pain impacts subsequent health and labor market outcomes. Our
current research using GSOEP and NCDS is exploring other outcomes that pain might
impact including sleep, drinking and smoking, drug taking and marital breakdown. Pain
hurts.

Never is the excluded pain category. General health and mental health information comes from the SOEP's
generated information for general health (gh_nbs) and mental health (mh_nbs) available in the same years as
the pain information. Individuals are deemed to have very low life satisfaction if they score 0, 1 or 2 on an
11-point life satisfaction scale. The personal controls are household income, gender, marital status, education
and age. The regional controls are a set of 16 dummies. Q6. During the past four weeks, how often did you
have severe physical pain? (Always, often, sometimes, almost never, never.)
