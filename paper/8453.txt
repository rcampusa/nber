Introduction

        It is widely believed that changes in exchange rates have important implications for financial
decision-making and for the profitability of firms. One of the central motivations for the creation of the euro
was to eliminate exchange rate risk to enable European firms to operate free from the uncertainties of changes
in relative prices resulting from exchange rate movements. But do changes in exchange rates have measurable
effects on firms? The existing literature on the relationship between international stock prices (at the industry
or firm level) and exchange rates finds only weak evidence of systematic exchange rate exposure (see
Doidge, Griffin and Williamson (2000) and Griffin and Stulz (2001) for two recent studies). This is
particularly true in studies of U.S. firm share values and exchange rates (see for example, Amihud (1994),
Bodnar and Gentry (1993), and Jorion (1990)).
        The first objective of this paper is to see whether the finding of low levels of exposure reported in the
literature generalizes to countries other than the United States. To this end, we examine the extent of firm-
and industry-level exposure as measured by the relationship between excess returns and foreign exchange
returns in a sample of eight industrialized and developing countries over a relatively long time span (1980-
99). We find a statistically significant level of exposure in the pooled eight-country sample: 23 percent of
firms and 40 percent of industries are exposed to at least one of the trade-weighted exchange rate, the U.S.
dollar, and the currency of the country’s major trading partner. We also find considerable heterogeneity in the
extent of exposure across our sample of countries. A large fraction of Japanese firms appear to be exposed to
weekly movements in the dollar, for example, while few Chilean firms appear to be exposed.
        In section II we examine the robustness of our findings on the extent of exposure to different
specifications of our estimating equation. In general, we find that (i) the choice of exchange rate matters, and
using the trade-weighted exchange rate is likely to understate the extent of exposure, (ii) conditioning on the
value-weighted vs. the equally-weighted market index has little effect on estimated exposure, while
conditioning on the international index does change the estimate of exposure, (iii) the extent of exposure is
not a result of a spurious correlation between random variables with high variances, (iv) exposure increases
with the return horizon, (v) within a country and within an industry, exposure coefficients are roughly evenly
split between positive and negative values, (vi) averaging across the (absolute value of the) significant
exposure coefficients in our sample of countries, we find an exposure coefficient of about 0.5 some countries,
(vii) the extent of exposure is not sensitive to the sample period, but the set of firms that is exposed does vary
over time, and (viii) the sign of the exposure coefficients changes across subperiods for about half of the
firms of our sample.
        The second objective of the paper is to examine potential determinants of exchange rate exposure.
Economic theory suggests a number of channels through which changes in the exchange rate might affect the



                                                        1
profitability of a firm. Firms that export to foreign markets may benefit from a depreciation of the local
currency if its products subsequently become more affordable to foreign consumers. On the other hand, firms
that rely on imported intermediate products may see their profits shrink as a consequence of increasing costs
of production due to a depreciating currency. One might expect, then, to find a correlation between exposure
(positive or negative) and a firm’s involvement in international markets. If large firms are more likely to be
engaged in trade, exposure may also be correlated with firm size.
        Even firms that do no international business, however, are likely to be influenced indirectly by
foreign competition. For example, if Ford Motor Company were to sell no cars abroad nor import any foreign
auto parts, domestic automobile sales would still be affected if the dollar price of competing Japanese
automobile imports falls or rises. Exposure could then depend on the competitiveness of a particular industry
-- in less competitive industries, prices are set farther from marginal cost implying higher mark-ups. In such
industries firms will have some ability to absorb exchange rate changes by adjusting profit margins and
lowering “pass through.” In more competitive industries we might expect close to perfect pass-through and
therefore larger effects of exchange rate movements on stock returns.1
        While trade would seem to be an obvious source of exposure, it is not clear that firms in the non-
traded sector of the economy are fully insulated from changes in the exchange rate. If non-traded goods
producers compete with traded-goods producers for factors of production, whose returns may be affected by
changes in the exchange rate, exchange rate movements may still affect firm value. It may also be that the
more international is a firm, the more likely the firm will hedge exchange rate risk. 2 As a result, net exchange
rate exposure may be smaller in those firms engaged in international business, not larger.
        Although theory suggests a number of channels through which firms and industries may be exposed
to exchange rate risk, in the final analysis theory provides us with little guidance as to which firms are most
likely to be exposed. Firm size, industry affiliation and degree of internationalization are all factors that may
influence whether a firm or industry is exposed. However, the precise linkage between those factors and the
direction of the exposure is unclear. Therefore, rather than test a specific model of exchange rate exposure,
we use available data at the firm- and industry-level to see what factors tend to be correlated with exposure.
The factors we study include firm size, industry affiliation, multinational status, foreign sales, international

  Bodnar, Dumas, and Marston (1999) and Marston (2001) develop a framework for analyzing the joint phenomena of
pass-through and exposure. Nucci and Pozzolo (2001) examine the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on investment in
a sample of Italian manufacturing firms and find a link between monopoly power and the impact of exchange rate
effects. Allayannis and Ihrig (2000), Campa and Goldberg (1995, 1999) and Dekle (2000) also find a relationship
between market structure and exposure.

  Bodnar and Marston (2000) find that foreign exchange exposure is low for a sample of 103 US firms that answered
their survey of derivative usage. On the other hand, survey results reported in Loderer and Pichler (2000) suggest that
Swiss firms do not seem to know the extent of their cash-flow exposure to exchange rate risk. And, based on surveys,
Bodnar and Marston (1998) find that firms do not seem to use derivatives to hedge exchange rate risk and in many
instances, appear to use derivatives to take open positions with respect to the exchange rate.

assets and industry-level trade. In general, we find that both the magnitude and the direction of exposure
varies across firms in each of these categories. That is, exposure appears to be a firm-specific phenomenon
that is not readily explained by easily observed variables. What little explanatory evidence we can find
suggests that small firms are slightly more likely to be exposed than medium- and large-sized firms, and firms
in the non-traded sector are as likely to be exposed as firms in the traded sector. We find that exposure is not
concentrated in particular industries, nor do we find a systematic link between exposure and foreign sales,
international assets, multinational status or information about industry-level trade flows. Taken together with
our estimates of exposure, these findings suggest that a significant fraction of firms are exposed to exchange
rate risk in our sample of countries, but we are unable to identify the factors that could account for that
exposure.
        The paper is organized as follows. The definition of exchange rate exposure is covered in Section I
and Section II describes our dataset. The benchmark exposure results and the robustness of these results are
discussed in Section III. The second-stage results on the links between exchange rate exposure and other
factors are reported in Section IV. Section V concludes.


I.      Defining Exchange Rate Exposure.
        We follow the extensive literature on foreign exchange rate exposure by defining exposure as the
relationship between excess returns and the change in the exchange rate (Adler and Dumas (1984)). More
formally, we measure exposure as the value of β 2,i resulting from the following regression:

(1)               Ri,t = β 0 ,i + β 1 ,i Rm ,t + β 2 ,i ∆s t + ε i,t

where Ri ,t is the return on firm i at time t, Rm,t is the return on the market portfolio, β1,i is the firm’s market beta

and ∆st is the change in the relevant exchange rate. Under this definition, the coefficient β2,i reflects the change
in returns that can be explained by movements in the exchange rate after conditioning on the market return.
        Note that a literal interpretation of the CAPM suggests that in equilibrium, only market risk should be
relevant for a firm’s asset price, and therefore only changes in the market return should be systematically
related to firm returns (Ri,t ). If the CAPM were the true model for asset pricing, the coefficient on the change
in the exchange rate, β2,I, should be equal to zero and evidence that β2,i is non-zero could be interpreted as
evidence against the joint hypothesis that the CAPM holds (i.e. the market efficiently prices systematic risk)
and that exchange rate risk is unimportant for stock returns. In this paper, we are not interested in testing a
specific version of the CAPM, nor are we testing whether exchange rate risk is “priced.” Our approach is to
use the market model (equation 1) as a framework for isolating the relationship between excess returns and
exchange rates in a cross-section of firms. In the second stage of our analysis (section IV), we will try to link
the estimated exchange rate “betas” with a set of factors that could proxy for plausible channels for exposure.


                                                                       3
II.     Data set
        Our dataset includes firm-, industry- and market-level returns and exchange rates for a sample of
eight countries including Chile, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Thailand and the United
Kingdom over the 1980-99 period. The specific countries in our sample were chosen both on the basis of
data availability and to include in our sample both OECD and developing countries. Returns are weekly
(observations are sampled on Wednesdays) and are taken from Datastream. For countries with a large number
of publicly traded firms (in our sample these include Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom) we select a
representative sample of firms (25% of the population) based on market capitalization and industry affiliation.
For the remaining countries we include the population of firms. Table 1 provides summary information on the
degree of data coverage across the eight countries. On average our sample includes 300 firms for each
country; Japan includes the largest number of firms at 488 and Chile has the smallest number at 199. Firms
with fewer than six months of data over the period 1980 to 1999 were excluded from our sample.
        In section IV of the paper, we will attempt to link our estimates of exposure to variables such as
industry affiliation, firm size, a firm’s multinational status, information on trade and a firm’s holdings of
international assets and its foreign sales. Parts 2 through 6 of Table 1 provide information about the coverage
of these variables. Datastream provides industry-level returns at a fairly disaggregated level (we focus on the
4-digit level). As shown in the second part of table 1, there are between 23 and 39 industry categories across
our sample of countries. (The list of industries is provided in Table A1. of the appendix.)
        Information about multinational status comes from three sources. The first source is the Worldwide
Branch Locations of Multinationals (1994), which includes a sample of 500 companies that have foreign
branches. The second source, The Directory of Multinationals (1998), includes the 500 largest firms with
consolidated sales in excess of $US 1 billion and overseas sales in excess of $US 500 million in 1996. Our
third source of multinational information comes from the Financial Times Multinational Index, created in
2000. If a firm appeared as a multinational in any of the three sources, we coded that firm as a multinational.
        We draw on two sources to gather information about trade, both of which provide data only at the
industry level. The first is Feenstra’s (2000) database on world bilateral trade flows over the 1980-97 period.
This data source allows us to identify each country’s major bilateral trading partners by industry. As shown in
part 4 of Table 1, the Feenstra database covers all of the countries in our sample, although it does not cover
all of the industry categories available from Datastream. The second source of trade information is the export,
import and net input shares in manufacturing industries reported by Campa and Goldberg (1997). Their study
covers two of the countries in our sample, Japan and the United Kingdom.
        While Datastream provides information about industry affiliation and market capitalization for all
firms in our dataset, the coverage ratios for international asset and foreign sales data is more limited. In the
regression analysis below we use annual values of foreign sales and international assets averaged over the


                                                        4
period 1996-1999. As shown in parts 5 and 6 of Table 2, the number of firms that report international assets
and/or foreign sales varies considerably from country to country. Over 50% of Japanese and UK firms
provide these data, while only three percent of Chilean firms (the country with the lowest coverage) provided
non-zero foreign sales data and no Chilean firms provided non-zero international asset data. Datastream
codes firms that do not provide international asset or foreign sales data in two ways, with either a missing
value code or a zero. Unfortunately the decision about whether to code a firm without data as missing or with
a zero is apparently arbitrary. Firms that do provide information, however, also may genuinely have no
foreign sales or international assets. This means that both a zero and a missing value code provide ambiguous
information. If one looks only at those firms that report non-zero, and therefore unambiguous information,
about foreign sales and international assets, the percent of the sample reporting drops dramatically, especially
for international assets. Less than 10 percent of firms report non-zero international assets in Chile, France,
Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Thailand. In Japan and the U.K., the share of firms reporting any data on
international assets is about 70 percent, and drops to less than 40 percent if we only use non-zero values.
         The usefulness of the data on foreign sales – even if we had full coverage - is also somewhat
questionable for our purposes. The figures reported by Datastream reflect only sales by foreign affiliates, not
the total sales of the firm to foreign markets. However, since previous studies3 suggest that sales by foreign
affiliates may help us predict which firms are likely to be exposed, we include these data in our second-stage
tests.


III.     The extent and robustness of foreign exchange exposure
         We begin by running a benchmark specification for exposure where the independent variable is
weekly firm- (or industry-) level returns and the right-hand-side variables are the equally-weighted local
market return for each country4 and the change in the exchange rate. One of the first problems that arises
when thinking about exchange rate exposure is "Which is the relevant exchange rate?" Many, if not most
studies use the trade-weighted exchange rate to measure exposure.5 As Williamson (1998) notes, the main
shortcoming of using a trade-weighted basket of currencies in exposure tests is that the results lack power if a
firm is mostly exposed to a small number of currencies. For instance, if a firm is exposed to only one or a
few of the currencies within the basket, this may lead to an underestimation of the exposure of the firm. One
possible research strategy to mitigate this problem is to create firm and industry specific exchange rates. The
difficulty with this approach is that it is not clear on what basis these exchange rates should be chosen. As we


3
  See, for example, Doidge, Griffin and Williamson (2000), Frennberg (1997) and Jorion (1990).
4
  In robustness checks, we compare results using the value-weighted local index and the international index as
alternatives to the equally-weighted index. See table 3 below.
5
  Three exceptions are Williamson (1998), Dominguez (1998) and Dominguez and Tesar (2001a). Doidge, Griffin and
Williamson (2000) use both bilateral rates and trade-weighted exchange rates but “score” total exposure based on one rate.

will show below, firms within the same industry have very different exposure coefficients, suggesting that
one needs detailed firm-specific data to isolate which exchange rate is the relevant one for capturing exchange
risk.
        As a starting point, we measure exposure relative to three different exchange rates – the trade-
weighted exchange rate (in large part to compare our results with those in the literature), the dollar exchange
rate, and one additional bilateral exchange rate based on the country’s direction of trade data.6 Table 2 shows
the results of the benchmark results for industry- and firm-level exposure across the eight countries. The
table presents information on the percentages of industries and firms in the sample with significant (at the 5%
level using robust standard errors) exposure using each of the three currencies. The row labeled “any
exchange rate” is the percentage of industries or firms that have significant exposure at the five percent level
using at least one of the three listed exchange rates. Focusing first on exposure at the industry level, we find
that the percent of industries exposed to any of the three exchange rates ranges from a minimum of 17 percent
in France to a maximum of 65 percent in Germany. Dollar exposure seems to be the most signific ant in Chile,
the Netherlands, and the UK, while the trade-weighted exchange rate or the currency of the country’s major
trading partner has the most significance for the other countries in the sample.
        Figure 1 shows the sensitivity of firm-level exposure to the three different exchange rates. The
results for the “any” exchange rate category, which are often twice as large as the results for any of the three
individual exchange rates, indicate that measuring exposure using just one currency for all firms will result in
a downward biased estimate of overall exposure. We find that the extent of exposure at the firm level is
qualitatively similar to the exposure at the industry-level. Chile emerges as the least exposed, while Japan is
the most exposed. Approximately 10 to 15 percent of the firms in Germany, the Netherlands, Thailand and
the UK are exposed to the dollar. Again Japanese firms exhibit the highest extent of exposure, with 22 percent
of the firms exposed to the dollar and 31 percent exposed to any of the three exchange rates.
        Part C of Table 2 shows the percentage of times a firm is found to be exposed to the U.S. dollar but
was not found to be exposed to the trade-weighted exchange rate. This fraction varies from a low of 15
percent in Thailand to a maximum of 86 percent in Chile. Part D repeats the same calculation for exposure to
the currency of the country’s major trading partner relative to the trade-weighted exchange rate, with similar
results. It appears that using the trade-weighted exchange rate alone would understate the true extent of
exposure to exchange rate movements, especially in Chile, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK.

  The country’s “major trading partner” is the country with the most trade with the reference country, where trade is
defined as the average of exports plus imports in the 1990s. Trade data are taken from the Direction of Trade statistics
reported by the International Monetary Fund. If the U.S. is the country’s major trading partner, the currency of the
second largest trading country is used.

Specification of market index
         One possible problem with the benchmark specification is the use of the equally-weighted local
market index as the measure of market returns. Empirical tests of the standard CAPM model typically include
the value-weighted market return to proxy for “the market.” Bodnar and Wong (2000) argue that the value-
weighted market return is dominated by large firms that are “more likely to be multinational and/or export
oriented and more likely to experience more negative cash flow reactions to dollar appreciations than other
US firms” (pp.4). Therefore, including the value-weighted return in an exposure test not only removes the
“macroeconomic” effects, but also the more negative effect of exchange rates on cash flow in larger firms.
This would likely bias tests toward finding no exposure. The second possible problem with our choice of
market return is that in a world of perfectly integrated capital markets the “market return” should be better
proxied by a global rather than a national portfolio.
         Table 3 and Figure 2 examine the robustness of our exposure results to the specification of the market
index. For purposes of comparison, rows A1 and B1 of the table repeat the results from table 2 for the
percent of industries and firms exposed to the dollar at the 5% level. Rows A2 and B2 show the percent
exposed when returns are conditioned on the value-weighted index instead of the equally-weighted index.
There is some change in the percent exposed at the industry level, but very little change at the firm level. The
industry level differences are a bit misleading because there are a relatively small number of industries, so a
switch of just one industry from exposed to not exposed results in a fairly large percentage change. The table
also lists the percentage of firms that are exposed using the equally-weighted index that are also exposed
when the value-weighted index is used. Excluding the Netherlands, which is clearly an outlier, the average
percent of firms exposed under specification 1 (using the equally-weighted index) that are still exposed under
specification 2 (the value-weighted index) is 84 percent.7 Because the results using the equally-weighted and
the value-weighted market indices are so similar, we will use the equally-weighted index in the remaining
analysis.
         Table 3 also provides a comparison between the equally-weighted local market index and the
international index. The international index is the World index reported by Datastream converted to the
reference country’s currency. The percent of firms found to be significantly exposed when conditioning on
the international index (row B3) is now substantially higher. The reason for the increase in the significance of
the exchange rate in the benchmark regression appears to be due to the fact that the international index does a
poor job of explaining market returns. Note that the average adjusted-R2 (part C of the table) of the regression
with the international index falls relative to the adjusted-R2 under the local market index specification, in


7
  At the industry level, Italy is the outlier with no industries showing up exposed to both market indices. This, however,
probably has more to do with the fact that few Italian industries are exposed than with the robustness of results to the
inclusion of different market indices.


                                                            7
some cases by fifty percent or more.8 Thus, more firms appear to be exposed simply because the exchange
rate is picking up more of the variability of returns and the market is picking up substantially less. 9 In the
remaining tests, we will use the local rather than the international index as our conditioning variable, though
it is worth noting that this may downward bias our estimates of exposure.10
Exposure or Randomness?
        Exchange rates and stock returns have large variances. Thus, it is possible that adding the exchange
rate to the benchmark specification is simply adding a random variable that is spuriously correlated with
returns. To test whether the extent of exchange rate exposure we find is in fact statistically significant, we
create a random variable that has the same variance as the bilateral dollar exchange rate for each country, and
test whether this random variable is correlated with firm returns.11 Figure 3 shows the percent of firms
significantly exposed under our benchmark specification, and the percent “exposed” to the random variable.12
We find that only in the case of Chile is the random variable as correlated with returns as actual dollar
returns. In all other countries, the extent of exposure exceeds the amount one would predict based on a purely
random sample.
Sensitivity of Exposure to Horizon
        Several studies of exposure have found that the extent of estimated exposure is increasing in the
return horizon (see, for example, Bartov and Bodnar (1995), Allayannis (1996), Bodnar and Wong (1999) and
Chow, Lee and Solt (1997)). Indeed, most studies of exposure are conducted using monthly returns,
suggesting that our results based on weekly returns may understate the true extent of exposure. Figure 4
shows the percent of firms with significant U.S. dollar exposure in our eight-country sample at the one, four,
twelve, twenty-four and fifty-two-week return horizons. 13 The results are based on rolling regressions
estimated by GMM, correcting for serial correlation. Consistent with the literature, we find that exposure is
indeed increasing in the return horizon for most firms in our sample. Exposure in Chile stands out as the most
extreme case. Using weekly returns, less than four percent of Chilean firms appeared to be exposed to the
U.S. dollar. That fraction increased to 30 percent at the quarterly horizon and to 39 percent at the yearly
horizon. Japan is the only country in the sample where exposure peaks at the quarterly horizon. In the

8
  As in most CAPM regressions, the R2 ’s are small under any specification. The key point here is that the explanatory
power of the regression is much smaller when the international index is used.
9
  While correlations between the two local market indices (EW and VW) and changes in the relevant exchange rates tend
to be low (ranging between -0.08 and 0.12) for all the countries – correlations between the international index and
changes in the relevant exchange rates were generally higher (ranging from -.44 to .47) suggesting that multicollinearity
may be a problem in the specifications including the international index.
10
   Connolly, Ozoguz and Ravenscraft (2000) indirectly measure exposure by testing whether the relevant regional or
country indices outperform the international index in explaining cross-country firm-level returns.

   We thank Ken Froot for this suggestion.
12
   We repeated the random variable regression 200 times for each firm and report the average percent exposed in Figure
3. These results are also reported in tabular format in Appendix Table 1.

   These results are reported in tabular format in Appendix Table 2.

second-stage analysis below, we will continue to use exposure estimates based on weekly returns. In future
work, however, we will explore the robustness of our second-stage findings to longer-horizon returns.
Magnitude and Direction of Exposure
         Table 4 provides summary information on the sign and the magnitude of the exposure coefficients.
Part A of Table 4 reports the percent of significant exposure coeffic ients that are positive and the percent that
are negative. Currencies are measured in units of the reference country’s currency per foreign currency (TW,
$US or major trading partner). In regressions that include changes in the trade-weighted exchange rate three
of the countries (Chile, Germany and Italy) have about evenly split positive and negative exposure. In
another four countries (France, Japan, the Netherlands and the UK) 60-70% of firms exhibit positive exposure
(meaning that a depreciation of the home currency results in an increase in firm share value). In Thailand,
79% of those firms exposed have negative exposure coefficients, suggesting that a depreciation of the baht
generally led to a decrease in the value of Thai firm share values. 14
         We also provide information on the average increase in the adjusted R2 (a measure of goodness of fit)
at the firm level when we include the exchange rate in as an explainer of excess returns (Part B of Table 4).
The first set of results (B.1) includes all firms, and the second set of results (B.2) includes only those firms
with significant (at the 5% level) exposure. When averaging across all firms and exchange rates, the increase
in the adjusted R2 is small, ranging from -.004 percent to 1.5 percent. Note that the R2 ’s are very small to
begin with (i.e. the explanatory power of the market index for returns is low) and the addition of the exchange
rate adds little additional explanatory power. When we average across the regressions in which exchange rate
exposure is found to be significant, the increase in the adjusted R2 ranges from about one-half of one percent
to nearly 3 percent. It is interesting to note that although the smaller countries like Chile and Thailand show
relatively low levels of industry and firm exposure – the average increase in adjusted R2 when we include an
exchange rate in the CAPM specification for these countries is relatively high. This suggests that although
fewer firms in these countries are exposed, those that are exposed have a relatively high degree of exposure.
This phenomenon also shows up in the average size of the coefficient on the exposure variable provided in
Part C of the table.
         Thus far, we have focused on the extent of exposure as reflected in the fraction of firms that have
significant exposure coefficients, but we are also interested in the magnitude of the exposure to exchange rate
risk. In other words, it may be that a significant fraction of firms is exposed to exchange rate risk, but we
would also like to know if that exposure is economically significant. Part C of Table 4 shows the average
magnitude of the significant exposure coefficients, sorted by sign. The figures suggest that the magnitude of
the positive exposure beta ranges from 0.2 to a maximum of 9. France and the Netherlands exhibit the largest

14
   It is likely that the main reason that a depreciation of the baht led to a fall in the value of Thai firms is that those firms
had large dollar-denominated liabilities.


                                                               9
betas with respect to changes in the exchange rate of their major trading partners. The negative betas are of
roughly the same order of magnitude. Averaging across significant dollar exposure betas across countries,
the data suggest that a one percent change in the exchange rate is correlated with a one-half percent change in
stock returns.
Robustness across sub-samples
        Our time-series exposure tests are estimated over the period January 1980-May 1999. In order to test
whether our results are robust over subsamples – and whether specific subsamples are driving our full sample
results, we re-estimate both firm and industry level tests over three subperiods. Rather than arbitrarily
splitting the full sample into three equally sized subperiods, we selected subperiods on the basis of changes in
the underlying currencies used for each country. 15 For example, in Thailand all the exchange rate “action”
occurs during and after the currency crisis of 1997. Arbitrarily splitting the Thai sample earlier than that,
would not allow us to focus on the period in which we might expect firm and industry level exposures to
change. Also, by splitting the sample in this way we are able to test whether exposure levels (or changes in
exposure) are highest during periods of home currency appreciation and/or depreciation, and whether changes
in the underlying volatility of the home currency are related to exposure.16
        Figure 5 reports the percent of firms exposed to the US dollar in the full sample and each of the three
subsamples. In general, the extent of exposure is about the same in the full and in the three subsamples.17 This
suggests that our finding of exposure at the aggregate level is not driven by a particular subsample and that
even though countries experienced different amounts of exchange rate volatility in different time periods, the
extent of exposure is fairly constant.
        While the aggregate amount of exposure remains roughly constant, we are also interested in whether
the same set of firms is exposed across subsamples and in the stability of the direction of exposure. Part A of
Table 5 reports the subsample exposure results for the USD bilateral rate. Part B shows the percent of firms
exposed in one sample that are still exposed in another subsample or the full sample. The table shows that
almost no firm is exposed across all three subsamples, and only a small fraction of firms are exposed across
two subsamples.18 This suggests that while there may be a fairly constant level of exposure in the economy as
a whole, which firms are exposed varies over time. Table 6 reports the stability of the exposure coefficients



15
   We also perform the subsample robustness tests over equal sized subperiods for the sake of completeness – results
over these subsamples are qualitatively similar to those reported in tables 5 and 6.
16
   The subperiods used for each of the countries are as follows: Chile (10/4/88-5/12/92, 5/19/92-4/18/95, 4/25/95-
5/18/99); France (1/1/80-6/3/86, 6/10/86-5/23/95, 5/30/95-5/18/99); Germany (1/1/80-3/5/85, 3/12/85-2/17/87, 2/24/87-
5/18/99); Italy (1/1/80-9/8/92, 9/15/92-4/25/95, 5/2/95-5/18/99); Japan (1/1/80-2/19/85, 2/26/85-4/18/95, 4/25/95-
5/18/99); Netherlands (1/1/80-3/5/85, 3/12/85-1/5/88, 1/12/88-5/18/99); Thailand (1/1/80-6/17/97, 6/24/97-
1/13/98,1/20/98-5/18/99); UK (1/1/80-3/5/85, 3/12/85-12/1/92, 12/8/92-5/18/99).
17
   Results for all three currencies are reported in Appendix Table 3.
18
   Percentages are based on the sample of firms that exist across the relevant sub-periods.

themselves over time.19 In 20 to 35 percent of the firms that exist over all the subperiods, the sign on the
exposure coefficient stays the same across the three subsamples. And, in about half of the sample of firms
that exist in at least two subperiods, the exposure coefficient switches sign across at least one subsample,
suggesting that both the incidence of exposure (i.e. who is exposed) and the direction of exposure is time-
varying. Our conjecture is that the time-varying exposure estimates reflect the adaptability of firms. Firms
that find themselves highly exposed in one period, will react by changing operational or financial policies to
offset (or exploit) any adverse (positive) consequences of the exposure. 20 Unfortunately, the detailed firm-
specific time series data necessary to confirm this conjecture is not available for the wide cross-section of
firms included in this study. However, there do exist firm- and industry-level data that may help us
distinguish which firms are most likely to find them selves exposed to foreign exchange risk. In the next
section of the paper we attempt to explain the average level of firm exposure to exchange rate movements
over the full sample period using these data.


IV.      Explaining exposure

         In this section we attempt to link the foreign exchange exposure estimates we have documented in the
previous section to firm- and industry-specific characteristics. Table 7 presents a broad overview of the
unconditional relationships between our exposure estimates and potential explanatory variables. In the table
the statistically significant exposure betas are sorted by firm size 21 , industry affiliation, a traded vs. non-
traded industry indicator and multinational status. The results in the table suggest that foreign exchange
exposure is not concentrated in any one category. Large firms exhibit a bit more exposure than medium and
small firms, there is less exposure in certain industry categories (for example, mining, oil and gas, food &
drug retail and telecom, and information technology) but, exposure is very evenly split in traded and non-
traded industries, and non-multinationals are more likely to be exposed than multinationals. 22 The last
column in table 7 provides information on the percentage of (significant) positive exposure betas in each
category. With the one exception of the Electric, Gas and Water industry where most exposure betas are
negative, the percentages suggest that the sign on the exposure betas vary both within and across the
categories.

19
   Table 6 includes information about the sign of all exposure coefficients, not just the significant coefficients.
20
   Allayannis and Ihrig (forthcoming) also find in their study of US industries that exchange rate exposure varies both
over time and switches sign. They hypothesize that these changes in industry exposure are linked to changes in imported
input share, export share and the value of markup.
21
   Nance, Smith and Smithson (1993) suggest that larger firms are more likely to hedge exchange rate risks.
22
   A number of studies in the literature (for example, Jorian (1990), Bartov, Bodnar and Kaul (1996), Gao (1996),
Bodnar and Weintrop (1997) and He and Ng (1998)) test for exchange rate exposure in samples of exclusively
multinational firms. This first cut at the data for our eight countries indicates that multinational firms are less likely to
be exposed than are non-multinationals suggesting that exposure estimates based on a sample of multinationals may
understate aggregate exposure levels.


                                                            11
         Table 8 presents further information regarding the direction of firm-level exposure within three
categories of firm size and across ten industry categories. In this table the percentages of firms with positive
exposure are calculated from the full sample of exposure betas (including the point estimates of exposure
betas that are not statistically significant). These percentages again suggest that with few exceptions, the
direction of firm level exposure is mostly fairly evenly split when we group firms by size or industry. Put
another way, it does not appear to be the case that firms within an industry (or size class) are affected in the
same way by exchange rate movements.23
Second-Stage Regressions
         Although the relationships between the exposure betas and the explanatory variables reported in
tables 7 and 8 are unconditional, the patterns that emerge give some indication that there is unlikely to be a
simple explanation for why some firms are exposed to exchange rate risk and others are not. The tables also
suggest that testing for exposure at the industry level will be particularly difficult given the within industry
variation in the sign of firm-level exposure. It is possible, however, that there exists a set of conditional
relationships between the explanatory variables and the exposure betas. We test this hypothesis by running a
second-stage regression that takes the estimated exposure betas from equation (1) and regresses these on a
series of potential explanatory variables.
         The basic regression specification has the firm-level dollar exposure beta as the dependent variable
and firm- and industry-level information as explanatory variable s.
         (2)                β 2 i = λ 0 + γ 1 D i firmsize + γ 2 D kindustry + γ 3 X i + γ 4 Yk + ε i

         All regressions include dummy variables for firm size. These are based on firm-level market
capitalization where separate dummies are used for large-sized (top-third) and medium-sized (middle-third)
firms (small-sized firms being the excluded category). We also include a measure of industry affiliation in
most of our regression specifications. Datastream provides a set of (2-digit) industry groupings (10 categories,
see the appendix for a detailed breakdown), from which we create a set of dummy variables (the excluded
category being industry 50 “retailers, restaurants, transport”).24 Alternative specifications of regression (2)
include as “X” (i) a dummy variable denoting whether the firm is a multinational corporation, (ii) the firm’s
percentage of foreign to total sales, (iii) the firm’s percentage of international to total assets, and (iv) a
dummy variable denoting whether the firm is in the traded-sector. Likewise, the industry-specific
explanatory variables denoted by “Y” in the specification include (v) the volume of the firm’s industry export
and import flows, and (vi) the export, import and imputed input shares of the firm’s industry.

23
   Examples of studies in the literature that test for exposure at the industry level include Allayanis (1995), Allayanis and
Ihrig (2000), Bodnar and Gentry (1993), Campa and Goldberg (1995) and Griffin and Stulz (1997).
24
   We also tried using a more disaggregated set of industry groupings (at the 4-digit level) in our basic second stage
regression specification. These results, reported in Dominguez and Tesar (2001b), are qualitatively the same as those
reported here using 2-digit industry categories.


                                                                          12
         The results from the basic specification of our second-stage regressions (which includes firm size and
industry affiliation as explanatory variables) for each of the eight countries in our sample are reported in table 9.
In the upper portion of the table we report the sign (positive or negative) on any of the coefficients of the
included explanatory variables that are statistically significant at the 5% level (based on robust standard errors).
The first thing to note from the table is that firm size is not systematically related to exposure betas for any of
the eight countries. It is also striking that most of the significant industry coefficients are found for Japan and
to a lesser extent Italy. 25 Looking over all eight countries, the results suggest that neither firm size nor industry
affiliation explain the variation in firm level exposure.26
         The specification of equation (2) is somewhat restricted, however, in that it asks not only whether
firm size and industry play a role in foreign exchange exposure, but it also implicitly restricts the direction of
the exposure to be the same within each of those categories. It is possible, for example, that two firms in the
same industry are strongly affected by exchange rate movements, but one firm benefits from an exchange rate
appreciation while another firm is made worse off by an appreciation. Indeed, we found in table 8 that the
direction of firm level exposure within industry categories is often evenly divided. To test whether our firm-
level explanatory variables contain information about the magnitude of exposure, if not the direction of the
exposure, we next regress the square-root of the absolute value of the exposure betas on the same set of firm
and industry characteristics.27 The results are reported in the bottom portion of table 9. The number of
significant coefficients rises substantially when we ignore the sign on the exposure betas. Now firm size is
statistically significant for five of the eight countries and the sign on the coefficients suggests that large and
medium firms are likely to have lower levels of exposure than are the excluded category, small firms. It is
also now the case that the numbers of significant industry coefficients is more evenly distributed across the
eight countries. However, it remains true that the signs on the industry dummies are not consistent across
countries. For example, in Germany and the Netherlands firms in the Mining, Oil and Gas industry are less
exposed than other firms, while the reverse is true in Japan and the UK.




25
   Chamberlain, Howe and Popper (1997) find that while the returns on US banks are sensitive to exchange rate
changes, Japanese bank returns are not exposed. In table 9 we find evidence that firms in the Japanese finance industry
(which includes banking, insurance and real estate) are likely to have higher levels of exposure than are firms in our
excluded category (Distributors, Retail, Hotel, Rest and Transport).
26
   We also experimented with interaction effects between firm size and industry affiliation – but found little evidence
that such interactions are operative in the data.
27
   A number of studies in the literature estimate the second-stage regression using the simple absolute value of the
exposure beta as the dependent variable. This imposes a truncated bias. We include the square root of the absolute value
of the exposure beta – which allows for both positive and negative values and therefore (largely) leaves the error term
normally distributed. It is still the case, however, that this specification restricts the error term from taking on extremely
large negative values. An alternative transformation of the betas, used in Dominguez and Tesar (2001b), which takes the
log odds of the absolute value of beta, is undefined for values of beta that exceed (-1,1). Our results are qualitatively
similar using the two possible transformations of the exposure betas.


                                                             13
         Table 10 presents three alternative specifications of the second-stage regression. In the first
specification, in addition to the firm size and industry affiliation variables, we include a dummy variable that
distinguishes whether the firm is multinational. The results suggest that in the signed exposure beta
specification, German and UK multinational firms, on average, have higher levels exposure. When we ignore
the sign on the exposure betas (in the bottom portion of the table), we find that multinational status
corresponds to lower exposure betas in France and Italy, and higher magnitudes of exposure in Japan. The
second two specifications in table 10 include the percentage of foreign to total sales, and the percentage of
foreign to total assets (in addition to the firm size and industry affiliation variables). As described earlier in
the paper, firm level data on foreign sales and foreign assets is limited for most countries, so that the degrees
of freedom in these regression specifications are often quite low. Further, we would expect that firms that
are designated as multinational are also likely to have high levels of foreign assets and foreign sales, so that
the explanatory power of the three variables included in this table should be qualitatively similar.28 The
results in the upper portion of the table generally confirm this – higher levels of foreign sales and assets
correspond to higher exposure betas for Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands and the UK. Interestingly, in
this set of results we find that ignoring the direction of exposure leads to fewer significant coefficients on our
explanatory variables.
         Another plausible hypothesis regarding exchange rate exposure, suggests that firms that are heavily
involved in international trade will be more exposed than purely domestic firms. Our final set of explanatory
variables, therefore, attempt to proxy for firm level trade. Although firm-level export and import data is not
available for a large sample of firms – information on industry-level international trade is available in Feenstra’s
(2000) World Trade Flows database. These data will obviously only provide a good proxy for firm-level trade
flows in industries where trade patterns at the firm level are similar across firms. As a first cut at testing how
important trade may be in explaining firm level exposure, we start by using the World Trade Flows data to
identify what currencies to include in our first-stage exposure regression. In particular, rather than include the
same exchange rate for all firms in a country as we did in previous tables, we can now use an industry-specific
exchange rate corresponding to the top trade country’s currency. So, for example, the country that imports the
largest fraction of Japanese automobiles is the United States, suggesting that the appropriate currency to include
in the exposure regression for Japanese firms in the automotive industry is the US dollar. Table 11 presents the
percentages of firms that are significantly exposed to these industry-specific currencies.29 Interestingly the
results using both the industry-specific leading export country currencies and the industry-specific leading

28
  Note that the multinational status variable is a (1,0) dummy variable while the foreign sales and assets variables are in
percentages. We also tried specifications of equation (2) that include dummy variables which distinguish large, medium
and small percentages of foreign sales or assets. We find that results generally did not change depending on how we
specify the variables (as dummies or percentages).




                                                           14
import country currencies do not much differ from the exposure levels we find when we use the dollar bilateral
rate for all the firms.30 The fact that we do not find that firm-level exposure increases when we use a trade-
based currency in the regression, suggests that we are unlikely to find a strong connection between trade and
exposure in our second-stage regressions.31
         Table 12 presents the results of the final three variants of our second stage regression (2)
specifications that include various proxies for firm-level international trade. These specifications also include
the firm size variables that were included in tables 9 and 10. The first specification includes a dummy
variable that indicates whether the firm is in a traded-goods industry or a non-traded industry (see appendix
table 1 for the list of industries included in each category). Regardless of whether we take into account the
sign of the exposure beta, the traded/non-traded distinction matters only for UK firms. Our second “trade”
specification includes the volume of world trade flows in exports and imports for each country by industry. 32
This specification is a second-stage version of the regressions presented in table 11 that use the same trade
flows data to specify the currency to include in the first stage exposure estimates. Consistent with our
previous findings, these regressions also suggest that there is little connection between an industry’s level of
international trade and the degree of exchange rate exposure for the firms in the industry. 33
         Campa and Goldberg (1997) provide another measure of industry-specific trade orientation for two of
our eight countries, Japan and the UK. They provide measures of export share, import share and imported
input shares for a number of manufacturing industries in 1993. These data provide another proxy for relative
levels of trade across industries. The Campa and Goldberg data are included as explanatory variables in the
basic second stage regressions together with the firm size dummy variables. The results presented in table 12

29
    We include results based on just the top export or import country’s currency as well as the top three exporters and
importers country’s currencies.
30
   The industry-specific trade data were not available for all the Datastream industries, therefore the exposure estimates
in table 11 are based on the subsample of firms for which we have the trade data. The dollar exposure comparisons are
also based on this subsample of firms, explaining why they do not match the numbers included in table 2.
31
    Forbes (forthcoming) examines the connection between trade linkages and country vulnerability to currency crises for
a sample of developing countries. In future work we hope to explore the relationships between the ex ante magnitude of
firm level exposures in (currency) crisis and non-crisis countries.
32
   Again, because the trade data are not available for all the Datastream industries, these regressions include the
subsample of firms in the industries covered by the World Trade Flows data. In addition, we include both the world
trade flows as well as the bilateral flows to the US (to correspond with the dollar exposure betas). Results using the US
bilateral flows are qualitatively similar to those using world trade flows.
33
   A number of studies in the literature have suggested that excluding information about market structure (and in
particular mark-ups) in an industry will result in less precise estimates of exposure. Unfortunately we do not have cross-
country industry-specific information about mark-ups. However, in Dominguez and Tesar (2001b), we attempt to
control for mark-ups by using a cross-country industry-specific regression specification (which implicitly assumes that
industry structure is constant across countries). The results based on the signed exposure beta specification suggest that
industry-specific trade flows help predict cross-country firm level exposure in two industries: chemicals and
automobiles. And when we ignore the sign on beta, we find that trade flows help predict the magnitude of exposure in
five out of twelve industries. These results do indicate that market structure may play an important role. Moreover, our
subsample results suggest that a full explanation of exposure will involve time variation as well as cross-sectional
variation by industry in mark-ups.


                                                           15
suggest that all three measures of trade shares are statistically significant for Japan. In the case of Japan,
higher export and import shares in an industry are positively related to the firm-level dollar exposure betas in
that industry, while higher imported input shares in an industry are negatively related to firm level exposure
in that industry. For the UK firms increasing imported input shares also lead to a reduction in exposure
levels. While these results are more encouraging for the hypothesis that trade is related to exposure, it is
difficult to know whether the results for Japan and the UK would also hold in a broader set of countries.

IV.     Conclusions

        We use firm- and industry-level stock returns to test for the presence of exchange rate exposure in
eight countries. We find a surprising amount of exposure, ranging from 14 percent of the sample of firms in
Chile to 31 percent in Japan. At the four-digit industry level, Germany and Japan exhibit significant exposure
in greater than 60 percent of the sample, and the remaining countries show between 17 and 46 percent
exposure. These results differ substantially from most previous studies in the literature that find little evidence
of exposure.
        We also find that the direction of firm-level exposure is very much a firm-specific phenomenon. In
other words, firms within the same industry and same size category appear to have very different (and
unobserved) characteristics that result in exposure to exchange rates. Because of this firm-specific nature of
exposure, it is no surprise that empirical studies that have relied on industry-level indices, or on samples with
only large firms concentrated in a few industries, have had trouble finding evidence of exposure. And the fact
that exposure is firm-specific, is more prevalent among small-sized firms and is as likely to occur in firms in the
non-traded sector as in the trade d sector, may help explain why the firms (or the investors in these firms) are not
better hedged against exchange rate movements. Off-the-shelf foreign exchange risk management techniques
based on industry-level characteristics are not likely to provide the right hedge for firms that have very specific
hedging needs.

    The market return is the equally-weighted local market return and the exchange rate is either the trade-weighted, US$
    bilateral rate or the bilateral rate of the country's major trading partner. Each cell shows the percent of firms for which the
    exchange rate coefficient was significant at the 5% level based on the robust standard errors. "Any" exchange rate indicates
    The percent of firms for which any of the three exchange rates was significant at the 5% level.
