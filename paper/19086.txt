                                              ABSTRACT

Chamley (1986) and Judd (1985) showed that, in a standard neoclassical growth model with capital
accumulation and infinitely lived agents, either taxing or subsidizing capital cannot be optimal in the
steady state. In this paper, we introduce innovation-led growth into the Chamley-Judd framework,
using a Schumpeterian growth model where productivity-enhancing innovations result from profit-motivated
R&D investment. Our main result is that, for a given required trend of public expenditure, a zero tax/subsidy
on capital becomes suboptimal. In particular, the higher the level of public expenditure and the income
elasticity of labor supply, the less should capital income be subsidized and the more it should be taxed.
Not taxing capital implies that labor must be taxed at a higher rate. This in turn has a detrimental effect
on labor supply and therefore on the market size for innovation. At the same time, for a given labor
supply, taxing capital also reduces innovation incentives, so that for low levels of public expenditure
and/or labor supply elasticity it becomes optimal to subsidize capital income.

1        Introduction

Should we tax capital income? Popular views on this issue are mixed: on the one hand, there is the view
that taxing capital income is a way to restore the balance between capital owners and workers. On the
other hand, going back to Hobbes (1651) or John Stuart Mill (1848) is the view that individual savings
already consist of income net of (labor income) tax; thus, taxing the revenues from savings amounts
to taxing labor income twice, and it introduces unnecessary distortions in consumption versus saving
decisions. Somewhat surprisingly, growth considerations do not play much of a role in this debate.
However, recent history suggests that appropriate reforms of the tax structure can spur innovation
and growth in a relatively short time period.1
        This paper tries to fill this gap by analyzing how the welfare-maximizing tax structure is aﬀected
by the introduction of endogenous technical progress. In line with new growth theory, which used
the neoclassical models of Solow and Cass-Koopmans-Ramsey as its benchmark, here we use as a
starting point the optimal taxation models of Chamley (1986) and Judd (1985). These two papers
analyze labor versus capital taxation in the context of a standard neoclassical growth model with
capital accumulation and infinitely lived agents sharing the same intertemporal utility function (not
necessarily separable). A main finding is that taxing capital cannot be optimal in the steady state
(i.e., in the long run). The underlying intuition is well explained by Salanié (2003): if  denotes the
rate of tax or subsidy on capital, then the relative price of consumption in  periods with respect
                                   ³         ´
                                      1+
to consumption today is equal to 1+(1−   )    which goes to zero or infinity when  −→ ∞ which
cannot be optimal.
        In this paper, we introduce innovation-led growth into the Chamley-Judd framework, using a
Schumpeterian growth model where productivity-enhancing innovations result from profit-motivated
R&D investment.2 By doing so, we show the usefulness of this class of models for optimal fiscal
policy design and how understanding the mechanism behind innovation may change well-known policy
prescriptions.
        Our main result is that, for a given required trend of public expenditure, a zero tax/subsidy on
capital becomes suboptimal. In particular, the higher the level of public expenditure and the income

     Prior to the 1991 tax reform, Sweden had a progressive tax on capital income with a maximum marginal rate of
72% and an average rate of 54%. The 1991 reform turned it into a flat 30% rate. Combined with selected reductions in
public spending, this reform is believed to have contributed to a sharp increase in the savings rate (from 9% in 1990 to
12,86% in 2011), to a significant increase in labor supply, and a large reduction in fiscal evasion- both of which resulted
in an increase in fiscal revenues in spite of the lower average tax rate, and to a jump in patenting (between 1990 and
2010, the annual number of patents per thousand inhabitants increased from 1 to 2,5). See Aghion and Roulet (2011)
and OECD statistics.

elasticity of labor supply, the less should capital income be subsidized and the more it should be
taxed. Not taxing capital implies that labor must be taxed at a higher rate. This in turn has a
detrimental eﬀect on labor supply and therefore on the market size for innovation. At the same time,
for a given labor supply, taxing capital also reduces innovation incentives (again a market size eﬀect).3
As a result, for suﬃciently low levels of public expenditure and/or labor supply elasticity, it becomes
optimal to subsidize capital income.
       Our analysis relates to three main strands of the literature. First is the literature on optimal
capital taxation. In response to the seminal contributions by Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976), Chamley
(1986) and Judd (1985), all of which point to the optimality of zero capital income taxation, various
attempts have been made to overturn this result by introducing suitable additional assumptions. Thus,
Chamley (2001) shows that when agents are credit-constrained, it may become optimal to also tax
capital. The underlying intuition is that credit-constrained agents build up precautionary savings to
better resist the consequences of aggregate fluctuations, but credit constraints limit the extent to which
insurance against aggregate risk can be achieved under laissez-faire. Taxation on accumulated savings
then acts as an insurance device. Golosov et al. (2006) and Kocherlakota (2010) develop dynamic
models with private information where the accumulation of savings leads to reduced labor supply
in the future, hence the role of capital taxation in enhancing future insurance possibilities. More
recently, Piketty and Saez (2012) develop a dynamic model of savings and bequests with two sources
of inequality: first, diﬀerences in labor incomes due to diﬀerences in ability; second, diﬀerences in
inheritances due to diﬀerences in parental tastes for bequests. These two sources of inequality require
two taxation instruments, not one. Hence, the rationale for also taxing capital.4 However, none of
these contributions5 factor in the potential eﬀects of taxation on growth, whereas we contribute to
this whole literature by introducing (innovation-based) growth into the analysis.
       A second related literature is that on taxation and growth. The first major attempt at looking
at the relationship between the size of government and growth in the context of an AK model is by
Barro (1990, 1991). Using cross-country regressions, Barro finds that growth is negatively correlated
with the share of public consumption in GDP and insignificantly correlated with the share of public
expenditure in GDP. More recently, Gordon and Lee (2006) perform cross-country panel regressions
of growth taxation over the period 1970-1997 and find a negative correlation between statutory cor-
   3
      In addition, taxing capital income also discourages production by intermediate monopolists. This market power
eﬀect is also absent from the original Chamley-Judd model; which instead assumes full competition.
    4
      There is also a literature that emphasizes that positive capital taxation is part of the best response of a government
that cannot commit to future taxation paths. See, for instance Phelan and Stacchetti (2001)
    5
      And the same is also true for the New Dynamic Public Finance literature (e.g., see Kocherlakota 2005, Golosov et
al. 2006, Farhi and Werning, 2012).



                                                             3
porate tax rates and average growth rates, both in cross-section regressions and in panel regressions
where they control for country fixed eﬀects. Focusing more directly on entrepreneurship, Gentry and
Hubbard (2004) find that both the level of the marginal tax rate and the progressivity of the tax
discourage entrepreneurship.6 Petrescu (2009) shows that more tax progressivity reduces the prob-
ability of choosing self-employment and decreases the number of micro-enterprises, and that these
eﬀects are weaker in countries with higher levels of tax evasion. Similarly, Djankov et al. (2010) find
that the eﬀective corporate tax rate has a large adverse impact on aggregate investment, FDI, and
entrepreneurial activity. However, none of these papers is concerned with the choice between labor
and capital income tax and more generally with the optimal design of the tax system in a dynamic
framework with endogenous technical progress.7
       More closely related to our analysis is the paper by Atkeson and Burstein (2012). This paper looks
at the impact of fiscal policy on product innovation and welfare, using a growth model with expanding
varieties. However, their focus is on the comparison between R&D tax credits, federal expenditures
on R&D, and corporate profit tax, whereas we focus on labor versus capital income taxation and the
comparison with Chamley (1986) and Judd (1985).8
       A third strand is a recent empirical literature documenting the importance of market size as a
determinant of innovation incentives.9 In this paper, we contribute to this literature by showing how
the market size eﬀect translates into a simple expression for the aggregate growth rate as a function
of the tax rates on capital and labor income, which in turn indicates very clearly how the optimal tax
rate on capital income diﬀers from the zero rate generated by Chamley and Judd.
       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces growth in a reduced
form into the Chamley-Judd model. Section 3 opens the growth black box using a fully fledged
   6
      More recent evidence of the eﬀect of tax policy on growth includes Gentry and Hubbard (2004), Alesina and Ardagna
(2010), Romer and Romer (2010), Barro and Redlick (2011), and Mertens and Ravn (2012).
    7
      Notable exceptions consider the eﬀect of tax structure on growth in AK models with human capital investments (see
Jones, Manuelli and Rossi 1993 and Milesi-Ferretti and Roubini 1998). In these models, taxing labor rather than capital
is always detrimental to growth by discouraging human capital accumulation. As we shall see below, innovation-led
growth leads to more nuanced conclusions: namely, depending on the value of labor supply elasticity and on the share of
government expenditure in GDP, innovation-led growth may push toward taxing capital income or toward subsidizing it.
More precisely, the market size eﬀect pushes toward subsidizing capital income more for lower values of the labor supply
elasticity and of the share of government expenditure, whereas it pushes toward taxing capital more for high values of
these variables.
    8
      As we were completing this draft we heard about parallel work by Jaimovic and Rebelo (2012); who analyze the
eﬀect of (profit) taxation on growth in a model with endogenous innovations. A main point of their paper is that the
detrimental eﬀect of taxation on growth is non-linear: it starts out being small as increasing the tax rate from zero
first discourages the least talented innovators. However, the higher the tax, the more it also aﬀects more talented
entrepreneurs. Unlike in the present paper, the authors do not allow for labor taxation, and more generally they do not
look at the optimal taxation structure. Also, not surprisingly, the growth-maximizing capital/profit tax can never be
positive in their model.

2         Introducing Growth in the Chamley-Judd Framework

Consider the standard Ramsey problem of a government that seeks to finance an exogenous stream
of government expenses { }∞
                            =0 through distortionary, flat-rate taxes on capital and labor earnings,

{     }∞
                =0 . The government’s objective is to maximize the representative household’s welfare sub-

ject to raising the required revenue. We analyze an environment in which the government can fully
commit to future tax rates.10
         In subsection 21, we refresh the reader’s memory with the standard analysis of Chamley (1986)
and Judd (1985) with no productivity growth and with their result that the optimal tax rate on capital
is zero in the long run. In subsection 22, we show that this result still holds when productivity grows
exogenously. In subsection 23, we study a reduced-form endogenous growth model where productivity
growth depends on the tax structure and we explain why, in general the zero capital taxation result
no longer obtains in that case. Section 3 will develop a full-fledged endogenous growth model to
rationalize the reduced-form specification of subsection 23


Household’s Maximization Problem

We consider an infinite-horizon, discrete time economy with an infinitely lived representative house-
hold. The household owns the sequence of capital stocks { }∞
                                                             =0 and chooses consumption and labor

allocations {   }∞
                      =0 to maximize its lifetime utility

                                                               ∞
                                                               X
                                                max                     (   )                               (1)
                                          {  +1 }∞
                                                         =0   =0

    10
    To make this problem interesting, and in line with Chamley (1986), Judd (1985), and the theoretical literature on
optimal taxation, we do not allow for lump-sum taxation. Full commitment is a natural first step in the investigation of
optimal policy.




                                                               5

labor income tax and depreciation rates, respectively. The unique final good can be consumed, used

       The household maximization problem delivers the following optimality conditions

where we have defined the after-tax input prices as


                                                                     e ≡ (1 −   )  

The first condition reflects the optimal choice between consumption and leisure, whereas the second
(Euler) condition reflects the optimal choice between current and future consumption.

       Assuming that the final good sector is competitive, and choosing the final good as the numeraire,
the equilibrium prices for capital and labor are determined by:

                                                        

       Finally, in this section we model the growth process in reduced form, as:


                                                      +1 =  Φ (     )                                                (7)


The expression in (7) nests three alternative scenarios: () no growth when Φ (     ) = 1 for all

                                         =  (  )1− =   +   


we can rewrite the government’s budget using after-tax prices (4) as


                                          =  (  )1− − e  − 

      In this section, we assume that  grows at the same rate as output. Government expenditures
such as education, health care, or police, are basically wages paid to government employees. As the

       Thus, the government’s problem can be summarized as

       Let {1  2  3  4  5  } denote the Lagrangian multipliers associated with the above five se-
quences of constraints. In the following subsections, we will consider three cases: () no growth:
Φ (     ) ≡ 1; () exogenous growth: Φ (     ) ≡ ; and () endogenous growth: Φ (     )
varies with   and   


2.1       Steady State Without Growth

We first consider the steady-state equilibrium with no growth (Φ (     ) ≡ 1 for all      .) In this
case, all the Lagrange multipliers remain constant over time, hence we can drop time subscripts. In
the appendix, we show that the first order conditions for the above government maximization problem
imply:                      µ
                                                  2 ³                   ´¶

    If anything, Wagner’s law suggests that the cost of many of these public services grows faster than output. It is
plausible to think that education or health care are goods with income elasticities larger than one and that the political
economy process delivers public spending on education and health care that outgrows output. Note also that, as in the
standard Ramsey approach, we are dealing with  , and not with transfers (although these are also likely to be linked
with output).


                                                                8
    However, the government must also satisfy the household’s Euler condition (3), which we can
rewrite in this no-growth case as:
                                                  1 =  (e
                                                          + 1 − )                                                      (14)

    For both conditions (13) and (14) to hold simultaneously, we must have:


                                             e =  −1 ()1− = 


which in turn yields the Chamley-Judd result:

Proposition 1 Absent productivity growth, the optimal long-run tax rate on capital is   = 0.


2.2    Balanced Growth Path with Exogenous Growth

We now move to the case where productivity growth is exogenous: Φ (     ) ≡ . We focus on
the balanced growth path equilibrium (BGP) with  = , where capital and government spending
also grow at rate , and labor supply remains constant over time (for that BGP to exist, we need to
                                                                                          2 (  )
impose additional conditions on the utility function, for instance, that the              1 (  )   is linear in  ).14
We will identify a variable at the start of its BGP by using subindex “0.”
    In the appendix, we show that the first-order conditions for the government problem imply:
            µ                                                                         ´¶

                                                     2+1
                                                          ³
                                                                   −1        1−
      1=               (0 )    (0 )    +1− +        (0 )    (0 )    − e                                   (15)
                 1                                 1

    However, note that in BGP, 2 and 1 decline at rate  with 1 = 10  − and 2 = 20  − .
Therefore, equation (15) boils down to:
                     µ ³                  ´ 1 ³                     ´¶
                      1   −1     1−           20   −1     1−

                                             10

    Next, the Euler equation (11) can be re-expressed as:


                                   1 (   ) = 1 (+1  +1 ) (e
                                                                        + 1 − )                                        (17)


    Then, since 1 (   ) and 1 decline at the same rate  15 so that 1 (   ) =  − 1 (0  ) 
   14                                                                                                             2 (  )
      For the BGP to exist, we need to impose additional conditions on the utility function. For instance, if     1 (  )   is
linear in  , we can show that such a BGP exists.
   15
      This follows from equation (62) in the appendix.




                                                           9
the Euler equation (17) is simply:
                                                          1
                                                     1 =  (e
                                                             + 1 − )                                                     (18)
                                                          

   For conditions (16) and (18) to hold simultaneously, we must have again:


                                                   e = 0−1 (0 )1−


which in turn establishes:

Proposition 2 When productivity growth is exogenous and constant over time, the optimal long-run
tax rate on capital is   = 0.


2.3     Balanced Growth Path with Endogenous Growth

Finally, we consider the case with endogenous growth modeled in a reduced form, namely, as Φ (     )
varying with the tax rates   and   . We again restrict attention to a BGP equilibrium with  = 
and where capital and government spending grow at the same rate Φ (     ). In this equilibrium,
the first-order conditions for the government problem become:

where


          1 =  − 10  2 =  − 20  5 = 5  1 (   ) =  − 1 (0  ) and  =   0 


   As before, from (11) we have the household’s Euler equation:

                                                          1
                                                     1 =  (e
                                                             + 1 − )                                                     (20)
                                                          

Obviously, (19) and (20) do not necessarily hold with equality when   = 0 For example, if


                                           Φ (     ) = 0 + 1   + 2   


then generically over the set of triplets (0  1  2 ) the term

                               10 0

                                                                10
is not equal to zero when   = 0. Hence, we have the main result of this section:

Proposition 3 When growth is endogenous as in (7), the optimal long-run tax rate on capital income
is typically diﬀerent from zero.


3     Opening Up the Growth Black Box: The Market Size Eﬀect

We now open the black box of the Φ function. To this end, we develop a full-fledged growth model
with capital accumulation and endogenous innovation. In this model, productivity growth is generated
by random sequences of quality-improving innovations, which themselves result from costly R&D
investments. Taxes on labor and capital will aﬀect the market values of these innovations, which in
turn will then aﬀect R&D investments and growth.


3.1     Basic Environment

3.1.1    Household

We continue with the same representative household setup of section 2. However, here we explicitly
specify the household’s utility function as:

                                          ∞
                                                     Ã               !
                                          X                   1+
                                                   ln  −                                          (21)
                                          =0
                                                              1+

to ensure the existence of a BGP, where  ∈ (0 1) is the discount factor,  is consumption,  is
labor supply,  is the inverse of the Frisch elasticity of labor supply, and   0 is a scale parameter
for the disutility of labor. The household owns physical capital as well as all firms and collects labor
income. Therefore, the budget constraint of the representative household is:


            +1 +  = (1 −   )   + (1 −   )   + (1 − ) + (1 −   ) (Π −  )    (22)


where  , Π ,     and  stand for physical capital, gross profit, R&D expenses, the rental rate
of capital, and the wage rate in period  respectively. The tax rates imposed on profits net of R&D
expenses, capital, and labor income are       and   . We will assume that the tax rates are less
than or equal to 1 (that is, the government cannot tax more than the total income), but we let them
be negative (that is, the government can subsidize). The representative household maximizes (21)
subject to the budget constraint (22).



                                                         11
       The corresponding optimality conditions imply an Euler condition with the familiar form:

                                      +1
                                           =  (1 + (1 −  +1 ) +1 − )                                     (23)
                                       

The intuition is straightforward. A higher discount factor delays consumption, whereas a lower de-
preciation rate, a lower tax on capital, or a higher return rate increases consumption growth. Finally,
the consumption-leisure arbitrage condition is simply


                                                = (1 −   )                                           (24)


For any given consumption level, a higher wage rate increases labor supply, whereas a higher tax on
labor and a higher scale factor of disutility reduce the labor supply.16


3.1.2      Production

We now describe the production side of the economy. We will see how, in equilibrium, the technology
for the production of the final good has a reduced form that is Cobb-Douglas in capital and labor.
At the same time, the technology described in this subsection embodies the basic ingredients of an
innovation-led model, namely: () intermediate input production, which is made more productive by
innovation; and () monopoly rents rewarding successful innovators.
       More specifically, final good production is such that:


                                                    =  1−                                                 (25)


where  is the capital stock at date  and  is an intermediate goods basket produced according to
the aggregator:                                           Z   1
                                                ln  =           ln                                       (26)
                                                          0

where  is the amount of intermediate input  used to produce  at time  We assume that both
 and  are produced under perfect competition.
       Taking the final good as the numeraire, we then have, by the Euler Theorem:


                                                 =   +   
  16
     The reader should bear in mind that there are several sources of income for the representative household, not just
labor income. This in turn implies that the income and substitution eﬀects of an increase in the labor income tax rate
  do not exactly oﬀset one another: here, an increase in the labor income tax, which keeps capital income unaﬀected,
will induce the individual to save more and to supply less labor.


                                                          12
where  is the price of the intermediate goods basket  at time  The logarithmic structure in (26)
implies that the producer of  will spend the same amount ̂ ≡   on each intermediate input
. Therefore, the demand for each intermediate input  at time  is:

                                                          ̂
                                                 =                                             (27)
                                                          

   Each intermediate input  is produced by a one-period-lived ex-post monopolist. This firm holds
the patent to the most advanced technology described by:


                                               =                                       (28)


where  is the amount of labor employed by intermediate input producer  at time  and  is the
corresponding labor productivity. Thus, its marginal cost of production is:

                                                            
                                                =           
                                                            

3.1.3   Profits

At the beginning of any period  in each sector , one firm has the opportunity to innovate. A
successful innovation increases productivity in the sector from −1 to  = −1  where  ≥ 1 is
the size of the innovation, and in this case, the innovator becomes a local monopoly for one period
in sector . If innovation does not succeed, then  = −1 and the monopoly power is randomly
allocated to an individual in the economy. In both cases, there is always a fringe of firms that can
potentially produce the intermediate input using the previous technology:

                                                                   
                                         = −1  =             
                                                                    

   Now let us compute the equilibrium profit of a successful innovator (profit is zero if innovation does
not succeed). Potential fringe producers have a marginal cost equal to   . Bertrand competition
implies that this is the limit price the latest innovator in sector  can charge. Thus:

                                                          
                                                =                                              (29)
                                                         




                                                     13
   It follows that the equilibrium profit of a successful innovator in sector  at time  is equal to:


                                           = ( −   ) 


or, using (29) and (27):
                                          ³        ´ ̂   −1
                                     =  −            =     ̂ 
                                                           

   Finally, using the fact that spending on intermediate inputs ̂ accounts for a fraction (1 − ) of
total final output and that the production technology (25) is Cobb-Douglas, we get:

                                                   −1
                                           =       (1 − )                                    (30)
                                                    

In this expression we can see how profit is determined by the size of the market,  , and the innovation
step (and hence, by the producing cost advantage) of the monopolist. In particular, profits go to zero
when  −→ 1. In that situation, we are back to the perfect competition/no innovation case in the
traditional Chamley-Judd framework.


3.1.4   Factor Shares

Let us define the aggregate productivity  at date  by:
                                                     Z    1
                                           ln  ≡            ln  
                                                      0


   Using (25), (26), (27), (28), and (29), and equating labor supply to labor demand (i.e., using
    R1
 = 0  ) one can show:

Proposition 4 (1) The production technology (25) for the final good can be re-expressed in the reduced
form:
                                           =  (  )1− ;                                     (31)

(2) the equilibrium shares for capital, labor and profits are respectively equal to:

                                 1              Π   −1
                             =        = (1 − )  and    =     (1 − )                            (32)
                                                       

   Proof. Using (28) and aggregating over all intermediate inputs, we get:


                                                  =                                           (33)

                                                      14
      Next, from (27), (28), and (29)  the amount of labor employed by intermediate input producer 
is:
                                                          ̂
                                                  =        
                                                           
                                                  R1
Equating labor supply to labor demand,  =        0       we get

                                                          1
                                                          =
                                                   ̂        

or
                                                          1−
                                                =                                          (34)
                                                           

This, together with the Euler Theorem, which implies that capital income accounts for a fraction 
of final output (which itself results from the Cobb-Douglas production technology (25)), establishes
Part 2 of the Proposition.
      Part 1 is then proved as follows. First, dividing (33) by (34) yields:
                                                              µ         ¶
                                              (1 − )              
                                          =                                                  (35)
                                                                  

Then, combining (33), (34), and (35) yields:


                                             =  (  )1− 




      From this Proposition we learn that the share of capital, labor, and profits is determined by two
parameters:  and  Moreover, (a) aggregate (monopoly) profits are equal to zero when  = 1 (in
other words, the case of the basic Chamley-Judd model with perfect competition and no growth in
 analyzed in the previous section); (b) aggregate profits are proportional to aggregate final output.
This observation implies that the equilibrium rate of innovation and the rate of growth of the economy
will be proportional to final output, that is, to the market size. The resulting relationship between
equilibrium profits and final output means that anything that enhances aggregate activity will also
stimulate innovation and growth. This in turn will have consequences for the optimal taxation policy.
In particular, the Chamley-Judd result that the long-run tax on capital should be zero will no longer
be true in general.




                                                         15
3.1.5      R&D, Innovation and Growth

We are now ready to describe how innovation and growth come about in the model. Before doing so,
though, it is helpful to clarify the timing within each period . Events unfold as follows: () period
 starts with some initial  and  ; () inventors in each intermediate sector invest in R&D; ()
successful innovators become monopolists in their intermediate sector; () monopolists produce, and
consumers consume and invest for the next period, which leads to +1 ; () quality improvements
take place according to step  and +1 is determined accordingly; () period  ends. In that way,
technology is predetermined at the start of the period and the current period R&D only aﬀects the
technology tomorrow, a timing convention that is both empirically plausible and computationally
convenient.
       Growth in the model results from innovations that increase the productivity of labor in the produc-
tion of intermediate inputs, each time by some given factor   1. We assume that, at the beginning
of any period , there is the opportunity to innovate in order to increase labor productivity in any
intermediate sector . More specifically, a potential innovator in sector  must spend the amount
  of the final good to innovate at rate  ̄  where ̄ is the aggregate innovation intensity of
other potential innovators.17
       To streamline the exposition, in the remaining part of this section we will assume that firms’ R&D
spending is not publicly verifiable. This implies that the government cannot directly subsidize R&D
costs.18 That R&D costs are not fully verifiable is a realistic assumption. First, in practice firms often
use R&D subsidies for other purposes, for example, for advertising or other devices to limit the threat
of entry. Second, R&D is only the tip of a broader innovation investment iceberg, which includes the
time and eﬀort entrepreneurs spend to solve problems and to find new and better ways of doing things
  17
    This linear R&D technology simplifies the analysis by delivering simpler expressions for the equilibrium R&D in-
tensity and the equilibrium growth rate. Eﬀectively, it leads to the same first-order condition as with a quadratic cost
function (see equation 37), that is, as when solving:
                                                                       
                                               max   − 2  2 
                                                  

but our formulation has the advantage of keeping the aggregate R&D investment in the aggregate resource constraint (44)
linear in  . Note that the congestion externality we introduce does not have any additional implication for the aggregate
dynamics due to the linear structure. In particular, both the above convex cost and the linear cost in (36) imply the same
innovation rate  and exactly the same aggregate growth rate  = 1 + ( − 1)   Hence, our findings do not hinge
on this form and the qualitative analysis and results extend to more general convex R&D technologies. An alternative
way to motivate the above innovation technology is to assume that with probability   a potential innovatorproduces     
a radical innovation that improves productivity by  and becomes the monopolist, and with probability  ̄1 − 1 
the potential innovator produces an incremental innovation that improves the latest technology by  → 1. Note that the
incremental innovation probability increases in her own eﬀort   and decreases in ̄  which in turn reflects a congestion
externality.
   18
      The calibrations in Section 5 suggest that our main findings are robust to allowing for R&D subsidies.




                                                             16
(and it also includes the time and eﬀort spent by potential inventors “in their backyard,” which again
can hardly be identified and measured by a government). The corresponding opportunity cost of time
is hard for a government to identify and therefore to subsidize.
       If   denotes the tax rate on innovation profits at date , the resulting maximization problem for
innovators is:19                                           µ                           ¶
                                                               
                                        max (1 −   )              −                                   (36)
                                                             ̄

In a symmetric equilibrium, and using (30), the innovation rate is given by:

                                                              − 1 1 −  
                                               = ̄ =                                                          (37)
                                                                     

which leads to the equilibrium growth rate:

                                 +1                        ( − 1)2 1 −  
                                      = 1 + ( − 1)̄ = 1 +                                                        (38)
                                                                      

This growth rate depends negatively on the share of capital  and the cost of R&D  but positively
on markups  and normalized market size    Thus, a growth-maximizing policy should aim to
maximize current output. The corresponding market size eﬀects lie at the heart of our analysis.
       Finally, the total amount of the final good used in R&D in equilibrium is:

                                                     −1
                                   = ̄  =         (1 − )  = (1 − Ω)                                      (39)
                                                      

                   −1
where Ω ≡ 1 −           (1 − )  Note that (32) and (39) imply that equilibrium aggregate profits net of
R&D costs are zero:
                                                     Π −  = 0


3.1.6      Government

Government spending is assumed to grow at the same rate as the economy, namely:


                                                       =  0                                                    (40)
  19
    Here we implicitly assume that net profits are verifiable and thus can be taxed. However, as we shall see below, in
equilibrium these profits are equal to zero, so that in the end, it makes no diﬀerence to our analysis and results whether
net profits are verifiable or not.




                                                               17
where  evolves over time according to (38) and 0 is exogenously given.20 This assumption captures
the idea that many government expenses grow with the economy. As we mentioned in Section 2, in
reality, government employees’ wages cannot grow more slowly than private-sector wages, which in
turn grow with labor productivity. Otherwise, the government would find it increasingly diﬃcult to
hire workers. Similarly, many goods and services purchased by the government have prices determined
by opportunity costs that increase with economic growth and labor productivity (think, for instance,
about the land required to build a public school). Technically, in a model with growth, we need to take
a stand on how government spending evolves over time. If we assumed a constant spending, economic
growth will make it asymptotically negligible. If we assumed that spending grows faster or slower
than the economy, asymptotically we would either violate the resource constraint of the economy or
be back in the case where government spending is trivially small.
       The government will choose the tax policy {        }∞
                                                                         =0 on capital, labor, and net profits to

maximize intertemporal welfare21 subject to the above dynamic equilibrium conditions, together with
the aggregate resource constraint of the economy, namely


                                      + (1 − )  = +1 +  +  +                                             (42)


and the balanced budget constraint


                                          =     +     +   Π̂ 


where Π̂ ≡ Π −  . Using the fact that equilibrium aggregate net profits Π̂ are equal to zero, the
choice of {  }∞
                  =0 is irrelevant and the above condition boils down to:



                                               =     +                                             (43)
  20
     In Section 5, we will look at the case where  enters the utility function of the representative household and is thus
also optimally chosen by the government.
  21
     On the BGP, welfare is equal to:
                                                           ∞                        

3.2    Equilibrium Balanced Growth: Analytical Results

We can now define an equilibrium for our model.

Definition 5 Given tax policy {        }∞
                                                      =0 and initial conditions 0 and 0 , a dynamic equilib-

rium for the model is a tuple {          Π       }∞
                                                                           =0 such that given prices, the household

maximizes (conditions (23) and (24)), all firms maximize (conditions (32) and (38)), the government
satisfies its budget constraint (43), and markets clear (conditions (25), (39), and (42)).

    After suitable substitutions, the conditions in the above definition boil down to the following
system of equations:


                                    +1 +  +  = Ω + (1 − )                                           (44)

    Note that the previous equations would be the same in a neoclassical growth model except that
Ω =  = 1. Hence our economy is a minimal departure from the standard model in business cycles or
optimal taxation problems.
    Similarly, we can define a balanced growth path (BGP):

Definition 6 A BGP is a dynamic equilibrium where the aggregate variables {        Π     }∞
                                                                                                             =0

grow at the same constant rate  and {   }∞
                                               =0 remain constant.


    To simplify the analysis, in the following proposition we shall concentrate on the case with full
capital depreciation, that is, with  = 1 We then immediately obtain:

Proposition 7 Consider the benchmark economy with full depreciation  = 1 Then:
(1) in a laissez-faire economy with 0 = 0 the equilibrium solution takes the following form

(2) in an economy with 0  0 the balanced growth equilibrium takes the following form

   Proof. See the Appendix.
   This lemma implies that equilibrium labor supply is decreasing in the tax rate on labor. More
important, it also implies that taxing labor too much can be detrimental to growth, since this could
reduce the market size too much. To see this, in the following proposition we focus on steady-state
growth and use a Taylor approximation around  = 1

Proposition 8 For  close to 1, the steady-state growth rate of the benchmark economy is approxi-
mately equal to

   Proof. See the Appendix.
   Intuitively, the higher the tax rate on labor income the lower the amount of labor supply

in equilibrium and therefore the lower the size of profits to successful innovators. This in turn lowers
R&D incentives and thus the equilibrium innovation eﬀorts. True, taxing capital also reduces inno-
vation incentives. However, with the Cobb-Douglas technology we assume for final good production,
the former eﬀect dominates when labor tax is initially high (or labor supply is initially low). This
market size eﬀect may counteract the Chamley-Judd eﬀect pointed out in the previous section.




                                                                        20
         In section 4, we will provide a detailed quantitative investigation of these diﬀerent eﬀects and we
will compute the welfare-maximizing tax structure for various parameter values. For given public
spending and tax policy, the equilibrium welfare is given by (21)  The welfare-maximizing policy
maximizes (21) subject to equations (44) − (49). Note that when  = 1 we are back to the Chamley-
Judd model with no growth and no market power. Thus, we shall decompose the departure from the
Chamley-Judd welfare-maximizing tax rates into the part that comes from the market power and the
part that comes from the market size eﬀect.


4         Quantitative Analysis

In this section, we perform a quantitative analysis of our model. First, we calibrate the structural
parameters of the model for a baseline case. Second, we describe how we compute the model. Third,
we characterize the optimal policy in the benchmark calibration. Fourth, we perform an extensive set
of sensitivity analysis exercises.


4.1         Calibration

One considerable advantage of our model is its parsimony: we have only 8 parameters: , , , , , ,
, and 0 . In our benchmark calibration, we select values for the first 7 parameters to match certain
observations of the U.S. economy at an annual rate. In that way, our choices will be quite close to
standard values in the literature. With respect to the preferences, we set the discount factor  = 098,
to generate an annual interest rate of 4 percent,  = 67 to make hours worked to be around 1/3,
and in our baseline calibration we take  = 0833 (which implies a Frisch elasticity of 1.2) following
the evidence surveyed in Chetty et al. (2011).22 With respect to technology, we set  = 0295 and
 = 10522 to give us a labor income share of 067, a capital income share of 0295, and an R&D share
on GDP of 0035. A labor income share of 0.67 is a standard value in the business cycle literature
and corresponds to the long-run average observed in the U.S. Our choice of R&D share on GDP of
0035 corresponds to the company-funded R&D to sales ratio in the U.S. (N.S.F., 2010). Moreover,
the innovation step size  corresponds to the benchmark value of Acemoglu and Akcigit (2012). A
depreciation of  = 006 matches a capital/output ratio of around 3 (close to the one observed in
the U.S. economy) and  = 005 delivers (conditional on the other parameters) a growth rate of 192
percent, roughly the per capita long-run growth rate of the U.S. economy since the late 19th century.
Instead of calibrating the final parameter, 0 , we will explore the optimal policy for a large range
    22
         But, below, in our first calibration exercise we allow this elasticity to vary over a whole interval from 0.5 to 2.5.


                                                                 21
of its possible values: from 0.1 to 0.215 (we will discuss below how big these are as a percentage of
output). This range will be suﬃciently wide as to give us quite a good view of the behavior of the
optimal tax as a function of government expenditure.


4.2      Computation

We will solve the model by finding a third-order perturbation for the decision rules of the agents in
the model given a tax policy, evaluate the welfare associated with those decision rules, and then search
over the space of feasible tax policies. Third-order perturbations have become popular because they
are extremely fast to compute while, at the same time, being highly accurate even far away from the
point at which the perturbation is performed. This accuracy is thanks to the presence of quadratic
and cubic terms and it is particularly relevant in cases where we are evaluating welfare, a non-linear
function of the equilibrium variable values. Caldara et al. (2012) provide further background on
third-order approximations and compares them numerically with alternative solution methods. Also,
in Appendix A2, we report the Euler equation errors of our solution. These Euler equation errors will
demonstrate the more than satisfactory accuracy of our perturbation.
   Before we proceed further, and since our model has long-run growth, we first need to renormalize
the variables to keep an inherently local approximation such as a higher-order perturbation relevant.
We rewrite the equilibrium conditions of the model as:

where, for an arbitrary variable  , we have defined the variable normalized by the average productivity
index:

                                                      

With that normalization, it is straightforward to find a steady state on the transformed variables and
use that steady state as the approximation point of the perturbation. We will use the notation e
for the value of an arbitrary variable in such a steady state. Analogously, we define the log deviation
of such a normalized variable as
                                                                  

                  
tivity, and following the same convention as before, we get

                                                                 

                                               = −1 


which will allow us to undo the normalization once we have computed the model in order to evaluate
welfare and the equilibrium path of the economy.
   Once we have transformed the model, we find the rescaled steady state, we substitute the unknown
decision rules within the equilibrium conditions of the model, and we take derivatives of those condi-
tions and solve for the unknown coeﬃcients in the partial derivatives of the decision rules. With these
coeﬃcients, we can find a third-order Taylor expansion of decision rules and simulate the equilibrium
dynamics from any arbitrary initial condition.


4.3   Baseline Calibration

Our main exercise below will be to characterize optimal policy in the baseline model with a benchmark
calibration. More concretely, we will implement the following experiment:

  1. We will set the tax rate on capital income to be constant over time.

  2. We will balance the budget period per period using labor taxes.

  3. We will set as the initial level of capital the capital for a BGP when the tax rate on capital
      income is 0 percent.

  4. Then, we will compute the tax rate on capital that maximizes the welfare of the representative
      household for a range of values of 0 that imply a government expenditure that ranges from
      around 18 to 45 percent of output.


                                                        23
       The motivation for each of these choices is as follows. First, we fix the tax on capital over time
to simplify the computation of the problem and to make the intuition of the result more transparent,
and because we do not find complicated time-dependent policies such as those implied by a pure
Ramsey analysis either plausible or empirically relevant. Second, we balance the budget period by
period to avoid handling an extra state variable. Also, given our choice of a constant tax rate on
capital, this constraint is less important than it might seem.23 Third, we set the initial capital to the
one implied by a BGP when the tax rate on capital is 0 percent. This is the level of capital tax in
the Chamley-Judd case. With that choice, we will have a tax rate that is in the lower range of the
observed rates.24 Finally, remember that the tax on profits is irrelevant because profits net of R&D
are zero and thus we do not need to take any stand on it.
       However, before we engage in this main computational experiment, a preliminary exercise where
we illustrate the role of market size in the optimal tax on capital, the main mechanism at work in our
paper, will be most helpful at building intuition.


4.4      Tax Rate on Capital for Varying Labor Supply Elasticity

Figure 1 depicts the growth-maximizing tax rates on capital income as a function of the Frisch elasticity
of labor supply, for two levels of 0 , a low level of 0.14 (discontinuous red line) and a high level of
0.18 (continuous blue line). The ratio 0  implied by the figure goes from 0.15 (low 0 , low Frisch
elasticity) to 0.60 (high 0 , high Frisch elasticity). That is, instead of finding the combination of
tax rates on capital and labor income that maximizes welfare, we simply find the combination that
maximizes the growth rate along the BGP of our economy. We could also have reported the welfare-
maximizing tax rate. The lessons for this alternative would be exactly the same. We prefer to focus
on the growth-maximizing rate in this subsection because the intuition is more transparent. Also,
when one is dealing with a range of Frisch elasticities as large as the one in Figure 1, initial conditions
for capital stock that are sensible for some labor elasticities are not particularly good choices for
other elasticities. This matters because the initial condition induces a transitional dynamics that can
potentially obscure the eﬀects we are highlighting. By focusing on the growth-maximizing tax rate,
  23
      In the standard Ramsey approach, capital at time 0 is already in place and, hence, optimal government policy
involves, in general, a large tax on capital income in that initial period. The tax revenue is used to buy assets of the
private sector and to rely on the income generated by those assets in the future to reduce the need of raising distortionary
taxation. That is, the relevant constraint in our exercise is not that the government cannot accumulate debt -something
it would not like to do anyway,- but that the government cannot accumulate positive assets. Because of the arguments
of empirical plausibility outlined in the main text, we are not particularly concerned about that constraint.
   24
      In unreported additional sensitivity analysis we found that our results were robust to the choice of initial capital.




                                                            24
we avoid this problem.25
       In Figure 1, we selected a range for the Frisch elasticity between 0.5 and 2.5 that encompasses
all empirically relevant values. The lower range of this interval corresponds more to what we find in
the empirical public finance literature (e.g., see Bianchi et al., 2001, or Pistaferri, 2003), whereas the
upper range is more in line with the macroeconomic literature on business cycles and fiscal policy
(e.g., see Cho and Cooley, 1994, King and Rebelo, 1999, Prescott, 2004, and Smets and Wouters,
2007).26




   Figure 1: Growth-maximizing tax on capital as a function of the Frisch labor supply elasticity.

       In Figure 1 we can see that the growth-maximizing tax on capital income may be as low as −100
percent (a subsidy as high as the rate of return) or as high as 27 percent. Figure 1 teaches us several
lessons. The first lesson is that there is a positive relationship between the optimal tax rate on
capital and the elasticity of labor supply. The intuition is simple: when labor is not very elastic, the
optimal policy is to tax labor heavily (since it will have a small impact on hours worked) and use
the proceedings to finance  and to subsidize capital. That is, market size considerations tilt fiscal
policy against labor income and in favor of capital income. The opposite eﬀect occurs when labor is
  25
     Also, for very high Frisch elasticities of labor supply and high ratios 0  the model often enters into regions of
indeterminacy if we keep  at the value calibrated in the benchmark case. Fortunately, indeterminacy is not an issue for
more empirically relevant regions of the parameter space.
  26
     Note that we are keeping  constant as we change the Frisch elasticity to make the numbers more easily interpretable.
An alternative exercise would be to vary the Frisch elasticity and, simultaneously, change  such that the average hours
worked are always the same as in the data. We find this alternative experiment to be much less transparent.


                                                           25
very elastic: the optimal tax policy relies on taxing capital to finance  and avoid having to tax labor
income. Interestingly, as we pointed out in the introduction, the strongest advocates of high tax rates
on capital income tend to assume low values for the labor supply elasticity. Similarly, often those
supporters of low taxation of capital like to assume high elasticities of labor supply in their models.
The market size mechanism turns both sides of the argument around.
   The second lesson is that the optimal tax on capital income is increasing in . The reason is
that, since we need to finance a larger amount of expenditures, it is relatively more costly to subsidize
capital income and the distortions on labor grow bigger for all Frisch elasticities.
   In summary, Figure 1 teaches us that high labor supply elasticities and high  are associated,
through the market size mechanism, with high taxes on capital income. Conversely, low labor supply
elasticities and low  are associated with subsidies to capital.


4.5   Welfare-Maximizing Tax Rates for Varying Government Expenditure

We now fix labor supply elasticity at its calibrated value of 1.2 and focus on how the welfare-maximizing
optimal tax rates on capital and labor income vary with the share of government expenditure in output.
Figure 2 shows the welfare-maximizing tax rates for capital and labor as  goes from 18.16 percent
to 48.60 percent. Over that range, the welfare-maximizing tax rate increases from -20.80 percent to
9.4 percent.
   The intuition of these results is as follows. When we have low levels of government expenditure,
the optimal policy consists of a subsidy to capital (a negative tax rate) financed by a positive tax
on labor income, which also finances the expenditure. There are two reasons for this. First, we
have monopolistic competition in the intermediate inputs. Therefore, the production level is too low
with respect to first best. By subsidizing capital, we induce a higher level of production. Second,
by subsidizing capital, we increase the market size since more capital is accumulated and output
grows. However, as we increase the size of government expenditure, the tax rate on labor must grow,
increasing the distortions in labor supply and lowering hours and, with them, the market size. The
only way to minimize this impact is by reducing the subsidy to capital to the point at which it
eventually becomes positive.
   In Figure 3, we illustrate how the diﬀerences in the BGP growth rates implied by our range of
government expenditure are significant, but not too large: from 2.01 to 1.76 percent at an annual rate.
We checked that a similar finding occurred when we depart from optimal policy: fiscal policy does
change the rate of growth of the economy (and hence it has a significant eﬀect on welfare), but those



                                                   26
      Figure 2: Optimal tax on capital and on labor as a function of the share of G on output.


eﬀects are measured in a few dozen basis points and not in several percentage points. This reinforces
our view that the model captures orders of magnitude that are empirically plausible.
   Obviously, dozens of other possible experiments are feasible. For example, none of the four as-
sumptions in the exercise of this section are essential and we just picked them to illustrate our point
more forcefully, but our framework is rich enough to accommodate many other exercises. Similarly,
we can easily change any of the parameter values of our calibration. Over the next subsections, we
will report on several sensitivity analysis exercises that we found particularly interesting for our main
argument. But, first, we need to take care of some unfinished business and oﬀer a more thorough
comparison with the neoclassical case.


4.6   The Neoclassical Case

Since the setup of our previous experiment is slightly diﬀerent than the standard Ramsey allocation
problem, we need to check how a neoclassical economy would work under the same assumptions. To
illustrate that, we now reduce  to 1, keeping all the previous assumptions unchanged, and recover
the neoclassical case we are interested in: both without market power and without growth.
   The results are reported in Figure 4, where we see that the tax rate on capital income is much
flatter than in the previous case. Note that, in comparison with the standard Chamley-Judd analysis,


                                                   27
                     Figure 3: Growth rates in the BGP at the optimal policy

                                                 28
the tax on capital income is slightly positive. In Chamley-Judd, we let the government have time-
varying taxes. Given that freedom, a benevolent government would like to tax capital at time 0
because it does not distort (capital is already in place). If we do not let the government do that, it
will trade oﬀ a bit of distortion in the long run for extra tax revenue from capital in the short run
(which allows a reduction in the tax on labor). In any case this eﬀect is small and the tax on capital
is low. Obviously, as  → 1, this eﬀect disappears. As shown in Figure 5, we have checked that, for
 = 0999, the optimal tax on capital is numerically zero.

high .



4.7   Exogenous Growth

We can also do the neoclassical case with exogenous growth:

                                            +1
                                                 =1+
                                             

where  is calibrated to be the same as in the baseline model (around 1.9 percent at an annual level).
   The results appear in Figure 6 and are nearly identical to the ones in Figure 4. This exercise
allows us to argue that growth is not, per se, the reason for our results in the benchmark model, but
rather the fact that growth is aﬀected by the market size instead of being exogenous. The results are

                                                 29
Figure 6: Optimal tax on capital and on labor as a function of the share of G on output, exogenous
growth.


not a surprise, either, since we know that in the neoclassical case, the presence of a positive  has
nearly the same numerical implications as a slightly lower  and, more importantly, as we reminded
the reader in Section 2, that the main insight from Chamley-Judd is independent of whether or not
we have positive growth in a neoclassical framework.


4.8   Exogenous Growth Plus Market Power

In this exercise, we compare the welfare-maximizing tax on capital income to the optimal capital tax
schedule under exogenous growth but we reintroduce market power. In other words, we compare the
optimal tax schedules on capital, respectively, with and without the market size eﬀect (market power
is at work in both cases). The results are shown in Figure 7. The continuous lines depict the welfare-
maximizing schedules for the tax rate on capital income (as a function of the share of government
spending in GDP) when factoring in market size, i.e., with innovation-led growth, for two values of
the Frisch elasticity of labor supply, namely, the benchmark value at 1.2 and a higher value at 2.5.
The dotted lines depict the corresponding optimal capital tax schedule under exogenous growth plus
market power.
   A first observation is that the optimal capital tax under exogenous growth plus market power



                                                 30
Figure 7: Optimal tax on capital under exogenous and endogenous growth with diﬀerent Frisch
elasticities.

varies very little with respect to both the labor elasticity or the share of government: namely, the two
dotted curves corresponding to the two values of the Frisch elasticity of labor supply are very close
to each other and these two curves are also almost horizontal. In contrast, the continuous curves are
far apart and also strongly upward sloping. This in turn suggests that most of the eﬀect of labor
elasticity or of the share of government on the optimal capital tax is due to market size, not market
power.
    A second observation is that the market size eﬀect, that is, the eﬀect on innovation incentives per
se, pushes toward subsidizing capital for these values of the labor market elasticity and of the share of
government spending in GDP, although to a lower extent when the Frisch elasticity and/or the share
of government spending in GDP are higher.


5     Extensions

5.1   Endogenous Choice of Government Spending

In the standard Chamley-Judd analysis, the sequence of  that the government has to finance is
exogenously given and it does not yield any utility to the household. A natural alternative is to
assume, instead, that government spending enters the utility function of the representative household

                                                   31
and that government spending becomes a choice variable for the government.
      A simple utility function that captures that idea is Cobb-Douglas between private consumption,
 , and public expenditure,  :

                                                   1                  1+
                                            =       ln 1−  −  
                                                  1−                 1+

This utility function is convenient because it only introduces one new parameter: . This utility
function makes  separable from  and  , which seems a reasonable point of departure in the
absence of strong evidence that  is a substitute or a complement of  and  . Finally, it makes the
dynamics the same as in the baseline case because all the equilibrium conditions are still the same.
      Since there is no generally accepted value for  in the literature (not a big surprise, since, as we just
argued, it does not aﬀect the equilibrium dynamics of the model and therefore cannot be identified
from the macro data), we prefer to report the results for a range of values between 0.4 and 0.75. In our
exercise, we compute both the optimal share of  over output and the optimal tax on capital income.
The left-hand side of Figure 8 shows that, not surprisingly, optimal government spending increases as
 increases. The right-hand side of Figure 8 then shows that as  increases, so does the optimal tax
rate on capital income. Intuitively, the higher  the higher the optimal level of government spending
and therefore the higher the optimal tax rate on capital income, given the negative market size eﬀect
of taxing labor income on innovation and growth.27


5.2      Allowing for R&D Subsidies

anything, its impact becomes stronger. The higher the R&D subsidy rate , the less one should tax
capital income (or the more one should subsidize it) for any value of  . The intuition is simply
that higher direct R&D subsidies partly oﬀset the potentially negative market size eﬀect of taxing
labor income instead of capital income.
   Note that here we are fixing the level of R&D subsidies. A natural question then is: what happens
if we allow the government to fully optimize on the R&D subsidy rate as well as on the capital and
labor income tax: are we back to the Chamley-Judd result in that case? The answer is no. The
reason is that, with or without R&D subsidies, the market size eﬀect is always at work: namely, not
taxing capital income would still impose a higher tax rate on labor income in order to satisfy a budget
balance (remember that the government does not have access to lump-sum taxes). This channel is
even more important than before, since the labor tax must pay for both the exogenous government
expenditure  and the R&D subsidy.

5.3   Allowing for Public Debt

In this section, we let the government save (or borrow) intertemporally by issuing government bonds
  Therefore, the budget constraint of the household is:

                     +1
          +1 +          +  = (1 −   )   + (1 −   )   + (1 − ) + Π −  + 
                      

where  is the gross rate of return on one-period bonds. As in Ljungqvist and Sargent (2004), we
assume that bonds are tax exempt (this assumption is just for notational convenience: a tax on the
bond yields will be immediately reflected in the pretax rate of return to ensure that the bonds are
held by the public).
   In every period , the government’s budget constraint becomes:

                                                                      +1
                                    =     +     +        −  
                                                                       

Moreover, the present value of the government’s future resources should exceed its initial debt position

Finally, we have two transversality conditions with respect to both assets:
                       µY       ¶                    µY       ¶
                          −1 1                         −1 1    +1
                   lim             +1 = 0 and lim                   = 0                    (53)

This time, in addition to the optimality conditions with respect to consumption and leisure, the
household optimality conditions include a no-arbitrage condition between two assets (capital and
bonds):
                                     = (1 −  +1 ) +1 + 1 − 

   Then we can write the government’s maximization as:

                                                      ∞

This result shows that the government’s ability to borrow or lend does not change our long-run

6         Conclusion

In this paper we have extended the Chamley-Judd framework by introducing innovation-based growth.
We showed that the long-term optimal tax rate on capital ceases to be zero when we introduce
innovation-led growth. This departure reflects two eﬀects: first, a market power eﬀect driven by the
monopoly distortion associated with endogenous innovation; second, a market size eﬀect that relates
the equilibrium rate of innovation to the equilibrium level of aggregate final output. For low levels
of public investment or for low elasticity of labor supply, the market size eﬀect pushes toward taxing
labor income while subsidizing capital income. For high levels of public investment and high elasticity
of labor supply, the market size eﬀect pushes toward taxing capital income in order to spare labor
income and thereby preserve labor supply.
         The analysis can be extended in several directions. A first avenue is to allow for diﬀerent kinds of
labor incomes, i.e., to introduce skilled versus unskilled labor subject to diﬀerent supply elasticities.
In the same vein, one could analyze the case where (skilled) labor is a direct input into R&D. A
second avenue is to analyze the implication of endogenous innovation and the resulting market size
eﬀect in alternative optimal taxation models, in particular in the context of a model with finitely lived
individuals and bequests. This would allow us to blend dynastic wealth accumulation considerations
with endogenous growth.28 A third avenue would be to extend the analysis to the case of an open
economy. There we conjecture that the market size eﬀect would still operate not only on non-traded
goods but also on the traded goods for which the domestic economy is currently a technological leader.
A fourth avenue is to use cross-country or cross-region panel data to test the relationship between
growth and the tax structure interacted with variables such as the elasticity of labor supply or the
size of government spending. All of these extensions await further research.
    28
   Also, one should explore the implications of introducing endogenous innovation in New Dynamic Public Finance
models.

   Proof of Proposition 3.                 First note that    1 (otherwise, we do not have an equilibrium

                                                               5        1
                                                (1 −   )       1      0

Thus,

Solve (71) for 0  and substitute into (67)  Similarly, use conjecture ̃ = (1 − ) ̃ in (68) and

A.2       Euler Equation Errors

A standard measurement of the accuracy of a solution to a dynamic equilibrium model is the Euler
equation error function (Judd, 1992). In figure A1, we plot the Euler equation errors of the model
solved with our third-order perturbation for the benchmark calibration as a function of the log of
(normalized) capital and for 0 = 01. Following standard practice, we plot the decimal log of the
absolute value of the Euler equation error. For values close to the normalized level at the rescaled
steady state, the Euler equation errors are around -7 (one can interpret this number as equivalent to
making a mistake of $1 for each $10 million spent). Hence, the performance of our solution method
in terms of accuracy is most satisfactory. Even if we move away from the rescaled steady state (and
remember that we are normalizing all the variables by the level of technology and that, consequently,
the approximation stays relevant along the BGP), the Euler equation errors are still below -5.

   In Figure A2, we plot the Euler equation errors as a function of both capital and diﬀerent values
of 0 . Again, we see a very good performance of our third-order perturbation in all relevant ranges
of the variables.
