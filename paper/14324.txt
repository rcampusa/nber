                                               ABSTRACT

This paper examines the litigation of patents relating to financial products and services. I show that
these grants are being litigated at a rate 27 to 39 times greater than that of patents as a whole. The
patents being litigated are disproportionately those issued to individuals and to smaller, private entities,
as well as those whose features may proxy for higher quality. Larger entities are disproportionately
targeted in litigation. I discuss how the findings are in large part consistent with the theoretical literature
on the economics of litigation.

Introduction

       The impact of financial innovation is widely accepted. For instance, the economic

importance of new products and services in the financial arena has been heralded by

Miller [1986] and Merton [1992], questioned by Van Horne [1985], and empirically

documented by Tufano [1989]. Yet the empirics of financial innovation have attracted

remarkably little academic attention, as highlighted in a review article by Frame and

White [2004].



       Moreover, in the past decade, there has been a profound change in the conditions

under which financial innovations are pursued. The State Street case in the late 1990s

unambiguously established the patentability of financial inventions. (The history of

financial patenting is summarized in Appendix A.) Because patents fundamentally alter

the way in which innovations can be used—for instance, they make the type of rapid

diffusion documented by Tufano [1989] less feasible—assessing the impact of patenting

is critical to understanding the future of financial innovation. In particular, we know

almost nothing about the way in which these financial patents, having been granted, are

utilized by firms.



       This paper seeks to understand the litigation of financial patents. Litigation is

crucial to delineating the boundaries of patent awards. Moreover, since patent litigation

typically entails several millions of dollars of expenditures for each party in a suit

(AIPLA [2005]), the lawsuits in this sample represent a significant expenditure of

resources in their own right.
       After framing the paper through a discussion of the economics literature on suit

and settlement, I empirically examine the litigation of all financial patents awarded

between January 1976 and August 2003 through the end of 2005. I find that financial

patents are being litigated at a rate 27 to 39 times greater than that of patents as a whole.

Even relative to the most extensively litigated major category of patents (drugs and

health), the rate is more than an order of magnitude higher. The rates are also far greater

than that in the early years of an emerging industry where the extent and breadth of patent

protection was initially ambiguous, biotechnology.



       The bulk of this paper seeks to understand the litigation of financial patents in

greater depth. I show that:

   •   The finance patents being litigated are disproportionately those issued to

       individuals. Inasmuch as those granted to corporations are being adjudicated, it is

       overwhelmingly those issued to smaller, private entities. This seems inconsistent

       with suggestions that larger firms will be able to detect infringements more

       accurately.

   •   Litigated patents appear to be more important than other financial patents: they

       have more claims, and disproportionately cite and are cited by other patents. This

       result appears consistent with standard economic models of suit and settlement.

   •   Litigation does not appear to have increased for patents awarded after the State

       Street decision, despite the likely increase of uncertainty about these awards. If




                                             2
       these years also saw an increase in the awarding of lower-quality patents,

       however, the lack of a temporal pattern may be consistent with theory.

   •   The defendants in these cases are dominated by larger firms. I suggest that well-

       off firms’ greater propensity to be the target of lawsuits—and individuals’ and

       smaller firms’ tendency to initiate litigation—may reflect differences in the cost

       of litigation.



       The plan of this paper is as follows. Section 1 briefly reviews the relevant

literature on the economics of litigation. Section 2 describes the construction of the data-

set. Section 3 analyzes which patents are litigated. Section 4 examines which firms are

defendants in lawsuits. The final section concludes the paper.



1. Modeling and Analyzing Suit and Settlement

       Since the pioneering work of Priest and Klein [1984], economists have

understood that the decision to litigate rather than to settle disputes is a function of the

expected payoffs. To summarize a well-developed literature (see the survey by Cooter

and Rubinfeld [1989]), conditional on a legal harm being done, four considerations can

be seen as increasing the probability of a trial being held:

       •   The likelihood that the offence is detected by the potential plaintiff.

       •   The size of the stakes under dispute.

       •   The uncertainty about the outcome of the controversy between the two parties.

       •   The costs of settlement relative to that of trial.




                                              3
        In the context of financial patent litigation, these hypotheses have a number of

implications:

    •   The extent to which infringements are identified may be a function of the

        characteristics of the patentees. It is likely that larger, more established firms

        will have better information about the state of the market and the activities of

        their rivals, so they might be more likely to initiate litigation. Typically, patent

        litigation is initiated by the patent-holders themselves.1 Among the ways we can

        characterize an entity are whether the patent-holder is a corporation, whether it is

        publicly traded, and its size and sales.

    •   While we cannot directly measure the value of patents, several indirect measures

        can be employed. The literature (e.g., Jaffe and Trajtenberg [2002], Lanjouw,

        Pakes, and Putnam [1998]) has suggested that patent value can be captured

        through a number of proxies, including the number of claims made in the issued

        patent, the number of citations in other patents that the patent subsequently

        received (an indication that subsequent inventions have built on this discovery),

        and the number of citations made by the patent (which has been interpreted as

        reflecting the care with which the patent drafters have searched the prior patents).

        Theory suggests that these more valuable patents should be more frequently

        litigated.

    •   The extent of uncertainty surrounding financial patents increased substantially

        after the State Street decision. Prior to this period, there was a general consensus

1
 While potential infringers can sue for “declaratory judgment” that they do not infringe a
patent, these actions are only permitted when the alleged infringer has already been
threatened with litigation. Other parties are not allowed to sue to have a patent declared
invalid.


                                              4
        that financial innovations were unlikely to be patentable. After the decision,

        questions about the future of business method patent awards, the scope of these

        grants, and the size of the monetary damages associated with the infringement of

        financial patents have proliferated. But it should also be noted that the

        acceleration in the number of filings after the decision (documented in Lerner

        [2002]) suggests that more marginal discoveries may have been patented post-

        State Street. These less important discoveries may be less frequently litigated for

        the reasons delineated in the previous bullet.

    •   Assessing the relative costs of settlement rather than trial is challenging. An

        overall time trend may be difficult to discern. For instance, lawyers have been

        increasingly willing to work for plaintiffs on a contingency basis in patent cases,

        which reduces the cost of litigation sharply. Danzon [1983] shows how such

        contingency arrangements can lead to a greater willingness of plaintiffs to file

        suit in some cases, but not others.



        One complication is introduced by the fact that most theoretical depictions are of

the decision to proceed to trial once a suit has been filed. The empirical analysis here will

focus on the initial decision to file litigation. In part, this is due to necessity: it is the

exceptional patent case that proceeds to the end of a trial.2 It can thus be argued that the

decision to initiate litigation is the critical one in this setting. But more importantly, basic

models of suit and settlement (e.g., Cooter and Rubinfeld, [1989, Section II.C]) suggest

that factors affecting the decision to settle a dispute prior to trial should also drive the

2
For instance, in Lanjouw and Lerner’s [2001] sample, only in 11% of the patent suits
was a verdict rendered in the case.


                                               5
decision to settle prior to the inception of litigation. The same considerations—the

probabilities of success, the extent of uncertainty, and the rewards if successful—should

largely shape the decision to file a lawsuit and to proceed to trial.3



       It should be noted, however, that models of nuisance litigation suggest that the

decision to file a suit may be different in some instances from the decision to proceed to

trial. In particular, a plaintiff may be willing to file a suit that would have a negative

expected value were it to go to trial if certain conditions are met, such as if the defendant

has greater costs in litigating disputes or if the defendant’s costs are more “front-end

loaded” (see, for instance, Bebchuk [1988], Cooter and Rubinfeld [1989], and Rosenberg

and Shavell [1985]). In these instances, a plaintiff may rationally initiate a losing suit.



       Earlier literature (e.g., Lerner [1995]) has suggested that firms as opposed to

individuals, and larger firms in particular, should have more litigation experience and

consequently lower litigation costs due to “learning curve” effects. This might lead us to

conclude that nuisance litigation against large firms should be rare. Recent developments,

however, raise questions about this interpretation. For instance, the reliance on

injunctions both prior to (preliminary injunctions) and after (injunctive relief) a finding of

patent infringement mean that the cost of an adverse judgment to a larger firm—where a

shut-down and the associated reputational damage may affect a wide variety of product

lines—may be greater than to a small firm or to an individual with a single product (or no

A similar assumption has been made in other empirical research on litigation, such as
Browne and Puelz [1999] and Lanjouw and Schankerman [2003].



                                               6
product at all). If this suggestion holds, we may see disproportionate numbers of lawsuits

directed against large firms by individuals or smaller concerns.



2. Constructing the Data-Set

       This section summarizes how I constructed the data-set used in this analysis.

More details are in Appendix B.



       Patent awards. I identify awards using the online database of the U.S. Patent and

Trademark Office, which summarizes all patents awarded since January 1976. Because I

wanted to be able to assess the quality of issued patents (which relies on being able to

identify how frequently the awards are cited in subsequent documents), I only included

patents in the sample if they were awarded through August 2003 (which gives me three

years to observe citations). In total, there are 2944 awards in the sample.



       Litigation. I employ the Derwent LIT/ALERT patent litigation database to

determine if, and how often, each patent in the sample has been litigated through the end

of 2005. I do not observe cases where litigation was threatened but no lawsuit was filed.

Ideally, I could address this concern through a Heckman-style regression. But in the

classic Heckman analysis, we typically have strong priors about what considerations lead

to non-responses (e.g., that young children or a wealthy spouse may deter a woman’s

labor force participation). In this analysis, it was much more difficult to identify

observable variables that could plausibly explain settlement prior to the filing of a

lawsuit.




                                             7
       Characteristics of patentees. I also characterize the features of the parties to

whom the patents were assigned in the year of the award. I classify the awardees into

publicly traded corporations, privately held firms, individuals, and others (e.g.,

government and university entities), as well as obtaining information on the headquarters

location, revenues, and employees of the patentee.



       Features of the patents. I compiled the number of forward and backward citations

through July 2006 in order to have as full depiction of the patents as possible. I also

identified those forward and backward citations that are self-citations. The interpretation

of self-citations is ambiguous: in part, it may indicate awards that are more valuable to

the patentees. Earlier work, however, suggests that large firms disproportionately cite

themselves. Finally, I computed two alternative measures of patent quality: generality

and originality (see Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg [2002]).



       Potential defendants. In the final analysis in Section 4, I examine which firms are

sued for infringement. In order to identify potential infringers, I analyze all firms in the

“Finance, Insurance and Real Estate” industry category (except for Standard Industrial

Classification class 65, which contains real estate operators) listed in Compustat in any

year between 1990 and 2002. I download a variety of measures characterizing the firm’s

financial health and its propensity to innovate on an annual basis.



3. An Analysis of the Litigation of Patents




                                             8
    A. Summary Statistics

        Table 1 provides an overview of the firms and patents included in the sample.

Several patterns stand out in Panel A:

    •   While the award date of the patents in the sample ranges from 1976 to 2003, they

        are concentrated in the second half, with the mean award in late 1994. This

        reflects the acceleration of financial patenting activity in recent years.

    •   These patents are heavily cited relative to the typical U.S. award. Jaffe and

        Trajtenberg [2002, p. 439] find that the typical twelve-year-old patent had

        received just fewer than seven citations, or one-quarter the level seen here.4

    •   Financial patenting activity is dominated by U.S. firms, which account for 74% of

        the awards. In recent years, approximately one-half of all patent awards have gone

        to non-U.S. entities. This disparity is particularly dramatic among individuals and

        private firms. The foreign assignees are dominated by Japanese firms to a much

        greater extent than in other technical fields, which reflects the fact that Japan is

        one of the few nations outside the U.S. that unambiguously allows business

        method patents.

    •   As noted in Lerner [2002], the representation of government and university

        assignees (about 0.4%) is considerably less than in patents as a whole, and

        certainly much less than in other academically-linked fields such as biotechnology

        and advanced materials.

    •   While the bulk of patents are not litigated, a few awards are extensively so, with

        one patent being involved in fifteen lawsuits. (This is an award to an individual

4
 The predicted number of citations is slightly lower if one computes a weighted average
based on the actual ages of the awards in the financial patents sample.


                                               9
       inventor, Lawrence B. Lockwood, which is being litigated through the patent

       holding     company     Pangea      Intellectual   Properties.   The   patent—number

       6,289,319—covers an automated “financial transaction processing system,” and is

       cast in sufficiently broad terms that it probably covers all e-commerce

       transactions, as well as those employing automated teller machines. Pangea has

       been targeting small firms in its litigation, in a successful effort to obtain

       settlements of hundreds of thousands of dollars each from firms that are reluctant

       to bear the cost of litigation.5)



       The second panel indicates a few characteristics of the lawsuits themselves. Most

involve a single financial patent, but several encompass multiple awards. More

interestingly, the role of third parties here is much greater than elsewhere. Only 46% of

the disputes involve an assignee or an inventor as a plaintiff or a defendant. In other

cases, the litigation is being conducted by third parties (who have typically purchased or

licensed the patent) instead. This share of third parties is much greater than seen

elsewhere. For instance, Lanjouw and Schankerman [2001, Table 1] find that in 68.5% of

the cases, the assignee is either a plaintiff or defendant. (They do not examine cases

where the inventor but not the assignee was a litigator, which would increase the share at

least modestly.)

http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/02/05/15/020515hnpangea.html              (accessed

                                               10
        This point is underscored by Table 2. This presents the five most frequently

represented firms in several categories, which prove to be dramatically different:

    •   The first column reports the most frequently represented financial innovators, as

        reported in Lerner [2006]. This compilation is based on stories in the Wall Street

        Journal on financial innovation between 1990 and 2002.6 This list is dominated

        by financial institutions and includes a major publisher.

    •   The second column presents the most frequent financial patentees between

        January 1976 and August 2003. While Citigroup appears here as well (and other

        financial institutions appear further down on the list), it is dominated by

        information technology companies. These firms—which routinely file for

        protection of hardware and software inventions—rapidly began filing for patents

        on innovations that were developed in the course of projects for financial service

        firms after the State Street decision (or even before).

    •   The most frequent plaintiffs7 in financial patent litigation between 1976 and 2005

        are reported in column 3. This list, in contrast to the others, is dominated by




6
  Mergers and acquisitions introduced complications to the tabulations. Citicorp appears in
the first column because it was an active innovator until its acquisition by the Travelers
Group in 1998. Subsequent innovations by this institution were attributed to Citigroup, its
corporate parent in 2003 (which is credited with innovations developed by the new
combined entity and the old Travelers Group). (Lerner [2006] provides a more detailed
description of the procedure used.)
7
  In some cases, entities file for “declaratory relief,” or for a ruling that a patent they are
being threatened with litigation about is invalid. These cases appear relatively rare in the
sample. Prior to making this and the subsequent tabulation in the fourth column of Table
2, I eliminate cases where the defendant is an assignee or an inventor of a patent in
contention, but the plaintiff is not. I also eliminate from the list of defendants parties that
appear twice or more as plaintiffs, as these cases are also likely to be suits for declaratory
relief. In the third and fourth columns, when two firms are involved in the same number
of suits, I rank them based on the number of patents over which they have litigated.


                                              11
       patent holding companies that have no lines of business other than licensing and

       litigating patent awards.

   •   The most frequent defendants in financial patent litigation between 1976 and

       2005 are reported in the fourth column of Table 2. In contrast to the plaintiffs, the

       compilation of the most frequently represented defendants is dominated by major

       investment banks, trading exchanges, and other established financial institutions.



   B. The Overall Level of Litigation

       I then examined the propensity for these patents to be litigated. The basic

distribution of patent awards and suits over time is presented in Table 3. The first two

columns make clear that the number of financial patents granted has increased in recent

years and that the rate of litigation (which is expressed as suits per thousand patents

issued) peaked among the patents issued between 1990 and 1994.



       The data in column 2, however, have two limitations. First, not all cases are

reported to the PTO. Lanjouw and Schankerman address this issue by comparing the

number of cases reported to the PTO with the number of case filings identified as patent

related by the Federal Judicial Center. This administrative office compiles a

comprehensive database of all litigation. It does not, however, indicate which patents

were involved in individual cases, so cannot be used as the basis for the analysis here.

From this information, Lanjouw and Schankerman are able to compute an adjustment

factor (reported in Appendix I of their 2003 paper), which scales up the number of

reported cases to reflect non-reporting.




                                            12
        The second limitation has to do with the fact that all patents are not litigated

immediately after issue. Rather, a considerable number of cases are initiated involving

patents that are a few years old (the probability of litigation drops considerably for older

patents). Because many of the patents in the sample are quite young (having been

awarded as recently as mid-2003), this truncation bias may be significant. I report two

adjustments to the number of lawsuits:

    •   First, based on the actual distribution of litigation over time of all patents awarded

        between 1982 and 1986, Lanjouw and Schankerman [2003, Appendix I] report

        adjustment factors: i.e., factors that allow one to compute the total expected

        amount of litigation over a patent’s lifetime based on the extent of such activity in

        the initial years after award.8

    •   Second, I look at the propensity to litigate financial patents specifically. Using the

        number of lawsuits in each year after each patent award in the sample as the

        dependent variable, I estimate the propensity of patents in different age groups

        and technology classes and with different grant dates to be litigated. I then use

        these coefficients to predict the amount of litigation over the patent’s lifespan.




8
 There are two subtle differences between my procedure and Lanjouw and
Schankerman’s. First, the earlier authors assumed that there was only one patent per
lawsuit due to the limitations in the early Derwent data noted above, while I researched
the cases to determine missing patents. Because there are on average 1.3 patents per case
in my sample, my reported litigation rate will be slightly higher. Second, approximately
twenty percent of the entries in the Derwent database are duplicate records, referring to
different actions in the same suit. I deleted these entries (which apparently was not done
by Lanjouw and Schankerman). Thus, collectively these two adjustments should have a
very modest effect on the comparisons.


                                             13
       Because the litigation of financial patents tends to be more concentrated in the

       later years after the award, this generates larger estimates than the first approach.



       Columns 3 and 4 present the adjusted amount of litigation. Once these corrections

are made, there is no clear time trend in the amount of litigation: the upward adjustments

are greatest for the oldest patents (due to the severe non-reporting biases in early years)

and the most recent ones (because of their greater truncation). Comparing the litigation

rates in the third column to the similarly adjusted data of Lanjouw and Schankerman

[2001, Table 1], the overall rate of litigation is 27 times greater than in their overall

sample of awards; using the fourth, it is 39 times greater.



       The rate of patent litigation is far greater than that in other fields. In the

technology group with the greatest litigation rate in the Lanjouw-Schankerman sample,

“drugs and health,” has a litigation rate that is less than 7% that seen in financial patents.

Nor do other emerging technologies—where uncertainty is presumably greater—appear

to have rates approaching financial patents. For instance, Lerner [1995] examines the

litigation of the first 2048 biotechnology awards. He finds that the rate of litigation was

less than one-fifth the rate seen here.



C. The Distribution of Litigation

       Table 4 considers the litigation rate for patents with different classes of owners.

Here again, there are dramatic differences across the various sub-samples:




                                             14
    •   Patents assigned to individuals are five times more likely to be litigated than

        those held by public corporations, and about 50% more likely to be so than those

        held by private firms (which include both smaller operating firms and patent

        holding companies).

    •   Patents by individuals and institutions in the United States are 8 to 10 times more

        likely to be litigated than foreign-owned ones.

    •   The litigation rate of firms of different sizes differs dramatically. Among patents

        awarded to firms with fewer than 200 employees at the time, for instance, there is

        more than one lawsuit per patent. Among the patents awarded to the largest firms

        (those with over 200,000 employees), there is no litigation at all in this sample.

        When firms are segmented by revenues, a similarly dramatic pattern appears.

The prevalence in litigation of patents by small firms and individual inventors is quite

striking.



        I compare the characteristics of the patents themselves in Table 5. I examine

domestic and foreign patentees separately, as their citation practices may differ. I contrast

patents that are and are not litigated. Like litigated patents overall, litigated financial

patents have more forward citations and claims. The difference in the number of forward

citations, however, is much smaller and no longer statistically significant at the five-

percent confidence level when I compute citations per claim. Thus, while litigated

financial awards may be more expansive in their claims, they are not disproportionately




                                             15
cited once the number of claims is controlled for. Litigated patents do, however, cite

more prior art.9



        I then turn in Table 6 to a regression analysis to explain the prevalence of

litigation. The unit of observation is each patent award in the sample. I employ two

dependent variables in the reported regressions. The first is an indicator denoting as one

instances where the patent was litigated before the end of 2005, and zero otherwise. This

is in the first column, which features a probit analysis. The second (in the remaining

columns) is the count of lawsuits in which the patent was involved. In these cases, I

estimate Poisson and negative binomial specifications. (I do not adjust the dependent

variable here for truncation or reporting biases, instead employing dummy variables for

each patent award year.)



        In the first three regressions (which include a probit analysis as noted above, as

well as a Poisson and more robust negative binomial regression when using the count of



9
 In the discussion above, I have argued that forward citations proxy for importance,
which drives litigation. There might be another relationship between citations and
innovation, however: patents that are litigated might be more frequently cited, not
because they are more important, but rather because the publicity generated by the
lawsuit calls attention to the award. This might lead to false inferences. In an unreported
table, I test for the presence of a publicity effect. In particular, for all litigated patents, I
look at the mean number of citations obtained in the years before and after the patent was
litigated. Part of the difference in citations between litigated and non-litigated patents
appears to be driven by a “publicity effect.” In the three years after the dispute, the
litigated patents garner 5.2 more forward citations relative to the baseline before the
inception of litigation. (By the fourth year, the citation rate has returned to the baseline.)
For the mean patent in the sample, which is twelve years old, this translates into a little
under one-half of a citation per year. This accounts for roughly 23% of the difference in
annual forward citation rates for litigated and non-litigated financial patents (4.0 and 2.1).



                                               16
lawsuits), I employ a set of independent variables suggested by the theoretical discussion

above.10 These include the number of claims, the logarithm of one plus the number of

forward and backward citations per claim, dummy variables denoting cases where there

were no forward or backward citations, and the share of citations that are self-citations

(which may be informative about the importance of the patent to the firm or just citation

practices).11



           Each of these regressions paints a consistent story. Patents ranking higher on the

proxies for importance—those with more claims and with more forward and backward

citations—are more likely to be litigated. The controls for self-citations are consistently

insignificant.



           In Table 7, I explore the magnitude of the coefficients. I analyze the first, third,

fourth and fifth regressions reported in Table 6. In the first column, I report the predicted

dependent variable at the means of the continuous variables and with the binary variables

coded as zero. In the subsequent rows, I change one independent variable at a time, e.g.,

increasing the number of claims by one standard deviation or shifting the binary variable

denoting a U.S. assignee from zero to one. In each case, I show the change in predicted

dependent variable as the independent variable is shifted.




10
  The sample size is smaller in the first regression. Some observations are dropped from
the probit regression because a zero or one outcome is perfectly predicted.
11
     In cases where there are no citations, I code the share of self-citations as zero.


                                                 17
       These provide an illustration of the magnitude of the effects delineated above. For

instance, regarding the finding that patents with more claims are more frequently

litigated, a one standard deviation increase in the third regression increases the predicted

number of suits per thousand patents from 24 to 64. Those with more forward citations

also experience an increase—a one standard deviation boost in the third regression raises

the litigation rate per thousand to 49. Patents with more backwards citations, which again

may suggest more important awards, similarly experience an increase in the litigation rate

(to 40 per thousand).



       Regression 4 adds a variety of characteristics of the patentee to the specification.

(Once again, each patent is a separate observation, so some patentees are represented

multiple times in the regression). Consistent with the cross-tabulations in Table 4, patents

awarded to public corporations are far less likely to be litigated: the predicted litigation

rate falls by two-thirds. Those patents awarded to U.S. residents are more likely to be so.

(The patterns concerning individuals are statistically insignificant.) When I add the

logarithm of employment (in thousands) and sales (in millions of 2003 dollars) in the

year of the award to the specification in regressions 5 and 6, larger firms’ patents are

associated with less litigation, as before. (In each case, I add one to the count of

employees or sales before taking the logarithm.) For instance, a one standard deviation

increase in employment in the fifth regression reduces the expected amount of litigation

by 70%. We will defer discussing the implications of these results until we explore the

distribution of defendants in these cases in Section 4.




                                             18
       Another natural question is whether there is a time trend in the pattern of

litigation. On the one hand, the uncertainty around patent value is likely to have increased

markedly after the State Street decision. On the other hand, the increase in financial

patent filings after this decision may mean that more marginal discoveries were being

patented post-decision. Chart 1 shows the coefficient on each annual dummy variable in

the first negative binomial regression in Table 6 (the third regression). Not only are there

no consistent patterns over time, but the year dummies are collectively and individually

insignificant. A similar pattern emerges from year dummies in the other regressions.

Perhaps reflecting the countervailing pressures, no pattern in the propensity to litigate

appears around the time of the decision.



D. Robustness Checks

       I undertake a variety of robustness checks to examine whether the results are

sensitive to the specification used. Most of these changes appear to have little impact.



       The first concern is whether the results are sensitive to my assumption that the

appropriate time control was the date of award. It is reasonable to control for award date,

as older patents may be more frequently litigated simply because they had more time to

generate conflicts and the propensity to litigate will vary over time (patents can typically

not be litigated until they are awarded). But it may be that there are systematic patterns

in the patents applied for over time. To address this concern, I repeat in unreported

regressions the specifications reported in Table 6, now also employing dummy variables

for the application year. The key results are little changed.




                                             19
       Another possibility is that the specification is problematic because it fails to

account for the large number of zero observations in the sample. One way to address this

problem is to estimate a zero-inflated negative binomial specification, in which a first

stage estimates the probability that the patent is litigated at all, and the second focuses on

the number of suits filed conditional on there being litigation. I report the second stage in

column 7 of Table 6, again using a second-stage specification akin to that in column 3.

(The first stage, which includes controls for the year of the award, the employment and

sales of the firm, and the status of the assignee, is not reported.) The basic results go

through as before. In unreported regressions, I repeated the other analyses using zero-

inflated equations, and found that the key results were qualitatively unchanged. Similarly,

I re-estimate the equations in Table 6 using a Tobit specification, and find that the results

are qualitatively unchanged.



       Another concern is that lawsuits may vary in intensity. In some cases, suits may

be dropped or settled soon after being filed; in others, litigation may progress for years.

(Of course, a suit that is quickly settled for a large amount may also be very disruptive to

a defendant.) In order to measure the intensity of litigation, I total the number of docket

filings in each case, using the records of the PACER system.12




12
  In approximately five percent of the cases, I am unable to obtain the index of the docket
file, either through PACER or an examination of the physical docket. In these instances, I
assume that the case had zero docket entries. I also repeat the analysis, assuming that
these missing cases have the mean number of docket entries, and find that the results are
essentially unchanged.


                                             20
       I then estimate Tobit regressions, employing the cumulative number of docket

entries in the lawsuits associated with each patent as the dependent variable. Table 8

reports the regressions corresponding to the negative binomial analyses in columns 3

through 6 of Table 6. The primary results that appeared in the earlier regressions continue

to go through as before.



       I also undertook a variety of other robustness checks in unreported analyses.

Among the changes were:

   •   Using the adjusted counts of lawsuits, as in Tables 3 and 4, rather than the actual

       counts as the dependent variable in the regressions. (In the reported regression, by

       using dummies for the year of issue, I addressed the differing vintages of the

       patents.) In ordinary least squares regressions, the results were similar in both the

       magnitude of marginal effects and statistical significance.

   •   Repeating the analysis using alternative measures of patent importance, such as

       originality and generality (Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg [2002]) in lieu of the

       citation counts. These alternative measures proved to have limited explanatory

       power.

   •   Employing the additional financial data available about publicly traded firms. The

       basic patterns continued to hold when these controls were added.

   •   Adding fixed effects for the firms awarded the patents. In regressions akin to that

       reported in column 3 of Table 6, the results were little changed: patents with more

       forward citations and claims were significantly more likely to be litigated. When

       measures of firm characteristics were added, however, these coefficients’



                                            21
         significance dropped sharply from the reported regressions, which reflected the

         fact that the features of the firms only changed slowly (if at all).

     •   Dividing the patentees by those above and below the median employment (and in

         a separate analysis, sales). Among both large and small patentees, the basic

         patterns held: patents with more claims and citations are more frequently litigated.

         The relationship between firm size and probability of litigation, however, is only

         statistically significant among the smaller firms.



4. Analysis of Defendants

         In the analysis in Section 3, I analyze which patents are litigated. I now turn to

examining which firms are especially likely to be named as defendants in these actions.

Because it is difficult to observe the entire pool of potential defendants, I focus on

publicly traded firms, which I can identify and characterize.



         Theoretical work on the propensity to file litigation suggests that the costs of

litigation should matter. But, as discussed in Section 1, the predicted effects are not

obvious: larger firms should have lower litigation costs due to “learning curve” effects,

but are also more vulnerable to damage to other product lines and their reputation from

an adverse judgment. I employ several proxies for potential litigation costs:

     •   the firm’s experience (measured, admittedly imperfectly, as the logarithm of its

         age as a public entity)13



13
  I compute the age and other measures using the Compustat identifier associated with the
firm at the time of the innovation. I map in the count of innovations using the appropriate
identifier. These assignments are not always apparent, but can be determined by


                                               22
   •   its financial scale (as measured through the logarithm of assets)

   •   its financial condition (measured via its profitability, calculated as pre-tax

       operating income over sales)

   •   its leverage, measured as the ratio of the book value of the firm’s long-term debt

       to total capitalization (the book value of its long-term debt and preferred stock

       plus the market value of its common stock).

   •   the location of its headquarters (foreign firms might face greater litigation costs),

       and

   •   the extent to which it engages in innovative activities (measured by the number of

       innovations associated with that firm reported in the Wall Street Journal, the

       extent of the firm’s interconnections to academia, and the financial innovations

       occurring in the firm’s zip code, all computed in the year of the observation).

I confine the analysis to all firms with a primary assignment to Standard Industrial

Classification (SIC) codes 60–69 or else who developed a financial innovation that was

reported in the Wall Street Journal during these years. (See Lerner [2006] for a

discussion of the identification of these innovations; the results are robust to just using

financial firms.) I report the analysis for the entire sample, and then for U.S.-only firms,

and just for the period after the State Street decision. In each case, I add (but do not

report) fixed effects that control for the major three-digit Standard Industrial

Classification classes in the sample.


reviewing the corporation’s history using the Hoover’s directory, Lexis-Nexis, the SDC
Mergers and Acquisitions database, and online sources. Thus, for instance, an innovation
by Wachovia Bank in 1999 would be assigned to Compustat GVKEY 11247 (denoted
‘‘Wachovia Corp-Old’’), while one by First Union Bank in that year would be assigned
to GVKEY 4739 (denoted ‘‘Wachovia Corp,’’ reflecting the fact that First Union
acquired Wachovia in 2001 and assumed its name).


                                            23
        The analysis, reported in Table 9, suggests that the strongest determinant of a firm

being a defendant in financial patent litigation is its scale: the coefficient measuring the

firm’s assets is consistently positively and significant. The measures of innovation are

consistently insignificant, and the firm headquarters dummies are inconsistent in sign.



        One interpretation of these patterns—as well as the earlier finding that patents

owned by individuals and smaller firms are much more likely to be litigated—harkens

back to the discussion of the costs of litigation delineated in Section 1. If large firms find

litigation substantially more costly than do other parties—presumably due to the risk of

damage to their reputation or to other lines of business from a possible injunction—they

may disproportionately be the subject of nuisance litigation, in which entities with lower

litigation costs rationally target them with dubious claims, confident that the defendants

will find it in their interest to settle the cases.



5. Conclusions

        This paper examines the litigation of financial patents. I find that financial patents

are being litigated two to three dozen times more frequently than patents as a whole. The

awards being litigated are disproportionately those awarded to individuals and to smaller,

private entities. Patents with more claims and more citations are also more frequently

litigated. Larger firms are disproportionately targeted in litigation.




                                                 24
       I argue that many of the patterns here are consistent with theoretical models of

suit and settlement. In particular, the selection of more important patents for litigation

follows directly from theoretical suggestions that high-stakes disputes should lead more

frequently to litigation. If we accept the suggestion that larger firms have significantly

greater costs of litigation, the patterns regarding the initiation of lawsuits and the targets

in litigation would be consistent with theories of nuisance litigation.



       It is less clear why we see the extraordinary high level of litigation in this area,

even when compared to other emerging technology classes. It may be that given the

substantial uncertainty and high potential rewards associated with these patents, the

pressures to proceed to litigation are particularly great. Alternatively, the differences in

the litigation costs between the various innovating parties may drive large numbers of

nuisance suits, which may explain the prevalence of litigation.



       This paper suggests a number of questions. Foremost among these are the

consequences of these patterns of litigation for innovation in financial services. For

instance, has the high level of intellectual property litigation deterred or encouraged the

introduction of new products and services in this area? How have firms’ innovative

choices been affected by this new intellectual property regime? What has been the impact

on social welfare? Understanding the consequences of these shifts are important, given

the economic impact of financial innovation.

                  Appendix A: Background on Business Method Patents14


       There has long been ambiguity about the patentability of business methods in the
United States. At least since a 1908 court decision that established the “business methods
exception,” many judges and lawyers have presumed that business methods were not
patentable subject matter. While the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) has issued
patents on financial and other business methods for several decades, many observers
questioned their validity. Consequently, patent-holders were reluctant to incur the time
and expense to litigate their awards.

        Attitudes toward business method patents changed with the July 1998 appellate
decision in State Street Bank and Trust v. Signature Financial Group. This case had
originated with a software program used to determine the value of mutual funds, on
which Signature had obtained a patent in 1993. State Street Bank sued to have the patent
invalidated on the grounds that it covered a business method and was hence not
patentable. While State Street’s argument prevailed in the district court, the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the centralized appellate court for patent cases, reversed
the finding. In its decision, the court explicitly rejected the notion of a “business method
exception.” The Supreme Court declined to hear State Street’s appeal of the appellate
decision in January 1999. In the numerous articles in the trade press that followed the two
decisions, the case was interpreted as unambiguously establishing the patentability of
business methods.

        The decision appears to have led to a substantial increase in the filing and
granting of business method patents, including financial patents. One of the major
concerns expressed about the expansion of awards in this area has been about their
quality. These concerns are at least partially supported by Lerner [2002], who shows that
while academic research is highly relevant to many financial patents, these works are far
less often cited than in patents in other academically related areas, such as biotechnology.

     This appendix is based on Lerner [2002].


                                                28
                   Appendix B: Details About Sample Construction


Patents: Following the procedure in Lerner [2006], I identify all patents assigned to
relevant US Patent Classification subclasses. Patents are classified at the time they issue
to one or more classifications. There are over one hundred thousand such classes. The
PTO takes such classifications very seriously, because they ensure that examiners will be
able to identify the relevant earlier awards when they engage in subsequent patent
searches. As in the earlier analysis, I employ all patents with a primary assignment to
subclasses 705/4, 705/35 through 705/45, and 902/1 through 902/41.

Litigation: The Derwent database is built using reports to the PTO from the district courts
where the patent litigation is initiated. While these reports are required to be filed, as
Lanjouw and Schankerman document [2001, 2003], in a considerable number of
instances (about 35% in recent years and more earlier), no such report is made. (To
address this deficiency, I adjust the computed patent litigation rates, as discussed in detail
in Section 3.B.) The data on litigation were downloaded in May 2006. There appears,
however, to be substantial reporting lags: no suits from 2006 and only one after August
2005 were found.15 From the database, I gather information on the key dates, parties, and
location of the case, as well as the patents that were involved.16 Because the lists of
litigating parties provided by Derwent are incomplete (it only assigned one patent to each
lawsuit prior to 1990, even if there were multiple ones at issue), I obtained the docket
filings for the earlier cases and augmented their records. I count the number of lawsuits
involving each patent, regarding each case as one suit even if there are multiple
defendants named.

Patentees: I define publicly traded entities as those for which financial and related
information for the year prior to the award is available from Compustat, WorldScope, or
filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. I classify as private firms all
other cases where there is a non-governmental, non-academic assignee other than the
inventor.17 For private entities, I employ a variety of sources, including the Moody’s
manuals, the Corporate Technology Directory, national directories of firms (particularly
of Japan), and directories of various segments of the financial services industry. In these
cases, I simply seek to obtain information on the revenues and employment of the firm,


15
   I assume in the calculations below that the database contains all records involving
patent litigation filed through the end of 2005. Thus, the estimates of the amount of
litigation—and the disparities from other areas of patent litigation—are slightly
understated.
16
   Because the considerable majority of patent cases ultimately settle, and these
settlements are highly diverse and rarely disclosed to the public, it is impossible to
characterize the outcomes of these cases in a systematic manner.
17
   Because it is difficult to determine whether non-U.S. foreign firms are publicly traded,
some public firms may be misclassified as private. Given that the corporate financial
patentees are dominated by U.S. and large Japanese firms, this problem should be
limited.


                                             29
as well as the nation in which its headquarters is based. If I am unable to identify the
relevant information in the year of award, I use information from the year beforehand or,
if this is not available, the year after the award. In many cases, however, I am unable to
locate the sales and revenue information: many of the assignees are small patent holding
companies that keep extremely low profiles. I am, however, able to characterize the
location of all assignees: if information on firm location is not available from the above
databases, I employ the location of the assignee as identified in the issued patent. If there
is no assignee, I use the location of the inventor.

Potential defendants: Information on financial health and headquarters location are taken
from Compustat. I count innovations by a given firm by totaling the stories about
innovative financial products or services introduced by that firm in the Wall Street
Journal in a given year. I characterize the potential for knowledge spillovers by totaling
the number of innovations by firms headquartered in the same zip code in the same year.
I characterize the extent to which each firm is close to the academic frontier by
employing the firm’s representation on the editorial boards of four leading academic-
practitioner journals, normalized by the firm’s assets. I calculate each firm’s editorial
board seats at the beginning of each year. I count a firm that is a sponsor of a journal as
having the equivalent of two editorial board seats. Lerner [2006] provides more details on
these measures.

Table 6: Regression Estimates of Number of Lawsuits

The sample consists of 2942 financial patents issued between January 1976 and August 2003. The dependent variable in the first regression is a
dummy variable indicating whether the patent was ever litigated; in the remaining regressions, it is the count of lawsuits involving the patent. The first
regression employs a probit specification; the second is a Poisson estimation; and the remainder use negative binomial specifications.

The seventh regression is the second stage of a set of equations that controls for probability of no litigation occurring at all.
Table 7: Estimated Litigation Probabilities

The sample consists of 2942 financial patents issued between January 1976 and August 2003. The dependent variable in the regression in the first row is a dummy variable indicating
whether the patent was ever litigated; in the remaining regressions, it is the count of lawsuits involving the patent. The regression in the first row employs a probit specification and the
remainder use negative binomial specifications. The first column presents the predicted dependent variable at the means of the continuous variables and with the binary variables coded as
zero; the other columns show the change in predicted dependent variable as one variable at a time is shifted.

Table 9: Regression Estimates of Financial Patent Litigation Defendants

 The sample consists of 15,397 annual observations of financial firms and financial innovators (see
   text) in Compustat between 1990 and 2002. The dependent variable is the count of filings in all
  patent lawsuits with the firm as a defendant in the year of the observation. All regressions employ
                                    negative binomial specifications.
