                                             ABSTRACT

Using a unique new dataset linking administrative data on investment performance and financial knowledge,
we examine whether investors who are more financially knowledgeable earn more on their retirement
plan investments, compared to their less sophisticated counterparts. We find that risk-adjusted annual
expected returns are 130 basis points higher for the most financially knowledgeable employees, and
those scoring higher on our Financial Knowledge Index have slightly more volatile portfolios while
they do no better diversifying their portfolios than their peers. Overall, financial knowledge does appear
to help people invest more profitably; this may provide a rationale for efforts to enhance financial
knowledge in the population at large.

           Financial Knowledge and 401(k) Investment Performance

        Numerous studies show that more financially knowledgeable people accumulate more

retirement wealth.1 Several explanations have been offered for this finding, including the fact

that more financially sophisticated people are more likely to plan and save for the future

(Berhman et al. 2012; Lusardi and Mitchell 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011a and b). Also, they also are

more aware of, and manager better, the fees and charges associated with financial products

(Hastings and Mitchell 2011, Choi et al. 2010). Moreover, more sophisticated people are more

likely to invest in stocks (van Rooij, Lusardi and Alessie (2011) and Yoong (2011)). But, as yet,

little is known about whether more financially knowledgeable people also earn higher returns on

their retirement saving. This paper contributes to the literature by showing that financial

knowledge enables defined contribution (DC) plan investors to earn higher risk-adjusted

expected returns compared to their less-sophisticated counterparts.

        This is an important topic since, with the spread of 401(k) plans, which are the most

common form of DC plans in the U.S., plan participants are increasingly required to take on

responsibility for managing their individual retirement accounts.2 In the 1980’s, for instance,

only 40 percent of U.S. private-sector retirement contributions went to DC pensions; two

decades later, 90 percent of contributions are flowing to DC retirement accounts (see Poterba et

al., forthcoming). If financial knowledge can be shown to enable people to better allocate

resources over their lifetimes in a world of individual responsibility, this could motivate private

(and perhaps public) efforts to enhance financial knowledge for the larger population. The ability

  Potential changes in other employer-provided retirement benefits (e.g., health saving accounts and health
reimbursement accounts) are also likely to enhance the importance of individually-managed retirement saving.
These accounts also may require employees to contribute to and manage individual saving accounts.

to invest wisely and earn better returns will therefore be increasingly critical for national

retirement wellbeing in an aging world.3

         In what follows, we use a novel dataset which links a unique administrative dataset on

retirement plan investment performance with a survey which permits us to measure and evaluate

employees’ financial knowledge. Our results show that more financially knowledgeable

investors earn substantially better risk-adjusted investment returns. Specifically, expected risk-

adjusted annual returns are 130 basis points higher for the most financially literate investors, as

compared to the financially unsophisticated. This advantage could have important implications

over a lifetime of saving for retirement, and it might help account for large differences in

retirement wealth in the population.



Prior Research

         In our recent review of the economic impact of financial literacy on retirement planning

and saving (Lusardi and Mitchell 2014), we described numerous studies suggesting that people

with better understanding of economic and finance fundamentals also have higher wealth.

         A potential explanation for this observation might be that financially knowledgeable

individuals earn higher returns. While there is some suggestive evidence supportive of this

hypothesis, confirming it empirically has been difficult since, to our knowledge, researchers have

not had access to datasets reporting both financial knowledge questions and detailed

administrative data on investment holdings and returns. Some authors have shown that better-

3
  While investors might be able to substitute financial advice instead of enhancing their own financial literacy,
recent evidence (Bricker et al. 2012; EBRI 2013) indicates that fewer than one-third of Americans consults financial
advisors, lawyers, or accountants for investment help. Of those, only a quarter followed the advice. Moreover,
Calcagno and Monticone (2011) argue that non-independent advisors do not offset clients’ low levels of financial
knowledge, and Collins (2012) concludes that financial advice is a complement to, rather than a substitute for,
financial knowledge. Clark et al. (2014) report most people (62%) get their investment advice from family and
relatives. Kim et al. (2013) explore the tradeoff between hiring a financial adviser and investing in on-the-job human
capital.
                                                                                                  3

educated households hold more stock than their less-educated counterparts (Haliassos and

Bertaut 1995; Calvet et al. 2007; 2009a, b; 2014), but that research did not measure any specific

effect of respondent financial knowledge. Bodnaruk and Simonov (2012) examined the

portfolios of private mutual fund managers and concluded that financial experts did not make

better investment decisions than their less savvy counterparts. That study also lacked a direct

measure of investor financial knowledge. In related work, Grinblatt et al. (2013) explored the

links between cognitive functioning (IQ), business education, and investment performance in a

Finnish dataset. They reported that higher-IQ investors were less likely to pay high mutual fund

fees, and business education also played an important role. Christelis et al. (2010) and Jappelli

and Padula (2013a, b) noted that cognitive ability, proxied by math scores in school, was

associated with more stock market participation. Yet Lusardi et al. (2010) showed that, while

cognitive ability is positively associated with financial knowledge, it is not the sole determinant.

In other words, there remains substantial heterogeneity in financial literacy even after controlling

for cognition.

       A separate group of researchers has examined this topic by drawing on surveys of

financial literacy but without detailed information on people’s actual investment holdings. For

instance van Rooij et al. (2011) used self-reported data on stocks and mutual funds by Dutch

households, and they found a positive correlation between financial knowledge and stock market

participation. Similarly, Yoong (2011) used a US survey with a battery of financial knowledge

questions and again reported that the more financially knowledgeable were more likely to say

they held stocks and mutual funds (controlling for other factors). Nevertheless, neither study had

the administrative information to link fund holdings, investment performance, and financial

knowledge.
                                                                                                 4

       In addition to asking whether more knowledgeable individuals earn higher investment

returns on their portfolios, it is also important to ascertain whether this might be due to better

diversification patterns. For instance von Gaudecker (2011) showed that more knowledgeable

respondents reported holding better diversified funds in the Netherlands, though again his

analysis relied on self-reported portfolios rather than what are likely to be more accurate

administrative records.

       A different explanation for the observed positive relationship between financial

knowledge and wealth is that, in the retail market at least, sophisticated investors might pay

lower fees on their investments, thereby enhancing their net returns. Lab experiments by Choi et

al. (2010) found that people who deemed themselves more financially knowledgeable did elect

lower-fee investment options than their counterparts. Indeed those authors concluded (p. 1408):

“mistakes driven by financial illiteracy are the primary source of the demand for high-fee index

funds.” In a Chilean field experiment, Hastings et al. (2011) used a financial literacy module to

examine whether less financially knowledgeable respondents were differentially sensitive to how

pension plan fee information was framed. They reported that the less financially knowledgeable

were more sensitive to this framing, and that financial knowledge scores and education were

sufficiently uncorrelated to effectively test their separate impacts. Yet that study did not assess

how financial knowledge affected respondents’ pension plan investment performance. In related

work, financial literacy has been found to affect return on simple assets such as saving accounts:

for instance, Deuflhard et al. (2013) linked saving account returns earned by Dutch survey

respondents to a set of financial literacy questions and to information on bank interest rates.

Their study concluded that financial knowledge was associated with higher returns on saving

accounts; interestingly, some of this impact appeared to be attributable to people’s willingness to
                                                                                                                  5

use self-managed online banking. Nevertheless, their database did not contain information on

any more sophisticated investments. 4

        In sum, previous financial literacy studies have not had access to high-quality

administrative data on sophisticated investments nor linked outcomes to detailed information on

investors’ financial knowledge levels. In what follows, we use a new dataset to explore whether

financial knowledge is associated with investment behavior and investment performance.



Data and Methods

        We investigate the link between financial knowledge and investment performance using a

unique new dataset from a large financial institution (hereafter, the institution) employing over

20,000 individuals across the U.S. This institution offers to its employees a defined contribution

retirement plan with a fund menu including stock and bond index choices, target date funds,

lifestyle funds (conservative, moderate, aggressive), international and emerging market funds,

and a real estate fund.

        The institution provided us with administrative records on each employee’s contribution

rates and investment allocations across the fund menu, which we then link to fund returns data as

detailed below. Accordingly, we have information on which of the funds offered by the plan

sponsor each participant had selected. Using this linkage and 10 years of historical net returns for

the investment menu, we computed each participant’s equity allocation and own portfolio

performance metrics as of 2013. Moreover, in cooperation with the employee benefits office of

the institution, we fielded an internet survey on financial knowledge via email in October of

2013. Under confidentiality conditions, these responses were linked to the administrative records



4
 It is unclear whether that evidence is particularly informative about U.S. 401(k) participants, most of whom hold a
mix of stocks and bonds in their portfolios.

on respondents’ investment allocations immediately prior to the survey, along with their personal

characteristics (including sex, age, marital status, job tenure, salary, and 401(k) plan balances).

In what follows we describe our data and methodology.

A. Measuring Financial Knowledge

        With our input, the employee benefits office designed and fielded an online survey on the

financial knowledge levels of approximately 22,000 employees. Some 16% of these individuals

responded to the invitation to take the survey, a response rate similar to other voluntary and non-

incentivized surveys.5 Our respondent sample differs from the nonparticipating sample in some

unsurprising ways: for instance, Table 1 shows those who responded to the survey contributed

1.7 percentage points more of their pretax salary; additionally, they had significantly higher plan

balances, held about two percentage points more equity, were about five years older, and had

worked for the institution about four years longer than their non-responsive counterparts. To the

extent that employees who participated in our survey were probably more financially

sophisticated than nonparticipants, the effects we report below are likely to underestimate the

results that would be obtained from a survey covering all employees.

Table 1 here

        We measure respondent financial knowledge using five questions from the online survey

(correct answers are provided in bold):

       Interest Rate: Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2%
        per year. After 5 years, how much do you think you would have in the account if you left
        the money to grow? More than $110, Exactly $110, Less than $110, DK, RF
       Inflation: Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1% per year and
        inflation was 2% per year. After 1 year, how much would you be able to buy with the
        money in this account? More than today, Exactly the same , Less than today, DK, RF

  This response rate is in line with what is found in many other online, nonmandatory, and nonincentivized surveys

         Risk: Is this statement True or False? Buying a single company’s stock usually provides
          a safer return than a stock mutual fund. True, False, DK, RF
         Tax Offset: Assume you were in the 25 percent tax bracket (you pay $0.25 in tax for
          each dollar earned) and you contributed $100 pretax to an employer’s 401(k) plan. Your
          take-home pay (what’s in your paycheck after all taxes and other payments are taken out)
          will then: Decline by $100, Decline by $75, Decline by $50, Remain the same, DK
         Match: Assume that an employer matched employee contributions dollar for dollar. If
          the employee contributed $100 to the 401(k) plan, his account balance in the plan
          including his contribution would: Increase by $50, Increase by $100, Increase by $200,
          Remain the same , DK

          The first question measures people’s ability to do a simple interest rate calculation; the

second tests people’s understanding of inflation; and the third is a joint test of knowledge about

“stocks” and “stock mutual funds” as well as risk diversification, since the correct response

requires the respondent to know both what a stock is and that a mutual fund is comprised of

many stocks. The first three questions were developed by Lusardi and Mitchell (2008; 2011a)

and have been used in many other national surveys in the United States including the National

Longitudinal Survey of Youth, the American Life Panel (Lusardi, Mitchell and Curto, 2010, and

Lusardi and Mitchell, 2009), and the US National Financial Capability Study (Lusardi, 2011).

They have also been fielded in 12 other countries as well (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011c, 2014).

The last two questions were used in surveys fielded in large firms by Clark, Maki and Morrill

(2014).

          Our prior research showed that very few Americans can answer all of the first three

questions correctly (with similar results in other countries), and not many more know the correct

answers to a majority of them. By contrast, this workforce was substantially more financially

knowledgeable (as measured by the first three queries) than the general population, an

unsurprising result given that the group consists of financial sector employees (Table 2).

Specifically, 76 percent of the respondents got the Interest Rate question correct, 92 percent the

Inflation question, and 88 percent knew the right answer to the Risk question. This can be
                                                                                                       8

compared to 75 percent, 61 percent, and 48 percent correct response rates to the interest,

inflation, and risk diversification questions in the nationally representative 2012 National

Financial Capability Study (FINRA Investor Education Foundation, 2012) which is also an

online survey, as was ours.6

Table 2 here

        The final two financial knowledge questions, developed by Clark, Maki, and Morrill

(2014), proved to be more difficult, even for such a relatively sophisticated group. This is

understandable since the queries required respondents to understand how employer and

employee contributions influence pension accumulations, taking into account the tax

implications of worker pre-tax contributions. In the Tax Offset question, the employee had to

understand that the tax-deferred aspect of own contributions reduced the net cost of payments

into the plan. Here only 45 percent of respondents answered correctly. The Match question

required the employee to know that a dollar-for-dollar match meant that $100 of own

contributions would generate an equal employer contribution; moreover employer match dollars

are not taxed when contributed to the plan. This last question was easier to answer for this

population, and 78 percent scored correctly.

        As is conventional, we sum the correct answers to these questions to produce a Financial

Knowledge Index for each person. The Index values range from 0 to 5, with a mean of 3.7 and a

standard deviation of 1.2. One-third answered all five questions correctly, and just under two

percent (46 respondents) got all three questions wrong.

B. Investment Metrics

        This institution offered 16 funds in its 401(k) plan portfolio, including a government securities

fund, a TIPS fund, and several bond funds, along with several equity funds and a REIT Index Fund.

                                                                                                                     9

Descriptive statistics regarding fund returns (net of expenses, measured over a 10-year period to

September 2013) and asset allocation patterns (measured as of October 2013) appear in Table 3.7 The

first three columns on fund returns show that, over this period (and not surprisingly), bond funds

generally earned returns below those of the equity and REIT funds, and they also experienced lower

volatility.

         The next four columns report the share of assets held by survey participants who responded to the

knowledge questions, as well as sorted by their Index score. Interestingly, the least knowledgeable were

substantially less likely to hold the equity index, international equity and small company equity funds.

Conversely, when they did invest in stock, they were more likely to invest in the conservative asset

allocation fund; overall they were much more likely to be holding bonds than not.

Table 3 here

         To further compare participant investment behavior and performance in the defined

contribution plan, we use four measures found in the literature. The first is the fraction of equity

in participants’ retirement portfolios,8 computed from retirement plan assets as of October 2013.

While financial sophistication need not imply that all participants will hold more equity, it is

likely that more knowledgeable individuals will invest more in equities compared to their less-

knowledgeable counterparts.

         For our second measure, we compute each participant’s risk-adjusted excess returns,

                      N
defined as rj e   k rk . Here k refers to the portfolio weight of the kth fund in the jth
                     k 1



participant’s pension account, and rk is the excess return of the kth benchmark over Treasury

 Fund return correlations are provided in Appendix Table 1.

 The equity allocation refers to the fraction of contributions directed to US equity funds, international equity funds,
and a percentage of balance/lifecycle funds. The equity percentage for balanced/target date funds is calculated based
on each fund’s investment policy which varies from fund to fund.
                                                                                                                                                 10

bills in a given month.9 We hypothesize that the more financially sophisticated are likely to earn

higher excess returns.

           Third, we compute the standard deviation of these excess returns to determine whether

those with more financial knowledge can expect relatively more or less volatile excess return

streams. Our fourth performance measure is the participant’s portfolio idiosyncratic risk share,

computed using the variance-covariance matrix of all assets ̂ decomposed into its systematic

and idiosyncratic components:

                      ˆ j   'j ,k ˆ  j ,k   'j ,k (ˆ sys  Dˆ idio ) j ,k  ˆ sys
                                                                                        j j
                                                                                            ˆ idio


where D̂ is the diagonal matrix with diagonal elements computed as the square of ˆn .

           Our final measure reflects how much of the participant’s portfolio variance is attributable

to nonsystematic or non-market factors. The idiosyncratic risk share is then the ratio of the

participant’s idiosyncratic portfolio risk to his total portfolio variance, NSR / TV j ,t  ˆ idio
                                                                                                j   / ˆ j .

monthly returns on the assets held in fund i ( ri ,t   i                          R t   i ,t ). Following Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini

We anticipate that the more financially knowledgeable are likely to have lower relative levels of

nonsystematic risk.10

         All four attributes of investors’ performance are summarized in Table 4. Panel A reports

investment patterns for those who did not take the survey, alongside those who did. In addition,

the panel displays investment measures by Financial Knowledge Index for those for whom we

have them. First, we note that nonparticipants held slightly less of their portfolios in equity than

those who responded to the survey; accordingly, their risk-adjusted returns, standard deviations,

and nonsystematic risk were slightly lower.11 Second, looking across the Financial Knowledge

Index groupings, those who scored lowest on the Index were also less likely to hold stocks: the

least informed held about 49% of their retirement assets in equity, whereas the most informed

held 66%. Turning to annualized risk adjusted expected returns, standard deviations, and

nonsystematic risk levels, Rows 2-4, we see only small differences between survey respondents

and non-respondents. Yet on the right side of Panel A, expected risk-adjusted returns appear

somewhat lower for the least knowledgeable, compared to the most knowledgeable. We examine

shortly whether this tabular difference persists after controlling on other factors.

Table 4 here

         Row 2 of Table 4 confirms that the most knowledgeable respondents earned 130 basis

points higher risk-adjusted excess returns annually, as compared to the least knowledgeable

counterparts (9.5%-8.2%=1.3%, a difference significant at the 1% level). This is a substantial

difference, enhancing the retirement nest egg of the most knowledgeable by 25% over a 30-year




10
  The three last measures are similar to those used in Tang et al. (2010).
11
  Appendix Table 2 compares performance metrics for those who did versus did not respond to the survey.
Controlling on other measurable factors, our results indicate that respondents were more likely to hold equity, earn
higher risk-adjusted returns, have somewhat higher portfolio volatility, and higher nonsystematic risk.
                                                                                                12

worklife.12 This confirms the surmise of Calvet et al. (2007) who contended that higher expected

returns are positively correlated with variables associated with financial sophistication (e.g.

family size, financial wealth); nevertheless, that study lacked direct measures of financial

knowledge as we have here.

       Turning to Row 3, top scorers on the Index appear to hold a somewhat more volatile

portfolio than their least knowledgeable peers, with one-fifth higher annualized standard

deviation of risk-adjusted expected returns (11.8% versus 9.2%, significant at the 1% level).

Row 4 indicates that the least knowledgeable participants had less idiosyncratic risk than their

better informed counterparts. In other words, more financially knowledgeable participants hold

more equity and would earn higher risk-adjusted returns, though their portfolios reflect more

nonsystematic risk. Panel B of Table 4 displays the number of funds held by survey participants

arrayed by financial knowledge, where we see a slight upward slope as financial knowledge

rises. The least savvy hold 3.97 funds on average, whereas the most savvy hold slightly more, at

4.13 funds (however this difference is not statistically significant).



Multivariate Analysis

       In order to test whether these findings are robust to a range of controls, we estimate a

series of multivariate regression models of the following form:

            PORTFOLIOi   FinancialKnowledgeIndexi  βX i   i                   .

Here PORTFOLIOi refers to each of four investment outcomes of interest for each participant i,

namely portfolio equity share, annualized excess return, standard deviation, and idiosyncratic

risk. The coefficient of most interest for our purposes is the term α associated with the Financial


12
    Comparing, for instance, a base return of 2% annually versus a 3.3% yearly return (see
http://illuminations.nctm.org/Activity.aspx?id=3568)
                                                                                                               13

Knowledge Index. In each case, the first model includes the Index and Index-squared term (to

test for nonlinear effects); the second model differentiates the three knowledge groups (least

knowledgeable Index = 0, 1; a middle group with Index = 2, 3; and the most knowledgeable

Index = 4, 5) with the reference category being the least knowledgeable. We also control on

participant attributes including age, sex, whether married, salary ($100K), plan balance ($100K),

and years of tenure at the institution.13

        Results appear in Table 5, where the first two rows indicate the estimated impact of

greater financial knowledge along with a squared term on our measures of interest. Rows 3-4 in

the second column of each panel provide the estimated impacts of higher Index scores relative to

the reference low knowledge reference category. In each case, participant controls available in

our dataset are also included. In particular, to help control for differences across groups, we

include controls for salary and pension wealth.

Table5 here

        Our first conclusion is that, ceteris paribus, more financially knowledgeable people hold

more equity in their portfolios, and hence they can expect higher risk-adjusted returns. These

effects are statistically significant and nonlinear: that is, the most knowledgeable hold 11.5%

more stock than their least knowledgeable counterparts and they can anticipate earning around

10 percent or one hundred basis points more (coefficient on the High Financial Literacy Index of

0.975 versus a mean of 9.142). In other words, the most financially sophisticated earn higher

risk-adjusted excess returns. Since we control on respondents’ 401(k) balances, it is remarkable

that there remains a positive and statistically significant association between excess returns and

the financial index after netting out past investment success

13
   The models also control for region-specific fixed effects and missing data dummies. We do not have information
on respondent education, but income and plan balances are reasonable proxies. We also lack risk aversion measures
in this dataset, though in other datasets, including the American Life Panel, we find that the correlation between
financial literacy and risk aversion is only 0.05 (Brown et al. 2013).
                                                                                                                     14

         A second finding is that the portfolios of the more financially knowledgeable are more

volatile, particularly for the most knowledgeable, and this finding is robust to the two alternative

functional forms explored here. Thus the portfolio of the highest scoring group has a 1.8

percentage point higher standard deviation in risk-adjusted returns, relative to the lowest scoring

one (16% on a base mean of 11%). And the last panel shows that, though the most financially

knowledgeable have higher expected returns, their portfolios exhibit 1 percentage point more

idiosyncratic portfolio risk as a fraction of total portfolio variance, NSR / TVi ,t (or 18% on a base

mean of 5.63). In other words, the most financially sophisticated hold more equity and can

expect to earn about one percentage point higher risk-adjusted returns compared to the least

financially sophisticated,14 but they diversify portfolios marginally less well than their less-

knowledgeable peers.

         It is worth recalling that those who responded to the financial knowledge survey at this

institution were somewhat better off, had higher plan balances, and contributed more of their

salaries to their retirement accounts, compared to their non-respondent counterparts. That is,

while we have little direct evidence on the levels of nonrespondents’ financial knowledge, it is

reasonable to surmise that employees who responded to the survey were likely more financially

sophisticated than those who did not. Accordingly, it is quite likely that the financial knowledge

impacts we report here are lower bound estimates of the links between knowledge and

investment performance in the larger population.



Conclusions and Discussion


14
  Since we also include the respondents’ 401(k) balance as a control variable in the regressions, this weakens the
concern about reverse causality between returns and financial knowledge. That is, the fact that there remains a
positive and statistically significant association between excess returns and the financial index after netting out past
investment success points to the fact that knowledge drives returns, rather than vice versa.
                                                                                              15

       Prior studies have not been able to establish a firm connection between investment

performance and financial knowledge. This paper remedies that gap using high-quality

administrative data on sophisticated investments and a purpose-built survey on the financial

knowledge levels of participants in a 401(k) plan. We show that more financially knowledgeable

employees are also significantly more likely to hold stocks in their 401(k) plan portfolios. They

can also anticipate significantly higher expected excess returns, which over a 30-year working

career could build a retirement fund 25% larger than that of their less-knowledgeable peers.

Their investment portfolios are also somewhat more volatile, exposing them to slightly more

idiosyncratic risk.

       These results are important in view of the growing role that 401(k) plans play in

Americans’ retirement security, and they confirm the key role of financial knowledge in the

modern workplace. The fact that more knowledgeable investors can expect to earn more in their

401(k) retirement plans is also supportive of models that posit differences in financial

sophistication as a driver of wealth inequality (e.g., Lusardi et al. 2013).

       Our estimates of the positive association between financial knowledge and investment

returns may be understated. As noted above, survey respondents at this institution were likely to

be better informed than non-respondents, implying that a stronger and more positive relationship

between knowledge and returns is likely to hold in the workforce as a whole. Additionally, this

institution provided relatively few pension investment choices, many of which were index funds.

Where more complex investment menus are available, it can be surmised that the measured

effect of financial knowledge would be even larger.

       It would be premature to offer policy recommendations, since additional research will be

needed to evaluate whether the improvements in investment performance found here are

sufficiently powerful to motivate efforts to spur greater provision of financial knowledge.
                                                                                           16

Additionally, both costs and benefits of such financial knowledge provision would need to be

considered. Nevertheless the significantly higher risk-adjusted annual expected returns of 130

basis points for the best versus the least knowledgeable confirm that financial literacy can

contribute to better earnings in 401(k) retirement plans.

Financial Knowledge Questions:                                         Mean   SD
Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was
2% per year. After 5 years, how much do you think you would have
                                                                       0.76   0.42
in the account if you left the money to grow? More than $110,
Exactly $110, Less than $110, DK, RF
Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1% per
year and inflation was 2% per year. After 1 year, how much would
                                                                       0.92   0.27
you be able to buy with the money in this account? More than today,
Exactly the same , Less than today, DK, RF
True or False? Buying a single company’s stock usually provides a
safer return than a stock mutual fund. True, False, DK, RF             0.88   0.33

Assume you were in the 25% tax bracket (you pay $0.25 in tax for
each dollar earned) and you contributed $100 pretax to an employer’s
401(k) plan. Your take-home pay (what’s in your paycheck after all     0.45   0.50
taxes and other payments are taken out) will then: Decline by $100,
Decline by $75, Decline by $50, Remain the same, DK
Assume that an employer matched employee contributions dollar for
dollar. If the employee contributed $100 to the 401(k) plan, his
                                                                       0.78   0.42
