               COMPETITION AND HUMAN CAPITAL ACCUMULATION:
            A THEORY OF INTERREGIONAL SPECIALIZATION AND THADE

We consider  a model with several regions whose technological ability and factor
endowments are identical and in which transport costs between regions are non-
                                                                           firms
negligible. Nonetheless,certain goods are sometimesproduced by multiple
all of which are located in the same region. These goods are then exported from
the regions in which their production is agglomerated.Regional agglomeration of
                                                                         firms for
production and trade stem from two forces, First, competition between
the services of trained workers is necessary for the workers to recoup the cost of
acquiring industry-specifichuman capital. Second, the technology of production
is more efficient when plants are larger than a minimum efficient scale and local
demand is insufficient to support several firms of that scale. We also study the
policy implications of our model.

     Regional agglomeration in the production of goods is pervasive: the Swiss special-
ize in the production of watches and chocolates; Silicon Valley in computers; and shoes,
haute couture, and movies originate disproportionately in Italy, Paris, and Hollywood
respectively. Regional specialization extends evento product subcategories. Within auto-
mobiles, luxury sedans tend to come from Germany, sports cars from Italy, and reliable
forms of basic transportation from Japan. While, as the Heckscher-Ohlin model has it,
some of this regional agglomeration results from differences in factor endowments, much of
it is difficult to explain in that manner. For example, regional specialization in industrial
products such as shoes and watches does not seem to be driven by the abundance of any
particular factor.
    The standard alternativeexplanationof regional agglomeration (e.g. Marshall (1920),
Melvin (1969), Markusen and Melvin (1981) and Ethier (1982)) is that, for given inputs,
the output of an individual firm is larger the larger is the aggregate output of other
firms producing the same good in the same region. So, for example, the level of inputs
required by a new watchmaker to produce a given output is lower if that entrant locates in
Switzerland where there are other watch manufacturers. Romer (1986) and Lucas (1988)
have shown that external returns of this type can also explain the fact that some nations
seem to remain forever more advanced than others.
     A possible source of external economies of this kind is the spillover of knowledge i.e.,
the possibility that knowledge acquired by one agent can be used by others. In order for
knowledge spillovers to provide a compelling explanation, however, it must be the case
that they are somehow localized. If an engineer in Taiwan can reverse engineer a product
of Silicon Valley as easily as an inhabitant of Silicon Valley, there is no good reason for

                                             1
regional concentration     of computer companies.
    Marshall (1920) posits instead that the external economies arise from proximity to
specialized inputs. As noted by Helpman and Krugman (1985), unless there is a natural

comparative advantage      for the production of these inputs in the region, this explanation
is incomplete.     The puzzle is simply rolled back to the previous production stage: Why do
the producers of inputs locate in the region?
     Our theory is that the location decisions of the firms and their input suppliers are
interdependent. Input suppliers find it advantageous to be located where they have several

potential customers because competition among their downstream customers assures them
a fair return. In the absence of such competition, the relatively immobile suppliers would
be subject to the monepsony power of the downstream firms. Foreseeing that monopsony

power would be used        to drive       down input prices, potential input suppliers would not

choose to invest ex ante in the accumulation          of the capital necessary to supply the inputs
efficiently.   This critical   role   of competitionin securing a return to suppliers   is one   of the
elements in Porter's (1989) broad treatise on regional agglomeration.
      For concreteness, the particular input we focus on is industry specific human capital
which is costlyfor individuals to acquire, such as the specific hand-eye coordinationneeded
to cut diamonds or the skills which facilitate the creation of a new           chocolate concoction.
If trained workers     can choose among several potential employers, they will be paid as a

function of their marginal product. By contrast,           if there   is only one potential employer,
and   it is impossible to write contracts that specify the level of training, there is no reason
for this monopeonist to pay trained employees any more than untrained employees earn
(in this industry or elsewhere). The hold-up problem described by Williamson (1975)
arises. Confronted with the prospect of a single potential employer, workers do not find it
worthwhile to accumulate human capital. Moreover, if entry by firms is costly, firms will
themselves refrain from entering if they can expect to be the only firm in the industry.

The industry can only exist with several closely located competitors.
      If there is a minimum efficient scale below which each firm cannot operate profitably,
the necessity of having several competing firms for an industry to be viable implies that the

region's output may haveto be substantiaL In particular,demand
itselfmay be insufficient to accommodate the requisite numberof firms. Then the onlyway
of ensuring competition among firms is to have several of them locate in one region and
                                                             between spatially separated

regions with the same endowments and access to the same technology
are transport costs anti it is technologically feasible to produce all of a region's consumption
locally.'
     Our theory involves an externality. The presence of other firms is necessary for each
                                                                                     trade
firm to have access to suitable workers. However, unlike the alternative theory of
based on external returns, we do not require that the presence of other firms lower the
                                                                                         is
input requirement for producing output. instead, the technology for producing output
the same in all regions.
    Because each firm needs other firms to be present for workers to become trained,
                                                                                        it

might be though that our model has multiple equilibria in someof which no firm produces.
This would be true is we insisted that the entry decisions of firms all be made simultane-
                                                                     as          this choice
ously. instead, following Farrell and Saloner (1985), we model firms making
                                                                   their intentions to each
sequentially so that, through their actions,they can communicate
other. This makes it impossible for equilibria with no productionto coexist with others in
 which production is positive.
     One of the most important implications of the traditional theory of trade based on
 external returns is that nations can be made worse off as a result of trade (see Graham
                                                                   are possible as well. These
 (1923) and Ethier (1982)). In our model such losses from trade
 losses are intimately linked to the existence of multiple equilibria. In some equilibria (the
                                                                                           the
 agglomerated equilibria)  only one region produces the good even though, in autarky,
 good is producedin both regions. At these agglomerated equilibria the importing region
                                                                             costs so that
 can be worse off, In our model this happensbecause there are transportation
 an imported good costs more than a locally produced good. In Ethier (1982) it occurs
                                                                                                  froos those rn th. ,srlr

 when one region producesnothing other than the good subject to external returns. This
 can lead its price in terms of the other good to rise relative to autarky (even though it is
 producedmore effIciently) because factor demands rise in the producing region.
      We show that, in our context at least, the equilibria with losses from trade are not
 robust. They, again, depend crucially on the absence of any mechanism that allows the
 agents to tell each other that they would like to produce the good subject to the exter-
 nality,2 Formally, losses from trade can occur in our model if workers must make their
decision whether to become trained simultaneously. To capture the possibility that work-
ers can communicate their intentions to each other we consider a variant of our model in
which workers become trained in sequence. In this case,                          the equilibrium is unique and
trade can only be beneficial.
     One difference between our theory and the traditional external returns approach is
in the role ascribed to antitrust policy. In the traditional theory, relaxation of antitrust
policy can be socially desirable. Cooperation among firms can lead them to internalize
whatever externality leads the production by one firm to lower the input requirements
of the others. This logic has led Jorde and Teece (1988), for example, to conclude that
antitrust exemptions are essential for certain US high-technology industries to succeed in
a world scale.
     By contrast, in our theory as well as in Porter (1989), society benefits from competi-
tion. The more competitionamong firms the potential suppliers of labor expect, the more
willing they are to make industry specific investments. Thus a vigorous antitrust policy
can play an important role in promoting the creation of viable export industries,
      Section 1 presentsthe simple partial equilibrium setting in which workers decide si-
multaneously whether to acquire industryspecific human capital. Section 2 embeds this
model in general equilibriumand considers trade among ex ante identical regions. That
section has several subsections in which we discuss the patterns of trade that emerge as the
number of goods and the number of regions that trade varies. In one of these subsections
we present our argument that if workers decide whether to become trained in sequence,

every region benefits from trade.
    In section 4 we consider the policy implications of our theory.  In particular we study
industrial policy, tariffs, and antitrust. Industrial policy encompasses those policies that
governments pursue to affect the location of industries. In our model, such policies can
raise welfare in the region imposing them. The reason is that the goods subject to the
externality are sometimes produced disproportionately in one region. But, the presence
of transport costs implies that regions benefit from having such goods produced locally.
Therefore, policies that ensure local production of these goods can be desirablefrom the
region's point of view.
   While tariffs can be a tool of industrialpolicy, they can also be imposed in situations
where they do not affect the regional pattern of production. The usual "optimumtariff"
argument implies that, after workers in the other region have become trained, importers
benefit from such tariffs beacuse they improve the importer's terms of trade. However,
workers in  the exporting region who foresee that tariffs will be levied, have a smaller
incentive to become trained. So, the perception that tariffs will be imposed raises the
equilibrium price of the good in the exporting region. We show that, as a result, tariffs
which are foreseen when workers seek trainingunambiguously lower welfare in both regions.
This strengthens Lapan (1988)'s argument against tariffs.

1. The Partial Equilibrium Model
    We assumethat skilled labor and entrepreneurial activitiesare the only factors of pro-
duction. The "entrepreneur",who is also a skilled worker, must perform preparatorywork
necessary to create the firm and enable    it to function. We assume that the entrepreneur
 has disutility of effort e for performing those activities. If he is successful in creating a
 firm that actually operates, however, he derives utility of v from his success.
      Thus v—c, which we assume to be positive, is the net utility from becoming a successful
 entrepreneur. We focus mainly on the case where v — e is arbitrarilysmall. As we shallsee
 below, the role of these assumptions on the costs and benefits of managing is to eliminate
 the indifference between producing and remaining idle that characterizes standard zero-
 profit competitive equilibria. We suspect that introducing even a minimal level of market
                                              S
power would have essentially the same effect.
     The other factor of production is skilled labor. At the margin,each skilled worker
can produce one unit of output. However, one of the central parameters in our analysis
is the minimum efficient scale of production. We capture the presence of efficient scale by
assuming that, to produce at all, the entrepreneur must employ S skilled workers including
himself (i.e., he must hire S- 1 additional skilled workers). An entrepreneur is thus deemed
successful, so that he receives v in utility, if his firm has S skilled workers.   S is a measure
of minimum efficient scale, but there are constant returns to scale when the firm produces
more than S. These assumptions can be formalized as follows:

                            L(OS)L(S)5         0<1, and
                                                   if                                         (i)
                                   L(9S)=0S if 0>1                                            (2)
where L(Q) is the amount of labor required to produce Q units,
      S determines the number of firms that the industry can accommodate. If S is zero
thenproduction             constant returns to scale globally and an arbitrarilylargenumber
of firms can be present at the same time. For very large values of S the industry can
accommodate at most a single firm, i.e., it is a natural monopoly. In between, the number
of firms that can operate in equilibriumfalls as S increases.
      In order to obtain the requisite skills to be useful in this industry a worker must obtain
training at a cost of h to himself. If the worker chooses not to obtain training, he can earn
w in an alternative occupation. Thus a worker will only be willing to become trained if he
can earn w + h in this industry.
      The entrepreneur is the sole residual claimant of the firm: he collects revenues from
customers and pays the other workers. So, in addition to his net utility from performing
the entrepreneurialfunction, he earns whatever profits there are in equilibrium. Despite
the fact that the "entrepreneur" receives both the profits and the net utility of success,
for clarity in what follows we shall refer to the entrepreneuras the agent who makes the
decision to form a firm and enter the industry, and the firm as the agent that, once created
by the entrepreneur,makes the operational decisions of the firm such as what wages to
offer workers.

                                              6
    The quantity of this product that is demanded equals D(P) where P is the price.
What matters for the form of equilibrium outcomes is the relationship between demand
and minimum efficient scale S. In particular, consider the demand when price equals
marginal cost w + h, D(w It). Then the outcomes depend on the ratio of D(w + h) to S.
In particular, let:
                                                                                                                      (3)

where "int" denotes "the integer part oP. Then we will show that the form of the equilibria
dependson N.
                   contrast the industry outcome when there is only a single firm in the
       Our goal is to

industry — and hence it is a monopsony purchaser of skilled labor — with one in which
firms compete for skilled workers. Since wage competition to attract workers is a critical
aspect of our theory, we explicitly examine firms' strategies in bidding for workers. By
contrast, strategic interactions in the output market are unessential to our argument. We
therefore assume that whenever there is more than one firm in the industry there exists a
fictitious Walrasian auctioneer which clears the output market. If there is only one firm,
however, we make the natural assumption that it is able to exercise its monopoly power
in the output market in the usual way.
    The timing in our model is as follows: First,                       I
                                                         individuals decide to become en-

trepreneursand perform the preparatorywork necessary for creating their firms (incurring
disutility e in the process). Second, workers, including the entrepreneurs, decide whether
to obtain training. We denote the number of workers who obtain training by L. Third, the
firms simultaneously announce wages {tii,. . , tZ}. Fourth, workersdecidewhomto work
                                                           .



for.   If two or more firms offer the highest wage, workers are assumed to spread themselves
uniformly across those firms. Finally, productiontakes place and goods are sold at a price
P which the Walrasian auctioneer sets to clear the goods market.3
   Our subgame perfect equilibriumrequires that: (i) Entrepreneursare successful; (ii)
Workers make optimal training decisions; (iii) Firms choose {t1,. .. ,  to maximize               ti}
   5We could hew con.ided anotherlIegein which firma decide which of their workere they actually eeL to produce goods.
This would not change the enslyir the firma would aek all the workera to produce. The reason is that labor u the only factor

profits; and (iv) workers make optimal employment decisions given        . .,               {i,.
     We consider two cases separately. In the first case N is greater than or equal to 2

while in the latter case it is smaller. In the former case it is feasible for two or more firms
to produce at minimum efficient scale when the "competitive" price w + h prevails. In the
latter case that is not feasible: The industryis a natural monopoly.

LL Case (i): N 2
      We show that, for v sufficiently close to e, the equilibrium has N firms and produces
the "competitive" outcome, In particular, prices and wages equal marginal resource costs
(including training), P =   = w h, and the number of workers who obtain training is
exactly the number required to satisfy market demand at that price (L = D(w h)). To
do this, we begin by exogenously specifying the number of entrepreneurs N that enter,
and examine equilibria of the subgames that ensue.
    (a) 2 < <N
      We informally describe why the competitive outcome is an equilibrium of the subgame.
In Appendix A we provide a formal proof and in Appendix                           B   we show that it is the only
one that can emerge in equilibrium.
      Consider first the entry decision of entrepreneurs. With                         P° =     w   + h = tZ1', firms
break even as long as they can produce at minimum efficient scale. Thus entrepreneurs
gain v — e by entering as long as N is in the range specified. From the workers' point of
view, anticipatingwages of w + h, any worker is indifferent between getting trained at a
cost h (and receiving a wage of w + h) and not becoming trained and taking alternative
employment at a wage w. Moreover, since all firms offer the same wage in equilibrium,
workers are happy to spread themselves uniformly across the firms. Thus workers have no
incentive to deviate. Finally, consider the firms:    If a firm unilaterally lowers its wage it
attracts no workers,4 if it raises its wage it loses money on each sale since then sZ' > P° =
w + h. So the firms have no incentive to deviate,

    To understandthe motivations of the agents, consider first the finns' wage announce-
ments. In equilibrium the firms correctly anticipatethe market clearing price. Any firm, if
it believes that its rivals are offering wages below the equilibrium market price, will itself
offer a tiny amount more than the highest wage being offered by a rival, attract all the

workers, and thereby maximize its profits. This logic drives the firms to bid the wage
up to what they believe the market clearing price will be. That is to say, they behave
analogously to Bertrand rivals in homogeneous goods output markets.
    The workers, for their part, understand that the wage will be bid up to the price
which will be set to clear the market given that L workers are employed. They therefore
correctly anticipatethat the wage will equal D1 (L). Therefore, additional workers obtain
training until the number trained workers drives the market clearing price down to the
wage at which a worker is willing to become trained and work in this industry, w + h.
     Although the industrycan accommodate up to N firms in the competitive equilibrium,
the competitive outcome can be sustainedwith just two firms in the industryand the entry
of additional firms doesn't affect the price or wage that results (as long as    N). This
is because Bertrand competition drivesthe equilibrium wage to the level of the final goods
price with just two firms in the market.
     Firms make zero profits in equilibrium. However,entrepreneurswho haveentered are
not indifferent about producing. They derive utility v from producing. Therefore, each
entrepreneur tries to attract sufficient workers to produce at least S. So, trained workers
can feel sure that entrepreneurs who have entered will competefor their services and drive
the wage to    w   + h.

     The only possible equilibria have the wage equal to w + h.5 We show, however, that
for v sufficiently close to e there is no equilibrium where the wage equals w + when  Fm



N > N. To do this we suppose, in contradiction,that the wage equals w + and consider,
                                                                              Fm



seriatim, the possibility that an equilibrium exists where (i) NS or more workers obtain
training, and (ii) fewer than NS workers do.

      If NS workers or more obtain training and all obtain employment in this industrythe
market clearing price is equal to D(NS) <w + h. But then if all the firms produce, the
workers are spreadevenly over the firms and the entrepreneurs earn v — e+D' (fTS) — (w +

h). For                   to e, this expression is negative(because D'1(S) <w + h).6

      If fewer than NS workers obtain training it is not possible for all N entrepreneurs to
be successful, i.e., there are insufficient trained workers for every entrepreneurwho entered
to produce at minimum efficient scale, But then the unsuccessful entrepreneurs could have
done better by not entering (and saving the disutility of effort e).

      If only one firm has entered and some number of workers, L, has obtained training,
the firm will pay themjust slightly above their alternative wage w and charge a priceequal
to:
                                                                             —
                                    max{D1(L),argmaxD(z)(z                       w)}.                                 (4)

The first expression is relevant when L is small so that the firm hires all the trained workers
and charges a price whichclears the market. The second expression is relevant when L is
very large so that the firm can act in the usual monopoly fashion in the goods market.
      Note that after the workers have obtained training,no-one has an incentive to deviate:
Workers will work for this firm because they do not have a viable alternative. The result,
of course, is that, anticipating that they will not be compensated for their training costs,
workers do not obtain training in the first place. This in turn means that the single
entrepreneursuffers in vain his disutility of effort e.
      (d) Entry
      We havediscmed these outcomes by fixing the initial number of firms and have shown
that entrepreneurs gain utility in equilibrium if the number of them who enter is between 2
and N but lose utility otherwise. We now turn our attentionto the questionof the number
of entrepreneurs who will enter initially.

     We follow Farrell and Saloner          and assume that potential entrants must decide

                                                                  decides whether to enter
whether to enter in sequence, i.e., the second potential entrant
                                                        will enter. This ensures that firms
only after he knows whether the first potential entrant
can communicate   their intentions vis-a-vls entry through their actions. In the case where
                                                                than making all firms decide
only a few firms will ever enter this seems more appealing
                                                       forces firms to make their decision in

 1.3. Discussion
     The results of the model can be summarized as follows. If
                                                               D(w + h)                2S, the
 competitive outcome emerges. The social marginal resource costs are w + h, and the
 competitive output when price is equal to those costs is D(w h) The number of workers
 who become trained is exactly sufficient to
                                             produce that quantity, the maximum number
 of entrepreneurswho can create firms that produce at minimum efficient
                                                                          scale enter, and
 competitionamong them drives the wage up to w±h. If, on the other hand, D(w+h) <2S
 so that demand cannot support two firms
                                             operating at minimum efficient scalewhen price
 is equal to marginal costs (including
                                        training),the industry is not viable. No firms enter
 and the good is not produced. This outcome results because the firm cannot commit not
 to exploit the workers once they have obtained their training, and hence
                                                                               they have no
 incentive to become trained.
      This latter conclusion hinges critically on our assumption that workers choose their
training before they have had any formal relationship with the firm. We are thus ruling
out any initial long term contractwhichguarantees the workers a
                                                                    wage of w + h if they do
become trained. Similarly, we are ruling out                in which the firm trains workers
                                               arrangements
at a cost of h to itself. In the presence of such employer-provided
                                                                    training the wage could
be w and the allocation would be the same as when the worker is sure to be
                                                                               paid w + h if
he becomestrained.
     Our assumption that these alternativearrangements are
                                                               impossible is only a conve-
nient simplification. We expect that similar conclusions would follow in the more
                                                                                   realistic
setting where such contracts are possible but involve a variety of costs which are absent
when (as in the case of multiple firms) the workers make their own
                                                                         training decisions.
Such costs arise because long-term contracts that specify future
                                                                   payments as a function
of worker training are hard to enforce and because it is difficult for firms themselves to
provide the appropriate training.
    Consider first   the "solution" where the firms assume responsibility for the training
                                             12
of the workers, i.e., they train their workers at a cost per worker of h to the firm. The
immediate problem with this is that the workers may not all be equally suitedfor training
or may need different types of training. For instance, training may improve the skill of
some workers but not           that of others. if workers know whether training will improve their
skill ex ante while firms only discover this ex post, the equilibria with two firms considered
above induce the right workers to obtain training. By contrast, if the firm pays all workers
w    ex post and simply pays for their training, it is likely to obtain a rather mixed groupof
trainees.8
    Similar problems arise if the firm signs a contract committing it to pay w + h to
workers who obtain training. The difficulty here is in defining "training" in a way that is
contractually implementable if the contract only specifies that a specific training course
must be taken, then the difficulty is the same as when the firm provides the training
course itself: adverse selection results in the "wrong" workers becoming trained. Instead,
the firm might try to write a contract that specifies a required level of acquired skill, The
problem here is that it is much more difficult for a third party to verify skill itself than
the completion of some training course, So, the workers cannot be sure that the firm will
not attempt to exploit them ex post by claiming that they are insufficiently skilled and
therefore do not qualify for a skilled wage.


2. General Equilibrium Models
     In this section we consider general equilibrium models in which trade among regions
arises precisely because workers only obtain training if they can be sure of competition

among firms located within the region in which they work. We show that equilibriumcan
entail the emergence of "developed" regions that trade high wage goods among themselves
and who also trade th'ir high wage goods for the low wage goods of "undeveloped" regions.
      We build up to a model with three regions and two high wage goods, by first consid-
                                                                                     two
 ering two simpler models. in Section 2.1 we consider a model with two regions and
 goods. We derive conditions under which equilibrium entails one developed region which

produces    a high wage good of the kind we analyzed above, and which exports it to the
undeveloped region which produces only a low wage good. In Section 2.2 we then consider
a model with two regions and two high wage goods. We derive conditions under which
each region specializes in one of the high wage goods, exporting it to the other. Finally,
in Section 2.3, we combine these elements in considering a model with three regions hut
only two high wage goods.

2.1. A Model with Two Regions and Two Goods
     One of the two goods, good Y, is of the kind analyzed above: it can only be produced
by workers who have received training, each skilled worker can produce a single unit of Y,
and there is a minimum efficient scale S. The other good, Z, which acts ss the numeraire,
is also produced with constant returns to scale but there is no minimum efficient scale.
One unskilled worker can produce      units of good Z. Good Z serves as a competitively
                                             so

supplied good that is produced in both regions. The presence of such a common good
ensures that, in some sense at least, workers are paid the same in both regions. As in
Heipman and Krugmao (1989) the presence of this good achieves at least a limited form
of factor price equalization.
      There are M workers in each region, each of whom supplies one unit of labor inelas-
tically. These workers are geographically immobile, they can only produce in their own
region. We assume that M              >   2S so   that there are sufficient workers for two firms to
produce   at minimumefficient scale in each region.
    Each individual's utility function is given by:

                                     U(C) + C — hit — IceS + cc,,v
                                                      Fe
                                                                                                 (5)
where   C represents the consumption of good i. The ic's are indicator variables; irk is one
if the individual becomes trained, it0 is one if he becomes an entrepreneur,ic,, is one if the
individual who has become an entrepreneur produces at least S units. Hereafter we shall
assume that v     —e   is arbitrarily small.
    Goods are costly to transport between regions. In particular, an amount   t of good Z
is spent when one unit of good Y is transportedfrom one region to the other.9 Thus a well

                                                      14
meaning social planner would avoid interregional trade, if possible. Assuming an interior
solution where both goods are produced, a Pareto Optimal allocation where each region
is self sufficient would have C, set at a level where marginal utility equals marginal cost,

i.e., where U'(C) = w + h. Such a Pareto Optimum would thereforeinvolve training L*
individualsin each region where L* satisfies:

                                                                                                                    (6)

since L*/M is the per capita consumption of good Y. Finally, since entrepreneursderive
utility from owning active firms, this productionshould be spread across as many firms of
minimumefficient scale         as possible.1°

      Note that our assumptions on preferences make this general equilibriummodel es-
sentially identical to the partial equilibrium model of section 1. If we write d(p) for the
amount demandedby each individual as a function of the price, then utility maximization
implies U'(d,,) = p, or d(p) = U''. Since there are M individuals in each region, the
aggregate amount of Y demanded in one region as a function of price is now given by

                                  D = Md = MU'1 = M() = L.                                                          (7)
For both goods to actually be produced in positive quantities at the Pareto Optimal
allocation it must be possible to satisfy the total domestic demandfor good Y by employing
domestic workers. This requires           that L* be no greater than M.
      We now analyze the conditions underwhichequilibria exist which result in the Pareto
Optimal allocation, and those under which equilibrium involves interregional trade. We
assume free entry into the production of good Z so that the wage in terms of Z is w.
The issue then is how many firms enter industry Y. As before we assume that entry
decisions are made first. There are two main cases to consider, depending on whether or
not   L > 2S.
2.1.1. Case (i): L > 25
     WhenL exceeds 25 there is sufficient demand for two firms to produce at minimum
efficient scale in both regions. There is then an autarkic equilibrium in which each region

has  N = int(Lt/S) active firms. Once N firms have entered, L workers are happy to
obtain training and the firms have enough workers to produce at minimum efficient scale.
The Farrell and Saloner (i988) reasoning we employed in the previous section implies that
this is the only autarkic equilibrium. The Pareto Optimaloutcome is thus an equilibrium
when trade is impossible. It obviously remains an equilibrium when trade is allowed
between regions since there is no incentive to for interregional trade at this equilibrium.
      Even though the Pareto Optimal outcome is an equilibrium, there may also exist
another class of equilibria when there is free trade, These equilibria have regional agglom-
eration; one of the regions produces all of good Y and the other produces only       Z. These
are the only other equiiibria. In particular   there do not exist equilibria in which one
                                                                                  of the

regions both produces some of Y domestically and also imports some. To see why, suppose
to the contrary that there are two firms producing Y in one of the regions and that this
region aiso imports Y. Suppose workers in the exporting region earn w + h. Then, wages
must equal w + h t in the importing region. But that would mean that more workers in
the importing region would obtain training. Similarly, if the wage in the importing region
is w + h it is less than that in the exporting region and workers do not have an incentive
to become trained there.
     The agglomerated equilibria, if they exist, can be of two types depending on the
magnitude of M. The first applies when M is "large" in a sense to be made precise
shortly. Then, the firms in the region that produces V pay their workers a wage of w + h
and charge w + It. Denote the producing region as the foreign region while home is
the importing region. The landed cost (including transportation) in the home region is
to + It + 2, so that home demand is MU"1(w + It t). Aggregate demand at a price of
to + It is therefore given by:


                 M[Lfl_1(w+h+t)
                  =MU (w+h)(1+A), where Ass           (w + It 2)
                                                                 '                          (8)
                                                   LTh-l(w±It)
                  = (1 A)L*, since MU°"(w + It) = L*.

The parameterA represents the per capita consumption of the high wage good in the
                                                16
importing region relative to that in the producing region. Since U'1 is decreasing in its
argument, A is less than one. This is merely a. reflection of the fact that transportation
costs raise prices for the high wage good in the importing region above w + h so that per
capita consumption of it is lower there.
     The maximum number of firms that can operate abroad at minimum efficient scale
is given by int[(1 + A)L"/5J. This is therefore the number of entrepreneurs that enter in
the agglomerated equilibrium. It is now clear what it means for M to be large: For this
type of equilibrium to exist M must exceed (I + A)L". Otherwise, even if all available
workers seek training, the market clearing price exceeds w + h. Such is the situation in the
other type of agglomerated equilibria which arise when M is less than (1 + A)L*, These
agglomerated equilibria, if they exist, have higher wages and prices.
     In order for an equilibrium with agglomeration of either type to exist the transporta-
tion cost, t, must not be "too large". The reason is that, if t is high, the price of Y in the
importing region is high as well. Such high prices create an incentive for two firms to enter
and produce 2S. This incentive is even higher when M is less than (1 + A)L" since, in this
case, the price exceeds w + h in the exporting region as well. For purposes of illustrating
these incentives we thus focus on the case where M exceeds (1 + A)L".
     Suppose, for argument'ssake, that the exporting region produces (1 + A)L* and that
two entrepreneurs enterin the importingregion and produceS each. Output in that region
is 25 which, by assumption is less than L*. The equilibrium pricecan now have one of two
forms depending on the sign of U'(25) — U'(L * (1 + A)) — t, If it is negative, the difference
between the prices in two regions when each region consumes its entire production is less
than t. Thus there is no incentive to trade in this case; the price in the home region is
U'(2S) and that in the foreign region is U'(L" (I + A)). If, instead,U1(2S) U'(L * (1 + A))
                                                                            —


is greater than t, there would be an incentive to trade if both regions consume their entire
productionof Y. Therefore, the home region imports some of good Y and the equilibrium
price abroad Pf is between U'(2S) and U'(L * (1 + A)) while that at home equals F' + t.
In this case:

                    M{U'1(F1 + t) +
                                    U'_1

                                              17
     If t is zero and S > 0, the equilibrium is of this second type and Pt exceeds w + It.
 However, the larger is 2, the more likely that the resultingequilibrium with trade has pf
 bigger thanw + It or that U'(2S) — U'(L * (1 + A)) —i is negative. In either case the domestic
                                                                                                                        t
 price exceeds w + It so two entrepreneurs can enter in the importing region, produce at
 minimum efficient scale, offer their workers w + It, and make nonnegative profits. But
 then the Farrell and Saloner reasoning implies that they will enter. There thus cannot be
 agglomeration    of the productionof Y in one region if 2 is sufficiently big.1t
       Similarly, for a given 2, there always exists a sufficiently small (t) such that for S
 smaller than,(t), pf + 2 is larger than w It. Thus, the findings of this subsection can
be summarized as follows: if S is small relative to 2 the unique equilibrium is autarkic,
otheowise there are multiple equilibria: both the autarkic equilibrium and
                                                                            equilibria in
which one of the regions specializes in the productionof Y exist. We argue in our section
on gains from trade (and prove in Appendix C) that if workers also make their training
decisions sequentially in each region, the Farrell and Saloner reasoning eliminates the
equilibria withagglomeration. Thusthe autarkic equilibria are more robust when L' > 25.

2.1.2, Case (ii): L* <2S
     As long as Lt exceeds 5, the Pareto Optimal allocation with no trade is still feasible.
However since L' < 25, it is not possible for two firms to operate at minimum efficient
scale in each region and so, for the reasons explored in Section 1, there is no laissez-faire
equilibrium in which the good is producedby each region for its own consumption.
     The only possible equilibria where good Y is supplied in positive quantities must
therefore have only one region supplying the good, as in the equilibrium with
                                                                              agglomeration
of the previous subsection, For such an equilibrium to exist here aggregate demand at a
price of w + It must exceed the sum of the firms' minimum efficient scales, i.e., we must
have (1 + A)L    2S.
     Compared to autarky, trade for these parameter values is clearly beneficial to both
regions. Under autarky, since U <25, the regions do not get to consume good Y at all.
The change from autarky to free tradekeeps the wages of workers the same. On the other

it possible for the two firms producing good Y to be viable in one region. Similarly, the
assurance of competition among firms makes training worthwhile for workers. However,
the external returns are not the usual ones. They might rather be viewed as a pecuniary
externality: The presence of another firms affects the competitionfor workers and this
makes workers available to both firmswhere one firm cannot obtain workers by itself.
    Figure 1 is useful for describing the outcomes as L*/S varies. The Pareto Optimal
allocation involves no trade as long as L*/S                we can support the Pareto

region, the equilibriumhas internationaltrade even though the Pareto Optimalallocation

2.L3. The Gains from Trade
     When     L is less than 2S trade is beneficial in that the regions can consume the good
with trade but not without trade. When       L is greater than 2S, the autarkic allocation
remains an equilibriumeven with free trade. This does not establishthat free trade is as
good as autarky in this case because, for sufficiently low transportation costs, there also
exist equilibria, whereonly one region produces good Y. In these equilibria the importing
region is worse off.
     These losses from trade as a result of multiple equilibria are analogous to those ex-
plored by Graham (1923), Melvin (1969), Markusen and Melvin (1981) and Ethier (1982).
A slight difference with Ethier (1982) is that he obtains losses from
                                                                  trade only when the ex-
              is
porting region ful'!y specialized in the production of the goodsubject to external returns.
These losses are analogous to those we obtain in the absence of transport costs when M
is less than (1 + A)L*. They come about because, in this case, the
                                                                   price in the exporting
region exceeds the autarky price w   h. In our model with transport costs, by contrast,
we obtain losses from trade even when the exporting region is not fully specialized.
     The equilibria in which trade leads to losses rely on a coordination failure. Workers in
the importing region do not believe that other workers will enter in sufficient numbers to
make the industryviable. This leads them not to get trained when they expect
                                                                                (1 + A)L*
workers to get trained in the other region. Because these equilibria rely on the inability
of workers to communicate to each other their willingness to become trained one would
expect them not to be robust to changes in the informational structure. This is what we
argue next.
    Following Farrell and Saloner (1985) we capture the possibility that workers can com-
municate to each other their intentions by assuming that they take the decision to become
trained in sequence. First one worker has the option of becoming trained, then another and

the worker who has the option of becoming trained alternates between the two regions.

trade is always beneficial.

 world's demand for good Y

 2.3. An Asymmetric Model with Three Regions
     Combining elements developed in each of the previous subsections, we now show that
 our model is capable of explaining the coexistence of multiple "developed" regions and
an "undeveloped" region in which the "developed regions" export high wage goods to the
less developed region, and also trade with each other. The less developed region has lower
wages than the developed region. Moreover workers employed in the export sector of the
developed region earn wages that are higher than the average for the region as a whole.
    To derive these results we consider a model in which there exist the same three
                                                                                    goods
X, Y and Z but where there are three identical regions. Demand in any one region for
X (or Y) at a price of w + h is too small for two firms to produce at minimum efficient
scale (i.e., L < 2S), but the overall demand from all three regions is sufficient to do so
((1 + 2A)L 2S). Moreover, 2(1 + 2A)L*, the aggregate demand for both            X and Y,
exceeds M, so that no one region can produce both on a world scale.
     Then the only equilibriumwhere all three goods get produced has two "developed"
regions each of which exports one high wage good and imports the other, and one "less
developed" region which imports both X and Y. All three regions produce good Z. In
what follows we refer to the region that produces X (Y) as Region X (Y), and the region
that produces only Z as Region Z.
    To develop implications for wages, note first that some workers in the developed region
earn w while other earn w + h. This means that the average wage in the region exceeds
that in the undeveloped region where all workers earn w. Moreover, the wage of those
employed in the exporting region of the developed region is w + h so that it exceeds the
average wage in the region.
    This is also an implication of the symmetric model of the previous subsection. This
implicationof these models is consistent with the evidence of Katz and Summers (1q89).
They find that, in industrializedcountries, the average wage paid by a country's exporting
industries exceeds the average wage paid in that country'smanufacturingsector as a whole.

                                           22
     Our model also gives some guidance as to why Katz and Summers (1989) and others
havefound it difFicultto account for inter-industry wage differences by looking at differences
in the amount of formal educationthe workers in different industries possess. In our model,
wages are determined by industry-specific skill which is often obtained in ways other than
through formal education. For example, workers often acquire those skills on the job.'3
This could explain why the wages of workers who move from one industry to another
change in ways that are related to the inter-industry wage differentials. Workers who have
acquired some industry-specific skill in one industryand move to another where those skills
are not valued, will experience a reductionin their wages. Conversely, workers who have
acquired skills that are not valued in the industry in which they are currently employed
but which are valuablein the one they move to will raise their wages by moving.

3. Industrial/Commercial Policy
    In our models the production of some goods involves high wages while that of other
goods does not. In such contexts, protection has been viewed as beneficial by numerous
authors e.g. Hagen (1958), Bhagwati and Ramaswami (1963), Katz and Summers (1989).)
We are thus led to explore whether                a region can gain by unilaterally deviating from free
trade.
      We considertwo types of deviations. In the first, which we call industrialpolicy, the
central authority attempts to encourage the emergence of a specifically targeted industry.
In the second, the central authority is not interestedin changing the pattern of regional
specialization but nonetheless taxes imports whose production requires skilled labor. While
industrialpolicy often involves the use of tariffs, we distinguish between the two policies
because the first tries to affect the composition of trade without trying to affett its level
while the second affects mainly the level.

3.1. IndustrialPolicy.
    Industrial policy can be carried out using various tools. One approach is to give a
subsidy to firms who produce the desired good. Suppose, for example, that we are in the

simple case ofSection 2.1 where there are two regions but only a single high wage good.
The central authorityin one region, acting unilaterally, can ensurethat the high wage good
is produced locally by offering a subsidy to firms who produce the good. In particular,
suppose it announces that in the event that the domestic firms face foreign competition
they will receive a per unit subsidy, u, which is such that

                                         = to /t — MU''((l + A)L°).                                                (12)


Then, two firms will be willing to enter the domestic market and to produce enough output
to satis' world demand even if they do not in fact end up exporting at all in equilibrium.
The reason for this is that if the foreign market is somehow foreclosed to them, equilibrium
in the domestic market will entail an equilibrium price of P° = MU'1((1 + A)L°) and a
wse equal to to           /t14
    No foreign firms will enter this market if they know that the domestic firms have
been offered this subsidy. They will decide to stay out of the market since they will be
unable to export and their domesticmarket is not sufficiently large to support minimum
efficient scale production for two firms. Therefore, if the central authority announces its
subsidy plan before any entry decisions are made, the outcome will be that the domestic
firms will be the sole world producers of the high wage good. Moreover, since the central

authority only had to commit to paying the subsidy in the event that foreign competition
materialized, domestic dominance of the industryis achieved without any subsidy actually
being paid ft quihbrium.
    This outcome is desirable from the perspective of domestic residents since the utility
of the region that produces the high wage good is higher than the utility in the other
region. In the symmetric model of Section 2.2, however, the subsidy to one good makes
no difference. There each region can only produce one high wage good and that is the
equilibrium outcome with or without the offer of the subsidy on a single good. While the

subsidy can determine which of the high wage goods the domestic industry produces by
"targeting"    that good, the country is indifferent in that model as to which of the goods it
produces.
    In a slightly richer model, however, the subsidy can be socially costly. Suppose, for
example, that foreign workers can more easilybecome trainedthan domestic workers. This
could arise for example where the high wage good involves a new technology and where
the workers of the foreign country have built up some relevant industry-specific know-how
with the old technology. In that case efficiency may call for production to be done by
foreign firms whereas the offer of a subsidy may lead to the emergence (and dominance)
of a domestic industry. Not only would foreign consumers be hurt by this since they must
bear the transportation costs, but even domestic consumers may be hurt. While they save
the transportation cost they would otherwise have to pay, they now pay for the higher
training costs of the domestic workers. The industrial policy can also be implemented by
imposing a prohibitive import tariff on the targeted good. By announcing the tar.ff before
foreign firms make their entry decisions, and thereby convi'ving them that the domestic
market is foreclosed to them, they can be deterredfrom entering. The end result, again,
will be the emergence of domestic firms as the sole world producers of the good. This is    a
simple case of "import protection leads to export promotion"

3.2. Nondiscriminatory Import Taxes
      In this section we study tariffs which reduce the volume of trade but do not affect the
pattern of specialization. This analysis is thus closer in spirit to traditionai analyses of
tariffs which are conducted assuming that a country will continue to import the good on
which a tariff has been levied.
      To make sense of such policies in the context of our model it might be best to have
in mind the symmetric model of section 2.2 with M less than 2(1 + A)L, In that model
free trade has one of the high wage goods, X produced by one region while the other,
Y is produced by the other. Suppose that, as described in the previous subsection, one
region imposes a prohibitive tariff on good X so that it is sure to export X. The analysis

of this subsection then corresponds to the analysis of relatively small tariffs on V levied
by the other region. Such moderate tariffs on V will not affect the regional pattern of
specialization in this case.
    We show     that the benefits from tariffs depends critically, as in Lapan (1988), on
whether the government that imposes the tariff takes the agents in the other country
by "surprise", In our model this depends, in particular, on whether workers in the for-
eign country correctly predict the imposition of the tariffs when they make their training
decisions.
     Suppose first that the foreign workers do not correctly anticipate the imposition of
the tariffs. Then (1 + A)L" of them become trained for the production of V. A tariff on
imports of V lowers the demand for V. Thus, for the market to clear the equilibrium price
for Y must be less than it' h and the wage of foreign trained workers will thereforealso be
beow w h. As long as the tariff is not too large, so that the wage for trainedworkers still
exceeds to, the skilled workers will prefer to be employed producing V and its output will
not change. Because the tariff lowers the price charged by the foreign firms, small tariffs
on imports of V helps the domestic region. This is the standard optimal tariff argument.
     Now suppose that workers in the foreign region do correctly anticipatethe imposition
of the tariff when they make their training decisions. Since they correctly anticipatethe
reduction in demand that will follow the imposition of the tariff, fewer of them obtain
training. Indeed, the number of foreigners that obtains training adjusts until their wages
equal w + h and the price charged abroad equals to + h. If the ex post tariff is r, the
number of workers that obtain training is:

                       MU''(w h) + Muv_1((1 + r)(w + fi +t)).                          (13)

     Since   the price charged abroad is thus independentof the anticipated tariff rate,
domestic residents lose from the tariff. Domestic consumption falls and the unit price paid
to the foreign firms is unchanged. Domestic residents would be better off if the country
could commit never to levy a tariff.
     These conclusions are similar to, though stronger, than Lapan's. Lapan (1988) shows
that when the production of output occurs before a government can levy a tariff, the
                                             26
incentive to raise tariffs      is   larger ex post than ex ante. However, his framework is one
where countries trade because they are intrinsically different. As a result, in his model a
small tariff is desirable even ex ante. Here, by contrsst, all tariffs are undesirable ex ante
so countries are sure to gain by committing themselves never to levy a tariff in the future.
     One resson to stressthese resultsis that they differ radically from thoseof the standard
models   that explain trade among similar countries. Standard models of this type stress
increasing returns and monopolistic competition as motives for trade among regions As
can be seen in Gros (1987), Venables (1987) and Helpman and Krugman (19S9'. ur.der
these assumptions tariffs are generally desirable even whin they are correctly antiripaed.
What we haveshown is that Lapan's (1988) case againsttariffs applies even more strongly
in a model where Identical countries trade with each other.

4. Antitrust Policy
     In the models we have presented the perfectly competitive outcome emerges even if
there are only two competing rivais. In practice, however, paucity of competitors may
endow the firms tn the industry with market power over their customers and suppliers.
In particular, the firms may be able to restrict their consumption of inputs and thereby
reduce the amount they pay to their input suppliers.
     This can occur, for example, when firms interact repeatedly and implicitly collude.
Suppose in particular that after entrepreneurs have entered and workers have obtained
training, prices are set and demand is realized over many periods. Then the firms may
be able to implement a collusive norm in which wages are set below the competitive level.
That norm may be sustainable if firms fear that any unilateral deviation from the norm
will lead to a breakdown in cooperation in which wages return to the competitive level.16
Each firm would then weigh the short term gain from offering a slightly higher wage while
others keep their wages at the collusive level, with the future loss that results from the
elimination of the collusive gain. The result is that, as long as the number of firms is not
too large, they obtain an outcome that is similar to that of perfect collusion. To keep the
discussion manageable we will assume                that as long as no more          than S firms are present
 "See Fried,nsz, (tan) fort thecry slong then tines for cohesion in output prices.
                                                        27
they achieve the fully collusive outcome; the pay their workers to and charge a price given
by (4). By contrast, if there are more than 1 firms, the competitive outcome obtains.
      We are interested in examining               the effect of a strong antitrust policy. We focus in
particular on the vigor with which merger policy is established and enforced.17 We assume
that, initially, there are N > S firms. The more vigorous the antitrust enforcement, the
less likely it is that a set of mergers Will be toleratedwhich reduce the number of firms in
an industry to                  the probability that the antitrust authoritieswill prevent
                        or fewer, Let

3uch an increase in concentrationbe given by p. That is, p. denotes the probability that
competition will characterize the industryand (1 p) is the probabilitythat the firms will
                                                 —


collude perfectly and drive the wage down to to,
      We suppose   that the initial number of firms, N, is such that they can all operate
at efficient scale when the price is to' h. For it to be worthwhile for workers to obtain
training they must expect to earn to h on average. Since they earn to when antitrust
enforcement is lax, they must earn to h/p when antitrust enforcement is vigorous. Since
the wage and price are equal In equilibrium when firms are competing, this implies that
the price equais to + h/p as well when there is effective competition.
     In order for the trainedworkers to be fully employed in the event that antitrust policy
is vigorous, the number of workers that seek training must equal D(w      + h/p.). Therefore,
the number of workers who obtain training is decreasing in the probability that antitrust
policy enables the firms to collude, (1 — p.): A higher probability of collusion means that
fewer workers obtain training. In the limit, if the probability of collusion is one (so that p
equais zero), no worker becomes trained.
    When the firms collude they set a wage of to and hire all the trained workers. Thus
 sales equal D(w h/p.) and the price must again equal to                                h/p. So the potential for
 collusion raises the price whether collusion takes place or not.
     We now consider international trade. Suppose that, as in the model of Section 2.1
 there are two regions but only one high wage good. Suppose that in the domestic region

   "In lbs U.S., for example, the Departmentof Justice has considerable latitude in decidingwhich mergers it will challente
 and has set out 'Onidelines' it uses in reachingthose deoisioss. The guidelines are subject to reviuion and those in effect at
 any tune isacs substaostial room for interpretstioo. Accordingly mergerpolicy can fluctuate substantially from administration
 to adoniniutratioo.

                                                              28
the probability of collusion is zero. By contrast, in the foreign region the probability of
competition ,u is less than one i.e., the foreign region has a weak antitrust policy Then,
for a sufficiently 8mall (but strictly positive) foreign j. the foreign regionmust become the
importer of good Y.
   This can be seen                           that the foreign region is the only producer
                      as follows. Suppose first

of Y. Then the total number of trainedworkers abroad L1 is MU'(w hji)                      -
                                .
h/ji + tj which is decreasing in So, for sufficiently low  :
                      M[U''(w       h)   U't(w m h + t> L + 2S.
Then, 2S workers find it profitable to become trained at home if two firms enter here.
Knowing this two firms do enter and the foreign wage falls below w          even when

foreign firms compete. But, this means that in this case foreign workers do not benefit
from obtainrng training. The only equilibrium has the domestic region, with is tough
antitrust stance, exporting the high wage good,
     Thus the country with the vigorous antitrust policy is better off than the country
in which collusion is tolerated, This simple example sugges. that relaxation of antitrust
rules, particularly in industries where human capital accumulation is important, can weli
be detrimental to a region's welfare. Insofar as cooperation between firms allows them to
exploit workers more ex post, fewer workers will obtain training and the region will suffer.
This concern for a strong antitrust policy in order to ensurevigorous competition between
purchasers of inputs echoes that of Porter (1989) who makes this argumentstrongly for
similar reasons.
     This result may appear surprising because in the usual models of external returns
cooperation among firms is beneficial. When the externality is technological, so that
increased output by one firm reduces the inputs needed by another, an agreement between
the firms is beneficial since it allows the firms to internalize the externality, leading to a
socially desirable output expansion. Similarly, in the case of localized knowledge spillovers,
research joint ventures may improve social welfare. By enabling all the members of the
joint venture to benefit from the research carried out by them in the joint venture, the
externality from research is mitigated. Indeed, this is precisely the argument used by
                                             29
.Jorde and Teece (1988)18 Our paper serves as a warning that the appearance of external
returns is not enough to justify cooperation among firms. In particular, although very
large research consortia might lead to greater sharing of the fruits of the research, they
may also reduce the compensation of their employees, and thus reduce their incentive to
acquire the knowledge and the skills needed to conduct the research.

5, Conclusions
      We have presented         a model of regional agglomeration in the production of specific
goods where the principal motor behind a region's exports is the healthy competition
among many suppliers located there. Competition ensures that workers earn high wages
if they acquire industry-specific          human capital which, in turn, makes human capital accu-
mulation attractive and the industryviable.
     The main message from the model is that even where it is technolocaliy possible
to obtain the same allocation with trade as without trade, trade serves a useful role. It
allows industriesto operate on a sufficiently large scale that it is possible to have several
firms producing the same goods in one location and thereby reap the benefits that flow
from regional agglomeration.
    While we have focused on the salutary effect of regional agglomeration on the abuse
of monopsony power, there may be other reasons why regionalagglomeration enhances
human capital accumulation. That is, it is an open question whether the mechanism by
which having several local firms creates an incentive for human capital accumulation is
through the Lcreased competition they generate.
    For example, a different advantage of regional agglomeration may be that it provides
some assurance to workers that they will remain employable in the industry if conditions
change in the future. That is, workers may prefer it if there is a diverse range of activities
in the area that use their industry specific skills in case demand conditions or production
techniques change in a way that eliminates the activity they choose to be employed in.
This preference for diversity might exist even if long-term wage contracts can be written
  '                                                                              on

strict antitrust enforcement is generally not needed in the circumstances we contemplate, because international competition
and new and unewected entry is especiallystrong?

specifying the wage that the worker will receive in a particular activity, so that monopsony
power is not an issue.
     Consider just three specific examples. Workers employed in the production of mid-
sized automobiles may want to be located near plants that produce small automobiles in
case demand shifts in the direction of the latter. Or workers employed producing computers
based on a proprietaryoperatingsyctem, but whose skills are not specific to that operating

system, may prefer it if plants producing computers basedon alternativeoperatingsystsnr
are located nearby in case theirs becomes obsolete. Finahy, is could slmpl be         'at

know that if he becomes unhappy in his job that he can easily shift to another
     While the existence of such diversity may be importantto workers making their train
ing decisions, it is not clear why it cannot be achieved within   a single enterprise. That is.
one firm couldencompass a range of technologies, products,plants, and divisions. Multiple
firms might have an advantage if workers are concerned about the possibility of bankruptcy
and if two firms someh have a combined probability of ankruptry that is lower than
those firms would have when rolled into one. Or it might be that workers are concerned
about the "corporate culture" and that it is difficult to maintainseveral "cultures" in sep-
arate divisions within the same company. Such rationales for regional agglomeration must
be highly speculative for the moment. Sorting out which of them, or others not suggested
here, can survive the scrutiny of formal modeling is a questionthat awaits future research.
     Anotheropen area for research is the extent to which competition is actuallyassociated
with high wages, extensive industry specific training and exports. One problem is that,
in practice, it is hard to gauge when an industry is relatively competitive. Nonetheless it
is worth providing some anecdotal examples which appear to support the model. First,
centrally planned economies have little actual competition for workers between the various
firms and are notorious for their inability to export highwage goods. Second, consider the
automobile industry. Japan, the most successful exporter of high quality mass-produced
cars, has a relatively large number of firms in this industry. Similarly, Italy has several
producers of high performance cars which are very successful exporters, In contrast, Italy

                                             31
has only one large mass-production auto manufacturer, FIAT, whose exports to the US
are minimal. Interpreted within the context of our model, the high performance Italian
cars and the mass-produced Japanese can can be thought of as high quality goods which
use relatively skilled workers while FIAT can be thought of as a lower quality producer
who employs less skilled workers. These anecdotes suggest   that a more careful exploration
of   the empirical validity   of the model is warranted.

                      Existence of The Competitive Equilibrium
    In this appendix we prove the assertion in Section 1 that a competitive equilibrium
exists when 2    < N < N.
    The subgame equilibrium strategies are as follows: L workers obtain training. The
wages that firms offer are: (a) if L < S all firms set sV = 0; (b) if S < L <25 one of the
firms sets tiq = 11(L) + and the others set tfij = 11(L)    +  — c for c
                                                                         arbitrarily small; (c)
if 25 <   L     D(w    ii) there are two cases to consider: (I) N < Nt      int:   In this case
the firms set sZ,j =  11'(L). (ii) N > Nt: In his case Nt firms set   sD
                                                                         = 11'(L)
and the remaining firms set their wage equal to 0; (d) if 11(w + h) <L < 11(w), firms all
set tD1 = 11'(L); and (e) If 11(w) < L firms set w = w. In case (e) a minor modification
is required for the rule that workers use in allocating themselves across firms since there
are too many workers to be employed at wage w in this industry. Here we assume that
L 11(w) workers elect to work in other industries. The 11(w) workers that remain in this
industry distributethemselves uniformly across the N firms.
    We first demonstratethat the firms' wage strategies are equilibriumstrategies.
Case (a): Since here fewer than S workers obtain training, no firm is able to operate at
minimum efficient scale. Thus they all refuse to hire workers (set ttq = 0).
Case(b): Sincethe number of workers who obtain training exceeds S but is less than 25,
only one firm can operate at minimum efficient scale. Since the entrepreneurthat succeeds
in being the one who hires the worker derives utility of v, they are each prepared to bid v
to the workers, or each, for the right to be their employer. (Note that since e is a sunk
cost at this stage it is irrelevant). Since the market clearing price will be 111(L), the
winning firm is willing to pay 11'(L) + to each worker to be the sole producer. Since
the losing firms will not attract any workers in equilibrium, they are prepared to offer a
tiny amount less than the wage of the "winning firm". Doing so keeps the winning firm
 "honest" and eliminates an incentive for him to shave his wage offer.
 Case (c (H):   if the I, workers are hired the market clearing pricewill be 11(L) which exceeds
 w + h. Since all N firms can produce     at minimum efficient scale in this case, they will bid
the wage up to D(L).
Case (c(ii)): Here there are insufficient trained workers for all N firms to operate at
minimum efficient scale. N is the number of firms that can operate at minimum efficient
scale. As in Case (b) the entrepreneurs are willing to pay v to be successful. Since there
are     workers per successful firm, the firms are willing to pay a "premium" of       per
worker to   attract them to the firm and be successful, Once the workers are all employed
the market clearing price will be D'(L). Thus the successful firms bid   D''(L) —       for
workers. Unsuccessful
                   firms bid 0.
Case(d): Here all    firms can produce at minimum efficient scale. Once the woreLs are
hired the market clearing price will be D'(L). Firms therefore bid the wage up to this
level.
Case (e): If firms offer w, workers are indifferent between being employed in this industry
and beingemployed elsewhere. Therefore it is consistent with optimizing behavior for only
D'1(w) workers to take employment in this industry. But then the market clearing price,
                                                           u
if they are employed, will be w. Thus firms bid the wage to w.
    Thus the firms are willing to carry out the proposed strategies for any number of
workers that become trained. Those strategies are therefore subgame perfect. We turn
now to the training strategy of workers. The proposed equilibrium strategy calls for    L
workers to obtain training. If that number obtains training, Case (c(i)) is the relevant one
and the wage that is offered is D..(L*) = w+h. Since they recoup their training expenses
the workers are prepared to obtain training.
    No additional workers are prepared to obtain training, however. If one additional
worker obtains training, Case (d) becomes the relevant one. The wage that is offered is
        + 1) <w + h, so that the deviatingworker is unable to recoup his training costs.
Similarly, none of the L workers has an incentive to deviate by not obtaining training.
Each worker who obtains training in equilibrium in indifferent between obtaining training
at a cost h and earning   w + h and not obtaining   training and earning w.
                                           Appendix B
                       Uniqueness of the Competitive Equilibrium
     In this Appendix we show that the equilibrium in Section 1, where the price and wage
equal w   h, is unique. The proof of this proposition proceeds by contradictionfor a series
of exhaustive cases. Denote the price that is charged in a candidate equilibrium by P
and the highest wage that is offered in equilibrium by iD.
           r
           C a' h: There cannot be an equilibrium where the highest wage offered to
trained workers is less than a' h since at least one of the workers would be able to deviate
by not obtainingtraining and make himself better off.
     (ii) ti, > a' + Ii and   Pta' + h: In an equilibrium like this it must be the case that
the entirepool of untrainedworkers becomes trained because tD > a' + ii. Since the pool of
untrainedworkers is sufficient to satisfy demand when the price is a' fi, the price must be
below w        h for the market to clear. But then for v — e very small at least one entrepreneur
can make himself better off by not entering.
    (iii)     a' + h and fi <a' + /s: When the price is below the wage, firms that hire
workers lose money. But then for v — e very small at least one entrepreneur could do better
by not entering.
     (iv) ti' = a'  + h and E > a' + h: Here a firm will deviate and offer a wage above
a'   fi,   The reason is that a firm can raisethe wage infinitesimally, attract all the trained
workers and increase its profits.

              Uniqueness of Equilibrium with Sequential Training Decisions
     In this Appendix we consider the case where L* > 25 and workers get trained in
sequence. We show that, in this case, the outcome where L(1 + \) workers get trained in
one region while none get trained in the other is not an equilibrium. The only equilibrium
is the autarkic one where L* workers get trained in each region.
    Workers in each region are ordered from 1 to M. The first worker is the fl-st to
be given the option of becoming trained. If he declines he cannot later become 'rained
After that, the first worker at home is given the option, then it is given to the second
worker abroad and so         Let s1' denote the strategy for the i'th worker at home while
   denotes the j'th foreign worker's strategy. These strategies can take only one of two
values; we let s equal one if the worker becomes trained and zero otherwise. The strategy
for the i'th worker dependsonly on the number of workers that have decided to become
trained before him. Thus:


                        m=1       n=1
                                                s(=ff(4,s)  v,i=I      n=1
                                                                                       i=1...M,

     Suppose that at least two firms enter in each region and that Xh workers become
trained at homewhile XI workers become trained abroad. Given our interest, assume that
X1 exceeds Xh.           the equilibrium prices can be of two forms. If U'(X') — U'(X1)
                      Then

is smaller than t, then the price at home is UI(Xh) while the price abroad is U'(Xf) and
there is no trade. if it is greater than t, good Y flows from the foreign to the domestic
region. The equilibrium price abroad           P' is bigger than U'(Xf) while the equilibrium price
at home, Ph equals Pf + t and is smaller than U'(X').
     We showed in section 2.1.1 that if the equilibrium is of the former type when 2S
workers get trained at home and as many as (1 + A)L workers get trained abroad, the
equilibrium is unique. So, consider the latter equilibria, if 2S workers become trained at
home, then no more than M[U'(w + h) + U'1(w                         + h + t)J — 25 workers are willing to
become trained abroad. On the other hand, 2S workers are willing to become trained at
   The eneyiie woW4 be undanged lithe fire deciai on trenlng were taken by the firet worker   eS   home,
home as long as the number of foreign trained workers does not exceed K1                  M[U''(to +
h)   U''(w + it — t)] — 25, which is larger.          The discrepancy   comes   from the existence of

transport costs whose presence ensures that the price abroad must be below to                 it if   it is
to equal to + it   at home.
     We now show that,        if the strategies followed   by foreign workers are subgame perfect,
at least 25 domestic workers become trained. Consider first subgames in which fewer than
K1 wnrkers       ever become trained abroad. Then, 25 workersor more             will   become trained

at home. To see this note that the M'th domestic worker is strictly better off' by becoming
trained if 25 — 1 workers got trained before him. Similarly, the M — l'st domestic worker
will enter if exactly 25—2 workers got trained before him. By doingso he, just like the last
worker, recoups his training cost and lowers the equilibrium price. This reasoning extends
baiw ards so that the M — 25'th worker is sure to become trained if other workers did
not get trained before him.
    We now argue that it is impossible for K1 workers ever to become trained abroad.

Suppose there exists a subgame where tbe i'th foreign worker becomes the  'th worker     K'
to become trained      there. That worker would refrain from acquiring training           if there were
                       + it) U°1(w + it t)] — (K' — 1) = 25              1+     M[U'1(w + it + t) —
            it — t))   domestic workers already trained.       In equilibrium, such a number will
always be present. The        i   —   l'th domestic worker would definitely become trained if there
were   Kh   —1   domestic workers already trained before him.       If he does not become trained,
good   Y will         it + t (By the definition of Kh). By entering, he lowers the price
                 cost to +

of Y and recoups his training cost even if his decision to become trained triggers further
training of domestic workers, Similarly, the I — 2'th domestic worker will get trained if
there are only Kd — 2 workers trained before him. This argument extends backwards so
that the I — Kd — l'th domestic worker becomes trained.
        far we have argued that the home region produces at least 25 which justifies the
       So

entry of two firms we initially assumed. In fact the argumentcan be strengthened to show
that the home region produces V and the autarkic equilibrium prevails. Suppose that, on
the contrary, the foreign region produces V x which is less than K1 where x is positive.
For z sufficiently large the home region will import Y. The backwards inductionargument
implies that the domestic region will then produce M1U'1 (w + h) +  U'1(w + h — t)] —
(L* + z) = MU1(w + h — t) — z which exceeds 25 because L + z is less than K1.
But, then, the price and wage abroad equal w + h — t which is impossible. So z must be
sufficiently small that the foreign region does not export the good. But, then, x must be
zero for otherwise the foreign price and wage would again be below w h.
