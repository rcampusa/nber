                                             ABSTRACT

This article takes a critical look at the literature on equity premium puzzle - the inability of standard
intertemporal economic models to rationalize the statistics that have characterized U.S. financial
markets over the past century. A summary of historical returns for the United States and other
industrialized countries and an overview of the economic construct itself are provided. The intuition
behind the discrepancy between model prediction and empirical data is explained and the research
efforts to enhance the model’s ability to replicate the empirical data are summarized.

       More than two decades ago, we demonstrated that the equity premium (the return earned

by a risky security in excess of that earned by a relatively risk-free T-bill), was an order of mag-

nitude greater than could be rationalized in the context of the standard neoclassical paradigms of

financial economics as a premium for bearing risk. We dubbed this historical regularity ‘the eq-

uity premium puzzle.’(Mehra and Prescott(1985)). Our challenge to the profession has spawned

a plethora of research efforts to explain it away.

       In this paper, we take a retrospective look at the puzzle, critically examine the data

sources used to document the puzzle, attempt to clearly explain it and evaluate the various at-

tempts to solve it. The paper is organized into four parts. Part 1 documents the historical equity

premium in the United States and in selected countries with significant capital markets in terms

of market value and comments on the data sources. Part 2 examines the question, ‘Is the equity

premium due to a premium for bearing non-diversifiable risk?’ Part 3 examines the related ques-

tion, ‘Is the equity premium due to borrowing constraints, a liquidity premium or taxes?’

Finally, part 4 examines the equity premium expected to prevail in the future.

        We conclude that research to date suggests that the answer to the first question is ‘no’,

unless one is willing to accept that individuals are implausibly risk averse. In answer to the sec-

ond question McGratten and Prescott (2001) found that, most likely, the high equity premium

observed in the postwar period was indeed the result of a combination of the factors that included

borrowing constraints and taxes.

1.1 Facts

    Any discussion of the equity premium over time confronts the question of which average

returns are more useful in summarizing historical information: arithmetic or geometric? It is well
                                                                                                                                    3


known that the arithmetic average return exceeds the geometric average return and that if the re-

turns are log-normally distributed, the difference between the two is one-half the variance of the

returns. Since the annual standard deviation of the equity premium is about 20 percent, this can

result in a difference of about 2 percent between the two measures, which is non - trivial since

the phenomena under consideration has an arithmetic mean of between 2 and 8 percent. In Mehra

and Prescott (1985), we reported arithmetic averages, since the best available evidence indicated

that stock returns were uncorrelated over time. When this is the case, the expected future value of

a $1 investment is obtained by compounding the arithmetic average of the sample return, which

is the correct statistic to report if one is interested in the mean value of the investment.1 If, how-

ever, the objective is to obtain the median future value of the investment, then the initial invest-

ment should be compounded at the geometric sample average. When returns are serially corre-

lated, then the arithmetic average2 can lead to misleading estimates and thus the geometric aver-

age may be the more appropriate statistic to use. In this paper, as in our 1985 paper, we report

arithmetic averages. However, in instances where we cite the results of research when arithmetic

averages are not available, we clearly indicate this.3



1.2 Data Sources

      A second crucial consideration in a discussion of the historical equity premium has to do

with the reliability of early data sources. The data documenting the historical equity premium in

the United States can be subdivided into three distinct sub-periods, 1802–1871, 1871–1926 and


1
  We present a simple proof in appendix A.
2
  The point is well illustrated by the textbook example where an initial investment of $100 is worth $200 after one year and $100
after two years. The arithmetic average return is 25% whereas the geometric average return is 0%. The latter coincides with the
true return.
3
  In this case an approximate estimate of the arithmetic average return can be obtained by adding one-half the variance of the
returns to the geometric average.

1926 – present. The quality of the data is very different for each subperiod. Data on stock prices

for the nineteenth century is patchy, often necessarily introducing an element of arbitrariness to

compensate for its incompleteness.

    Subperiod 1802-1871

          Equity Return Data

          We find that the equity return data prior to 1871 is not particularly reliable. To the best of

our knowledge, the stock return data used by all researchers for the period 1802–1871 is due to

Schwert (1990), who gives an excellent account of the construction and composition of early

stock market indexes. Schwert (1990) constructs a “spliced” index for the period 1802–1987; his

index for the period 1802–1862 is based on the work of Smith and Cole (1935), who constructed

a number of early stock indexes. For the period 1802–1820, their index was constructed from an

equally weighted portfolio of seven bank stocks, while another index for 1815–1845 was com-

posed of six bank stocks and one insurance stock. For the period 1834–1862 the index consisted

of an equally weighted portfolio of (at most) 27 railroad stocks.4 They used one price quote, per

stock, per month, from local newspapers. The prices used were the average of the bid and ask

prices, rather than transaction prices, and their computation of returns ignores dividends. For the

period 1863–1871, Schwert uses data from Macaulay (1938), who constructed a value-weighted

index using a portfolio of about 25 North-east and mid-Atlantic railroad stocks;5 this index also

excludes dividends. Needless to say, it is difficult to assess how well this data proxies the ‘mar-

ket,’ since undoubtedly there were other industry sectors that were not reflected in the index.

  “They chose stocks in hindsight … the sample selection bias caused by including only stocks that survived and were actively
quoted for the whole period is obvious.” (Schwert (1990))

  “It is unclear what sources Macaulay used to collect individual stock prices but he included all railroads with actively traded
stocks.” Ibid
                                                                                                                                    5


          Return on a Risk-free Security

          Since there were no Treasury bills at the time, researchers have used the data set con-

structed by Siegel (1998) for this period, using highly rated securities with an adjustment for the

default premium. It is interesting to observe, as mentioned earlier, that based on this data set the

equity premium for the period 1802–1862 was zero. We conjecture that this may be due to the

fact that since most financing in the first half of the nineteenth century was done through debt,

the distinction between debt and equity securities was not very clear-cut.6



    Sub-period 1871–1926

          Equity Return Data

          Shiller (1989) is the definitive source for the equity return data for this period. His data is

based on the work of Cowles (1939), which covers the period 1871–1938. Cowles used a value-

weighted portfolio for his index, which consisted of 12 stocks7 in 1871 and ended with 351 in

1938. He included all stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, whose prices were re-

ported in the Commercial and Financial Chronicle. From 1918 onward he used the Standard and

Poor’s (S&P) industrial portfolios. Cowles reported dividends, so that, unlike the earlier indexes

for the period 1802–1871, a total return calculation was possible.



          Return on a Risk Free Security

          There is no definitive source for the short-term risk-free rate in the period before 1920,

when Treasury certificates were first issued. In our 1985 study, we used short-term commercial

  The first actively traded stock was floated in the U.S in 1791 and by 1801 there were over 300 corporations, although less than
10 were actively traded. ( Siegel (1998)).
7
  It was only from Feb. 16, 1885, that Dow Jones began reporting an index, initially composed of 12 stocks. The S&P index dates
back to 1928, though for the period 1928–1957 it consisted of 90 stocks. The S&P 500 debuted in March 1957.

paper as a proxy for a riskless short-term security prior to 1920 and Treasury certificates from

1920–1930. Our data prior to 1920, was taken from Homer (1963). Most researchers have either

used our data set or Siegel’s.



           Sub-period 1926–present

          Equity Return Data

          This period is the “Golden Age” in regards to accurate financial data. The NYSE data-

base at the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) was initiated in 1926 and provides re-

searchers with high quality equity return data. The Ibbotson Associates Yearbooks8 are also a

very useful compendium of post–1926 financial data.

          Return on a Risk-free Security

          Since the advent of Treasury bills in 1931, short maturity bills have been an excellent

proxy for a “real” risk-free security since the innovation in inflation is orthogonal to the path of

real GNP growth.9 Of course, with the advent of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS)

on January 29, 1997, the return on these securities is the real risk-free rate.



1.3 Estimates of the Equity Premium

          Historical data provides us with a wealth of evidence documenting that for over a cen-

tury, stock returns have been considerably higher than those for Treasury-bills. This is illustrated

in Table 1, which reports the unconditional estimates10 for the US equity premium based on the


8
  Ibbotson Associates. “Stocks, Bonds, Bills and Inflation.” 2000 Yearbook. Chicago. Ibbotson Associates. 2001.
9
  See Litterman (1980) who also found that that in post war data the innovation in inflation had a standard deviation of one half of
one percent.
10
   To obtain unconditional estimates we use the entire data set to form our estimate. The Mehra-Prescott data set covers the long-
est time period for which both consumption and stock return data is available. The former is necessary to test the implication of
consumption based asset pricing models.
                                                                                                      7


various data sets used in the literature, going back to 1802. The average annual real return, (the

inflation adjusted return) on the U.S. stock market over the last 110 years has been about 8.06

percent. Over the same period, the return on a relatively riskless security was a paltry 1.14 per-

cent. The difference between these two returns, the “equity premium,” was 6.92 percent.

           Furthermore, this pattern of excess returns to equity holdings is not unique to the U.S. but

is observed in every country with a significant capital market. The U.S. together with the U.K.,

Japan, Germany and France accounts for more than 85 percent of the capitalized global equity

value.

           The annual return on the British stock market was 5.7 percent over the post war period,

an impressive 4.6 percent premium over the average bond return of 1.1 percent. Similar statisti-

cal differentials are documented for France, Germany and Japan. Table 2 illustrates the equity

premium in the post war period for these countries.

       The dramatic investment implications of this differential rate of return can be seen in

       Table 3, which maps the capital appreciation of $1 invested in different assets from 1802

       to 1997 and from 1926 to 2000.

       As Table 3 illustrates, $1 invested in a diversified stock index yields an ending wealth of

$558,945 versus a value of $276, in real terms, for $1 invested in a portfolio of T-bills for the

period 1802–1997. The corresponding values for the 75-year period, 1926–2000, are $266.47

and $1.71. We assume that all payments to the underlying asset, such as dividend payments to
                                                                                                           9


stock and interest payments to bonds are reinvested and that there are no taxes paid.

       This long-term perspective underscores the remarkable wealth building potential of the

equity premium. It should come as no surprise therefore, that the equity premium is of central

importance in portfolio allocation decisions, estimates of the cost of capital and is front and cen-

ter in the current debate about the advantages of investing Social Security funds in the stock

market.

       In Table 4 we report the premium for some interesting sub-periods: 1889–1933, when the

United States was on a gold standard; 1933–2000, when it was off the gold standard; and

1946–2000, the postwar period. Table 5 presents 30 year moving averages, similar to those re-

ported by the US meteorological service to document ‘normal’ temperature.

            Although the premium has been increasing over time, this is largely due to the diminish-

ing return on the riskless asset, rather than a dramatic increase in the return on equity, which has

been relatively constant. The low premium in the nineteenth centaury is largely due to the fact

that the equity premium for the period 1802–1861 was zero.11 If we exclude this period, we find

that difference in the premium in the second half of the nineteenth century relative to average

values in the twentieth century is less striking.

            We find a dramatic change in the equity premium in the post 1933 period – the premium

rose from 3.92 percent to 8.93 percent, an increase of more than 125 percent. Since 1933 marked

the end of the period when the US was on the gold standard, this break can be seen as the change

in the equity premium after the implementation of the new policy.



1.4 Variation in the Equity Premium over Time
            The equity premium has varied considerably over time, as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2,

below. Furthermore, the variation depends on the time horizon over which it is measured. There

          The low frequency variation has been counter- cyclical. This is shown in Figure 3 where

we have plotted stock market value as a share of national income12 and the mean equity premium

averaged over certain time periods. We have divided the time period from 1929 to 2000 into sub-

periods, where the ratio market value of equity to national income was greater than 1 and where

it was less than 1. Historically, as the figure illustrates, subsequent to periods when this ratio was

  In Mehra (1998) it is argued that the variation in this ratio is difficult to rationalize in the standard neoclassical framework
since over the same period after tax cash flows to equity as a share of national income are fairly constant. Here we do not address

high the realized equity premium was low. A similar results holds when stock valuations are low

relative to national income. In this case the subsequent equity premium is high.

2.     Is The Equity Premium Due To A Premium For Bearing Non-
       diversifiable Risk?
       In this section, we examine various models that attempt to explain the historical equity

premium. We start with a model with standard (CRRA) preferences, then examine models incor-

porating alternative preference structures, idiosyncratic and uninsurable income risk, and models

incorporating a disaster state and survivorship bias.

       Why have stocks been such an attractive investment relative to bonds? Why has the rate

of return on stocks been higher than on relatively risk-free assets? One intuitive answer is that

since stocks are ‘riskier’ than bonds, investors require a larger premium for bearing this addi-

tional risk; and indeed, the standard deviation of the returns to stocks (about 20 percent per an-

num historically) is larger than that of the returns to T-bills (about 4 percent per annum), so, ob-

viously they are considerably more risky than bills! But are they?

       Figures 5 and 6 below illustrate the variability of the annual real rate of return on the

To enhance and deepen our understanding of the risk-return trade-off in the pricing of financial

assets, we take a detour into modern asset pricing theory and look at why different assets yield

different rates of return. The deus ex machina of this theory is that assets are priced such that, ex-

ante, the loss in marginal utility incurred by sacrificing current consumption and buying an asset

at a certain price is equal to the expected gain in marginal utility, contingent on the anticipated

increase in consumption when the asset pays off in the future.

                  The operative emphasis here is the incremental loss or gain of utility of consumption and

should be differentiated from incremental consumption. This is because the same amount of con-
                                                                                                       17


sumption may result in different degrees of well-being at different times. As a consequence, as-

sets that pay off when times are good and consumption levels are high – when the marginal util-

ity of consumption is low – are less desirable than those that pay off an equivalent amount when

times are bad and additional consumption is more highly valued. Hence consumption in period t

has a different price if times are good than if times are bad.

       Let us illustrate this principle in the context of the standard, popular paradigm, the Capi-

tal Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The model postulates a linear relationship between an asset’s

‘beta,’ a measure of systematic risk, and its expected return. Thus, high-beta stocks yield a high

expected rate of return. That is because in the CAPM, good times and bad times are captured by

the return on the market. The performance of the market, as captured by a broad-based index,

acts as a surrogate indicator for the relevant state of the economy. A high-beta security tends to

pay off more when the market return is high – when times are good and consumption is plentiful;

it provides less incremental utility than a security that pays off when consumption is low, is less

valuable and consequently sells for less. Thus higher beta assets that pay off in states of low

marginal utility will sell for a lower price than similar assets that pay off in states of high mar-

ginal utility. Since rates of return are inversely proportional to asset prices, the lower beta assets

will, on average, give a lower rate of return than the former.

       Another perspective on asset pricing emphasizes that economic agents prefer to smooth

patterns of consumption over time. Assets that pay off a larger amount at times when consump-

tion is already high “destabilize” these patterns of consumption, whereas assets that pay off when

consumption levels are low “smooth” out consumption. Naturally, the latter are more valuable

and thus require a lower rate of return to induce investors to hold these assets. (Insurance policies

are a classic example of assets that smooth consumption. Individuals willingly purchase and hold

them, despite of their very low rates of return).

        To return to the original question: are stocks that much riskier than T-bills so as to justify

a six percentage differential in their rates of return?

        What came as a surprise to many economists and researchers in finance was the conclu-

sion of a paper by Mehra and Prescott, written in 1979. Stocks and bonds pay off in approxi-

mately the same states of nature or economic scenarios and hence, as argued earlier, they should

command approximately the same rate of return. In fact, using standard theory to estimate risk-

adjusted returns, we found that stocks on average should command, at most, a one percent return

premium over bills. Since, for as long as we had reliable data (about 100 years), the mean pre-

mium on stocks over bills was considerably and consistently higher, we realized that we had a

puzzle on our hands. It took us six more years to convince a skeptical profession and for our pa-

per “The Equity Premium: A Puzzle” to be published. (Mehra and Prescott (1985)).



2.1 Standard Preferences
        The neoclassical growth model and its stochastic variants are a central construct in con-

temporary finance, public finance, and business cycle theory. It has been used extensively by,

among others, Abel et al. (1989), Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987), Barro and Becker (1988),

Brock (1979), Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1985), Donaldson and Mehra (1984), Lucas (1978),

Kydland and Prescott (1982), and Merton (1971). In fact, much of our economic intuition is de-

rived from this model class. A key idea of this framework is that consumption today and con-

sumption in some future period are treated as different goods. Relative prices of these different

goods are equal to people’s willingness to substitute between these goods and businesses’ ability

to transform these goods into each other.
                                                                                                      19


       The model has had some remarkable successes when confronted with empirical data,

particularly in the stream of macroeconomic research referred to as Real Business Cycle Theory,

where researchers have found that it easily replicates the essential macroeconomic features of the

business cycle. See, in particular, Kydland and Prescott (1982). Unfortunately, when confronted

with financial market data on stock returns, tests of these models have led, without exception, to

their rejection. Perhaps the most striking of these rejections is contained in our 1985 paper.

       To illustrate this we employ a variation of Lucas' (1978) pure exchange model. Since per

capita consumption has grown over time, we assume that the growth rate of the endowment fol-

lows a Markov process. This is in contrast to the assumption in Lucas' model that the endowment

level follows a Markov process. Our assumption, which requires an extension of competitive

equilibrium theory13, enables us to capture the non-stationarity in the consumption series associ-

ated with the large increase in per capita consumption that occurred over the last century.

       We consider a frictionless economy that has a single representative 'stand-in' household.

This unit orders its preferences over random consumption paths by



                                   Ï•           ¸
                                E0 ÌÂ b tU (ct )˝,   0 < b <1                          (1)
                                   Ót =0        ˛

where ct is the per capita consumption and the parameter b is the subjective time discount factor,

which describes how impatient households are to consume. If b is small, people are highly im-

patient, with a strong preference for consumption now versus consumption in the future. As

modeled, these households live forever, which implicitly means that the utility of parents de-

pends on the utility of their children. In the real world, this is true for some people and not for

others. However, economies with both types of people—those who care about their children’s
                                                                                                       20


utility and those who do not—have essentially the same implications for asset prices and re-

turns.14

            Thus, we use this simple abstraction to build quantitative economic intuition about what

the returns on equity and debt should be. E0 {}
                                              ◊ is the expectation operator conditional upon in-

formation available at time zero, (which denotes the present time) and U: R+ Æ R is the in-

creasing, continuously differentiable concave utility function. We further restrict the utility func-

tion to be of the constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) class

                                                       c1-a - 1
                                        U (c, a ) =             ,   0 <a <•                     (2)
                                                        1-a

where the parameter a measures the curvature of the utility function. When a = 1, the utility

function is defined to be logarithmic, which is the limit of the above representation as a ap-

proaches 1. The feature that makes this the “preference function of choice” in much of the lit-

erature in Growth and Real Business Cycle Theory is that it is scale invariant. This means that a

household is more likely to accept a gamble if both its wealth and the gamble amount are scaled

by a positive factor. Hence, although the level of aggregate variables such as capital stock have

increased over time, the resulting equilibrium return process is stationary. A second attractive

feature is that it is one of only two preference functions that allows for aggregation and a ‘stand-

in’ representative agent formulation that is independent of the initial distribution of endowments.

One disadvantage of this representation is that it links risk preferences with time preferences.

With CRRA preferences, agents who like to smooth consumption across various states of nature

also prefer to smooth consumption over time, that is, they dislike growth. Specifically, the coef-

ficient of relative risk aversion is the reciprocal of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.

There is no fundamental economic reason why this must be so. We will revisit this issue in Sec-

tion 3, where we examine preference structures that do not impose this restriction.15

            We assume there is one productive unit which produces output yt in period t which is the

period dividend. There is one equity share with price pt that is competitively traded; it is a claim

to the stochastic process { yt }.

            Consider the intertemporal choice problem of a typical investor at time t. He equates the

loss in utility associated with buying one additional unit of equity to the discounted expected

utility of the resulting additional consumption in the next period. To carry over one additional

unit of equity pt units of the consumption good must be sacrificed and the resulting loss in utility

is ptU ¢(ct ) . By selling this additional unit of equity in the next period, pt +1 + yt +1 additional units

of the consumption good can be consumed and bEt {( pt +1 + yt +1 )U ¢(ct +1 )} is the expected value of

the incremental utility next period. At an optimum these quantities must be equal. Hence the

fundamental relation that prices assets is ptU ¢(ct ) = bEt {( pt +1 + yt +1 )U ¢(ct +1 )} . Versions of this

expression can be found in Rubinstein (1976), Lucas (1978), Breeden (1979), and Prescott and

Mehra (1980), among others. Excellent textbook treatments can be found in Cochrane (2001),

Danthine and Donaldson (2001), Duffie (2001), and LeRoy and Werner (2001).

            We use it to price both stocks and risk-less one period bonds.

with qt being the price of the bond. Since U (c) is assumed to be increasing, we can rewrite (3) as

                       1 = bEt {Mt +1 Re, t +1}                                                  (7)

where Mt +1 is a strictly positive stochastic discount factor. This guarantees that the economy will

be arbitrage free and the law of one-price holds. A little algebra shows that

                                                                    Ï -U ¢(ct +1 ), Re, t +1 ¸

       The equity premium Et ( Re, t +1 ) - R f , t +1 thus can be easily computed. Expected asset returns

equal the risk-free rate plus a premium for bearing risk, which depends on the covariance of the

asset returns with the marginal utility of consumption. Assets that co-vary positively with con-

sumption – that is, they payoff in states when consumption is high and marginal utility is low –

command a high premium since these assets “destabilize” consumption.

       The question we need to address is the following: is the magnitude of the covariance

between the marginal utility of consumption large enough to justify the observed 6 percent eq-

uity premium in U.S. equity markets? If not, how much of historic equity premium is a premium

for bearing non-diversifiable aggregate risk.

       To address this issue, we present a variation on the framework used in our original paper

on the equity premium. An advantage of our original approach was that we could easily test the
                                                                                                                                 23


sensitivity of our results to changes in distributional assumptions16. We found that our results

were essentially unchanged for very different consumption processes, provided that the mean

and variances of growth rates equaled the historically observed values and the coefficient of

relative risk aversion was less than ten17. Using this insight on the robustness of the results to

distributional assumptions from our earlier analysis we consider the case where the growth rate

                               ct +1
of consumption xt+1 ∫                is i.i.d and lognormal. We do this to facilitate exposition and because
                                ct

this results in closed form solutions18.

          As a consequence, the gross return on equity Re, t (defined above) is i.i.d, and log-normal.

Substituting U ¢(ct ) = ct-a in the fundamental pricing relation and noting that in this exchange

economy the equilibrium consumption process is {yt}

                                         pt = bEt {( pt +1 + yt +1 )U©(ct +1 ) / U©(ct )}                       (9)

we get                                   pt = bEt {( pt +1 + yt +1 ) xt-+a1 }                                   (10)

As pt is homogeneous of degree one in yt we can represent it as

                                         pt = wyt

and hence Re, t +1 can be expressed as

                                                      ( w + 1) yt +1 w + 1

   In contrast to our approach, which is in the applied general equilibrium tradition, there is another tradition of testing Euler
equations (such as equation 9) and rejecting them. Hansen and Singleton (1982) and Grossman and Shiller (1981) exemplify this
approach.

    See Mehra and Prescott (1985) pages 156-57. The original framework also allowed us to address the issue of leverage.

   The exposition below is based on Abel (1988). Our original analysis is presented in Appendix B

It is easily shown19 that

hence                                 Et {Re, t +1} =                                                (13)

Analogously, the gross return on the riskless asset can be written as

                                                     1     1

From (11) it also follows that ln E{Re} - ln R f = as x , Re                                         (20)

                                                                                                  25


       The (log) equity premium in this model is the product of the coefficient of risk aversion

and the covariance of the (continuously compounded) growth rate of consumption with the (con-

tinuously compounded) return on equity or the growth rate of dividends. From equation 19, it is

also the product of the coefficient of relative risk aversion and the variance of the growth rate of

consumption. As we see below, this variance s x2 is 0.00125, so unless the coefficient of risk

aversion a, is large, a high equity premium is impossible. The growth rate of consumption just

does not vary enough!

       In Mehra & Prescott (1985) we report the following sample statistics for the U.S. econ-

omy over the period 1889-1978:



                        Mean Risk free rate R f                               1.008

                    Mean return on equity E{Re}                               1.0698
               Mean growth rate of consumption E{x}                           1.018
     Standard deviation of the growth rate of consumption s{x}                0.036

                  Mean equity premium E{Re}- R f                              0.0618


       In our calibration, we are guided by the tenet that model parameters should meet the cri-

teria of cross-model verification. Not only must they be consistent with the observations under

consideration but they should not be grossly inconsistent with other observations in growth the-

ory, business cycle theory, labor market behavior and so on. There is a wealth of evidence from

various studies that the coefficient of risk aversion a is a small number, certainly less than 10. A

number of these studies are documented in Mehra and Prescott (1985). We can then pose a ques-
                                                                                                  26


tion: if we set the risk aversion coefficient a to be 10 and b to be 0.99 what are the expected rates

of return and the risk premium using the parameterization above?

        Using the expressions derived earlier we have

                        ln R f = - ln b + am x - 1 / 2a 2s x2 = 0.120

        or              R f = 1.127

that is, a risk free rate of 12.7%!

Since                   ln E{Re} = ln R f + as x2

                                 = 0.132

we have                 E{Re} = 1.141



or a return on equity of 14.1%. This implies an equity risk premium of 1.4%, far lower than the

6.18% historically observed equity premium. In this calculation we have been very liberal in

choosing the values for a and b. Most studies indicate a value for a that is close to 3. If we pick


a lower value for b, the riskfree rate will be even higher and the premium lower. So the 1.4%

value represents the maximum equity risk premium that can be obtained in this class of models

given the constraints on a and b. Since the observed equity premium is over 6%, we have a puz-

zle on our hands that risk considerations alone cannot account for.

        Philippe Weil (1989) has dubbed the high risk-free rate obtained above “the risk-free rate

puzzle.” The short-term real rate in the United States averages less than 1 percent, while the high

value of a required to generate the observed equity premium results in an unacceptably high
                                                                                                          27


risk-free rate. The risk-free rate as shown in equation (18) can be decomposed into three compo-

nents:

                                     ln R f = - ln b + am x - 1 / 2a 2s x2

         The first term, - ln b , is a time preference or impatience term. When b < 1 it reflects the

fact that agents prefer early consumption to later consumption. Thus in a world of perfect cer-

tainty and no growth in consumption, the unique interest rate in the economy will be R f = 1 / b .

         The second term, am x , arises because of growth in consumption. If consumption is likely

to be higher in the future, agents with concave utility would like to borrow against future con-

sumption in order to smooth their lifetime consumption. The higher the curvature of the utility

function and the larger the growth rate of consumption, the greater the desire to smooth con-

sumption. In equilibrium this will lead to a higher interest rate since agents in the aggregate can-

not simultaneously increase their current consumption.

         The third term 1 / 2a 2s x2 arises due to a demand for precautionary saving. In a world of

uncertainty, agents would like to hedge against future unfavorable consumption realizations by

building “ buffer stocks” of the consumption good. Hence, in equilibrium, the interest rate must

fall to counter this enhanced demand for savings.

         Figure 7, below, plots ln R f = - ln b + am x - 1 / 2a 2s x2 calibrated to the U.S. historical

values with m x = 0.0175 and s x2 = 0.00123 for various values of b . It shows that the precaution-

ary savings effect is negligible for reasonable values of a . (1< a <5)

For a = 3 and b = 0.99 R f = 1.65, which implies a risk-free rate of 6.5 percent – much higher

than the historical mean rate of 0.8 percent. The economic intuition is straightforward – with

consumption growing at 1.8 percent a year with a standard deviation of 3.6 percent, agents with

isoelastic preferences have a sufficiently strong desire to borrow to smooth consumption that it

takes a high interest rate to induce them not to do so.

         The late Fischer Black20 proposed that a =55 would solve the puzzle. Indeed it can be


shown that the 1889–1978 U.S. experience reported above can be reconciled with a = 48 and


b=0.55.

To see this, observe that since s x2 = ln Í1 +        2˙
                                                          = 0.00125

         and       mx = ln E(x) – 1/2 s x2 = 0.0172

                                    ln E( R) - ln RF
         this implies        a=
                                           a x2

                                 = 47.6
                                                         2
         Since ln b = -ln RF + amx – 1/2a2 s x

                        = -0.60

         this implies        b = 0.55.


         Besides postulating an unacceptably high a, another problem is that this is a “knife edge”


solution. No other set of parameters will work, and a small change in a will lead to an unaccept-

able risk-free rate as shown in Figure 6. An alternate approach is to experiment with negative

time preferences; however there seems to be no empirical evidence that agents do have such

preferences.21

          Figure 7 shows that for extremely high a the precautionary savings term dominates and

results in a “low” risk-free rate.22 However, then a small change in the growth rate of consump-

tion will have a large impact on interest rates. This is inconsistent with a cross-country compari-

son of real risk-free rates and their observed variability. For example, throughout the 1980s,

South Korea had a much higher growth than the United States but real rates were not appreciably

higher. Nor does the risk-free rate vary considerably over time, as would be expected if a was

large. In section 3 we show how alternative preference structures can help resolve the risk free

rate puzzle.

          An alternative perspective on the puzzle is provided by Hansen and Jagannathan (1991).

The fundamental pricing equation can be written as

                                                             ÏM ,R ¸
                         Et ( Re, t +1 ) = R f , t +1 + Covt Ì t +1 e, t +1 ˝                               (22)
                                                             Ó Et ( Mt +1 ) ˛

This expression also holds unconditionally so that

                         E( Re, t +1 ) = R f , t +1 + s ( Mt +1 )s ( Re, t +1 )r R, M / E ( Mt +1 )         (23)

or                       E( Re, t +1 ) - R f , t +1 / s ( Re, t +1 ) = s ( Mt +1 )r R, M / E( Mt +1 )       (24)

and since                -1 £ r R, M £ 1

                         E( Re, t +1 ) - R f , t +1 / s ( Re, t +1 ) £ s ( Mt +1 ) / E( Mt +1 )             (25)

This inequality is referred to as the Hansen-Jagannathan lower bound on the pricing kernel.

          For the U.S. economy, the Sharpe Ratio, E( Re, t +1 ) - R f , t +1 / s ( Re, t +1 ) , can be calculated to

be 0.37. Since E( Mt +1 ) is the expected price of a one-period risk-free bond, its value must be

close to 1. In fact, for the parameterization discussed earlier, E( Mt +1 ) =0.96 when a =2. This im-

 Kandel and Stambaugh (1991) have suggested this approach.

plies that the lower bound on the standard deviation for the pricing kernel must be close to 0.3 if

the Hansen-Jagannathan bound is to be satisfied. However, when this is calculated in the Mehra-

Prescott framework, we obtain an estimate for s ( Mt +1 ) =0.002, which is off by more than an or-

der of magnitude.

         We would like to emphasize that the equity premium puzzle is a quantitative puzzle;

standard theory is consistent with our notion of risk that, on average, stocks should return more

than bonds. The puzzle arises from the fact that the quantitative predictions of the theory are an

order of magnitude different from what has been historically documented. The puzzle cannot be

dismissed lightly, since much of our economic intuition is based on the very class of models that

fall short so dramatically when confronted with financial data. It underscores the failure of para-

digms central to financial and economic modeling to capture the characteristic that appears to

make stocks comparatively so risky. Hence the viability of using this class of models for any

quantitative assessment, say, for instance, to gauge the welfare implications of alternative stabili-

zation policies, is thrown open to question.

         For this reason, over the last 15 years or so, attempts to resolve the puzzle have become a

major research impetus in finance and economics. Several generalizations of key features of the

Mehra and Prescott (1985) model have been proposed to better reconcile observations with the-

ory. These include alternative assumptions on preferences,23 modified probability distributions

to admit rare but disastrous events,24survival bias,25 incomplete markets,26 and market imperfec-

2.2 Estimating equity risk premium versus estimating risk aversion

parameter.

          Estimating or measuring the relative risk parameter using statistical tools is very differ-

ent than estimating the equity risk premium. Mehra and Prescott (1985), as discussed above, use

an extension of Lucas’ (1978) asset pricing model to estimate how much of the historical differ-

ence in yields on treasury bills and corporate equity is a premium for bearing aggregate risk.

Crucial to their analysis is their use of micro observations to restrict the value of the risk aversion

parameter. They did not estimate either the risk aversion parameter or the discount rate pa-

rameters. Mehra and Prescott (1985) reject extreme risk aversion based upon observations on

individual behavior. These observations include the small size of premia for jobs with uncertain

income and the limited amount of insurance against idiosyncratic income risk. Another observa-

tion is that people with limited access to capital markets make investments in human capital that

result in very uneven consumption over time.

       A sharp estimate for the magnitude of the risk aversion parameter comes from macroeco-

nomics. The evidence is that the basic growth model, when restricted to be consistent with the

growth facts, generates business cycle fluctuations if and only if this risk aversion parameter is

near zero. (This corresponds to the log case in standard usage). The point is that the risk aversion

parameter comes up in wide variety of observations at both the household and the aggregate

level and is not found to be large.

       For all values of the risk-aversion coefficient less than ten, which is an upper bound

number for this parameter, Mehra and Prescott find that a premium for bearing aggregate risk

accounts for little of the historic equity premium. This finding has stood the test of time.

       Another tradition is to use consumption and stock market data to estimate the degree of

relative risk aversion parameter and the discount factor parameter. This is what Grossman and

Shiller report they did in their American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings article

(1981, p. 226). Hansen and Singleton in a paper in which they develop "a method for estimating

nonlinear rational expectations models directly from stochastic Euler equations" illustrate their

methods by estimating the risk aversion parameter and the discount factor using stock dividend

consumption prices (1981, p. 1269).

        What the work of Grossman and Shiller (ibid) and Hansen and Singleton (ibid) establish

is that using consumption and stock market data and assuming frictionless capital markets is a

bad way to estimate the risk aversion and discount factor parameters. It is analogous to estimat-

ing the force of gravity near the earth’s surface by dropping a feather from the top of the Leaning

Tower of Pisa, under the assumption that friction is zero.

        A tradition related to the statistical estimation is to statistically test whether the stochas-

tic Euler equation arising from the stand-in household’s inter-temporal optimization holds. Both
                                                                                                       34


Grossman (1983) and Hansen-Singleton (1981) reject this relation. The fact that this relation is

inconsistent with the U.S. time series data is no reason to conclude that the model economy used

by Mehra and Prescott to estimation how much of the historical equity premium is a premium for

bearing aggregate risk. Returning to the analogy from Physics, it would be silly to reject Newto-

2.2 Alternative Preference Structures
Modifying the conventional time - and state - separable utility function
        The analysis above shows that the isoelastic preferences used in Mehra and Prescott

(1985) can only be made consistent with the observed equity premium if the coefficient of rela-

tive risk aversion is implausibly large. One restriction imposed by this class of preferences is that

the coefficient of risk aversion is rigidly linked to the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. One

is the reciprocal of the other. What this implies is that if an individual is averse to variation of

consumption across different states at a particular point of time then he will be averse to con-

sumption variation over time. There is no a priori reason that this must be so. Since, on average,

consumption is growing over time, the agents in the Mehra and Prescott (1985) setup have little

incentive to save. The demand for bonds is low and as a consequence the risk-free rate is coun-

terfactually high. Epstein and Zin (1991) have presented a class of preferences that they term

“Generalized Expected Utility” (GEU) which allows independent parameterization for the coef-

ficient of risk aversion and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.

In this class of preferences utility is recursively defined by
                                                                        r   1

ral substitution. The usual iso-elastic preferences follow as a special case when r = a . In the Ep-

stein and Zin model, agents’ wealth W evolves as Wt +1 =(Wt - ct )(1+ Rw, t +1) where Rw, t +1 is the

return on all invested wealth and is potentially unobservable. To examine the asset pricing im-

plications of this modification we examine the pricing kernel31
                                                                 a ( r -1)
                                                   a                                          a -r
                                                   Ê ct +1 ˆ
                                                    r
                                                                    r
                                                                                               r
                                         kt +1 = b Á       ˜                 (1 + Rw, t +1)                      (27)
                                                   Ë ct ¯

Thus the price pt of an asset with payoff yt +1 at time t+1 is



                                         pt = Et (kt +1yt +1 )                                                   (28)

In this framework the asset is priced both by its covariance with the growth rate of consumption

(the first term in 27) and with the return on the wealth portfolio. This captures the pricing fea-

tures of both the standard consumption CAPM and the traditional static CAPM. To see this, note

that when a = r , we get the consumption CAPM and with logarithmic preferences ( a / r = 0),

the static CAPM.

Another feature of this class of models is that a high coefficient of risk aversion, 1- a , does not

necessarily imply that agents will want to smooth consumption over time. However, the main

difficulty in testing this alternative preference structure stems from the fact that the counterparts

of equations (3) and (5) using GEU depend on variables that are unobservable, and this makes

calibration tricky. One needs to make specific assumptions on the consumption process to obtain

first order conditions in terms of observables. Epstein and Zin (1991) use the “market portfolio”


31
  Epstein and Zin (1991) use dynamic programming to calculate this. See their equations 8-13. Although the final result is cor-
rect although there appears to be errors in the intermediate steps.
                                                                                                    36


as a proxy for the wealth portfolio and claim that their framework offers a solution to the equity

premium puzzle. We feel that this proxy overstates the correlation between asset returns and the

wealth portfolio and hence their claim.

       This modification has the potential to resolve the risk free rate puzzle. We illustrate this

below. Under the log-normality assumptions from section 2, and using the market portfolio as a

stand in for the wealth portfolio we have

                                                 mx a / r 2 (a / r ) -1 2
                               ln Rf = -ln b +     -     s +           sm            (29)
                                                 s   2s 2 x      2

Here s m2 is the variance of the return on the “market portfolio” of all invested wealth. Since

1 -a need not equal 1/ s , we can have a large a without making s small and hence obtain a rea-

sonable risk free rate if one is prepared to assume a large s . The problem with this is that there

is independent evidence that the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is small (Campbell

(2001)) hence this generality is not very useful when the model is accurately calibrated.



Habit Formation.

       A second approach to modifying preferences was initiated by Constantinides (1990) by

incorporating habit formation. This formulation assumes that utility is affected not only by cur-

rent consumption but also by past consumption. It captures a fundamental feature of human be-

havior that repeated exposure to a stimulus diminishes the response to it. The literature distin-

guishes between two types of habit, “internal” and “external” and two modeling perspectives,

“difference” and “ratio”. We illustrate these below. Internal habit formation captures the notion

that utility is a decreasing function of ones own past consumption and marginal utility is an in-

creasing function of own past consumption. Models with external habit emphasize that the op-
                                                                                                        37


erative benchmark is not ones own past consumption but the consumption relative to other agents

in the economy.

            Constantinides (1990) considers a model with internal habit where utility is defined over

the difference between current consumption and lagged past consumption. Although the Con-

stantinides (1990) model is in continuous time with a general lag structure, we can illustrate the

intuition behind this class of models incorporating “habit” by considering preferences with a one

period lag
                                                          •
                                                             (ct + s - lct + s -1 )1-a
                                              U (c) = Et Â b   s
                                                                                       ,l > 0   (30)
                                                         s=0          1-a

            If l =1 and the subsistence level is fixed the period utility function specializes to the form

            (c - x )1-a
u( c ) =                where x is the fixed subsistence level32. The implied local coefficient of relative
              1-a

risk aversion is

                                                  c u"   a
                                              -        =                                        (31)
                                                   u© 1 - x / c

            If x / c =0.8 then the effective risk aversion is 5 a !



            This preference ordering makes the agent extremely averse to consumption risk even

when the risk aversion is small. For small changes in consumption, changes in marginal utility

can be large. Thus, while this approach cannot resolve the equity premium puzzle without in-

voking extreme aversion to consumption risk, it can address the risk free rate puzzle since the

induced aversion to consumption risk increases the demand for bonds, thereby reducing the risk-

free rate. Furthermore, if the growth rate of consumption is assumed to be i.i.d., an implication of



32
     See also the discussion in Weil (1989)
                                                                                                                               38


this model is that the risk free rate will vary considerably (and counterfactually) over time. Con-

stantinides (1990) gets around this problem since the growth rate in his model is not i.i.d.33

          An alternate approach to circumvent this problem has been expounded by Campbell and

Cochrane (1999). The model incorporates the possibility of recession as a state variable so that

risk aversion varies in a highly nonlinear manner.34 The risk aversion of investors rises dramati-

cally when the chances of a recession become larger and thus the model can generate a high eq-

uity premium. Since risk aversion increases precisely when consumption is low, it generates a

precautionary demand for bonds that helps lower the risk-free rate. This model is consistent with

both consumption and asset market data. However, it is an open question whether investors actu-

ally have the huge time varying counter-cyclical variations in risk aversion postulated in the

model.

          Another modification of the Constantinides (1990) approach is to define utility of

consumption relative to average per capita consumption. This is an external habit model

where preferences are defined over the ratio of consumption to lagged35 aggregate con-

sumption. Able (1990) terms his model “Catching up with the Joneses.” The idea is that

one’s utility depends not on the absolute level of consumption, but on how one is doing

relative to others. The effect is that, once again, an individual can become extremely sensi-

tive and averse to consumption variation. Equity may have a negative rate of return and this

can result in personal consumption falling relative to others. Equity thus becomes an unde-

sirable asset relative to bonds. Since average per capita consumption is rising over time, the




33
 In fact, a number of studies suggest that there is a small serial correlation in the growth rate.
34
     If we linearize the “surplus consumption ratio” in the Campbell Cochrane (1999) model, we get the same variation in the risk
free rate as in the standard habit model. The nonlinear “surplus consumption ratio” is essential to reducing this variation.

induced demand for bonds with this modification helps in mitigating the risk-free rate puz-

zle.

            Abel (1990) defines utility as the ratio of consumption relative to average per capita

consumption rather than the difference between the two. It can be shown that this is not a

trivial modification.36 While “difference” habit models can in principle generate a high eq-

uity premium, ratio models generate a premium that is similar to that obtained with standard

preferences.

            To illustrate consider the framework in Abel (1990) specialized to the “catching up

with the Joneses” case. At time t, the representative agent in the economy chooses the level

of consumption ct to maximize

where Ct -1 is the lagged aggregate consumption. In equilibrium of course Ct = ct , a fact we

     See Campbell (2001) for a detailed discussion.
                                                                                                              40


We see that in the expression ln Rf = -ln b + amx -1 / 2a 2s x2 - g (1 -a )mx , the equity pre-

mium is ln E{Re} - ln R f = as x , z , which is exactly the same as what was obtained earlier.

Hence the equity premium is unchanged! However when g > 0, a high a does not lead to the

risk free rate puzzle.

         The statement, “External habit simply adds a term to the Euler equation 60 which is known at

time t, and this does not affect the premium” in Campbell (2001) appears to be inconsistent with the

results in Table 1 Panel B in Abel (1990).



Resolution.

         Although the “set up” in Abel (1990) and Campbell (2001) is similar, Campbell’s result is based

on the assumption that asset returns and the growth rate of consumption are jointly log-normally

distributed in both the “standard time additive” case and the “Joneses” case. In Abel (1990) the return

distributions are endogenously determined and Campbell’s assumption is internally inconsistent in the

context of that model.

         In Abel (1990), with “standard time additive” preferences, if consumption growth is log-

normally distributed gross asset returns will also be lognormal, however, this is not the case with

the “Joneses” preferences. In the latter case since 1 + Ri , t +1 = xt1-a ( xt +1 + Axta+1 ) / A , log-normality

of x will not induce log-normality in 1 + Ri , t +1 . ( xt = ct +1 / ct ).

         Abel (1990) reports expressions for E(1 + Ri , t +1 ) and E(1 + R f ,t +1 ) in equations 17 and 18.

Let ’ Abel = ln( E(1 + Ri , t +1 )) - ln( E(1 + R f ,t +1 )) . In the Abel model with q = 0 (the “standard time

additive” case), if the growth rate of consumption is assumed to be lognormally distributed ’ Abel can be

written as:
                                                                                                                           41


’ Abel = E(ln(1 + Ri , t +1 )) + 0.5Var (ln(1 + Ri ,t +1 )) - E(ln(1 + R f ,t +1 )) - 0.5Var (ln(1 + R f ,t +1 ))   (37)

or ’ Abel = ’ Campbell +0.5[Var (ln(1 + Ri ,t +1 )) - Var (ln(1 + R f ,t +1 ))]                                     (38)

or ’ Abel = ’ Campbell +0.5Var (ln( x )).                                                                           (39)

where ’ Campbell = E(ln(1 + Ri , t +1 )) - E(ln(1 + R f ,t +1 )) , is the definition of the equity premium in Campbell

(2001).

          With “standard time additive” preferences and log-normally distributed returns, the analysis in

Abel and Campbell are equivalent. Indeed, a direct evaluation of ’ Abel from equations 17 and 18 in Abel

(1990) yields ’ Abel = aCov(ln x,ln(1 + Ri )) . This is identical to that obtained by adjusting equation 62 in

Campbell by adding 0.5Var (ln( x )) .

          However, in Abel (1990) with “Joneses” preferences, if the growth rate of consumption is log-

normally distributed, asset returns will not be lognormal, hence the analysis in Campbell (2001) after

equation 60 will not apply.

          In Abel (1990), as preferences change, return distributions will change, hence if the counterpart

of equation 16 (in Campbell) represents the equity premium in the “standard time additive” framework

then equation 62 will not be the relevant expression for the premium in the “Joneses” case. Counterparts

of equations 16 and 62 in Campbell (2001) will not both hold simultaneously in Abel (1990).

          To summarize, models with habit formation and relative or subsistence consumption

have had success in addressing the risk free rate puzzle but only limited success with re-

solving the equity premium puzzle, since in these models effective risk aversion and pru-

dence become implausibly large.

2.3 Idiosyncratic and Uninsurable Income Risk


         At a theoretical level, aggregate consumption is a meaningful economic construct if the

market is complete, or effectively so.37 Market completeness is implicitly incorporated into asset

pricing models in finance and neoclassical macroeconomics through the assumption of the exis-

tence of a representative household. In complete markets, heterogeneous households are able to

equalize, state by state, their marginal rate of substitution. The equilibrium in a heterogeneous

full-information economy is isomorphic in its pricing implications to the equilibrium in a repre-

sentative-household, full-information economy, if households have von Neumann-Morgenstern

preferences.

         Bewley (1982), Mankiw (1986), and Mehra and Prescott (1985) suggest the potential of

enriching the asset-pricing implications of the representative-household paradigm, by relaxing

the assumption of complete markets.38

         Current financial paradigms postulate that idiosyncratic income shocks must exhibit three

properties in order to explain the returns on financial assets: uninsurability, persistence hetero-

scedasticity and counter cyclical conditional variance. In infinite horizon models, agents faced

with uninsurable income shocks will dynamically self -insure, effectively smoothing consump-

tion. Hence the difference in the equity premium in incomplete markets and complete markets is

small.39

     This section draws on Constantinides (2002).

   There is an extensive literature on the hypothesis of complete consumption insurance. See, Altonji, Hayashi and Kotlikoff
(1992), Attanasio and Davis (1997), Cochrane (1991), and Mace (1991).
39
   Lucas (1994) and Telmer (1993) calibrate economies in which consumers face uninsurable income risk and borrowing or short-
selling constraints. They conclude that consumers come close to the complete-markets rule of complete risk sharing, although
consumers are allowed to trade in just one security in a frictionless market. Aiyagari and Gertler (1991) and Heaton and Lucas
(1996) add transaction costs and/or borrowing costs and reach a similar negative conclusion, provided that the supply of bonds is
not restricted to an unrealistically low level.
                                                                                                                               43


          Constantinides and Duffie (1996), propose a model incorporating heterogeneity that

captures the notion that consumers are subject to idiosyncratic income shocks that cannot be in-

sured away. For instance, consumers face the risk of job loss, or other major personal disasters

that cannot be hedged away or insured against.40 Equities and related pro-cyclical investments

exhibit the undesirable feature that they drop in value when the probability of job loss increases,

as, for instance, in recessions. In economic downturns, consumers thus need an extra incentive to

hold equities and other similar investment instruments; the equity premium can then be rational-

ized as the added inducement needed to make equities palatable to investors.

          The model provides an explanation of the counter-cyclical behavior of the equity risk

premium: the risk premium is highest in a recession because the stock is the poorest hedge to job

loss in a recession. It also provides an explanation of the unconditional equity premium puzzle:

even though per capita consumption growth is poorly correlated with stocks returns, investors

require a hefty premium to hold stocks over short-term bonds because stocks perform poorly in

recessions, when an investor is more likely to be laid off.

          Since the proposition demonstrates the existence of equilibrium in frictionless markets, it

implies that the Euler equations of household (but not necessarily of per capita) consumption

must hold. Furthermore, since the given price processes have embedded in them whatever pre-

dictability of returns of the dividend-price ratios and other instruments that the researcher cares

to ascribe to them, the equilibrium price processes have this predictability built into them by con-

struction.




40
  Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron (2001) provide empirical evidence from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics (PSID) that
idiosyncratic income shocks are persistent and have counter cyclical conditional variance. Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron (2000)
corroborate this evidence by studying household consumption over the life cycle.
                                                                                                                          44


         Constantinides and Duffie (1996), point out that periods with frequent and large uninsur-

able idiosyncratic income shocks are associated with both dispersed cross-sectional distribution

of the household consumption growth and low stock returns. Brav, Constantinides, and Geczy

(2002) provide empirical evidence of the impact of uninsurable idiosyncratic income risk on

pricing. They estimate the relative risk aversion (RRA) coefficient and test the set of Euler equa-

tions of household consumption on the premium of the value-weighted and the equally weighted

market portfolio return over the risk-free rate, and on the premium of value stocks over growth

stocks. 41They do not reject the Euler equations of household consumption with an economically

plausible RRA coefficient of between two and four, although they reject the Euler equations of

per capita consumption with any value of the RRA coefficient.

         Krebs (2000) extends the Constantinides and Duffie (1996) model by introducing rare

idiosyncratic income shocks that drive consumption close to zero. In his model, the conditional

variance and skewness of the idiosyncratic income shocks are nearly constant over time. He pro-

vides a theoretical justification of the difficulty of empirically assessing the contribution of these

catastrophic shocks in the low-order cross-sectional moments.



     2.4 Models Incorporating a Disaster State and Survivorship Bias


         Rietz (1988) has proposed a solution to the puzzle that incorporates a very small

probability of a very large drop in consumption. He finds that in such a scenario the risk-free

rate is much lower than the return on an equity security. This model requires a 1-in-100

41
   In related studies, Jacobs (1999) studies the PSID database on food consumption; Cogley (1999) and Vissing-Jorgensen (2002)
study the CEX database on broad measures of consumption; Jacobs and Wang (2001) study the CEX database by constructing
synthetic cohorts; and Ait-Sahalia, Parker, and Yogo (2001) measure the household consumption with the purchases of certain
luxury goods.
                                                                                                    45


chance of a 25 percent decline in consumption to reconcile the equity premium with a risk

aversion parameter of 10. Such a scenario has not been observed in the United States for the

last years for which we have economic data. Nevertheless, one can evaluate the implications

of the model. One implication is that the real interest rate and the probability of the occur-

rence of the extreme event move inversely. For example, the perceived probability of a re-

currence of a depression was probably very high just after World War II and subsequently

declined over time. If real interest rates rose significantly as the war years receded, that evi-

dence would support the Rietz hypothesis. Similarly, if the low probability event precipitat-

ing the large decline in consumption were a nuclear war, the perceived probability of such

an event has surely varied over the last 100 years. It must have been low before 1945, the

first and only year the atom bomb was used. And it must have been higher before the Cuban

Missile Crisis than after it. If real interest rates had moved as predicted, that would support

Rietz’s disaster scenario. But they did not.

       Another attempt at resolving the puzzle proposed by Brown et al (1995) focuses on

survival bias.

       The central thesis here is that the ex-post measured returns reflect the premium, in

the United States, on a stock market that has successfully weathered the vicissitudes of

fluctuating financial fortunes. Many other exchanges were unsuccessful and hence the ex-

ante equity premium was low. Since it was not known a priori which exchanges would

survive, for this explanation to work, stock and bond markets must be differentially

impacted by a financial crisis. Governments have expropriated much of the real value of

nominal debt by the mechanism of unanticipated inflation. Five historical instances come
                                                                                                  46


readily to mind: During the German hyperinflation, holders of bonds denominated in Reich

marks lost virtually all value invested in those assets. During the Poincare¢ administration in

France during the 1920’s, bond-holders lost nearly 90% of the value invested in nominal

debt. And in the 1980s, Mexican holders of dollar-denominated debt lost a sizable fraction

of its value when the Mexican government, in a period of rapid inflation, converted the debt

to pesos and limited the rate at which these funds could be withdrawn. Czarist bonds in

Russia and Chinese debt holdings (subsequent to the fall of the Nationalists) suffered a

similar fate under communist regimes.

       The above examples demonstrate that in times of financial crisis, bonds are as likely

to lose value as stocks. Although a survival bias may impact on the levels of both the return

on equity and debt, there is no evidence to support the assertion that these crises impact

differentially on the returns to stocks and bonds; hence the equity premium is not impacted.

In every instance where trading equity has been suspended, due to political upheavals, etc.,

governments have either reneged on their debt obligations or expropriated much of the real

value of nominal debt through the mechanism of unanticipated inflation.

       The difficulty that collectively several model classes have had in explaining the

equity premium as a compensation for bearing risk leads us to conclude that perhaps it is not

a “risk premium” but rather due to other factors. We consider these in the next section.
                                                                                                        47




3.         Is The Equity Premium Due to Borrowing Constraints, a
           Liquidity Premium or Taxes?


3.1 Borrowing Constraints


           In models with borrowing constraints and transaction costs, the effect is to force in-

vestors to hold an inventory of bonds (precautionary demand) to smooth consumption.

Hence in infinite horizon with borrowing constraints, agents come close to equalizing their

marginal rates of substitution with little effect on the equity premium.42 Some recent at-

tempts to resolve the puzzle incorporating both borrowing constraints and consumer hetero-

geneity appear promising. One approach, which departs from the representative agent

model, has been proposed in Constantinides, Donaldson and Mehra (2002).

           In order to systematically illustrate these ideas, the authors construct an overlapping-

generations (OLG) exchange economy in which consumers live for three periods. In the

first period, a period of human capital acquisition, the consumer receives a relatively low

endowment income. In the second period, the consumer is employed and receives wage in-

come subject to large uncertainty. In the third period, the consumer retires and consumes the

assets accumulated in the second period.

           The authors explore the implications of a borrowing constraint by deriving and con-

trasting the stationary equilibria in two versions of the economy. In the borrowing-

constrained version, the young are prohibited from borrowing and from selling equity short.



42
     This is true unless the supply of bonds is unrealistically low. See Aiyagari and Gertler (1991).
                                                                                                     48


The borrowing-unconstrained economy differs from the borrowing-constrained one only in

that the borrowing constraint and the short-sale constraint are absent.

        An unconstrained representative agent’s maximization problem is formulated as follows.

An agent born in period t solves:

ct,j is the consumption in period t +j (j = 0, 1, 2) of a consumer born in period t. There are two

types of securities in the model, bonds, and equity with ex-coupon and ex-dividend prices qbt and

qet respectively. Bonds are a claim to a coupon payment b every period, while the equity is a

claim to the dividend stream {dt}. The consumer born in period t receives deterministic wage

income w0> 0 in period t, when young; stochastic wage income w1t+1 > 0 in period t+1, when

middle-aged; and zero wage income in period t+2, when old. The consumer purchases zet,0 shares

of stock and zbt,0 bonds when young. The consumer adjusts these holdings to zet,1 and zbt,1 , re-

spectively, when middle-aged. The consumer liquidates his/her entire portfolio when old. Thus

zet,2 = 0 and zbt,2 = 0.

        When considering the borrowing constrained equilibrium the following additional con-

straints are imposed zet,j > 0 and zbt,2 > 0.
                                                                                                                         49


         The model introduces two forms of market incompleteness. First, consumers of one gen-

eration are prohibited from trading claims against their future wage income with consumers of

another generation.43 Second, consumers of one generation are prohibited from trading bonds

and equity with consumers of an unborn generation. As discussed earlier in Section 2.3, absent a

complete set of contingent claims, consumer heterogeneity in the form of uninsurable, persistent

and heteroscedastic idiosyncratic income shocks, with counter-cyclical conditional variance, can

potentially resolve empirical difficulties encountered by representative-consumer models.44

         The novelty of their paper lies in incorporating a life-cycle feature to study asset

pricing. The idea is appealingly simple. As discussed earlier, the attractiveness of equity as

an asset depends on the correlation between consumption and equity income. If equity pays

off in states of high marginal utility of consumption, it will command a higher price, (and

consequently a lower rate of return), than if its payoff is in states where marginal utility is

low. Since the marginal utility of consumption varies inversely with consumption, equity

will command a high rate of return if it pays off in states when consumption is high, and

vice versa.45

         A key insight of their paper is that as the correlation of equity income with con-

sumption changes over the life cycle of an individual, so does the attractiveness of equity as

an asset. Consumption can be decomposed into the sum of wages and equity income. A

young person looking forward at his life has uncertain future wage and equity income; fur-

thermore, the correlation of equity income with consumption will not be particularly high,

as long as stock and wage income are not highly correlated. This is empirically the case, as

43
   Being homogeneous within their generation, consumers have no incentive to trade claims with consumers of their own genera-
tion.

                                                                                                                          50


documented by Davis and Willen (2000). Equity will thus be a hedge against fluctuations in

wages and a “desirable” asset to hold as far as the young are concerned.

         The same asset (equity) has a very different characteristic for the middle-aged. Their

wage uncertainty has largely been resolved. Their future retirement wage income is either

zero or deterministic and the innovations (fluctuations) in their consumption occur from

fluctuations in equity income. At this stage of the life cycle, equity income is highly corre-

lated with consumption. Consumption is high when equity income is high, and equity is no

longer a hedge against fluctuations in consumption; hence, for this group, it requires a

higher rate of return.

         The characteristics of equity as an asset therefore change, depending on who the

predominant holder of the equity is. Life cycle considerations thus become crucial for asset

pricing. If equity is a “desirable” asset for the marginal investor in the economy, then the

observed equity premium will be low, relative to an economy where the marginal investor

finds it unattractive to hold equity. The deus ex machina is the stage in the life cycle of the

marginal investor.

         The authors argue that the young, who should be holding equity in an economy

without frictions and with complete contraction, are effectively shut out of this market be-

cause of borrowing constraints. The young are characterized by low wages; ideally they

would like to smooth lifetime consumption by borrowing against future wage income (con-

suming a part of the loan and investing the rest in higher return equity). However, they are

prevented from doing so because human capital alone does not collateralize major loans in

modern economies for reasons of moral hazard and adverse selection.

45
   This is precisely the reason as explained earlier why high-beta stocks in the simple CAPM framework have a high rate of re-
turn. In that model, the return on the market is a proxy for consumption. High-beta stocks pay off when the market return is
                                                                                                                51


          In the presence of borrowing constraints, equity is thus exclusively priced by the

middle-aged investors, since the young are effectively excluded from the equity markets and

we observe a high equity premium. If the borrowing constraint is relaxed, the young will

borrow to purchase equity, thereby raising the bond yield. The increase in the bond yield

induces the middle-aged to shift their portfolio holdings from equity to bonds. The increase

in demand for equity by the young and the decrease in the demand for equity by the middle-

aged work in opposite directions. On balance, the effect is to increase both the equity and

the bond return while simultaneously shrinking the equity premium. Furthermore, the re-

laxation of the borrowing constraint reduces the net demand for bonds and the risk-free rate

puzzle re-emerges.




3.2       Liquidity Premium


          Bansal and Coleman (1996) develop a monetary model that offers an explanation of the

equity premium. In their model, some assets other than money play a key feature by facilitating

transactions. This affects the rate of return they offer in equilibrium.

          Considering the role of a variety of assets in facilitating transactions, they argue that, on

the margin, the transaction service return of money relative to interest bearing checking accounts

should be the interest rate paid on these accounts. They estimate this to be 6 % based on the rate

offered on NOW accounts for the period they analyze. Since this is a substantial number, they

suggest that other money-like assets may also implicitly include a transaction service component

to their return. Insofar as T-bills and equity have a different service component built into their


high, i.e. when marginal utility is low, hence their price is (relatively) low and their rate of return high.
                                                                                                     52


returns, this may offer an explanation for the observed equity premium. In fact, if this service

component differential were about 5 % there would be no equity premium puzzle.

       We argue that this approach can be challenged on three accounts. First, the majority of T-

bills are held by institutions, that do not use them as compensatory balances for checking ac-

counts and it is difficult to imagine their having a significant transaction service component.

Second, the returns on NOW and other interest bearing accounts have varied over time. These

returns have been higher post-1980 than in earlier periods. In fact, for most of the twentieth cen-

tury, checking accounts were not interest bearing. However, contrary to the implications of this

model, the equity premium has not diminished in the post-1980 period when presumably the im-

plied transaction service component was the greatest. Third, this model implies that there be a

significant yield differential between T-Bills and long term government bonds that presumably

do not have a significant transaction service component. However, this has not been the case.




3.3    Taxes and Regulation


       McGrattan and Prescott (2000, 2001) take the position that factors other than a premium

for bearing non-diversifiable risk account for the large difference in the return on corporate eq-

uity and the after-tax real interest rate in the 1960-2000 period. They find that changes in the

U.S. tax and legal-regulatory systems that permitted retirement accounts and pension funds to

hold corporate equity and reductions in marginal income tax rates account for the high return on

corporate equity in this period.

       Subsequent to the writing of our equity premium paper (Mehra and Prescott (1985)), real

business cycle theory was developed (Kydland and Prescott (1982) and Hansen (1985)). Real
                                                                                                       53


business cycle theory uses the stochastic growth model augmented to include the labor-leisure

decision. One finding of the real business cycle literature is that the real after-tax interest rate

varies in the range from 4 to 4.5 percent. Another finding is that the predicted after-tax return on

corporate equity is essentially equal to this real interest rate. These results are closely related to

and consistent with what Mehra and Prescott (1985) found in their “Equity Premium Puzzle” pa-

per. The key difference is the empirical counterpart of the real interest rate. Mehra and Prescott

(1985) use the highly liquid T-bill rate, corrected for expected inflation. Business cycle theorists

(see McGrattan and Prescott (2000, 2001), who build in the details of the tax system) use the in-

tertemporal marginal rate of substitution for consumption to determine this interest rate.

        Why was the average real return on T-bills significantly below the real interest rate as

found in the business cycle literature? Why was the average real return on corporate equity sig-

nificantly above this real interest rate in the 1960-2000 period? The low realized real return on

T-bills in this period probably has to do with liquidity services T-bills provide. The total T-bill

real return, including liquidity services, could very well have been in the range from 4 to 4.5 per-

cent.

        A more interesting question is, why was the return on corporate equity so high in the

1960-2000 period? McGrattan and Prescott (2000) answer this question in the process of esti-

mating the fundamental value of the stock market in 1962 and 2000. They chose these two

points in time because, relative to GDP, after-tax corporate earnings, net corporate debt, and cor-

porate tangible capital stock were approximately the same and the tax system had been stable for

a number of years. Further, at neither point in time was there any fear of full or partial expro-

priation of capital.
                                                                                                    54


       What differed was that the value of the stock market relative to GDP in 2000 was nearly

twice as large as in 1962.

       What changed between 1962 and 2000 were the tax and legal-regulatory systems. The

marginal tax rate on corporate distributions was 43 percent in the 1955-1962 period and only 17

percent in the 1987-2000. This marginal tax rate on dividends does not have consequences for

steady-state after-tax earnings or steady-state corporate capital, provided that tax revenues are

returned lump-sum to households. This tax rate does however have consequences for the value

of corporate equity.

       The important changes in the legal-regulatory system, most of which occurred in the late

1970s and early 1980s, were that corporate equity was permitted to be held as pension fund re-

serves and that people could invest on a before tax basis in individual retirement accounts that

could include equity. The threat of a lawsuit is why debt assets and not equity with higher re-

turns were held as pension fund reserves in 1962. At that time, little equity was held in defined

contribution plans retirement accounts because the total assets in these accounts were then a

small number. Thus, debt and not equity could and was held tax free in 1962. In 2000, both can

be held tax free in defined benefit and defined contribution pension funds and in individual re-

tirement accounts. Not surprisingly, the assets held in untaxed retirement accounts are large in

2000, being approximately 1.3 GDP (McGrattan and Prescott (2000)).

       McGrattan and Prescott (2000, 2001) in determining whether the stock market was over-

valued or undervalued vis-a-vis standard growth theory exploit the fact that the value of a set of

real assets is the sum of the values of the individual assets in the set. They develop a method for

estimating the value of intangible corporate capital, something that is not reported on balance

sheets and, like tangible capital, adds to the value of corporations. Their method uses only na-
                                                                                                                                    55


tional account data and the equilibrium condition that after-tax returns are equated across assets.

They also incorporate the most important features of the U.S. tax system into the model they use

to determine the value of corporate equity, in particular, the fact that capital gains are only taxed

upon realization.

          The formula they develop for the fundamental value of corporate equities V is

(1)                 V = (1 - t d ) K T' + (1 -t d ) (1 - t c ) K I'

where

          t d is the tax rate on distributions,

          t c is the tax rate on corporate income,

          KT' is the end-of-period tangible corporate capital stock, and

          K I' is the end-of-period intangible corporate capital stock.

The reasons for the tax factors are as follows. Corporate earnings significantly exceed corporate

investment, and as a result, aggregate corporate distributions are large and positive. Historically

these distributions have been in the form of dividends. Therefore, the cost of a unit of tangible

capital on margin is only 1 - t d units of forgone consumption. In the case of intangible capital,

the consumption cost of a unit of capital is even smaller because investments in intangible capital

reduce corporate tax liabilities46.

          The tricky part of the calculation is in constructing a measure of intangible capital. These

investments reduce current accounting profits and they increase future economic profits. The

formula for steady-state before tax accounting profits is



46
  In fact, formula (1) must be adjusted if economic depreciation and accounting depreciation are not equal and if there is an in-
vestment tax credit. See McGrattan and Prescott (2001).
                                                                                                    56


                  i
(2)       p=          KT + i K I - g K I ,
               1 -t c

where g is the steady-state growth rate of the economy and the interest rate i the steady-state af-

ter-tax real interest rate. Note that g K I is steady-state net investment in intangible capital, which

reduces accounting profits because it is expensed. Note also, all the variables in formula (2) are

reported in the system of national accounts with the exception of i and K I .

          McGrattan and Prescott (2001) estimate i using national income data. Their estimate of i

is the after-tax real return on capital in the noncorporate sector, which has as much capital as

does the corporate sector. They find that the stock market was neither overvalued nor underval-

ued in 1962 and 2000. The primary reason for the low valuation in 1962 relative to GDP and

high valuation in 2000 relative to GDP is that t d was much higher in 1962 than it was in 2000.

The secondary reason is that the value of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations grew in the

period. An increase in the size of the corporate intangible capital stock was also a contributing

factor.

          McGrattan and Prescott (2001) find that in the economically and politically stable 1960-

2000 period, the after-tax real return on holding corporate equity was as predicted by theory if

the changes in the tax and regulatory system were not anticipated. These unanticipated changes

led to a large unanticipated capital gain on holding corporate equity. Evidence of the importance

of these changes is that the share of corporate equity held in retirement accounts and as pension

fund reserves increased from essentially zero in 1962 to slightly over 50 percent in 2000. This is

important because it means that half of corporate dividends are now subject to zero taxation.

          In periods of economic uncertainty, such as those that prevailed in the 1930-1955 period

with the Great Depression, World War II, and the fear of another great depression, the survival
                                                                                                    57


of the capitalistic system was in doubt. In such times, low equity prices and high real returns on

holding equity are not surprising. This is the Brown, Goetzmann, and Ross (1995) explanation

of the equity premium. By 1960, the fears of another great depression and of an abandonment of

the capitalistic system in the United States had vanished, and clearly other factors gave rise to the

high return on equity in the 1960-2000 period.



4. An Equity Premium in the Future?


       There is a group of academicians and professionals who claim that at present there is no

equity premium, and by implication, no equity premium puzzle. To address these claims we need

to differentiate between two different interpretations of the term “equity premium.” One is the

ex-post or realized equity premium. This is the actual, historically observed difference between

the return on the market, as captured by a stock index, and the risk free rate, as proxied by the

return on government bills. This is what we addressed in Mehra and Prescott (1985). However,

there is a related concept–the ex-ante equity premium. This is a forward-looking measure of the

premium, that is, the equity premium that is expected to prevail in the future or the conditional

equity premium given the current state of the economy. To elaborate, after a bull market, when

stock valuations are high relative to fundamentals the ex-ante equity premium is likely to be low.

However, it is precisely in these times, when the market has risen sharply, that the ex-post, or the

realized premium is high. Conversely, after a major downward correction, the ex-ante (ex-

pected) premium is likely to be high while the realized premium will be low. This should not

come as a surprise since returns to stock have been documented to be mean-reverting.

       Dimson, Marsh and Staunton (2000), Siegel (1998), and Fama and French (2002) docu-
                                                                                                                                 58


ment that equity returns over the past 50 years have been higher than their expected values. Fama

and French argue that since the average realized return over this period exceeds the one-year

ahead conditional forecast (based on the price dividend ratio) by an average of 3.11 to 4.88 per-

cent per year, the expected equity premium should have declined by this amount. The key impli-

cation here is that the expected equity premium is small.

          If investors have overestimated the equity premium over the second half of this century,

Constantinides (2002) argues that “we now have a bigger puzzle on our hands.” Why have in-

vestors systematically biased their estimates over such a long horizon? He finds no statistical

support for the Fama and French claim however.47

          Which of these interpretations of the equity premium is relevant for an investment advi-

sor? Clearly this depends on the planning horizon. The equity premium that we documented in

our 1985 paper is for very long investment horizons. It has little to do with what the premium is

going to be over the next couple of years. The ex-post equity premium is the realization of a sto-

chastic process over a certain period and as shown earlier (see Figures 1, 2 and 3) it has varied

considerably and counter-cyclically over time.

          Market watchers and other professionals who are interested in short term investment

planning will wish to project the conditional equity premium over their planning horizon. This is

by no means a simple task. Even if the conditional equity premium given current market condi-

tions is small, and there appears to be general consensus that it is, this in itself does not imply

that it was obvious either that the historical premium was too high or that the equity premium has

diminished.

          The data used to document the equity premium over the past 100 years is as good an eco-

47
  “Notwithstanding the possibility that regime shifts may well have occurred during this period and that behavior deviations
from rationality may have been at work, the simple present-value model matches the gross features of the equity return and the
                                                                                                                          59


nomic data set as we have and this is a long series when it comes to economic data. Before we

dismiss the premium, not only do we need to understand the observed phenomena but we also

need a plausible explanation why the future is likely to be any different from the past. In the ab-

sence of this, and based on what we currently know, we can make the following claim: over the

long horizon the equity premium is likely to be similar to what it has been in the past and the re-

turns to investment in equity will continue to substantially dominate that in T- bills for investors

with a long planning horizon.

                                            Appendix A



Suppose the distribution of returns period by period is independently and identically distributed.
Then as the number of periods tends to infinity, the future value of the investment, computed at
the arithmetic average of returns tends to the expected value of the investment with probability 1.

To see this,
          T
let VT = P(1+ rt ) , where rt is the asset return in period t and VT is the terminal value of one dol-
          t =1
lar at time T.
                     T
Then E (VT ) = E ÈÍ P(1 + rt )˘˙ . Since the rt s are assumed to be uncorrelated, we have
                  Î i =1       ˚
                   T
        E (VT ) = P E (1 + rt ) .
                  i=1


                   T
or      E (VT ) = P(1+ E (rt )) .
                  i=1


                                 1 T
                                 TÂ
Let the arithmetic average, AA =       rt
                                   t=t
Then by the strong law of large numbers (Theorem 22.1, Billingsley)
                       T
        E (VT ) Æ P(1 + AA ) as T Æ •
                    i=1



        E (VT ) Æ (1 + AA ) as the number of periods T becomes large.
                              T
or
                                                                                                    69




If asset returns, rt , are identically and independently log normally distributed, then, as the num-
ber of periods tends to infinity, the future value of an investment compounded at the continu-
ously compounded geometric average rate tends to the median value of the investment.
          T
Let VT = P(1+ rt ) , where rt is the asset return in period t and VT is the terminal value of one
         t =1
dollar at time T.

The Geometric Average is defined by:
                                     1/T
             ÈT          ˘
        GA = ÍP (1+ rt ) ˙                 -1
             Ît =1       ˚

                                    1
                                          ln(1+ rt )
                            T

                                    TÂ
hence VT = (1+ GA) and ln(1+ GA) =
Let the continuously compounded geometric rate of return = mrc . Then by definition

        ln(1+ GA) = m rc
                     m rc
or      1 + GA = e

and     (1+ GA)T = e        T m rc




By the properties of the lognormal distribution the median value of VT = e E ( lnVT ) and by the
strong law of large numbers E (lnVT ) = Â E ln(1 + rt ) Æ Tmre as T Æ • (Theorem 22.1, Billing-
sley).
                                                 T
Hence the median value of VT = e Tm rc = (1 + GA) as claimed above.

                                               Appendix B

                         The Original Analysis of the Equity Premium Puzzle

       In this Appendix we present our original analysis of the equity premium puzzle. Needless

to say, it draws heavily from Mehra and Prescott (1985).

       The economy, asset prices and returns

       We employ a variation of Lucas' (1978) pure exchange model. Since per capita con-

sumption has grown over time, we assume that the growth rate of the endowment follows a

Markov process. This is in contrast to the assumption in Lucas' model that the endowment level

follows a Markov process. Our assumption, which requires an extension of competitive equilib-

rium theory, enables us to capture the non-stationarity in the consumption series associated with

the large increase in per capita consumption that occurred in the 1889-1978 period.

       The economy we consider was judiciously selected so that the joint process governing the

growth rates in aggregate per capita consumption and asset prices would be stationary and easily

determined. The economy has a single representative 'stand-in' household. This unit orders its

preferences over random consumption paths by



                   Ï•            ¸
               E 0 ÌÂ b tU (c t )˝ ,   0 < b < 1,                                    (1B)
                   Ó t =0        ˛




       where c t is per capita consumption, b is the subjective time discount factor, E{◊} is the

expectation operator conditional upon information available at time zero (which denotes the pre-

sent time) and U: R+ Æ R is the increasing concave utility function. To insure that the equilib-
                                                                                                     71


rium return process is stationary, we further restrict the utility function to be of the constant rela-

tive risk aversion (CRRA) class

                                                           c1-a
                                             U (c, a ) =        ,   0 <a <•            (2B)
                                                           1-a

        The parameter a measures the curvature of the utility function. When a is equal to one,

the utility function is defined to be the logarithmic function, which is the limit of the above func-

tion as a approaches one.

        We assume there is one productive unit which produces output yt in period t which is the

period dividend. There is one equity share with price pt that is competitively traded; it is a claim

to the stochastic process { yt }.

        The growth rate in yt is subject to a Markov chain; that is,

                          yt +1 = xt +1 yt                                             (3B)

where xt +1 Œ{l1 ,..., ln} is the growth rate, and Pr{xt +1 = l1 ; xt = l j} = fij .   (4B)

        It is also assumed that the Markov chain is ergodic. The li are all positive and y0 > 0 .

The random variable yt is observed at the beginning of the period, at which time dividend pay-

ments are made. All securities are traded ex-dividend. We also assume that the matrix A with

elements aij ∫ bfij l1j-a for i, j = 1,…,n is stable; that is, lim Am as m Æ • is zero. In Mehra (1988)

it is shown that this is necessary and sufficient for expected utility to exist if the stand-in house-

hold consumes yt every period. The paper also defines and establishes the existence of a Debreu

(1954) competitive equilibrium with a price system having a dot product representation under

this condition.
                                                                                                       72


        Next we formulate expressions for the equilibrium time t price of the equity share and the

risk-free bill. We follow the convention of pricing securities ex-dividend or ex-interest payments

at time t, in terms of the time t consumption good. For any security with process {ds} on pay-

ments, its price in period t is

                         Ï •                                  ¸
                 Pt = Et Ì Â b s - tU ¢ ( ys ) ds / U ¢ ( yt )˝ ,                         (5B)
                         Ós = t +1                            ˛



as the equilibrium consumption is the process {ys}and the equilibrium price system has a dot

product representation.

        The dividend payment process for the equity share in this economy is {ys}. Consequently,

using the fact that U ¢ (c) = c -a ,

                 Pt e = P e ( xt , yt )

                          Ï •         ya            ¸
                      = E Ì Â b s - t ta ys xt , yt ˝                                     (6B)
                          Ós = t +1   ys            ˛



        Variables xt and yt are sufficient relative to the entire history of shocks up to, and includ-

ing, time t for predicting the subsequent evolution of the economy. They thus constitute legiti-

mate state variables for the model. Since ys = yt xt +1 ... xs , the price of the equity security is homo-

geneous of degree one in yt which is the current endowment of the consumption good. As the

equilibrium values of the economies being studied are time invariant functions of the state

( xt , yt ), the subscript t can be dropped. This is accomplished by redefining the state to be the pair

(c, i ) , if yt = c and xt = li . With this convention, the price of the equity share from (6B) satisfies
                                                                                                       73

                                                    n
                               pe (c, i ) = b Â fij (l j c)-a [ pe (l j c, j ) + l j c] ca .   (7B)
                                                j =1



       Using the result that pe (c, i ) is homogeneous of degree one in c, we represent this function

as                             pe (c, i ) = w i c                                              (8B)

where wi is a constant. Making this substitution in (7B) and dividing by c yields
                               n
                wi = b Â fij l(j1-a ) ( w j + 1)               for i = 1,…, n.                 (9B)
                              j =1



This is a system of n linear equations in n unknowns. The assumption that guaranteed existence

of equilibrium guarantees the existence of a unique positive solution to this system.

       The period return if the current state is (c, i) and next period state (ljc, j) is

                         pe (l j c, j ) + l j c - pe (c, i )
                rije =
                                      pe (c, i )

                          l j ( w j + 1)
                     =                   -1 ,                                                  (10B)
                                wi

       The equity's expected period return if the current state is i is
                          n
                Rie = Â fij rije .                                                             (11B)
                         j =1



Capital letters are used to denote expected return. With the subscript i, it is the expected return

conditional upon the current state being (c, i). Without this subscript it is the expected return with

respect to the stationary distribution. The superscript indicates the type of security.

       The other security considered is the one-period real bill or riskless asset, which pays one

unit of the consumption good next period with certainty.

From (6B),

                pif = p f (c, i )
                                                                                                74

                                     n
                        = b Â fijU ¢(l j c) / U ¢(c)                                (12B)
                                    j =1




                        = b Â fij l-j a


The certain return on this riskless security is

                Ri f = 1 / pif - 1 ,                                                (13B)



when the current state is (c, i).

        As mentioned earlier, the statistics that are probably most robust to the modeling specifi-

cation are the means over time. Let p Œ Rn be the vector of stationary probabilities on i. This ex-


ists because the chain on i has been assumed to be ergodic. The vector p is the solution to the

system of equations



                p = fTp ,

with
                  n

                Âp       i   = 1 and fT = {fji}.
                 i =1



The expected returns on the equity and the risk-free security are, respectively,
                              n                    n
                Re = Â p i Rie and R f = Â p i Ri f .                               (14B)

Time sample averages will converge in probability to these values given the ergodicity of the

Markov chain. The risk premium for equity is Re - R f , a parameter that is used in the test.
                                                                                                     75


       The parameters defining preferences are a and b while the parameters defining technol-

ogy are the elements of [fij ] and [li ] . Our approach is to assume two states for the Markov chain

and to restrict the process as follows:

               l1 = 1 + m + d,            l2 = 1 + m- d,


               f11 = f22 = f,             f12 = f21 = (1 - f).


The parameters m, f, and d now define the technology. We require d > 0 and 0 < f < 1. This par-

ticular parameterization was selected because it permitted us to independently vary the average

growth rate of output by changing m, the variability of consumption by altering d, and the serial


correlation of growth rates by adjusting f.

       The parameters were selected so that the average growth rate of per capita consumption,

the standard deviation of the growth rate of per capita consumption and the first-order serial cor-

relation of this growth rate, all with respect to the model’s stationary distribution, matched the

sample values for the U.S. economy between 1889-1978. The sample values for the U.S. econ-

omy were 0.018, 0.036 and –0.14, respectively. The resulting parameter’s values were m = 0.018,


d = 0.036 and f = 0.43. Given these values, the nature of the test is to search for parameters a


and b for which the model’s averaged risk-free rate and equity risk premium match those ob-

served for the U.S. economy over this ninety-year period.

       The parameter a, which measures peoples’ willingness to substitute consumption be-

tween successive yearly time periods is an important one in many fields of economics. As men-

tioned in the text there is a wealth of evidence from various studies that the coefficient of risk
                                                                                                 76


aversion a is a small number, certainly less than 10. A number of these studies are documented


in Mehra and Prescott (1985). This is an important restriction, for with large a virtually any pair

of average equity and risk-free returns can be obtained by making small changes in the process

on consumption.




          Figure 1B. Set of admissible average equity risk premia and real returns

       Given the estimated process on consumption, Figure 1B depicts the set of values of the

average risk-free rate and equity risk premium which are both consistent with the model and re-

sult in average real risk-free rates between zero and four percent. These are values that can be

obtained by varying preference parameters a between zero and ten and b between zero and one.

The observed real return of 0.80 percent and equity premium of 6 percent is clearly inconsistent

with the predictions of the model. The largest premium obtainable with the model is 0.35 per-

cent, which is not close to the observed value.

An advantage of our approach is that we can easily test the sensitivity of our results to such di s-

tributional assumptions. With a less than ten, we found that our results were essentially un-

changed for very different consumption processes, provided that the mean and variances of

growth rates equaled the historically observed values. We use this fact in motivating the discus-

sion in the text.
