We compile large datasets from Norwegian and US historical censuses to study return migration
during the Age of Mass Migration (1850-1913). Return migrants were somewhat negatively
selected from the migrant pool: Norwegian immigrants who returned to Norway held slightly
lower-paid occupations than Norwegian immigrants who stayed in the US, both before and after
moving to the US. Upon returning to Norway, return migrants held higher-paid occupations than
Norwegians who never moved, despite hailing from poorer backgrounds. They were also more
likely to get married after return. These patterns suggest that despite being negatively selected,
return migrants were able to accumulate savings and improve their economic circumstances once
they returned home.

Introduction
       30 million migrants moved from Europe to the United States during the Age of Mass

Migration (1850-1913). Yet one in three of these arrivals eventually returned to Europe, a rate of

return migration that is even higher than today (Gould 1980; Bandiera, Rasul and Viarengo,

2013; Dustmann and Gorlach, 2016). In this paper, we ask: who chose to move back from the US

to Europe, and how did return migrants fare upon returning home? To the best of our knowledge,

this paper provides the first analysis of return migrants to Europe in the late nineteenth and early

twentieth century based on micro data.

       Our analysis is based on the case of Norway. We compile two large panel datasets of

return migrants to Norway observed at three points in their migration process: before they moved

from Norway, either as children or as young adults; during their sojourn to the US; and after

returning to Norway. For comparison, we also create a sample of more “permanent” migrants

who we observe before and after migration to the US, and a sample of non-migrants who

remained in Norway throughout the period. 1 To do so, we exploit a special supplement of the

1910 Norwegian Census that asked the full population if they had ever lived in the United States.

We link Norwegian-born men who lived either in Norway or in the US in 1910 to earlier

Norwegian Censuses, where we measure pre-migration characteristics.

       We find that migrants who returned to Norway held slightly lower-skilled occupations

than did Norwegian migrants who stayed in the US permanently. This small but significant

occupational gap was present both while abroad and before moving to the US. That return

migrants were negatively selected from the migrant pool even before moving to the US is



1
  Some men that we classify here as permanent migrants may have eventually returned to the
home country. We focus on men who had been in the US for at least five years to minimize this
concern, given that more than half of temporary moves to the US lasted five years or less.
                                                                                                  1
contrary to the idea that return migration mostly resulted from bad shocks that prevented

economic advancement in the destination.

       Furthermore, the negative selection of return migrants in this context is not consistent

with a simple Roy model. Unlike today, the occupation-based income distribution was more

unequal in Norway than in the US (Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson, 2012). In such a setting,

the Roy model predicts that higher skilled immigrants would be more likely to return to their

home country (Borjas and Bratsberg, 1996; Dustman and Gorlach, 2016). The pattern of negative

selection is more consistent with the possibility that low-skilled men who may have faced

borrowing constraints at home used temporary migration as a means to buy land or make other

local investments. 2 Indeed, we find that immigrants who hailed from rural areas in Norway were

more likely to return, and that these return migrants were likely to settle in their municipality of

birth and work as owner-occupier farmers.

       After going back to Norway, return migrants held higher-paid occupations than non-

immigrants, despite hailing from poorer backgrounds. Return migrants who stayed in the US for

a short period (1-5 years) enjoyed the highest earnings premium in Norway. One interpretation

for this finding is that successful migrants were able to accumulate savings and return home

more quickly. 3 Savings accumulated abroad may have also facilitated the investments necessary

to start a new household before marriage. Before leaving for the US, return migrants were less

likely than non-movers to be married, a pattern that reverses after return.




2
  On the use of temporary migration to accumulate savings, see Mesnard (2004), Yang (2006)
and Wyman (1993).
3
  Another interpretation, which is possible but seems less plausible, is that those returning
relatively quickly might be “target savers,” whereas those returning later might be “unplanned”
returners who got bad shock in the US and decided to go back.
                                                                                                  2
       Our paper contributes to a growing empirical literature exploring the economics of return

migration. In the modern data, comparisons between return and permanent migrants are usually

based on outcomes in the destination country, with the act of return migration inferred indirectly

from attrition from a panel sample (Aydemir and Robinson, 2008; Bijwaard, Schluter and

Wahba, 2014). 4 In earlier work, we used a similar approach to generate indirect evidence on the

selection of return migrants in historical data (Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson, 2012, 2014). 5

Using these methods, we found evidence of mild negative selection of return migrants to Europe.

       Our new historical dataset offers three advancements relative to the existing studies. First,

our data contains a direct measure of return migration, which allows us to validate indirect

evidence on the negative selection of return migrants to Europe. Second, the linked data allow us

to observe pre-migration characteristics in the sending country. With information on pre-

migration characteristics, we can separate explanations for negative selection based on either

initial selection or on differential shocks in the destination country. Third, we estimate the

economic return to time spent in the US using a set of Census questions asked of all residents of

Norway in 1910, whereas modern studies rely on small source country surveys with retrospective

migration histories (Wahba and Zenou, 2012; Reinhold and Thom, 2013).




4
  Rooth and Saarela (2007) is one exception. Linked register data allow the authors to observe
pre-migration characteristics of return migrants from Sweden to Finland.
5
  Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson (2012, 2013) match Norwegian migrants living in the US in
1880 to either the US or Norwegian Census of 1900. Return migrants observed in Norway in
1900 were 3 percentage points more likely to have been in the lower quartile of the occupational
distribution in 1880. Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson (2014) creates a panel dataset of
migrants from 16 sending countries that were present in the 1900, 1910 and 1920 US Census;
migrants in the panel are known not to return to Europe. We compare the panel data to a Census
cross-section, which contains a weighted average of migrants who will eventually stay in the US
and those that will return to Europe, and find indirect evidence that return migrants were mildly
negatively selected from the migrant pool.
                                                                                                  3
Historical background

          Many European migrants who moved to the United States in the early twentieth century

eventually returned to their home country. The US government collected official statistics on

both in- and out-migration from 1908 to 1923. In those years, the US received 10 million

immigrant arrivals and lost 3.5 million emigrants, a return migration rate of 35 percent (Gould,

1980; Wyman, 1993 p. 10-12; Hatton and Williamson, 1998, p. 9). Return migration rates may

have been even higher than the aggregate statistics suggest. Bandiera, Rasul and Viarengo (2013)

find that, in order to reconcile micro data on migrant inflows to the stock of migrants remaining

in the US in Census years, the return migration rate may have been as high as 70 percent. 6

          Return migration rates rose as the shift from sail to steamships reduced the cost of the

transatlantic voyage in the 1850s and 1860s. Travel times from Europe to the US declined from

one month in 1800 to eight days by 1870 (Hugill, 1993; Cohn, 2005). Shorter trips also lowered

the mortality risk of the journey (Cohn, 1984). The price of passage fell to around $25 in 1900,

which was 6 percent of mean annual earnings in the US at the time (Wyman, 1993, p. 24;

Lebergott, 1964, p. 523-24). Keeling (2010) estimates that, following this transportation

revolution, eastward journeys (from the US to Europe) rose from 18 percent of total transatlantic

travel in the 1870s to 30 percent by the 1900s.

          Compared to the 1920 migrant stock, return migrants were more likely to be male (80

percent versus 54 percent); less likely to be married (48 percent versus 61 percent); and more

likely to come from a “new” sending country in Southern or Eastern Europe (81 percent versus

44 percent) (Ward, 2016). Return migration rates varied substantially across sending countries,




6
    A portion of this discrepancy could be due to repeat or circular migration.
                                                                                                4
with 10 to 25 percent of Northern and Western Europeans journeying home, compared to 40 to

60 percent of Southern and Eastern Europeans (Wyman, 1993, p. 11; Gould, 1980). 7

       The share of migrants who returned to their country of origin in the past was, if anything,

higher than the rates of return migration today. Dustmann and Gorlach (2016) show that around

20 percent of migrants to the US return home in the current period. Sociologists emphasize the

“transnational” experience of contemporary migrants who “maintain various kinds of ties to their

homelands,” fueled by advances in communication and transportation technology (Levitt and

Jaworsky, 2007, p. 129). Yet, as Foner (1997, p. 355) argues, this “transnationalism is not new,”

characterizing the high rates of return and repeat migration in the early twentieth century as well.

       Some return migration was planned, while other returns were unanticipated. Between

1917 and 1924, 15 percent of immigrants reported an intention to return home upon arrival in the

US but 40 percent eventually did go home (Ward, 2016). In some cases, return migration was

part of a deliberate strategy to move to the US temporarily, accumulate savings, and then return

home to get married or purchase land. Alternatively, return migration could follow a spell of

unemployment, a spate of bad health, or another idiosyncratic personal event. As one

contemporary observer noted, return migrants tended to fall into two very different groups:

“those who go home because they have succeeded and those who go home because they have

failed” (Steiner, 1906; quoted in Wyman, 1993, p. 75). 8 A small number of migrants returned




7
  Jewish migrants were an outlier, with return rates as low as 5 percent, although Jewish return
migration was more common before the pogroms of 1903 and 1906 (Sarna, 1981).
8
  Consistent with this grouping, a questionnaire administered to return migrants to Finland found
that 40 percent of return migrants reported having good results in the US, 19 percent reported
suffering bad results, and the remainder fell somewhere in between (Wyman, 1993, p. 77).
                                                                                                   5
home to participate in national politics, particularly in the newly independent states that emerged

out of World War I (Wyman, 1993, p. 113-118). 9

       A substantial body of qualitative evidence supports the idea of return migration as a

means to accumulate savings. Case studies of Italians, Poles and other Central Europeans

document savings of $15 to $25 a month in the US, or between $500 and $900 upon return

(Wyman, 1993, p. 60, 130). Accumulating this sum would require a stay of three to five years in

the US, which is consistent with one Ukranian immigrant’s report that she planned to stay “just

two or three years. Everybody had the same idea – make a little money and go back home” (cited

in Wyman, 1993, p. 50).

       Upon return, the most common investment was buying a farm, expanding an existing

farm, or building a farm house. “He who crosses the ocean can buy a house” was a popular

expression in Italy reflecting the value of temporary migration to the US (Cinel, 1982, p. 71). An

immigration inspector in the US who interviewed repeat migrants from Italy confirmed this

view, testifying that “two-thirds told me they had bought a little place in Italy, a little house and a

plot of ground; that they had paid a certain sum; that there was a mortgage on it; that they were

returning to this country for the purpose of making enough money to pay that mortgage off”

(cited in Wyman, 1993 p. 131). A survey of 23 migrants returning to one parish in Sweden found

that 16 purchased some farmland with their savings (Wyman, 1993, p. 132).

       Although many successful migrants returned home in order to buy land or make other

investments, others left the US after facing a period of unemployment or a debilitating illness.

Wyman (1993, p. 79) notes that return migration rates were higher in years of economic

downturn following the Panics of 1893 and 1907. Moreover, a notable share of return migrants

9
 Johan Nygaardsvold, who served as the prime minister of Norway from 1935-1945, is one such
example, having migrated to Canada and the US for five years in 1902.
                                                                                                     6
had fallen ill in the US. 10 percent of Finnish returnees were sick or injured, and nearly 10 out of

1,000 Italians returning from the US had tuberculosis, a disease that the Irish took to calling “the

American sickness” (Wyman, 1993, p. 85).

       At the turn of the twentieth century, temporary migrants became a target of popular

animosity, which contributed to the sentiment in favor of closing the border. Migrants who

planned to return to their home country were faulted for focusing only on short-term financial

gain, rather than “making serious efforts to become citizens and real Americans” (Foner, 1997, p.

367; see also Shumsky, 1992). The Dillingham Commission, which was convened by Congress

in 1907 to study the effect of immigration on the US economy, adopted this view, complaining

that, for temporary migrants, “acquisition of the English language will be of little consequence…

The chief aim of a person with this intention is to put money in his purse” (Jenks and Lauck,

1911). In 1896, Rep. John Corliss (R-MI) proposed an amendment that “no one be admitted to

the United States who still maintained a home in a foreign country” (Wyman, 1993, p. 104).

Ultimately, the bill was defeated. 10



Data

       We develop a series of new data sets to compare Norwegian-born men who spent some

time in the US (“return migrants”) to Norwegian migrants still living in the US in 1910

(“permanent migrants”) and to Norwegians who stayed in Norway throughout this period (“non-

early twentieth century, and Abramitzky and Boustan (2016) review the economics of
immigration during this period more broadly.
                                                                                                  7
movers”). When possible, we link men to earlier Norwegian Censuses taken in 1865 or 1900 to

generate observations on pre-migration characteristics. 11

       To compare return migrants with non-movers, we start with men between the ages of 28

and 60 in the 1910 Norwegian Census; this age range allows men some time to have moved to

the US temporarily and returned. The 1910 Census asked all respondents whether they had spent

some time in the US and, if so, what was their date of arrival and departure, last state of

residence and last occupation held. This cross section, which contains nearly 300,000 men,

allows us to compare return migrants who had spent some time in the US with non-movers.

       To compare return migrants with permanent migrants, we instead combine information

on return migrants from the 1910 Norwegian Census with observations on Norwegian-born men

still living in the US in 1910 from the 1% US Census sample (Ruggles, et al., 2015). Some men

coded here as permanent migrants may have subsequently returned to Norway after 1910, which

we are unable to observe using the available historical data. 12 The majority of temporary spells in

the US are quite short, with more than half of return migrants spending five or fewer years in the

US. Thus, to improve the accuracy of our division between permanent and return migrants, we

focus on men observed in 1910 who arrived in the US before 1905, a sample of around 17,000

men.

       To gather information on pre-migration characteristics, we link both of our cross-

sectional samples to earlier Norwegian Censuses (1865 and 1900). In particular, we link men

between the ages of 28 and 45 in 1910 to the 1900 Norwegian Census (when they are between

the ages of 18 and 35), creating an “early adulthood sample”. We also link men between the ages

11
   We are unable to link women across Censuses because women often change their last name at
marriage.
12
   The completed Norwegian Census is only released 100 years after the Census was taken, so
the 1910 Census is the latest available to us.
                                                                                                  8
of 45 and 60 in 1910 to the 1865 Norwegian Census (when they are between the ages of 0 and

15), creating a “childhood sample.” These linked samples differ in two important ways. First, our

early adulthood samples allow us to measure own economic outcomes before migration, while

our childhood samples capture the characteristics of the household head (usually, father).

Second, men in the 1900-10 linked samples moved to the US, on average, in 1903, whereas men

in the 1865-1910 linked samples moved to the US in 1888. Links are conducted by first name,

last name, age and country of birth (Norway). Our match rates are relatively low (10.7 percent

for the 1865 to 1910 match and 23.4 percent for the 1900 to 1910 match), which is standard for

this literature (Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson, 2012, 2014, 2016; Ferrie and Long, 2007,

2013).

         Appendix Tables 1 and 2 compare men in the linked samples to the full population. As is

common in historical linked datasets, men with higher socio-economic status – measured here as

living in an urban area, having a father who owns land (1865) or having higher occupation-based

income (1900) – are more likely to be successfully linked across Census waves. These somewhat

higher match rates for men with better occupational status may be due to the fact that, in an era

without birth certificates, men with some basic education were more likely to remember their age

and report their name with consistent spelling. We are unfortunately unable to separately observe

selection into the linked sample by migration status. 13 It is encouraging that results do not change

when we re-weight the sample to match the socio-economic status of the population on observed




13
   We measure selection into the sample using initial characteristics (either in 1865 or 1900),
when the full universe of possible matches can be observed; the composition of the population
may change by 1910 due to mortality. However, migration status is only revealed by observing
residential location in 1910, thus making it impossible for us to separate the sample by migration
status in earlier years.
                                                                                                   9
characteristics, but we cannot know for sure that the conclusions are not specific to our linked

subset of the population.

       The main economic outcome available in our historical sources is occupation. Neither the

US nor the Norwegian census contains individual information on wages or income in 1910. To

calculate an occupation-based earnings measure, we assign the mean (PPP-adjusted) income

earned by members of their occupation based either on the US 1901 Cost of Living survey or on

tabulations published by Statistics Norway for 1900 (Preston and Haines 1991; Statistik

Centralbureau 1905). The online appendices for Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson (2012)

describe these sources in more detail and explain how we calculate earnings estimates for

farmers and fishermen, two occupations that are not included in the primary sources. In our

analysis of economic outcomes in the US, we supplement our standard earning measure with

information on the earnings of farmers and farm laborers by state from the US Census of

Agriculture. Marital status and geographic location are additional outcomes of interest.

       Our pre-migration characteristics are also based on occupation, either an individual’s own

pre-migration occupation or that of his household head. We divide own occupation observed in

1900 into deciles of occupation-based earnings. For household heads, we create six categories

given the highly-concentrated occupational distribution: urban residents and, among rural

residents, farmers with land, cottars with land (tenant farmers), farm laborers, fisherman, and an

“other” category that includes white collar and skilled blue collar workers. These pre-migration

characteristics are coarser than one might expect from the modern data. For example, Moraga

(2011) uses Mexico’s Quarterly National Labor Survey, a short panel, to observe the wages of

migrants before they move to the US, although, he cannot identify return migrants.




                                                                                               10
Estimating equations

       We begin our analysis by assessing the selection of return migrants from the migrant

pool. Our outcome of interest is occupation-based earnings in the US. In the cross-section, we

estimate:


                                                                                2
            ln (𝑂𝑐𝑐𝐸𝑎𝑟𝑛𝑈𝑆)𝑖 𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 ⋅ 𝐷𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 + 𝛾1 ⋅ 𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖1910 + 𝛾2 ⋅ �𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖1910 � + 𝜖𝑖 #(1)



where OccEarnUSit measures occupation-based earnings based on the last job held in the US for

person i observed in year t. 𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖1910 controls for trends in occupational attainment by birth

cohort. The coefficient of interest, β, indicates whether migrants who eventually returned to

Norway (Dreturn) held lower or higher paid occupations in the US, relative to migrants who stayed

in the US long term.

        A major concern in interpreting β is that occupation is observed in different calendar

years and, thus, at different ages for permanent and return migrants. All permanent migrants are

observed in the 1910 US Census, while return migrants report their occupation in the year of

their return to Norway (mean year = 1902). As a result, we observe the occupations of return

migrants in an earlier calendar year when the economy was less developed and earlier in the

migrants’ own career, both of which would tend to bias β downward. We address this

measurement issue by adding a progressive set of controls to equation 1, including: (1) age at

which occupation is measured; (2) year of arrival in the US (before 1890, 1891-1900, 1901-05);

(3) year in which occupation is measured (before/after 1900); and (4) age at arrival in the US. 14




14
  Age at arrival is collinear with year of arrival and age/year in which occupation is measured.
We address this multicollinearity by including two of these four variables as intervals rather than
exact years.
                                                                                                 11
       Return migrants may have had lower occupation-based earnings in the US because they

arrived with less valuable skills or because they faced poor conditions in the US that prevented

their ascension up the occupational ladder. To distinguish between these possibilities, we turn to

measures of pre-migration occupation (or, alternatively, fathers’ characteristics) in our linked

samples. For example, in our early adulthood sample, which is linked between 1900 and 1910,

we estimate:


         ln (𝑂𝑐𝑐𝐸𝑎𝑟𝑛𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑤𝑎𝑦)𝑖 1900 = 𝛼 + 𝛽′ ⋅ 𝐷𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 + 𝛾1 ⋅ 𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖 + 𝛾2 ⋅ (𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖 )2 + 𝜖𝑖 #(2)



where OccEarnNorwayi1900 measures occupation-based earnings in Norway in 1900, before any

move to the US takes place. β' indicates whether return migrants had higher or lower occupation-

based earnings in Norway, before moving to the US. Comparing β to β' reveals the extent to

which any disadvantage faced by return migrants was present before moving to the US.

       The second part of our analysis compares the occupation-based earnings of return

migrants to men who stayed in Norway. We estimate the following equation for men living in

Norway in 1910:


         ln (𝑂𝑐𝑐𝐸𝑎𝑟𝑛𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑤𝑎𝑦)𝑖 1910 = 𝛼 + 𝛿 ⋅ 𝐷𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 + 𝛾1 ⋅ 𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖 + 𝛾2 ⋅ (𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖 )2 + 𝜖𝑖 #(3)



The coefficient of interest, δ, estimates the earnings gap between return migrants who spent

some time in the US and non-movers. In some versions of equation 3, we estimate separate

earnings premia for return migrants according to time spent in the US (0-5 years, 6-10 years, 11-

20 years, and 21+ years).

       Time spent in the US may be valuable if migrants were able to accumulate savings to

make productive investments back home or if they acquired skills at a more rapid pace than their

                                                                                               12
counterparts who remained in Norway. Because migrants were negatively selected from the

population, and return migrants especially so, we would expect δ to be negative due to initial

selection. Finding a coefficient δ > 0 is thus suggestive that spending time in the US conferred

some positive return back in the home country. Within the set of return migrants, selection on

length of stay may be negative, with the most successful migrants able to accumulate savings

more quickly than their less successful counterparts. We caution that estimates on the return to

years spent in the US could be influenced by this form of selection, with the coefficients δ2 and

δ3 then being smaller than δ1.



Results

The selection of return migrants from the migrant pool

       One in three migrants chose to return to Europe from the US during the Age of Mass

Migration. A dynamic version of the Roy model, introduced by Borjas and Bratsberg (1996),

predicts positive selection of return migrants to unequal sending countries like Norway. Under

this logic, Norway-to-US immigrants would be negatively selected, and the ones who return

would be the ones who were just on the margin of moving to the US. Such marginal immigrants

would be positively selected from the immigrant pool, because they would have more to gain

from moving back to a higher-return-to-skill country. 15 Instead, we find that return migrants held

lower skilled occupations than permanent migrants.

       Table 1 compares the earnings of return migrants and permanent migrants in the US. The

first column shows that, in the raw data, return migrants earned 9 percent less than permanent



15
   As a result, the stock of immigrants, after the return migrants have left, would be more
negatively selected than the flow of immigrants. Hence, return migration would make the stock
of migrants more negatively selected, intensifying the initial selection pattern.
                                                                                                13
migrants by our occupation-based earnings measure. However, as mentioned, all permanent

migrants were observed in 1910, while the occupation of return migrants was measured in an

earlier year of return. Columns 2-5 progressively control for the age and year in which

occupation is measured, as well as arrival year and age at arrival in the US. After controlling for

these measurement differences, our estimate suggests that return migrants earned 4 percent less

than permanent migrants while in the US. In the last column, we replace our national income

estimates for farmers and farm laborers with state-specific estimates. Accounting for differential

geography increases the occupation-based earnings gap between return migrants and permanent

migrants to 9 percent, suggesting that permanent migrants were more likely to settle in states

with lucrative agricultural opportunities.

       The lower occupation-based earnings of return migrants while in the US may be an

indication that lower skilled migrants had a stronger incentive to return to Norway. Alternatively,

migrants who eventually decided to return to Norway may have started out in a similar position

to migrants who stayed in the US, but then faced a bad shock in the US, such as illness or

unemployment, that encouraged them to return home. In this case, we would not expect to find

differences in the pre-migration characteristics of permanent and return migrants.

       Differences in pre-migration characteristics suggest that men who started out with lower-

paid occupations were more likely to return to Norway. Table 2 examines a series of pre-

migration characteristics of men in the 1900-10 linked sample; men in this sample were observed

in early adulthood in Norway in 1900. Migrants who would eventually return to Norway were 23

percentage points more likely to live in a rural area before migration. Overall, these men earned

15 percent less than permanent migrants even before moving to the US. In part, return migrants




                                                                                                14
were at an occupation-based earnings disadvantage because they were more likely to live in rural

areas; however, return migrants also earned less within rural and within urban areas.

       A similar pattern emerges in Table 3, which compares the characteristics of fathers whose

sons would eventually move to the US permanently or on a temporary basis. Again, the fathers

of return migrants were 27 percentage points more likely to live in a rural area. Within rural

areas, the fathers of return migrants were more likely to be owner-occupier farmers, a relatively

highly paid profession (16 percentage points). Yet this gap was mostly offset by a lower

probability of being in the “other” category as a white collar or blue collar worker (9 percentage

points). Note also that, within this broad “other” category, the fathers of return migrants earned

17 percent less than the fathers of permanent migrants.

       We then assess the extent to which differences in pre-migration characteristics can

account for the earning gap between return and permanent migrants in the US. If an earnings gap

remains even after controlling for pre-migration differences, this residual may point to a role of

negative shocks as an impetus for return migration. Table 4 starts by re-estimating the earning

difference between return and permanent migrants in our linked samples. Column 3 then adds

pre-migration characteristics, including a dummy for living in a rural area, and indicators for

decile in the occupation-based earnings distribution (in 1900) or indicators for fathers’ status (in

1865). Controlling for own occupation in 1900 completely eliminates the earnings gap between

return and permanent migrants. However, despite the differences in fathers’ background by

migration status (Table 3), controlling for fathers’ occupation does not change the estimated

earnings gap. 16 In this era of rural-to-urban transition within Norway, fathers’ background does




16
   One difference between the own occupation and father controls is the degree of available
detail. We tried coarsening the own occupation controls, using the same set of categories
                                                                                                 15
not appear to be a good predictor of sons’ potential occupation. In this context, own occupation

offers a better measure of initial selection.

        Controlling for pre-migration occupation reveals that differences by migration status

were apparent even before moving to the US, and thus are not likely due to barriers or shocks

faced in the US. Rather, men with lower skills seem to have had the strongest economic

incentive to return to Norway. At the time, Norway was more unequal than the US and so a Roy

model would predict that the migrant just on the margin between staying the US and returning to

Norway would be relatively high skilled. Return migration of the low skilled is instead more

consistent with the idea of temporary migration to alleviate borrowing constraints at home.

Norway was not very financially developed at the beginning of the mass migration; in this

setting, the lower skilled were likely to face borrowing constraints. 17 By moving to the US,

migrants could expect a 70 percent increase in earnings, or an additional $10 a month for a farm

laborer who earned around $175 per year in 1900 dollars (Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson,

2012). According to the qualitative evidence described in section II, saving this excess return

would be sufficient to buy a plot of land within a three to five year stay in the US.



The value of time spent in the US

        Spending some time in the US offered migrants the opportunity to save up for productive

investments back in Norway. These savings may have allowed return migrants to ascend the


available for fathers’ background; yet, these coarse controls still eliminate the earnings gap in the
1900-10 matched sample.
17
   The Norwegian banking sector was small in 1860, with only 47 kroner of assets in commercial
and savings banks per capita (Nordvik, 1993). At the time, GDP per capita was around 250
kroner, implying a ratio of financial assets to GDP of 0.2 (Grytten, 2008). For comparison, the
mean ratio of assets of financial institutions to GDP was nearly 0.9 for industrialized countries in
1900 (Rousseau and Wachtel, 1998). Bank capital grew quickly in Norway over the next forty
years, expanding five times faster than GDP.
                                                                                                  16
occupational ladder and out-earn men who never moved to the US, even given the initial

negative selection of this migrant group. Table 5 begins by analyzing the full cross-section of

men between the ages of 28 and 60 who lived in Norway in 1910. Men who spent some time in

the US earned 4 percent more in our occupation-based earnings measure than did men who never

moved (column 1). Column 2 shows that the value of time spent in the US was higher for men

who worked in a non-agricultural occupation while abroad, likely in an urban area (5 percent),

relative to men who worked in farming (1 percent). In the late nineteenth century, the urban

wage premium was 30-40 percent in the US (Boustan, Bunten and Hearey, 2013); higher pay in

urban areas would have allowed return migrants to accumulate savings more quickly. Given that

many return migrants worked in agriculture upon return (as we describe below), this pattern is

not consistent with the idea of acquiring transferrable skills in the destination country, but more

so with acquiring savings to invest at home.

       The value of time spent in the US diminished over the nineteenth century. According to

column 3, migrants who moved to the US before 1890 earned 8 percent more than non-migrants

of the same age; the earnings premium fell to 5 percent for men who moved in the 1890s and to

zero for men who moved in the 1900s. This pattern could arise if migrant selection was less

negative at the beginning of the mass migration or, alternatively, if the relative ability to

accumulate savings in the US was highest when the wage gap between the two countries was

maximized, before Norway began to converge with the US.

       Among return migrants, the largest earnings premium was earned by men who spent less

than five years in the US, with additional time in the US diminishing the migrant earnings

advantage. Column 4 adds indicators for time spent in the US, with 1-5 years as the omitted

category. Men who moved before 1900 and stayed in the US for less than five years earned a



                                                                                                17
premium of 7-11 percent relative to non-migrants. Men who instead stayed for 6-10 years had a

2 percentage point reduction in their earnings premium; men who stayed for 11-20 years had a 4

percentage point reduction, and so on.

       That the peak migration premium occurred after just five years in the US stands in

contrast to contemporary data from Mexico, in which each year spent in the US confers an

economic return of 2.2 percent of monthly earnings (Reinhold and Thom, 2013). In the modern

period, migrants may be acquiring valuable work experience in more advanced destination

economies that is then transferrable to the home country. In our historical period, we suspect that

migrants were accumulating savings rather than skills, and that the more successful were able to

amass the necessary sums more quickly. Thus, what appears to be a falling return to additional

time spent in the US may be picking up negative selection on length of stay.

       Our estimates for the value of time spent in the US are likely biased downward by the

fact that migrants were negatively selected from the sending population, and return migrants

especially so. Table 6 partially corrects for this selection by controlling for pre-migration

occupation in the sample linked between 1900 and 1910. Note that all migrants in this sample

left for the US after 1900; according to Table 5, migrants in this arrival cohort on average earned

2 percent less than non-movers. Column 2 replicates this pattern for the linked sample,

documenting that the 2 percent earnings penalty is a weighted average of no occupation-based

earnings loss for return migrants with short stays in the US (1-3 years) and a 4 percent

occupation-based earnings penalty for return migrants with longer stays (4-9 years). Column 3

adds controls for pre-migration occupation in Norway in 1900. The earnings premium for return

migrants is shifted up by 3 percentage points for both migrant types. After controlling for pre-




                                                                                                18
migration characteristics, short-term return migrants appear to have earned 3 percent more than

non-movers, while return migrants with longer stays earned only slightly less than non-movers.

       Comparing estimates with and without pre-migration controls suggests that return

migrants were negatively selected relative to the population, biasing downward our initial

estimates of the value of time spent in the US. Indeed, if the observed shift in the coefficients in

the 1900-10 linked sample applied to the full population estimate, spending time in the US might

have increased earnings by 7 percent (rather than 4 percent). However, migrants with longer

stays in the US do not seem to have been differentially selected, at least not on the set of pre-

migration characteristics that we are able to observe. Rather, adding pre-migration controls shifts

up the estimated value of time spent in the US for short- and long-term stays to the same degree.

       Spending some time in the US helped return migrants climb the occupational ladder in

Norway. Yet, additional time in the US (beyond five years) did not confer any added value and,

if anything, diminished the earnings premium associated with being a return migrant. To further

understand this pattern, we turn to a descriptive analysis of the occupations and residential

locations of return migrants. Table 7 documents that return migrants were substantially more

likely than the rest of the population to live in a rural area (17-20 percentage points) and to work

as an owner-occupier farmer (14-25 percentage points), often in the migrant’s own municipality

of birth. These differences remain sizeable even after controlling for initial location (rural/urban)

and own or father’s occupation before migration. The occupational and geographic choices of

return migrants are consistent with the qualitative evidence, which suggests that temporary

moves to the US were used as a means of accumulating saving in order to buy land at home.

        Men who were working as farm laborers in early adulthood may have been particularly

likely to face borrowing constraints and keen to acquire land. Table 8 focuses on men in the



                                                                                                  19
1900-10 linked sample who were farm laborers in 1900, reporting the ten most common

occupations in Norway in 1910 by migration status. Men who spent some time in the US were 9

percentage points more likely to be owner-occupier farmers, with the difference primarily made

up by non-movers holding a broader array of occupations outside of the top ten. Half of men who

did not move to the US left their municipality of birth, often moving to an urban area within

Norway, in which the set of potential occupations was much wider. We also compare return

migrants to men who stayed in their birth municipality. In this case, return migrants were equally

likely to be an owner-occupier farmer (40 percent) but were 12 percentage points less likely to be

further down the agricultural ladder as a farm laborer or cottar (tenant farmer).

       Moving to the US was one way for lower skilled Norwegian men to get ahead, with a

temporary stay in the US allowing some farm laborers to save up and buy land at home.

However, overseas migration was not the only approach: other men who started out on the lower

rungs of the occupational ladder left their municipality of birth to move to urban areas within

Norway. These men were less likely to be owner occupier farmers circa age 35, but instead held

a broader array of urban occupations.

       Beyond acquiring land, another motivation for temporary migration was saving up money

to afford a marriage. In Norway, as in much of Northern and Western Europe, age at marriage

was determined in part by the ability to set up a separate household, which often required a

period of savings, often as a servant in another family’s household (Hajnal, 1965; Kussmaul,

1981; Guinnane, 1991). An alternative to saving at home would have been engaging in a

temporary move to the US. In this case, we expect return migrants to have lower marriage rates

before their move (in 1900) but higher marriage rates after return (in 1910). Table 9 finds

precisely this pattern: men who spent some time in the US were 3 percentage points less likely to



                                                                                               20
be married before moving but 3 percentage points more likely to be married after return. This

pattern is consistent with the idea of temporary migration as a means to save for marriage.



Conclusions

       We study return migration from US to Norway during the Age of Mass Migration. We

take advantage of a question in the 1910 Norwegian Census asking all residents whether they

had spent time in the US and when they returned. We construct large cross-sectional and panel

datasets that allow us to compare return migrants to permanent migrants still living in the US and

non-migrants who never left Norway.

     Return migrants were negatively selected relative to immigrants who stayed in the US. Not

only did Norwegian immigrants who returned to Norway hold lower-paid occupations while in

the US, but they also held lower-paid occupations even before their move. This finding suggests

that negative selection was unlikely due to barriers or bad shocks faced in the US. Rather, men

with lower skills seem to have had the strongest economic incentive to return to Norway.

       Upon returning to Norway, return migrants held higher-paid occupations than

Norwegians who never moved, despite hailing from poorer backgrounds. Despite being

negatively selected, return migrants were able to accumulate savings and improve their economic

circumstances once they returned home. These savings were used to acquire land in order to

work as an owner-occupier farmer and to afford the costs associated with setting up an

independent household before marriage.

       Moving to the New World was one strategy that poor European immigrants used to

achieve economic success. This paper suggests that temporary movement to the US in order to

accumulate savings and invest in the home country was another option available to poor

Notes: N = 17,157. Sample = Norwegian-born men between the ages of 28 and 60 in 1910 who
migrated to the US before 1905. Return = 1 if observed in Norwegian Census of 1910 and report
having spent some time in US. Return = 0 if observed in US Census of 1910 (1% IPUMS
sample). Column 2 controls for quadratic in age at time of occupation measurement. Column 3
adds indicators for three arrival cohorts (before 1890, 1891-1900, 1901-10). Column 4 adds
indicator for occupation observed before 1900. Column 5 adds indicator for arriving the US
before the age of 16. Column 6 replaces the national income estimate for farmers and farm
laborers with state-specific measures.

linked to the 1910 US or Norwegian Census. The analysis is further restricted to migrants who
arrived in US before 1905. Column 2 controls for a quadratic in age at which occupation is
measured and an indicator for whether occupation is measured before 1906 (row 1) or before
1900 (row 2). Because the 1865-1910 linked sample contains a large set of arrival cohorts, we
also control for three indicators for arrival cohort in row 2 (before 1890, 1891-1900, 1901-1910).
Column 3 includes measures of pre-migration characteristics, including deciles in the
occupation-based earnings distribution in 1900 (row 1) or indicators of father’s urban and
occupational status (row 2).
