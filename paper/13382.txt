Social Security provides spousal benefits in retirement to secondary workers in married couples based
on the primary worker's earnings record. In addition, Social Security pays spousal benefits to divorced
secondary workers whose marriages lasted at least ten years. However, if a marriage failed in less
than ten years, no spousal benefits are paid. The spousal benefit is particularly valuable to secondary
workers in couples where there is a large disparity in earnings between the primary worker and the
secondary worker. We examine whether these couples, who have more to gain from extending their
marriage to ten years, are more likely to delay divorce to the tenth year relative to a control group.
We find that vulnerable couples are slightly more likely to delay divorce from year nine to year ten;
however, the effect is statistically insignificant and small in magnitude. While the "cliff"-vesting of
retirement benefits for divorced spouses raises equity concerns, it does not appear to distort incentives
for divorce.

1.      Introduction

     The Social Security system contains many features designed to provide an adequate

retirement income for families, rather than just individual retired workers. The most

important of these features is the spousal benefit, under which secondary earners are

entitled to receive a monthly payment of 50 percent of their spouse’s monthly Social

Security benefit. Secondary earners may also elect to receive benefits based on their own

earnings records if they are higher than the spousal benefit; historically, however, the

spousal benefit provided a large source of benefits for non-working spouses in one-earner

couples. Of course, the existence of a spousal benefit raises the questions about what

happens in the event of divorce. Currently, an individual may not claim a spousal benefit

based on an ex-spouse’s earnings record if the marriage lasted less than 10 years. If the

marriage lasted 10 years or more, however, the divorced spouse is entitled to the full

spousal benefit in retirement.

     The spousal benefit and the general rules for divorce were designed during the early

years of the program, during which family structure differed considerably from today. At

the inception of the system, such a design made sense. As discussed by Smith (2002), in

1940, almost three quarters of families had a working husband and non-working wife;

less than 10 percent were two-earner couples. In contrast, in 1998, only 15 percent were

one-earner couples, and close to 50 percent were two-earner couples. Moreover,

women’s labor force participation has increased from around 34 percent in 1950 to




                                                                                            1
almost 60 percent in 2005.1 As a result, more married women receive benefits based on

their own records, making the spousal benefit (and divorce rules) irrelevant for a larger

fraction of the population. The Social Security Administration reports that in 1970, 16

percent of benefit recipients were receiving spousal benefits; by 2005, this number had

fallen to around 7 percent. This shift in family structure has led to a criticism of the

spousal benefit on equity grounds, as one-earner couples receive a higher rate of return

from Social Security compared to two-earner couples. The existence of the spousal

benefit also has efficiency considerations from a labor supply point-of-view: secondary

earners face large distortions in their labor supply decisions because their Social Security

contributions only increase their benefits to the extent that they are larger than the spousal

benefit (Feldstein and Samwick (1992), Goda (2007)).

    Divorce rates have also increased considerably over the last half a century. The

divorce rate has risen from about 2.6 divorces per year per 1,000 people in 1950, to 3.7

divorces per year per 1,000 people in 2004.2 In 1950, only about 2 percent of men and

women reported their marital status as divorced; by 2005, this number had risen to 11

percent for women and 9 percent for men. The increase in the divorce rate makes the

divorce rules more relevant for individuals who plan to claim the spousal benefit.3

    Social Security’s rules for divorce have also been criticized on equity grounds. A

marriage lasting only 9 years leaves a non-working spouse with no benefit entitlement;

on the other hand, staying together for 10 years results in a large increase in potential

benefits. Thus, a shorter marriage may leave a divorced spouse with inadequate income

in retirement. As reported by Smith (2002), in 1990, the median marriage length among

divorced couples was only 7.2 years, with 63 percent divorcing within 10 years.

Therefore, the 10-year requirement potentially affects a large number of individuals.

Favreault et al. (2006) provide a detailed analysis of the equity implications of the current

system; they also evaluate a variety of reforms including income splitting, under which a

couple’s total earnings credits are split equally at the time of divorce.

       In this paper, we focus on the efficiency implications of Social Security’s divorce

rules. One might expect these rules to affect the timing of divorce. For a couple married

9 years, there is a strong incentive to wait until the 10th year to divorce. Moreover, a

divorced person may be reluctant to remarry if it means giving up the spousal benefit

from the first marriage. Of course, these incentives only apply to couples in which the

secondary earner intends to claim spousal benefits, rather than benefits based on her own

earnings record. Dickert-Conlin and Meghea’s (2004) results – which are based on

divorce rates aggregated by age of the wife – suggest that Social Security’s rules do not

appear to affect the timing of divorce and remarriage.

       We revisit this question using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)

Marital History File. This dataset allows us to do an individual-level analysis, in which

we control for characteristics, including the likelihood of claiming the spouse benefit. To

do this, we identify “vulnerable” individuals, who are likely to claim spousal benefits

instead of benefits based on their own records. Vulnerable individuals are likely to be

affected by Social Security’s divorce rules. Couples with a vulnerable spouse have an

incentive to delay divorce from year 9 to year 10 in order to preserve the vulnerable

spouse’s Social Security benefit. There are no similar incentives for delay in the timing




                                                                                            3
of divorce among couples in which both individuals intend to claim their own Social

Security benefit.

       Our household-level analysis corroborates the findings of Dickert-Conlin and

Meghea. We find that vulnerable couples are slightly more likely than non-vulnerable

ones to delay divorce from year 9 to year 10. However, the difference is small and

statistically insignificant. We attribute this finding to several possible factors. For

example, the Social Security benefit computation is complex, and many individuals may

not be aware of the divorce rules. In addition, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that

individuals are myopic in planning for their retirements. Thus, it should not be surprising

if young couples do not consider the implications of delaying divorce for their future

Social Security benefits.

   This paper is organized as follows. Section II provides an overview of Social

Security’s rules regarding marriage and divorce, and a review of the previous literature.

Section III presents our methodology and results. Section IV concludes.



   2. Background and Previous Literature

   Social Security provides a spousal benefit equal to 50 percent of the primary earner’s

Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) to spouses of workers who have been married for at

least one year. The PIA is determined by applying a concave function to the Average

Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) which is the monthly average of the highest 35 years

of the worker’s wage-indexed earnings during their lifetime. The concavity in the

formula provides low lifetime income earners with a higher replacement rate than high

lifetime income earners. The secondary earner’s benefit is the maximum of the spousal




                                                                                              4
benefit and the benefits determined by his or her own earnings record. Because of the

progressivity of the formula that converts the AIME to a PIA, it is not the case that

workers need to earn, on average, 50 percent of what the primary worker earns every year

in order to generate a benefit larger than the spousal benefit. The exact fraction depends

on the relative earnings amounts within the couple, but in many instances is closer to one-

third. Figure 1 shows the necessary fraction of the primary worker’s earnings for

different values of the primary worker’s average indexed monthly earnings.

   According to the Social Security Administration, there were almost 31 million

workers receiving benefits based on their own earnings record in 2006. In addition to

this, around 2.5 million individuals received spousal benefits. Of those receiving spousal

benefits, more than 98 percent were female. However, women are increasingly likely to

receive benefits based on their own earnings record. In 1970, around 2.7 million women




                                                                                             5
received spousal benefits. By 2006, that had fallen to 2.4 million despite an increase in

the elderly female population.4

       When a couple divorces, the secondary earner is entitled to collect the full Social

Security spousal benefit if the marriage lasted 10 or more years. However, if the

secondary earner remarries, the spousal benefit from the first marriage is no longer

available. (It is, therefore, possible for several individuals to receive spousal benefits for

the same primary worker.) The 10-year requirement is relatively recent. Prior to 1977, a

marriage was required to last for 20 years before an ex-spouse could claim the spousal

benefit. Increasing divorce rates in the 1960s and 1970s prompted the change in the law,

as policy makers were concerned that women who were divorced after less than 20 years

of marriage would be left in poverty.

       Dickert-Conlin and Meghea (2006) carry out a differences-in-differences analysis that

focuses on the 1977 law change. They compare the divorce rates of 7-year marriages (the

control group) with those of 9- and 10-year marriages (the treatment groups) both before

and after 1977. One would expect the divorce rate in the 9-year marriage group to fall

relative to the control group after 1977, as postponing divorce by a year would result in

an entitlement to a spousal benefit. (In contrast, the 7-year marriage group would have to

postpone divorce by three years, which has a significantly higher cost.) Additionally, the

10-year marriage group should have displayed an increase in divorces relative to the

control group after 1977. The authors find some evidence of a decline in the divorce rate

for 9-year marriages; however, there appears to have been no impact on 10-year

marriages. Hence there is not much support for the claim that the change in Social

Security’s divorce rules affected the timing of divorce. A similar analysis suggests that

                                                                                                 6
remarriage behavior was not affected either. In this case, the treatment group is women

whose marriages lasted for 10 years. This group of women became eligible for spousal

benefits in 1977, provided they did not remarry. The control group is women whose

marriages lasted for 9 years, and were therefore not eligible for spousal benefits. One

would expect the latter group to have a higher remarriage rate than the former after the

1977 law change; however, the data did not support this claim.

   Of course, the predicted effect on behavior only apply to couples in which the

secondary earner intends to claim spousal benefits, rather than benefits based on her own

earnings record. The Dickert-Conlin and Meghea (2006) analysis makes no distinction

between these two groups. This provides a possible alternative explanation for their

findings. If many women are claiming benefits on their own record, then one might not

find an effect for women overall, as only a subset of women alter their behavior.

   While the existing literature provides little evidence of distorted behavior, the divorce

rules certainly raise significant equity concerns. The current method of 10-year “cliff”-

vesting means that secondary workers with marriages that lasted 9 years and 11 months

will not receive any spousal benefits from Social Security from that marriage, while those

in marriages lasting 10 years would receive spousal benefits based on their ex-spouse’s

entire earnings history at retirement. Favreault and Steuerle (2006) point out that, while

the overall poverty rate among the elderly is low, poverty is significant problem among

elderly women. The policy also creates large disparities in taxes paid relative to benefits

received. For example, a man who marries multiple times for 10 years or longer can

obtain (for his exes) several spousal benefits from one earnings history.




                                                                                             7
   As discussed by Thompson and Carasso (2002), many other countries use earnings

sharing to address such equity concerns. In Belgium and France, for example, divorced

spouses receive a benefit that is tied to the length of the marriage. Many other

industrialized countries split the couple’s total earnings credits at the time of divorce,

treating the divorced couple as two singles in computing benefits. The earnings-splitting

is either specified by law (e.g. in Canada, Germany, and Switzerland), or determined by

the divorce court (e.g., in Spain and the United Kingdom).

   Favreault and Steuerle (2006) investigate the implications of several reforms that aim

to improve the equity, efficiency, and adequacy of Social Security’s treatment of the

family. They examine three versions of earnings-splitting proposals, and incremental

changes such as providing a minimum level of benefits and providing caregiver credits.

The simulated winners and losers under each proposal differ, but divorced women fare

better under earnings-splitting reforms.

   Brien et al. (2001) study another aspect of the Social Security system: the treatment

of widows. When a widow reaches normal retirement age, she may claim a widow

benefit equal to 100 percent of her deceased husband’s PIA. Prior to 1979, a widow who

remarried lost her claim on the widow benefit, although she could claim a spousal benefit

based on the earnings of her new husband. The spousal benefit is, of course, less

generous than the widow benefit, as it amounts to only 50 percent of the primary earner’s

PIA. In 1979, the law was changed to allow widows aged 60 and above to claim the

widow benefit even if they remarried. However, widows under age 60 were still subject

to the old rules. The authors show that widows aged 60 and above had an increased

marriage rate in 1979, indicating that many individuals in this group had waited to




                                                                                             8
remarry until the law went into effect (it was passed in 1977). Moreover, they found that

after 1979, marriage rates declined among widows just under age 60, and increased

among widows over 60. This indicates that after 1979, widows just under age 60 started

waiting until age 60 to remarry in order to retain their widow benefit.

       Our analysis also fits into the broader literature on how fiscal policy affects

individuals’ choice of family structure. A number of studies have shown that marriage

penalties created by the income tax and welfare programs have an impact on the timing

of marriage and divorce. Alm et al. (1999) provide a review of this literature.



       3. Data and Methodology

       Our data come from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) 1985-2003 Marital

History File. This dataset contains a marital history for each PSID respondent. Since

respondents are asked to provide information about previous marriages, the histories also

include marriages that began and ended prior to 1985. For our analysis, each observation

consists of one marriage for an individual in the survey. If an individual has multiple

marriages, it is possible for that person to appear in multiple observations. However,

because of the data collection procedures, not all marriages for all individuals appear in

the data. We generally treat each marriage as a separate observation. Clearly, multiple

marriages for the same individual might not be independent observations. To see if this

affects the results, we also do all of our estimates using only the first marriage that

appears in the sample for all individuals. Our qualitative results do not change.5 After

dropping observations with missing values, we end up with a sample of 16,361



5
    These results are available from the authors upon request.


                                                                                             9
marriages. We merge this marital history data with the income data routinely collected

by the PSID.

   According to our discussion in the previous section, an individual whose AIME is

less than a third of his or her spouse’s is better off claiming the spouse benefit. We

define an individual as defined “vulnerable” if his or her average is less than a third of the

primary worker’s income. Vulnerable individuals are most likely to rely on the spousal

benefit, rather than benefits based on their own records. Couples with a vulnerable

spouse are most likely to alter their behavior in response to Social Security’s divorce

rules. Of course, the calculation of the spousal benefit is based on the individuals’

AIMEs, which take into account their wages over their entire working life. During the

earlier years of a marriage, individuals cannot know with certainty their ultimate AIME.

At this point, a couple’s expected AIMEs will influence the divorce decision. Of course,

estimating an individual’s expected average income is tricky. For our base case, we

average income in all years prior to and during the marriage for which data are available.

This computation contains two implicit assumptions. First, the couple perfectly

anticipates their future income path during the marriage. Second, for marriages that end

in divorce, the individuals’ average incomes up until the divorce decision are a good

estimate of what their average incomes would have been had the marriage continued.

Note that we do not include years after the marriage ended. An individual may intend to

claim the spousal benefit while married, yet seek out a higher paying job if the marriage

ends. Such an individual should correctly be classified as vulnerable, as it is their

anticipated status during the marriage that is relevant for the divorce decision.




                                                                                           10
    By this definition, there are 6,883 marriages in which one spouse is vulnerable. In

91.1 percent of these marriages, the vulnerable spouse is the wife. Clearly our definition

of vulnerable individuals does not perfectly capture those who intend to receive spousal

benefits. However, there should be a correlation between vulnerability as defined here

and the dependence on spousal benefits.

    Vulnerable marriages are our treatment group for the analysis. The control group

consists of all the other marriages. We predict that the treatment group should be more

responsive to Social Security’s divorce rules than the control group. Consider the set of

all couples entering their 9th year of marriage who are contemplating divorce. Those in

the treatment group have larger costs associated with divorce before 10 years. Therefore,

we would expect a decline in the divorce rate of the treatment group, relative to the

control group, at 9 years of marriage. We would also expect an increase in the relative

divorce rate of the treatment group at 10 years of marriage.

    Figure 2 depicts the conditional and unconditional probabilities of divorce by length

of marriage for the entire sample. The probability of divorce is simply the fraction of

marriages ending after t years. The conditional probability of divorce is the fraction of

couples divorcing after t years of marriage, conditional on being married at time t-1.

(The graph does not include the 316 marriages that either failed or left the sample before

the first year.) Only about 1 percent of marriages fail after one year. The divorce rate

increases until the 4th year of marriage, then levels off and falls.

   Figure 3 shows the conditional divorce probability for the vulnerable group and the

       We perform a formal regression analysis to determine whether there is any

statistically significant impact of Social Security’s divorce rules. We begin with the set

of all marriages lasting 8 or more years. There are three possible outcomes for these 8-

year marriages:

       1. Divorce in year 9,
       2. Divorce in year 10, or
       3. No divorce in either year 9 or year 10.

We estimate the following multinomial logit model:

                                                   exp(β j X i + α j Ti )
                                         pij =
                                                 ∑ exp(β        X i + α j Ti )
                                                 3

                                                            j
                                                 j =1




Here, pij is the probability that marriage i ends in outcome j , for the j = 1,2,3 specified

above. Ti is a dummy variable equal to 1 if marriage i is in the treatment group (has an

always-vulnerable spouse). X i is a vector of controls for the couple, including dummies

for the race of the household head, 6 whether each spouse was over the age of 22 at the

beginning of the marriage, and whether each spouse had finished high school and college

prior to the end of the marriage. The PSID’s racial classifications have expanded greatly

over time. In the initial years of the survey, the only categories coded were white,

African-American, and other race. Therefore, we consolidate the racial categories in

subsequent waves of the survey and include only indicators for African-American and

other race. The entire sample of 8-year marriages consists of 8,474 observations, of

which 3,877 have a vulnerable spouse. Including the independent variables reduces the

sample size to 8,076, as we are forced to drop observations with missing values.

   Table 1 presents the means and standard deviations for the independent variables

broken down by vulnerability status. The control groups have similar marriage lengths.

Both husbands and wives in the treatment group tend to get married at a younger age: 71

percent of men in the treatment group were over the age of 22 at marriage, compared to

78 percent in the control group. For the wives, 55 percent of the treatment group was

over 22 at the time of marriage, compared to 64 percent of the control group.

Wives in the control group are more likely to have finished college (but not high school).

Husbands in the control group are more likely to have finished high school (but not

college). Finally, the control group contains a greater percentage of African American

household heads.

    Relative risk ratios for outcome 2 (divorce in year 10) relative to outcome 1 (divorce

in year 9) are presented in Table 2.7 The first column of Table 2 uses a vulnerability

definition that incorporates income throughout the length of the marriage. The

coefficient of interest is the relative risk ratio for the treatment dummy, which indicates

the treatment group’s risk of getting divorced in year 10 relative to 9 ( pi 2 / pi1 ), divided

by the same ratio for the control group. Our prediction is that this value should be greater

than 1 – that is, relative to the control group, the treatment group’s probability of divorce

falls in year 9 and increases in year 10. The point estimate of the relative risk ratio is

1.12, suggesting that the treatment group is slightly more likely than the control group to

delay divorce from year 9 to year 10. However, this coefficient is statistically

insignificant. In general, the other independent variables don’t appear to be statistically

significant either.

    As discussed above, our definition of vulnerability assumes that couples perfectly

anticipate their future income path if the marriage continues. As a robustness check, we

redo our regression analysis under the alternative that couples do not anticipate any future

changes in their income. That is, we classify people as vulnerable if their average income

until the 8th year of marriage is less than a third of their spouse’s. The implicit

assumption here is that individuals expect their future average income to be similar to

their average income in the 8th year of marriage. The sample size for this case is only

7,517, as we must drop marriages in which both spouse’s average earnings are zero,

which are more likely to occur when we only compute average earnings until the 8th year

of marriage. Regression results for this case are given in the second column of Table 2.

They are qualitatively similar to the base case. The treatment group’s relative probability

of divorce does fall in year 9 and rise in year 10. However, this difference is statistically

insignificant.

   The only independent variable that is statistically significant in both regressions is the

dummy variable for the wife’s age at the time of marriage. The relative risk ratio is less

than 1, indicating that a woman who is younger when she marries is relatively more

likely to delay divorce until year 10. This is roughly consistent with the hypothesis that

vulnerable couples delay divorce: a woman who married at a young age is more likely to

be vulnerable (in a way that is not captured by our vulnerability measure) and therefore

more likely to anticipate receiving the spouse benefit. However, given the insignificance

of our direct measure of vulnerability, we hesitate to interpret this isolated finding as

evidence that Social Security’s divorce rules affect behavior.

   4. Conclusion

   Social Security’s current rules regarding divorce allow secondary workers in

marriages that lasted at least ten years to receive spousal benefits based on the primary

worker’s earnings history. However, secondary workers whose marriages lasted less than

ten years do not receive this benefit. As a large number of marriages that fail do so

before ten years, the rules create equity concerns. This “cliff”-vesting means that

secondary workers in marriages that fail before ten years undergo a significant loss in

terms of future retirement benefits, especially if their earnings were significantly lower

than their spouses. In our sample of marriages that lasted at least eight years and using a

definition of vulnerable that requires the secondary earner’s average earnings to be at



                                                                                             17
least one third of his or her spouse’s average earnings, 46 percent of couples have a

vulnerable spouse. This represents a significant percentage of all marriages.

    We attempt to detect a behavioral response by spouses that are more vulnerable to a

divorce before the tenth year of marriage relative to a control group. The control group

consists of couples where the secondary earner would likely earn more than the spousal

benefit. Because the secondary worker receives the maximum of the benefit calculated

from his or her own earnings record and the spousal benefit, the spousal benefit is

thought to be of little value to the secondary workers in the control group. While the

presence of the spousal benefit still provides secondary workers in this category some

insurance, it is relatively far less important to secondary workers in the control group

relative to the vulnerable couples.

    Our regression results show little evidence for a behavioral response among

vulnerable couples relative to the control group. While the relative risk ratios in the

multinomial regression indicate that vulnerable couples are slightly more likely to delay

divorce in their ninth year of marriage to the tenth year, the effect is not statistically

significant and is small in magnitude. Therefore, we conclude that the divorce rules in

Social Security do not have strong efficiency implications with regards to divorce

incentives even for couples where the secondary spouse is more vulnerable to the

potential loss in retirement benefits. There are several possible explanations for why

individuals may not respond to the incentives to delay divorce until the tenth year of

marriage: individuals may not be fully aware of the divorce rules in Social Security; they

may be myopic regarding the extra retirement benefits they are losing from earlier

divorce; they may value the earlier dissolution of their marriage more highly than the




                                                                                             18
added retirement benefits far into the future; they may have better information about their

future earnings potential than is available in our data; or they may expect to remarry and

receive spousal benefits from their future spouse’s earnings record. Further research

could shed some light on which of these explanations accounts for the insignificant

behavioral response to divorce rules in Social Security.
