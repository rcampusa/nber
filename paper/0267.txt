                                  Abstract



        This paper estimates statistical cost. and revenue curves for a
cross—section    of banks in the years 1962—75.    The primary data cover

reported accounting or book rates of return. Approximations are also

made to estimate economic or total returns. These approximations take

into account changes in capital values during the year as a result of

movements in interest rates measured by market yields of government

securities of the proper duration.

        Book rates of return and costs adjust towards each other so that

marginal rates received or paid for different activities tend to equalize.

On the other hand, the rates of adjustment are slow. While movements in

the cost of demand and time deposits correlate well with changes in market

rates, not all of the advantages of interest rate ceilings are given up

to depositors.

       Movements in interest rates cause sharp fluctuations in total

returns. These movements are sharp enough so that in several years

economic losses occurred rather than reported book profits. Furthermore,

over this period the net economic returns of classes of assets were

poorly correlated with their risks (their variance of returns).

                Sherman J. Malsel and Robert Jacobson*



        As part of an overall investigation of risk and capital adequacy

in banks, we have examined the magnitudes by which Interest rate movements

may alter reported rates of costs and returns for a typical commercial

bank. At the same time, we have attempted to measure the manner in

which banks adjust their loans and costs over time in reaction to shifting

markets and rates.

        A critical analytical question in the study of financial markets

is the degree and rapidity with which financial institutions react to

new Information and shift funds among asset and liability classes so as

to equalize marginal costs and returns. Many analysts assume that

markets are efficient, that transaction and information costs are

negligible or unimportant, and that borrowing and lending, hedging and

arbitrage are simple and available at Or close to risk—free rates. As

a result, they believe that they can successfully predict the results

of all types of market actions and reactions without concern for

institutional forces.

        On the other hand, large numbers of observers believe that the

markets within which financial institutions operate are so far removed

from these assumptions that different theories and analysis must be

applied. This is particularly true with respect to competition, legal

and institutional restrictions, and information and transaction costs.

        Our results fall between the extreme views. Rates of returns

and costs adjust towards each other as they should in a competitive

market. On the other hand, the rates of adjustment are slow, particularly

if we estimate total (in contrast to book) returns. Average book

returns for classes of assets over the past 14 years are not too far

apart, but this is not true for total returns. Furthermore, no indica-

tion exists that over this period the net returns of classes of assets

were related to their risk (their variance àf returns).

        Since corrections for operating costs as well as defaults and

losses are included, it does appear that institutions adjust rather

readily to costs which they record on their books. The major exception

to such adjustment is found in the low indicated return on non—home

mortgages, particularly from 1973 to 1975. This would seem to be an

obvious result of the general euphoria and speculation which characterized

this sphere in the early 1970's.

       While   major   problems arise in measuring year to year fluctuations

in actual returns caused by shifting interest rates, such movements have

been significant. In critical years such as 1969, 1973, and 1974, for

example, the rate of return on earning assets for an average bank fell

100 to 500 basis points below that reported based on book values. Since

net book returns (before taxes) as a percent of loans and investments for
                                    3



an average bank were about 1.20 percent of assets in this period, in

these years the typical bank probably ran a true deficit and up to 3.0

percent of assets. Such losses must be evaluated in light of a capital

asset ratio of 9 percent which the average bank held during this period.

        Since such losses tended to decrease or even reverse in the next

year for a typical bank, they were not too critical. However, the same

is not true for banks which varied far from the average in either their

portfolio or in capital. The variation in net returns or losses among

classes of assets ina year can be large. In the past, many institutions

were in jeopardy from interest rate movements. In the future, for those

with unbalanced portfolios or low capital, potential dangers would

appear to be sizable.

                        The Basis of the Estimates

        Our study is based upon estimated statistical cost and revenue

curves for a cross—section of banks in the years 1962—75 (with the

exception of 1969). These estimates are of net rates of income and

costs based upon book values of assets. The rates are net of servicing,

processing, overhead costs, etc. The rates are estimated in each year

from the fact that each individual bank holds a somewhat different mix

of assets and liabilities. When the differing assets and liabilities

are regressed on actual costs and revenues, the regression coefficients

estimate the effect on rates of return of placing a dollar in a particular

class of assets or liabilities under the economic circumstances of the

given year. Net rates are obtained by subtracting the costs for an
                                        4



asset from its estimated gross revenues. The estimated cost and revenue

curves are shown In Table 1.

         These statistical cost and revenue curves for a cross—section

of banks follow a technique used and explained in detail In studies by

Hester and Zoellner (1966) and Hester and Pierce (1975). This study

differs from theirs by using a national sample over a large number of

years and in the methods of estimation.

        The basic model used in estimation consists of two equations:


        R         b         A                          e
        AA 1A
          i       1             1

                                               Ak
                                                       A
                                                           1



(2)           =
                       c1
                                    +   + Ck   A    + Ck+l     +...   +
                                                                          C      +


        The first equation shows the gross revenues (R1) from earning

assets in a given year from a particular bank (i) related to the book

value for each class (k) of assets (Ad) for that bank in that year.

The second equation relates the operating expenses (C1), including

actual net loan losses less income from deposit service charges, to the

bookvalue for categories of assets (A.) and liabilities (L1). The coeffi-

cients of the equations are estimates of the gross revenues and costs for each

type of asset and liability. The difference between costs and revenues

for an asset is its net return.

        In each case, the variables on both sides have been divided

through by the level of assets In the year to correct for the hetero—

skedastic nature of banks with their widely varying sizes. This correction

means that with the exception of the first right—hand variable, which is

1/A1, all other variables are expressed as a percentage of total assets.

A Goldfeldt—Quandt test (1965) for heteroskedasticity was employed and

the assumption of homoskedasticity could not be rejected.

        While OLSQ run separately on equations (1) and (2) would give

unbiased estimates of the coefficients and standard errors, they would

not be efficient. It is known that the error terms across equations

for corresponding observations are likely to be correlated. Variables

that Influence bank behavior, but which are not included as Independent

variables and so show up in the error terms, are likely to be partly

the same for both equations. This knowledge can be used and efficiency

increased by taking account of the correlation across equations. This

has been done by using Zeilner's Seemingly Unrelated Equation Estimation

(1962). The differences from OLSQ are rarely large, but they are

significant.




                               The Data

        The data used in this study come from the Federal Deposit

Insurance Corporation's (FDIC) stratified sample of Reports of Condition

and Income. This sample covers 978 identical banks for the period

1961—68 and a somewhat different group of 980 banks for 1969—75. It

includes the end—of—the—year and mid—year call reports. There was a

change in reporting between the 1968 and 1969 reports which has some

Influence on the choice of variables and causes the omission of much

data from the analysis for 1969.
                                  7




        In 1975 the sample contains 1C6 banks with over $500,000,000 in

assets; 195 banks between $200,000,000 and $500,000,000; 196 between

$50,000,000 and $200,000,000; 252 between $10,000,000 and $50,000,000;

and 151 banks under $10,000,000 in aasets. The sample is approximating

random within categories with some adjustments to insure continuity.

Such a sample, it is well known, gives unbiased estimates.

        The income data cover the entire year as reported in the annual

Reports of Condition (calls), the asset data are weighted averages of

the final and mid—year reports for the designated year and the final

report for the previous year with weights of    4, and   ,   respectively.
Cash, bank balances, and items in process have been subtracted from

reported demand deposits as an estimate of net demand deposits.

        The data were run for the entire sample and for five sub—classes

by size. Chow tests indicated that one could not reject the hypothesis

that there were no significant differences in net revenues and costs

among the different size groups. The results for the smallest size

group is more erratic than for the others and also on the whole shows

higher revenues and costs, but they still fall within the normal

distribution for the entire sample.

       Various problems are known to exist with the data which cause

less than ideal results. Most important Is the fact that the data

report book income, costs, and asset values. These differ from economic

variables because rates of return and the amount of assets are not

corrected for changes in market values. Furthermore, economic periods

of adjustment are unlikely to equal a year. Table 5 and the discussion

of it show how rough corrections can be made to get actual economic

returns and the considerable difference in analysis which results.
                                    8




                                                                            1)
        Because of window dressing, reported assets on call dates are

known to be biased estimates of daily averages. The biases are small

for most assets and liabilities, but they are significant for items such

as federal funds. Miscellaneous assets or liabilities have been grouped

together to decrease this problem, but biases almost certainly remain

for these items. Total estimated rates of return and costs are perhaps

2 percent (about 5 to 10 basis points) less as a result of this problem.

        Some sources of income and expense cannot be directly related

to items on the balance sheet. This is true, for example, of income

from fiduciary activities. To correct partially for such income and

related costs, we have used as gross revenue the sum of all income

reported for each type of earning asset. We have subtracted this amount

from reported income to estimate that from other sources and have then

subtracted this sum   from both revenues and expenses. In effect, this
assumes that banks break even on their miscellaneous activities and

that costs and revenues for their loan and investment activities can be

estimated with only minor biases from this correction. Since this gross

correction is less than 7 percent of the total, any bias arising from a

net difference between costs and revenues for these miscellaneous items

is likely to be small.

       A related problem arises in attempting to allocate investment

expenses among classes of securities. From other sources we find that

expenses for portfolio investments are less than one—tenth of one percent

of the total. The difficulties of estimating the distribution of this

small sum are great enough so that we exclude the costs of managing the
                                  9



securities' portfolio from our estimations, even though this means that

net revenues from securities are over—estimated by 3 to 10 basis points.

This may approximately offset the opposite bias from use of call dates,

but there will be small variations from year to year.

        The most important difference between the data for 1962—68 and

1970—75 is in the treatment of sales and purchases of federal funds.

In the earlier period, such sales are included in commercial and other

loans while in the later period they are included in federal funds and
other securities owned. This is done to follow bank reporting which

included sales of federal funds as part of loans to financial institutions

in the earlier period, but reported them separately in the later period.

Purchases of federal funds in the earlier period were included in other

liabilities. This causes a major difference in estimates of purchased

money for the earlier period and for this reason the results are not

shown. Other minor definitional changes also occurred in 1969, but

their impact Is believed to be slight.




                                Results

        Tables 1, 2, and 3 report the results of the statistical analysis

of book returns. Table 1 shows the net and gross revenues for seven

classes of assets, three classes of liabilities, and the market rates

on three-month Treasury bills, by year. Table 2 shows the means and

standard deviations for each asset, both for the entire period and for

the two sub—periods. There was a major shift in the level of rates

between the two periods. Thus, even though they cover a shorter period,

      data for 1970—75 appear of greater interest and more relevant at the

present.

           Table 3 shows the correlations between the returns on U.S.

securities and the various other rates both for the entire period and

for the two sub—periods.

           Several facts stand out from the tables. (It should be recalled

that all results in these tables are for book income.)

         1. While net returns to a class of assets differ considerably

from year to year, they are fairly close together when a number of

years are averaged together.

         2. These convergences in net returns occur despite wide

divergences in gross returns. The higher gross payments reflect higher

costs. This is particularly true for consumer loans and non—home

mortgages.

         3. Some classes of assets with high risks (for example, non—home

mortgages) have among the lowest returns. Decisions are based on

expectations which can turn out to be very wrong.

           4. Except for federal funds and other securities, there is no

obvious relationship between book rates of return and the standard

deviation or variance of these returns.

           5. The correlation among the assets and liabilities and even

their year to year changes tend to be high. There are two major excep-

tions. Again, non—home mortgages stand out. It has an inverse correla-

tion in recent years. But recently movements of returns on consumer

loans also have not moved with the others.
                                      13



         6. In the recent period, the year to year movements of rates on

 three—month Treasury bills have been far more volatile and have not been

veil correlated with movements of other rates. Part of this difference

occurs because the other returns are reported on a book rather than

market basis. These book data tend to even out some of the year—to—year

fluctuations in actual returns. This averaging process does not affect

the return on the short—term Treasury bills.

         7. In recent years, the rate of return on Treasury bills has

been higher than on any class of assets except for the closely related

returns on federal funds. These first three tables show this comparison

on a book basis, but as we shall see, this fact is even clearer when

corrections are made for changes in market prices.

        8. While movements in the costs of demand and time deposits

correlate well with changes in market rates, the effect of regulation Q

in holding these costs down is evident. Not all of the advantages of Q

to banks are given up to depositors or borrowers.

        The average rate of return for the entire period for holdings

of U.S. government securities, for all loans, and for Treasury bills

are surprisingly close. While significant differences occur on a year—

to--year basis, they average out.

        The sharpest year—to—year movements occur in the cost and

revenues for federal funds and other securities, and in the cost of borrowed

money which in the later period is dominated by purchases of federal

funds (certificates of deposit are included in time and saving deposits).

These returns move with changes in short—term
                                                 treasuries. Superficially
It would appear that in recent years lending federal funds is the most

profitable activity for a bank. This may well be true, but unfortunately
                                  14




these numbers have considerable bias since the asset numbers are heavily

influenced by window—dressing on call dates.

        Among the other assets, the main divergence is for the returns

on non—residential mortages.   This class of loans shows low returns,

particularly in the last two years of the period. As noted, this

reflects the fact that investment decisions are based on expectations

which can be heavily influenced by market sentiments and which can turn

out to be very wrong. Banks as a group were carried away by the real

estate investment boom. Such errors with a lag led to the low returns

of 1974—75 as losses, caused by the prior over—enthusiastic lending, had

to be charged off.

        The lower reported return for state and local securities is

expected, thc only unusual feature being the high returns in 1975. Such

very high returns are shown in the reports of individual banks. They

appear to be related to the special trades and restructuring of New York

City's debt which occurred in that year.

        Costs of money move with interest rates. This is particularly

true for purchased money, but market rates also influence the costs of

time and saving deposits. Regulation Q was completely removed for

large certificates of deposit in 1973 and did not apply to most large

certificates after mid—1970. Of course, during the earlier period, the

ceilings were at times above market rates.

        On the other hand, regulation Q apparently does hold the costs

for demand deposits through services granted well below amounts paid for

other funds. It is not true that costs adjust so that demand deposits

have the same marginal costs as other funds. Whether because the ceiling.   )
                                  15



acts as a form of price leadership or because of other oligopolistic

features, banks do not compete away
                                      completely the advantages they gain
from interest rate ceilings.

        An examination of asset returns also makes it appear that the

advantages gained through Q are not given up in the form of lower returns

on loans to particular classes of borrowers.    There is no evident differ-
ence between the net rates earned on separate classes of loans. Net

income earned from customers who would be expected to hold large

balances do not differ greatly from rates charged those who walk in to

borrow over the counter. Banks as a whole appear to be competitive in

their loan terms even if not in payments on demand deposits.

        On the other hand, a relationship exists between the general

level of rates on i.oans and the fact that banks need to attract dcposlts.

Loan rates as measured in these tables do not appear to compensate

fully for their additional risk of possible losses In comparison to the

rate of return on Treasury securities. If they could have obtained the

same amounts of funds without having to be in the loan business, banks

would have earned more money with less risk by Investing primarily in

government securities. As noted shortly, however, these differences in

returns may also reflect the fact that during the entire period lenders

and investors were poor forecasters. The anticipated rates of return may

have been in accordancewith expected risks nd returns. Because of large

unanticipated movements, the ex post relationshIps probably do not

reflect those held by lenders at the time   decisions   to lend were made.

       Over this period, despite the fact that loans earned less

particularly n comparison with risks, banks continually increased the
                                 16




percent of their loans and decreased the share of government securities

in their assets. U.S. government and agency securities fell from over

25 percent of the total in 1961 to about 13.5 percent by 1975. Loans

rose from 45 to 52.5 percent of the total. Whether this shift occurred

because there Is a significant interrelationship between types of assets

and liabilities, or simply because rates of return differed from expecta-

tions, is not clear. Most bankers assume that if they made fewer loans

they would attract fewer depositors.




                             Total Returns

        The returns discussed thus far are accounting or book returns

as reflected in reported balance sheets and income statements. For

many purposes, however, we would like to know what happened from year

to year in actual or total or market—corrected returns. The return on

an asset may be positive or negative. It equals the sum of an interest

component, plus any change in the present value of future cash flows

due either to a shift in market interest rates or in the observed

probability of default.

        For an asset traded In an active market such as a listed common

stock or bond, the measurement of actual return is simple. To the

dividend or coupon payments received during the year, we add or subtract

changes in the market price to get the total return to the asset. If

we were able to get the change In market values during the year for

each of a bank's assets ot class of assets we would be able to estimate

total returns in this same manner. Unfortunately, we cannot. Therefore,
                                     17



 in order to obtain some Idea of how risks and returns have varied, we

 must construct rough approximations of such numbers.

         What   we have done is to assume that the market value of each
 class of   assets changes in accordance with the average tduratIonfl of

 the class multiplied by the change in market yields of government

 securities of the same approximate duration. These estimates follow

 from the known general relationship that the change in price of a bond

or loan is equal to the change in expected market interest rates for

similar bonds times the negative of its duration, or:

 ,   .   d Price      d(l+r)
            Price      (l+r)    —Duration,


where r is the rate of interest or yield to maturity (Boquist etal.,

1975). A bond or loan's duration is simply the time until its payments

will on average have been received. Thus duration is the average of

the present value of each future interest or principal payment times the

length of the period until it will be received.

         There are well recognized difficulties with this formulation.

No allowances are made for variations in uncertainty or the risk related

to the specific asset class. No adjustments are made for changes in the

term structure of interest rates. We have not taken into account the

fact that some changes in value may have been taken into the books

during the year through the sale or purchase of assets. We have not

accounted for changes other than interest rates.

         While recognizing that all of these factors can affect the value

of an asset, we have been forced to work primarily with those changes

which result from movements in the basic interest rate. However, it
                                      18



    should be noted that changes in defaults and related costs are already

    reflected in the estimated book returns for the year. Moreover, a

    number of simulations of the total impact of changes in market values

    ,indicates that movements in the interest rate on governments usually

    account for most value changes.

            As important as these other factors is the lack of exact

    estimates of the duration of the typical bank's assets. Duration has

    been estimated in a rough manner from the balance sheets of several

    banks. The most that can be claimed is that these estimates probably

     are in the proper rank order and that the magnitudes are in the right

•

     ball park. To avoid any sense of undue accuracy, we have rounded the

     estimated durations to full years. By happenstance, this results in

     the duration for assets of different types being roughly spaced from

     one to six years. The assigned duration in years are as follows:

     Consumer Loans (1); CommercIal and Industrial (2); U.S. Government and

     Agencies (3); Non—home Mortgages (4); Home Mortgages (5); and State

     and Local Bonds (6). It is also assumed that rates of return and costs

     of Federal Funds, other securities, and purchased money equal the market

     rates on Federal Funds and that the duration for these categories is

     insignificant.

             Changes In interest rates are measured from the end of the year

     prior to that for which the rates of return have been estimated to the

     end of the year covered hy.the income data. In each case, the rate

     for the particular yield to maturity is taken from yield curves estimated

     for the last business day of the year by McCulloch's cubic—spline

     term structure curve—fitting program for U.S. treasuries (McCulloch, 1975).   )
                                   19




        Table 4 shows the estimated changes in capital values for each

class of asset. This is in accordance with Equation (3). The percent

change in the yield to maturity at the assumed duration for the class

of assets is multiplied by the duration of that class.

        Table 5 is the result of combining the estimated book rates of

return in Table 1 with the year—to—year changes in capital values of

Table 4. Thus It Is an estimate of the total return to a class of assets

by year. As noted, these may differ from actual changes in values,

since the durations may not be accurate, since the specific risks of

the different classes may have altered, and since changes in the assets

held during the year may have meant that some of the reported book returns

reflected changes in the assets.

        In contrast to the tendency of book rates of return for classes

of assets to adjust towards each other under competitive pressures,

there is a much greater dispersion among the actual returns on assets.

Movements iii current yields are not sufficient to offset the losses or

gains which result from the effect of Interest rate movements on assets

with longer durations.

       More significantly it appears that over the entire period the

assets with the largest risks and variances have had the smallest rather

than the highest returns. This was a period dominated by unexpected

increases in both long— and short—term interest rates. With only a few

exceptions, rates at every maturity rose each year from 1963 through 1969.

From that year through 1975, increases were less universal and were

decidedly smaller, but yields on all maturities of three years and over

were higher in December 1975 than in December 1969.

 *There are no data for book returns in 1969. The estimates are the average of 1968 and 1970 book returns plus the

       For   the entire period, total returns were negatively correlated

with an asset's duration. The rates of return on consumer loans, federal

funds, and on three—month bills, were the highest, and   on municipals the

lowest (although perhaps not on an after-tax basis). Since the end of 1969,

however, with smaller increases in market interest rates the correlation

is not as exact. In a period not as heavily dominated by interest

rate movements, other factors become more important. The table indi-

cates that total net returns for commercial and industrial loans since

1969 have equaled those on T—bills. The after—tax returr on municipais

might well be the highest of all even though their duration is the longest.

The return on house mortgages again exceeded. that of the shorter—term

other real estate loans.

                            Portfolio_Losses

         The risk of any bank losing all Of its capital and having a

 negative net worth depends upon both the amount of its initial capital

 and on the risks it assumes by its selection of assets and liabilities.

We can divide the risks into two parts for analysis.

        The first is called the "wealth effect." This is the change in the value

of the portfolio caused by changes in the rate of discount applied to the

initial expected cash flows from both assets and liabilities. Thus at

the end of one year, the value of assets and liabilities and of the

bank depends upon the projected cash flows (based upon loan agreements,

expected defaults, expected processing costs, etc.) and the discount

rates applicable to these future cash flows.    During the course of the

year, these rates of discount will change as a result of movements in

spot interest rates, in forward rates, and the risk premia for each

class of assets and liabilities. Thus the wealth
                                                    effect depends upon
the distribution of assets in the initial portfolio and the way each

one's rate of discount alters.

        The "income effect" on the portfolio's values results from

changes in the expected cash flows. These are influenced by movements

in the macroeconomy. During the course of the year, cash flows will

differ from those expected at the start because market interest rates

will apply to new or refinanced loans or investments, because cost of

operations will alter, default rates and non—accruing loans may increase,

and the amount of effort required to collect
                                               on loans may differ, and

because liquidity problems may lead to transaction Costs to liquidate

part of the portfolio.
                                  24



        In addition, future cash flows will alter because the amounts

of each type of asset and liability in the portfolio may differ. The

rate of expansion or decline in holdings of the portfolio will react to

movements in Interest rates, in the money supply, In the gross national

product, and to competitive pressures. How banks react to these move-

ments will differ depending upon such factors as the bank's type of

customers, its region, past commitments, and the way in which different

categories of assets and liabilities react to the economy.

       Our study gives rough estimates of these two influences on banks

with dIfferent weights of assets and liabilities. Our estimates are

inexact because In Table 4 we have not included estimates of shifts in

risk premia or of those within the term structure, but instead have

used the concept of duration and yield to maturity.

       As examples of wealth effects for an average bank, the losses

in capital values as a percent of its total earning assets were 4.8 percent

in 1969, 2.4 percent in 1973, and 1.9 percent in 1974. These are the

weighted average of typical portfolios in those years times the rate

of loss shown in Table 4. These losses would have been increased to

the extent risk premia widened and decreased to the extent that the value

of existing deposits rose. However, Table 1 shows that the cost of

deposits rose at about the same rate as the value of money during this

period. As a result, since deposits had but a slight impact, we can

estimate that In these years the net wealth effect reduced capital

values somewhat more than would be estimated from the impact of government

interest rates alone.


                                                                              )
                                     25




        In contrast to wealth effects, those from changes in income

effects on the capital of the average bank seem to be small. However,

again our data are incomplete. We do not have estimates of shifts in

duration from operations, and as noted earlier, because of changes in

the reporting forms we lack information on changes in book income in

1969. What we do have are estimates of changes in value arising from

alteratioiis in the mix of assets and liabilities and from movements in

book earnings for the other years.

        The income effects on a bank's capital value turn out to be

rather minor because of offsetting pressures. Earnings on newly purchased

rolled—over loans and investments rise, as do costs of lIabilities. The

chief danger to a bank is likely to be from a need to borrow at much

higher rates while the return on assets is moving up more slowly. For

the average bank, this problem was not great. Its costs for demand

time and savings deposits rose at roughly the same rate as returns on

assets. The costs of purchased money rose rapidly and their share of

total liabilities rose also, but an average bank does not have a large

ratio of these liabilities. As a result, average net earnings on assets

fell from 1.07 percent in 1972 to 1.04 percent in 1973, and then rose to

1.18 percent in 1974.

        The income and wealth effects have been combined for an arche-

typical bank. The line in Table 5 labeled "Total
                                                   portfolio of assets and
liabilities" is an estimate of how a bank holding a portfolio of
                                                                 average
duration and average composition would have fared in thIs period. The

portfolio estimate combines information from Tables 1 and 5 using mean

weights from banks' distribution of assets and liabilities.
                                  26




        In contrast to reported book year—to—year earning movements of

about five basis points, the table indicates that the economic return

on net earning assets fluctuated widely. Although exact data are not

available for 1969, the shift in returns from 1969 to 1970 was probably

over 9 percent. This shift reflects the fact that the three—month

Treasury bill rate was 5.92 percent in December 1968, 7.72 percent in

December 1969, and 4.86 percent in December 1970.

       While not extreme for the average bank, losses would rise rapidly

if a bank maintained a portfolio with far above average duration. Further—

more, it should be noted that the shift in returns for an average bank

from iflterest rate risks far exceeded variations in defaults or loan

losses for even those banks at the high end of the loan loss distribution.

                                  APPENDIX



        We need to differentiate among four separate approaches to

estimating costs and revenues of banks.

        1. As noted, this study is based upon statistical cost and

revenue curves. Differing amounts of assets and liabilities for each

unit in the cross—section are regressed on its reported costs and

revenues. The regression coefficients estimate the effect on returns

of placing a dollar in one class rather than in another.

        Thus the estimated rates of return are closely related to

marginal revenue and costs with the estimated variations in returns

depending upon differences among classes. This technique specifically

accounts for the interrelationship among the banks' assets and liabilities.

The influences of all assets and liabilities are considered simultane-

ously. One   estimates   the effect on revenues of placing funds in loans

rather than investments in securities while simultaneously considering

the effect of such differences on costs. Overhead and partially variable

costs are distributed among assets and liabilities in accordance with

the way in which they cause costs and revenues for classes of assets

and liabilities to vary among banks rather than in an arbitrary manner.

        2. Closely related to this study are the operating data reported

by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve in their annual Bank Operating Statistics.

Reported data in those publications are unweighted averages of individual banks.

This gives a decided bias because most banks are small while most assets

are held by large banks. The sample we used is weighted more heavily to

banks with more deposits, but It results in unbiased coefficients. The
                                                                                   )
                                   29


Fecj—FDIC studies show average costs and revenues for aggregated assets,

for specific types of costs, and for gross and net income before and

after various types of adjustments. They do not show the interrelation-.

ship of costsand revenues. They do not show the net returns for loans

or categories of loans. They do not estimate-the cost of demand deposits.

On the whole, estimates for the few comparable series in this study and

Bank Operating Statistics are in general agreement. In 1975, however,

this study shows a higher return on municipals and lower costs for time

and saving deposits. The reason is unclear, but may be related to the

special impact of New York City bonds.

        3. Similar types .of data to that of the Fed—FDIC but with more

complete breakdowns, are found in the annual reports of larger banks.

These are the kinds of data used by stock analysts and those in the

market concerned with rating the safety of individual banks.   Analysis of

annual reports tends to emphasize net interest earned or the relationships

between rates of interest earned on assets (Including the effect of

volume and rate changes) and the costs of money available for lending.

Payments of interest are estimated for time and saving deposits and for

other purchased money. Net interest earned is then compared with the

non—interest costs of operating the banks.

        4. An entirely different approach is followed by the studies of

"Functional Cost Analysis" performed by and for Federal Reserve member

banks. This approach uses especially prepared detailed cost accounting

information. Banks in a sample period report information about personnel

and other types of costs assigned to specific functions such as check

clearing, account maintenance, lending, etc. The specific cost functions

for four types of loans, for investments, and for types of deposits are
                                  30



estimated. Overhead costs are allocated to each. Gross yields and

expenses are then estimated.

        To obtain net revenues by class of assets, the FCA studies sub-

tract the average cost of funds from the gross revenue after expenses for

a specific class of assets. Similarly, gross revenues after specific

expenses are calculated for the entire portfolio and the average income

is credited to each class of liability to get an estimate of net earnings

by type of liability and asset.

        The basic differences between the cost and revenue data in this

study in contrast to the others is that the allocations of revenues and

costs depend upon the total relationships among classes of assets and

liabilities. The estimates are made statistically by regression so that

a best estimate is obtained as to how costs and revenues vary in accord-

ance with the manner in which sums earned and spent relate to differing

distribution of assets and liabilities among the 980 banks in the sample.

In almost all cases (the exceptions being noted by asterisks in Table 1),

the resulting estimated coefficients are highly significant (at a

99 percent level).
