      THE COST OF CAPITAL IN JAPAN:     RECENT EVIDENCE AND FURTHER RESULTS
                                      ABSTRACT
     We extend our recent work measuring the cost of capital in Japan and the
United States by considering several questions that such results raised. Among
our findings are:
     (I)   The small firm   -
                              large firm distinction appears to be more
           significant   in Japan, not in the United States;
     (2)   CorrectingJapanese accounting statements for cross-holding
           raises the estimated Japanese cost-of-capital by about 1
           percentage point;
     (3)   CorrectingJapanese accounting statements for unmeasured returns
           to land has a significantly more important effect:  the most
           conservative correctionwe attempt raises the implied Japanese return
           to capital to parity with the United States during the mid-1980's.

                                   1.   Introduction
     In two recent papers (Ando and Auerbach, hereafter AA, 1988a, 1988b), we
investigated the   question of   whether the cost of capital is lower in Japan
than in the United States.       Examining accounting and market-based measures of
the returns to holders of debt and equity in two countries      from the early
1960s through the early 1980s, we reached a number of conclusions:
1.   Measures of the cost of capital based on market returns were closer for
     the two countries than measures based even on corrected accounting data;
2.   The differences between the measured costs of capital were more apparent
     for broad samples (AA 1988b) than for the selected samples of large
     companies (AA 1988a);
3.   One could reject several potential explanations of the seemingly large
     differences in the cost of capital; among these were:
     a.   differences   in corporate tax burdens;
     b.   the greater ability of Japanese corporations to avail themselves of
          tax deductible borrowed funds; and
     c.   the potential understatement of Japanese returns to capital due to
          the presence of compensating liquid balances on the books of
          Japanese corporations.
     We concluded that the most likely cause of the difference in rates of
return was a combination of the higher saving rate in Japan and the imperfect
flow of capital between the two countries.        One interpretation of our
differential results for large and small firms (Hodder 1988) was that this
lack of access to international capital markets plagued only smaller firms.
The intuition is that large U.S. and Japanese firms operate in a unified world
capital market, while smaller firms do not.        Hence, smaller Japanese companies
could benefit from the targeting of the domestically generated Japanese
surplus of funds, while smaller U.S. firms could not.        Evidence to support
this view comes from recent work suggesting that investment by smaller U.S.
firms is more sensitive   to internal funds than that of larger firms     (Fazzari
        1988)   and that the same is true for Japanese firms without a main bank
 connection (Hoshi eta]. 1989)
       In this paper, we revisit the cost-of-capital          issue once again.     Our
 investigation is motivated by several factors.            One is the desire to consider
the staall-firm-large-firtu distinction      in more detail.        second motivation is
chat data for the period 1985-88, after our previous sample ended, are now
avail-able.     This was   a   period of liberalizedcapital export from Japan, during
which Japanese investment in the United States grew sharply1.             Hence, it       might
be   possible to detect an erosion in a gap in the cost of capital due to
capital market imperfections.         Finally, the last few years have been a period
of extreme behavior in capital markets, including the international               stock
market crash of October 1987 and, in Japan, a subsequent explosion in the
prices of equity and land.2 The opportunity to include such data in our
analysis gives us the ability to evaluate additional hypotheses that might
explain differences in rates of return between Japan and the United States.
This ability is further aided by the availability for recent years of Japanese
accounting data presented on a consolidated basis.
      We begin our analysis in the next section with a review of our
methodology and an update of our results for Japan and the United States to
include the most recent period.         In Section   3,   we break the results down for
companies of different sizes in the two countries.            We find little evidence to
support the contention that the most important differences in the cost of
capital between the two countries are among smaller firms.            Indeed,     the
distinctions between small firms and large firms seems greater in Japan than
in the United States.
         Section 4   presents   our results regarding   the importance   of land and
cross-holdings in explaining rates of return in Japan.            We find that these two
factors,      particularly the significance of land as a corporate asset, help to
explain why Japanese market returns have so greatly exceeded Japanese
accounting returns, especially in recent years, and suggest that the cost.of-
capital gap may be considerably smaller than estimates based on corrected
accounting returns would suggest.           This leaves as a major puzzle, however,         the
high and, in recent years, rapidly appreciating Japanese land prices.
                                                                                 -
                                                                                     In
Section 5, we discuss this puzzle and other questions            that remain for future
research.
                                     2.   Recent Evidence
        As   in our earlier work, our basic data     source   for the Unites States is
the Compustat Tapes.       For Japan, our primary source for data is the Needs-
Nikkei Financial Data Tapes.
        In the past, we have estimated the before-tax cost of capital faced by
firms using two methods.         Each method is based on the underlying assumption
that,    at least over long periods of time, the rate of return to a firm            will
equal the rate required by the holders of securities.            Our approach is to take
a weighted average of the returns to equity and the returns to debt in
calculating the overall return to capital, using observed debt-equity ratios
for weights.
        For both of our measures of the cost of capital, we estimate the cost of
debt using interest payments of the firm divided by the book value of firm's
debt3.       The resulting effective interest rate is adjusted for inflation to
                                                                                      4
 produce an estimate of the firm's real cost of debt.     The measures    differ in
 the way we estimate the return to equity, before taxes.
        Our first measure, to which we refer as a "corrected accounting" measure,
 begins with the firm's accounting earnings, before-tax, and adjusts for
 several differences between this measure and an economically appropriate one,
 including the inflation-induced    understatement of depreciation and inventory
 costs and capital gains on net financial liabilities.     Our second measure,
 based on returns to equity in the stock market, begins with the holding-period
yield (dividend plus capital gain) to shareholders in a company as a measure
 of the return to equity after corporate taxes, and adds to this the taxes paid
by the company.    The measured holding period yield must be adjusted for new
equity issues, a somewhat complicated procedure in Japan because of the common
practice of issuing new shares at par value, normally 50 yen per share.
     Each of these measures has its advantages and disadvantages,        which we
have discussed in detail in the past.      While the market return may pick up
components of earnings missed by the accounting measure, notably capital gains
on land, it is very volatile and hence not very informative about the cost of
capital over short periods of time.4
     Table 1 presents annual averages for these two measures of the race of
return to capital in Japan and the United States for the period 1967 through
l988.     For the full period, the measure based on corrected earnings averaged
6.0 percent for Japan,   slightly lower than our previous average for the period
1967-83 of 6.5 percent. The decline in Japanese earnings-price ratios since
1983, particularly after 1985,     explains the drop from our previous average.
For the United States, too, our average corrected accounting measure of the
return to capital is close to our previous measure, with the extra years 1984-
 88 reducing the average from 12.3 percent to 11.9 percent.          In each country,
 the growth in equity values during the 1980s has reduced the average return to
 capital for the full sample period, but the gap between before-tax returns to
 capital based on corrected accounting measures remains      at about     6   percentage
points.
        It is not surprising that one obtains a different trend for each country
using the market-based measure of the return to equity, since both U.S. and
Japanese stock markets rose during the mid-1980s. The difference is
especially large for Japan, where the 1967-88 average of 8.2 percent exceeds
our previous measure of 5.7 percent.       This large jump is due to the growth in
equity values during the period 1986-88, when the overall market return to
capital (not just equity, but equity plus debt) averaged over 20 percent per
year.     By comparison,   the U.S. market returns over the period 1967-88 averaged
9.8 percent, up by 1.5 percentage points.
        It may be tempting to interpret this larger rise in Japanese market
returns as evidence of an increasing cost of capital in Japan and a closing of
the cost-of-capital gap.      Had that occurred, however, we should first have
observed a drop in the price of Japanese shares, to reflect the higher rate of
capitalization of earnings,     followed by a higher rate of return in the market
and a lower price-earnings ratio thereafter.       No such drop in equity prices is
evident in the data, except for the crash of October 1987 that was not unique
to Japan.    Given the opening of foreign capital markets to Japanese investors
during this same period and the considerable capital flows from Japan actually
observed, this reduction in an already very low accounting-based rate of
return is quite vexing.      After breaking the results --in Table   1   down by firm
 size in the next section. we return to this puzzling result and pursue
 alternative explanations.
                           3. Rates   of Return and Firm Size
        In separating our samples by size, we must recognize the
                                                                 potentially
 serious biases in doing so.      Firms that are small at the end of our sample but
 were large enough to be included in the data set two decades ago are more
 likely than a firm    chosen   at random to have    experienced    a race of growth (and,
presumably,    an average rate of return) below average.           Likewise a firm that
was small at the beginning of the sample period and did not disappear is
 likely to have grown at a greater than average rate.          Since these biases work
in opposite directions,     we consider two samples for each of the two countries,
broken down by size (market value of debt plus equity) in 1970 and size in
1985.
        In each of the four samples so drawn, we divide the firms into quartiles
by cumulative market value (i.e. each quartile contains one-fourth of total
market value, not one-fourth of all firms).          This method places many more
firms    in the bottom quartile than in the top, but we are primarily interested
in the behavior of small firms in terms of how their behavior affects the
aggregate measures previously reported.
        The results of our calculations are reported in Table 2.           For Japan, the
results are relatively insensitive to the base year chosen;             there   is little
evidence of any important selection bias.        Perhaps surprising,       in light of
previous arguments, is the fact that the implied cost of capital increases
with firm size, regardless of which of the four measures one uses.               Taking
simple averages   of   the measures   in the table   for each quartile yields (in
                                                                                                  7
order   of ascending size) rates of return of .090,             .089,    .081 and .072 for the
market return measures and .065, .065, .057 and .055 for the corrected
accounting measures. The main break appears to be between the top and bottom
halves of the sample, by size.
       The U.S. averages are more unstable across sample definition and method
of measurement. This is particularly true             for   the two     largest   size
categories,    which have relatively few firms in them.             Hence, we are less
comfortable drawing results on the basis of the U.S. numbers.                     However,   there
is clearly no evidence in tables that the second or third quartile of firms in
the United States had a lower required return to capital than the lowest
quartile.     Indeed, analysis based ott grouping the results for the two larger
quartiles,    suggests that the cost of capital rises with firm size. While the
results   in this section must     interpreted with care because of the smaller
                                    be
number of    firms   in   each size category,   it is striking nonetheless that the
only evidence of a required rate of return            to    capital that declines with firm
size   is for Japan, and that the opposite result seems to hold for the United
States.     One   cannot make   differences between the two        countries      disappear by
focusing attention only on larger firms with presumably more comparable access
to capital markets. Restricting attention to such firms simply magnifies the
differences already observed in the full samples of firms from the two
countries.
                              4. Explaining Returns in Japan
       The increasing gap between accounting-basedreturns                 to capital in Japan
and the United States has occurred in spite of the recent liberalization of
capital markets in Japan.         Since   increased   capital flows should have reduced
 cost-of-capitaldifferences, this trend strongly suggests that our accounting
 measures are incomplete,    that some other factors underlie the increase in
 Japanese equity values.
      We explore two such factors in this section.         These are the remarkable
 behavior of land values in Japan and the strong pattern of equity cross-
 holdings among Japanese companies.       Indeed, as we discuss below, these issues
 are related because significant
                                 cross-holdings make the values of a company's
 shares more sensitive to the changes in prices of underlying "fundamentals".
A. Cross-Holdinas
      To a much greater extent than      in   the United States, firms in Japan hold
equity in other firms.      Moreover,   Japanese accounting practices regarding the
equity of subsidiaries make the consolidations of financial statements of
parent and subsidiary much less likely.6
     Since only the flow income (i.e.         dividends) from unconsolidated holdings
will normally appear on income statements, rather than the total return
(either total earnings or dividends plus accruing capital gains), the earnings
of corporations with significant subsidiary holdings may be
                                                            substantially
understated. The extremely low dividend-price ratio in Japan (in recent
                                                                        years
well below 1 percent) would exacerbate this understatement.
     Moreover,   the problem of understatement applies to cross-holdings in
general.   Many cross-holdings in Japan do not represent holdings by a parent
of a subsidiary, but rather an interlocking ownership among
                                                            free-standing
independent companies.     In this sense, a consolidation of returns to include
subsidiaries would correct only part of the understatement of earnings.         We
estimate the importance of this phenomenon in two ways.
                                                                                        9
       Our first approach considers only the effects of the lack of subsidiary
consolidation.     For recent years, there are now available financial statements
for Japanese companies that are restated for the effects of consolidation.7
However, the data are not available for a long enough period for us to perform
all the relevant adjustments to accounting earnings used to produce the
numbers in the third column of Table     1.   While data on from 300 to nearly 800
corporations are available for years 1984-7, data for far fewer firms are
available even for the period 1978-83.        However,   a rough estimate of the
importance of this effect can be obtained if we assume that the unobservable
difference between adjusted earnings on consolidated and unconsolidated
returnsequals the observable difference between the corresponding levels of
unadjusted earnings.
     The results of this calculation are given in Table 3. The inclusion of
subsidiaries does make a significant differeTtce in measured earnings,
increasing them by a factor in the range of one-fourth to one-half. The
implied increase in the rate of return to capital (calculated by multiplying
the increase in the aggregate earnings-price ratio by the fraction of equity
in the aggregate capital structure) averages 1.3 percent over the period 1978-
87,   or roughly one-fifth of the average for the same period of the corrected
accounting numbers given in Table 1, 6.4 percent.
      Given   the importance of nonsubsidiary cross-holdings in Japan,      we   also
consider   a correction that takes account of all cross-holdings,       for which
aggregate data from other sources must be used and a variety of simplifying
assumptions are necessary.
      Let d be the dividend yield of equity in the aggregate (total dividends
divided by the   total value   of equity, summed over firms), and assume that all
                                                                                        10
 companies whose shares are held by other firms have this same yield in any
 given year.     Let f be the ratio of the market value of a company's cross-held
 equity (i.e. equity in other companies held as assets) to the market value of
 the company's       own equity, and assume also that this ratio is constant in a
particular year.        Then,    for a particular company i, the earnings-price ratio,
purged of cross-holdings,            is:
(I)
               (E/P)
                        —
                            ((E/P)     -   f d/(l-f)
Expression     (1)   provides a measure that subtracts dividends from cross-held
shares from earnings and the value of cross-held shares from equity value,
yielding an earnings-price ratio for the firm's "own" operations.8               Using the
aggregate dividend yield for our sample and a measure for our sample's
aggregate debt-value ratio (time series of which are provided in Table 4), we
need only a measure of          f,   the cross-holding ratio, to translate   the correction
given in   (1)   into a numerical estimate of the correction applicable to the
average accounting returns to capital presented in Table            1.
      One cannot obtain a measure of f from our corporate financial statements,
since cross-holdings are typically carried at book value, which we know to
represent a woeful understatement of market value.             Rather than attempt to
correct these book values directly, we use aggregate statistics available in
the Annual Reoort on National Accounts,            published by the Japanese Economic
Planning Agency (EPA).9
      Table 5 presents series for the nonfinancial Japanese corporate sector
for the period 1970-88. The first column of the table gives the gross
aggregate value of nonfinancial corporate equity, while the second, third and
fourth columns break these totals down by sector of ownership. Holdings by
                                                                                11
the nonfinancial corporate sector itself, given in column 2 of the table, are
cross-holdings.    The cross-holding ratio, corresponding to the fraction f in
equation (1), equals the ratio of column 2 to column 1 and is given in the
last column of the table.
     The table shows how important cross-holdings are now and have
historically been in Japan, with the ratio remaining between .33 and .38
during the entire period.    Indeed, since the late l970s, nonfinancial
corporations have themselves held more nonfinancial corporate stock than have
households,   as the share of nonfinancial corporate equity held by financial
corporations has steadily grown.    By the beginning of 1989, Japanese
households held just 26 percent of that country's nonfinancial corporate
equity.
     Given these estimates of f and the insignificance of dividend yields in
recent years, the correction based on expression (1) increases the corrected
earnings-price ratio by roughly the same magnitude as correction based on
subsidiaries alone.    Its effect on the estimated returns to capital is given
in the second column of Table 6, which repeats in its first column the
corrected accounting measures given in Table 1.    For the period 1970-88, the
correction adds about .9 percentage points to the average corrected accounting
return to capital.    For the period 1978-87 used above to consider the
consolidation of subsidiaries, the average impact of the cross-holding
correction is 1.1 percent.    Since, in principal, this number should exceed
that based on subsidiary consolidation (for it includes all cross-holdings,
not just holdings of subsidiaries), the two approaches provide a range of
estimated effects of correcting for cross-holding.
                                                                                   12
      Given the very rough nature of each calculation,      this range is not wide.
 It gives us a fairly good picture of the
                                          significance of cross-holding and the
 lack of subsidiary consolidation in the understatement of the
                                                               accounting
 returns to capital.     This is an important correction,   in that it may raise the
 estimated Cost of capital by more than one percentage point, but it falls far
 short of explaining the several percentage point gap between
                                                              accounting
 returns to capital in the two      countries.

      Like   cross-holding of equity, holding of land by a corporation can lead
 to an understatement of the firm's                            In each case, a
                                    accounting earnings.
significant portion of the return on the asset may come in the form of
unrealized capital gains that do not appear on financial statements unless the
asset is sold.       Hence, the large value of land holdings in Japan may help
explain the low accounting-based return to capital there.
      In addition,    however,   and unlike the case of cross-holdings, the
significant increase over time in the value of land can also help explain why
Japanese equities have grown in value at such a high rate even as the
accounting rate of return has been quite low.       The situation is different
because cross-holdings do not represent a "primitive" component of the
corporate sector's balance sheet.       It would be circular reasoning to "explain"
increases    in the value of corporations as resulting from increases in the
value of other corporations,      without having some underlying explanation for
any corporation's value increasing.       On the other hand, land values could
increase for a variety of reasons, leading the values of corporations holding
the land to increase as well.       Indeed, taking cross-holding into account could
                                                                                     13
then magnify the     measured   impact of increased land-holdings,   via the indirect
impact of increased land prices on the       values   of cross-held shares.   This
section considers     the importance    of land in explaining the recent high market
returns in Japan, as well as the apparently low accounting returns there.
      The value of land in Japan was extremely high by U.S. standards even
several years ago.      In recent years, this value has exploded in real terms.
The rate of this recent increase and, indeed, the extent of appreciation over
the past few decades,     depends very much on which price index one uses.
      The set of price indices we consider are given in Table 7.         These series
measure the price of land in Japan, expressed in terms of yen per square
meter, for the period 1965-88.         The first series applies to all privately-
owned land, while the second excludes forest land.          Each series shows a near
doubling of land prices over the three-year period 1985-8, and a similar
pattern of appreciation over earlier periods as well.
     Since we do not know the quality and location of land held by individual
firms in our sample, we must work with calculations based on the sample as a
whole.      Multiplying the aggregate price series in the first column of Table 7
by the land holdings of each firm in our sample produces the aggregate land-
value ratio given in the first column of Table 8 for the period 1970.88.10
The series suggests that by 1988, land accounted for nearly half of the value
of a representative firm in our sample.
     However,     this understates the importance of land as a determinant of the
value of the sample as a whole.         Some of each firm's value is accounted for by
the equity of other firms, which cancels        in the aggregate. Given cross-
holdings,    we should expect an increase in land values to be exceeded by the
corresponding increase in the value of gross nonfinancial corporate equity.
                                                                                    14
 The reason is simple.    If values reflect fundamentals,   then the net value of
 equity held by those outside the nonfinancial corporate sector should reflect
 the increase   in land values.   Since shares held within the corporate sector
 must maintain their relative value to shares held externally,     the gross value
 of shares must increase by the land value increase divided by (1-f), where f
 is the fraction of shares that are cross-held.
      Netting out cross-held equity under the assumption that the aggregate
 ratio f given in the last column of Table 5 also applies to our sample as a
whole, we obtain the ratio of land to net value given in the second column of
 Table 8.    This ratio indicates how much of the value of the firms in our
 sample is accounted for by their land holdings.    Using this ratio, we can
calculate how much the real value of these firms should have increased simply
to reflect increases in the real value of land, based on the price series
given in the first column of Table 7.     While substantial,   averaging 3.1% for
the period 1975-88,    these numbers fall far short of explaining the very large
returns to debt plus equity observed during the period 1985-88.
     However,    there is other evidence on land values suggesting that the
series in Table 7 greatly understate the value of land held by corporations,
and hence the role of land appreciation in the recent rise in Japanese equity
prices.     Our reasons for suspecting an underestimation by the procedure
followed here are discussed in the appendix to this paper.
     In light of our considerable uncertainty about the appropriate price
series to use for the land held by firms in our sample, we consider an
alternative approach based on aggregate National Income Account data on the
value of land held by the nonfinancial corporate sector.
                                                                                    15
        The aggregate   market values of land held by the nonfinancial corporate
 sector, again obtained from EPA data,     are presented in Table 9.    Also
 presented,    for comparison are gross and net (of cross-holdings)    aggregate
 equity values for the sector, taken from Table 5.      The ratio of land value to
 gross equity value     is given in the last column of the table.
        According to the table, the value of land held by nonfinancial
corporations exceeded gross equity value during all but the last two years of
the sample.      By 1989, this fraction had fallen to 73 percent. Even in that
year. however, land value far exceeded the value of equity net of cross-
holdings by one-third.
      Given our debt-value ratios in Table 4, this translates into the series
of land value ratios given in the first two columns of Table 10 based on
equity gross and net of cross-holdings,      respectively,   comparable to those in
the first two columns of Table 8.       The figures in Table   10 indicate land-value
ratios that are nearly twice as large as those based on the price series in
Table   7, although,    the trends over time are similar.    Given that these new
estimates     show land as representing the majority of all corporate value, it is
not surprising that the increases in market value attributable to land are
quite significant.      Based on the same inflation rate of land prices as before,
(calculated using the aggregate price series in Table 7), the real returns to
debt plus equity attributable to real appreciation of land are given in the
last column of Table 10.
     These returns are considerably larger than those in Table 8, and
"explain" a much greater fraction of the overall market returns during the
mid-l980s.     For example, during the period 1986-8, the average increase in
                                                                                                16
value due to land appreciation alone         is estimated            to have been 17.0%, compared
to the overall average market return of 20.9%.
        Thus, at least one measure of the value of land suggests that the changes
in equity values in Japan in recent years may be consistent with the
appreciation of the land held by Japanese firms, although this leaves
unexplained the reason for such land appreciation.                     Given tl   estimated
importance of land on corporate balance sheets, and the apparent importance
(at least in recent years) of capital gains               in motivating the holding of land,
it is likely that accounting returns that include only direct returns to the
holding of land will greatly understate the required returns to debt plus
equity of Japanese firms during our sample period.
        To correct the measured accounting returns for the incorrect measurement
of the total returns to land, we take an approach that is similar to the one
used to correct for cross-holdings.          Let r equal the direct rent on land
received by firms, expressed as a fraction of land value.                      Then,   taking
account of cross-holdings as well, and letting d be the dividend yield and 1
the land-gross equity ratio, the corrected return to equity should be:
(2)
              (E/P)
                      —   (El?)   + f   [(E/P)   -
                                                     d]   + 1   g     -
                                                                          r]
where   g   is the true return to the holding of land, presumably much larger than
r because of the importance of anticipated capital gains.                      Expression (2) says
that we should replace the returns to cross-holdings and land actually
appearing on corporate income statements,            d and      r,   with the true returns that
firms actually earn on these holdings, equal to the full return on equity.
            and the full return on land, g.
(E/P),
                                                                                                  17
       Assuming that g equals           (E/P).        i.e.. that the required returns to land
 and other assets are the same, we may solve (2) to obtain (compare to (1)):
 (3)        (E/P)        —   ((E/P).    -   fd   -
                                                     lrl/(l f

                                                                    1)
       To make this correction, we require an estimate of r, the rent-value
 ratio for land held by the corporate                 sector.   We face serious obstacles in
estimating this ratio.           In the first place, as far as we know, Japanese
national accounts do not report the rent on land earned by corporations.                      In
the second place, one of the features of the extraordinarilyhigh price and
the rate of increase of the price of land in Japan is that the rent-value
ratio for land is extremely small when it is measured.                     For example, the rent
earned by the household sector for 1985 is reported to be 1,790.1 billion yen,
whereas the land owned by the same sector at the beginning of 1985 valued at
the current market price is reported to be 657.8 trillion yen, implying the
rent-value ratio of .27%.              In order to remain as conservative as possible in
our estimate of the contribution of the real capital gains on land to the rate
of return on capital, we have arbitrarily decided to use the rent-value ratio
of 1.5% in this        context. 12
       Using this, along with estimates of the fractions d, f, and 1, we can use
expression (3) to obtain accounting return measures corrected for cross-
holdings and land.           For d, we use the series based on our sample, given in
Table 4.    For   f,   we use the cross-holding fraction from Table              5.   For 1, we
have two choices. One is based on the aggregate statistics given in Table                         9.
The second can be obtained from the land-value figures based on our sample,
given in Table 8.        The latter measure is lower, and hence will result in a
smaller correction to the accounting rate of return.                     These alternative
                                                                                            18
 estimates are provided in the second and third columns of Table 11.             The first
 column of the table repeats for convenience the basic corrected accounting
 measures from Table    1.
         If anything, the first Set   of   corrections   explains   "too much", in that
 the total corrected returns    to capital now far exceed those of the United
 States;    in some years exceeding 50 percent.      However, the second set of
 corrections,   based on the use of the price series for land
                                                              reported in Table 7
 combined with reported land holdings for our sample firms, yields results that
 are much more plausible.    Indeed,   comparing this series with the corrected
 accounting series for the United States in Table 1, we find very little
difference between the two countries in recent years, with the U.S. return not
noticeably higher after 1980.     While this hardly constitutes proof that the
cost of capital is now similar in the two countries,           it   does suggest that the
gap that appears to exist in Table 1 can be eliminated using quite feasible
corrections to the way one measures the accounting rate of return in
                                                                     Japan.
     Our results suggest that land appreciation may help
                                                         explain a significant
portion of the recently high market rates of return in Japan.             However,   this
is true only when we use land value estimates based on
                                                       aggregate statistics,
which suggest that land represents almost all the value of the nonfinancial
corporate sector.  In such a case, the implied correction to accounting rates
of return is so large as to imply a very high rate of return on non-land
assets,    since such assets would represent such a small
                                                          part of corporate
value.
     If we use a very conservative price series to estimate the value of
corporate land, we find that capital gains on land, while still important, can
explain only a small part of the recent appreciation of share values.
                                                                                     19
 However,    the correction to accounting returns based on these land value
 estimates    produce quite reasonable estimates   of corrected accounting returns,
 estimates    that are extremely close to those for the United States over the
 period 1984-8 when liberalized capital markets in Japan would have led us to
 expect a convergence of the costs of capital in the two countries.
      Even by our very conservative estimates of land values, which we believe
 may greatly understate true values, the value of land held by the firms in our
 sample represented over half of their net (of cross-holdings)      value in 1988.
This emphasizes how important it is to understand and allow for the behavior
 of land prices and the accounting for the return to land in estimating the
cost of capital.
                                   4. Conclusions
     In this paper, we have attempted to clarify the implications of our
earlier work in two ways: by exploring reasons for an aggregate cost of
capital differential between the United States and Japan, and alternative
explanations for observed differences between the countries in measured rates
of return.     We judge our findings to raise as many questions as they answer,
although the significance of land and cross-holdings is certainly important
enough to 'explain" differences in rates of return.       The explanation remains
incomplete,   however because it is difficult to understand the relationship of
land values to the market value of firms.      In some sense, our results argue
for a change of focus in future research,     away from explaining the perceived
cost of capital gap and toward achieving a better understanding of Japanese
capital markets, or more broadly, Japanese asset markets in general including
the market for land.

           sample 1970 divides sample using firm size in 1970; sample 1985
           divides sample using firm size in 1985; averages for Japan are for
           the period 1967-88; for the U.S., averages are computed for the
           period 1970-88.

Notes:     The total is the sum of holdings by nonfinancial and financial
           corporations and by households, reported at the market value.
           Conceptually, it differs from the equity reported in Mikkei-Needs
           tapes because (1) these figures apparently include equities of
           financial corporations; and (2) equities held by foreigrers are
           excluded.   It is our impression that the discrepancy due to these
           conceptual differences is quite small. Economic Planning Agency,

    (a) it includes shares of financial corporations, and (b) it does
    not include shares owned by foreigners.  Figures for balance sheets
    of financial institutions from the same source appear to suggest
    that the total value of equity for financial corporations is
    relatively small.

1. According to the August 1988 (p. 69) and 1989 (P. 47) issues of the Survey
of Current Business, the stock of Japanese direct investment capital in the
United States grew by 38.9 percent in 1986, 31.0 percent in 1987 and 51.8
percent in 1988.
2.The sharp drop in Japanese equity markets during the winter of 1989-90
occurred too recently to be accounted for in the data studied in this paper.
3. Although a market value of debt would be preferable, we have concluded in
the past that this correction would introduce new errors and is not
                                                                    likely to
be as significant as the others we undertake.
4. There are further problems plaguing each measure that Prelate to the effects
of taxes on market value. If there is accelerated depreciation, then the
value of the firm's equity may be less than its replacement cost because. old
capital bears less valuable depreciation allowances than new capital.   Hence,
the true cost of capital, equal to the expected rate of return to new
investment before tax, will be lower than that implied by the corrected
accounting measure.
     Equity value may also be lower than replacement cost if the marginal
source of equity funds is retained earnings.  In this case, again, the
earnings-price ratio will overstate the return to new equity investment. The
understatement will be less severe for the market-based measure, since only
the dividend yield (relative to the replacement cost of
                                                        capital) will be
overstated by the equity undervaluation.
     For further discussion of such valuation issues, see Auerbach (1983).
We have not pursued this question here, due not only to the uncertainty about
which assumption about equity valuation is correct, but also because of our
view that such corrections are quite unlikely to be as significant as the
others we undertake in this paper.
5. Our figures for the United States for the years 1967-69 are taken from our
earlier paper (AA 1988b) since our current version of the            tape
does not provide data for this period. This use of earlierCompustat

not appear to pose a problem of comparability, as our methodolgy is the same
and the two samples nearly so.  The aggregate results for the two data sets
for overlapping years (1970-84) are virtually identical.

I.   On the Size and the Price of Land Held by Non-Financial       Corporations
     and Real Capital Gains Due to Their Ownership1
     The analysis presented in the text of our paper has made clear the
importance of the real capital gains on land in the true earnings of Japanese
corporations.    The estimate of these capital gains, in turn, depends critically
on our estimate of the size of corporate holdings of land and its price.
Unfortunately,   information   on these quantities   front alternative   sources can vary
widely, making it very difficult to form a coherent picture of asset markets.
In this appendix, we present the background information on these quantities in
order to enable the reader to interpret our result in a proper perspective,         and
to stimulate further discussion on the assessment of data on these quantities.
     The Nikkei-Needs tape contains two pieces of information on land held
                                                                           by
each corporation:  physical size of the land in square meters (variable No. 230)
and its book value   (No.   231).   It is clear that the book value is of no use to
us, since in many cases     the ratio of the book value to the square meters implies
that the recorded book value is no more than a few yen per square meter,
                                                                         perhaps
because the land was owned since before the second world war.
     In an earlier version of this paper, we reported the result using the
information on square meters of land owned by corporations        in the Nikkei-Needs
sample, using a price based on the average price of land for all purposes for
Niigats prefecture reported in Chika-Koji.      The choice of the prefecture was
       This further investigation of the price of land and corporate holdings of
land and forests was partly motivated  by comments offered by Professor Yasushi
Iwamoto on the earlier version of this paper. We are
                                                       grateful to him for
calling our attention to the question of the presence of forest land in
corporate holdings in our calculation.
meant to utilize the price of land near the bottom, but not quite at the bottom,
of all prefectures, in order to generate a reasonably conservative result.
However, we now recognize    the possibility that we could still have overestimated
the price of land because a part of corporate holdings of land is forest, whose
price is much lower, while prices reported in Chika-Koji     refer largely to urban
land.     An alternative source of information on the land price is the Annual
Report on National Accounts.
        The Annual Report on National Accounts, however, reports only the aggregate
        of land owned by corporations and by households, and not the price or the
physical size, although these values are indeed broken down into several
categories    including forest land.   We must, then, find some other source of
information on either the price or the physical size of land corresponding        to
the value reported in National Accounts.     One possible source of information on
the physical size of land is the Susmnarv Renort on Prices. Etc.. of Fixed Assets
(Kotei Shisan no Kakaku to no Caiyo Chosho), prepared by the Ministry of Home
Affiars.     The Summary Report provides the physical size of the land in square
meters divided into the same categories as in National Accounts, but only for
total; that is, it does not divide land into those owned by corporations and by
households.    Thus, for example, in 1985, from these two sources, we have the
following    set of information:

     by Purpose (Physical Measure)
           In order to proceed, therefore, we must assume that the price of land owned
by households and that of land owned by corporations for the same purpose are
the same.         Under this assumption, we can compute the size of land owned
                                                                               by

         From these figures, it is clear that corporations do own a significant
 amount of forest land whose price is much lower than that for other types of
 land.    In the text, we will primarily rely on the average price including forest
 land shown above.     We wish, however, to gain some sense of whether or not these
 prices are reasonable by comparing them with prices reported in Chika-Koji.
 While any average price including forest land cannot be
                                                         compared with prices
 reported in Chika-Koji, at least residential land price should be roughly
 comparable   to the price of the corresponding      type of land in Chika-Koji.   It is
generally believed that price reported in Chika-Koji is considerablybelow the
actual transaction price in the market, perhaps by a half.           We record below the
average price for residential,        commercial, and industrial   land reported in
Chika.Koji,    for the highest priced prefecture     (Tokyo) and the lowest priced
prefecture (Shamine-Ken):

     Comparing Table A.3 with Table A.2, we see that the discrepancies       are
enormous.   The residential land price for Shimane-Ken, the prefecture with the
lowest land price    in the country, given in Table A.3, is of the same order of
magnitude   as the "national average" shown in Table A.2, namely,    58.l8 thousand
per square meter.     The Tokyo price is at least 5 times higher in Table A.3
compared to Table A.2.     The category called "other" in Table A.2 must include
commercial and industrial land, whose prices in Table A.3 are of entirely.
different   order of magnitude.   As we have mentioned earlier, there are
indications that even Chika-Koji prices are underestimates,      and we must also
remember that land owned by large corporations included in the Nikkei-Needs tape
are much more likely to be located in major commercial and industrial centers
such as Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya rather than in remote areas such as Shimane-Ken.
We must conclude, therefore, that relying largely on figures shown in Table A.2
for calculations    in the text, we are likely to be underestimating   the effect of
real capital gains on land for values of corporations      by a large margin.
     We can attempt to assess the reasonableness of our estimates from yet
another angle.     We record below the total value of debt plus equity for non-
financial corporations    as reported in Annual Report of National Accounts and the
corresponding    sum for all corporations   included in the Nikkei-Needs   tape and
included in our sample (only a few firms with significant missing data were
excluded from our sample), and similarly the total square meters of land from
these two sources:

  As above, the sum of total debts, given on p. 325, plus the sum of equities
  owned by non-financial corporations, financial institutions, and by
  households.  The latter is subject to error since it does not include
  holdings by foreigners and includes sonic equities of financial
  corporations.
  Square meters reported in the Nikkei-needs Tape multiplied by the average
  price reported above, namely, 14,2l0 per square meter.
  Nikkei-eeds Tape records adjusted as described in the text.
      According to the above table, both in the case of total debt plus equity
and the value of land, corporations included in Nikkei-Needs tape appear to
account for between 20% and 25% of national totals.
      It has been suggested by a number of authors that ownership of forest land
is concentrated in a few industries, namely, paper and pulp, stone, clay and
glass, mining, non-ferrous    metals, and electric generating.         This suggestion
seems to us to be reasonable, and we thought that we might apply the price of
land excluding forest for those corporations in industries other than the ones
listed above.     We found that the distribution of land between these two types         o:
industries   reported in the Nikkei-Needs tape does not seem to make sense:
                                      Table A.5
                    Distribution of Debt + Equity and Land (1985)

Forest Owning Industries          3914.4                      69,087.7
Non Forest Owning Industries       877.7                     145,987.8
Total                              4792.2                     215,074.8
        If we suppose that the ownership of non-forest land by forest owning
industries is in the same proportion to the ratio of debts plus equity of these
induatriea    to the non-forest owning induatriea, then our estimate of non-forest
land owned by forest owning industries must be approximately 415 million square
meters.     This implies that forest land owned by corporations is approximately
3,499 million square meters, while non-forest       land owned by these corporations
is approximately    1,293 million square meters.    In other words, the fraction of
forest land in total land owned by corporations included in Nikkei-needs           tape is
73%.    Figures reported in the National Accounts and the Summary Report referred
to above implies that this ratio should be 32% (—      5,867/(5,867 + 8,081   + 551 +
3,962)).     Thus, we have another serious contradiction in data from alternative
sources.
       The review of data in this appendix makes clear that, at least for those of
us not close to the sources of data, the information about Japanese land prices
and size and distribution of ownership of land contain many puzzles, and it is
difficult    for us to arrive at an understanding   of the land market in Japan and
its role in asset pricing that makes a reasonable economic sense.         We hope to be
able to clarify at least some part of these puzzles by learning more about the
nature of available data in the future.     Meanwhile,   the general pattern of data
 appears to imply that estimates of real capital gains on land accruing to
 corporations     during the past 20 years are most likely to be seriously
 underestimatedby the method displayed in Table       8.    Similarly, the method may
 seriously underestimate      the effect of capital gains on land in the correction o
 accountingmeasures of the cost of capital, given in the last column of Table
 11.
 II.     Debt-Value   Ratio in our Sample and in Aggregate Data
         The debt-value   ratio reported in Table 4 is based on figures reported in
Nikkei-Needs tape for our sample of firms, after some adjustments for reserves,
accounts payables, and so on.        The Annual Resort on National Accounts,    in its
balance sheet section, reports debts of non-financial corporations.          For the
beginning of 1985, we have
                                        Table A.6
                              For Nonfinancial Corporations

              Gross Equity*                           203.1
              Debt Value Ratio                        .76
*
    It should be recalled that this figure may include some equities of
    financial corporations and excludes holdings by foreigners.
         This ratio of .76 appears to be radically different from the one reported
in Table 4, namely, .489.        Some adjustments will reduce the difference:    for
instance,     eliminating accounts payable from the debt to reduce the debt-value
ratio to .70, but the difference       is still quite large.
         Since our sample accounts for only about 23% of the total reported in
national accounts in terms of debts plus equity (see Table A.4 above), we must
conclude that other, presumably smaller corporations and some large semi-public
