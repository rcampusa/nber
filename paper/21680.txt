                                              ABSTRACT

The Great Recession and the subsequent passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
returned fiscal policy, and particularly the importance of state and local governments, to the center
stage of macroeconomic policy-making. This paper addresses three questions for the design of
intergovernmental macroeconomic fiscal policies. First, are such policies necessary? Analysis of
US state fiscal policies show state deficits (in particular from tax cuts) can stimulate state economies
in the short-run, but that there are significant job spillovers to neighboring states. Second, to internalize
these spillovers, what central government fiscal policies are most effective for stimulating income
and job growth? Both federal tax cuts and transfers to households and firms and intergovernmental
transfers to states for lower income assistance are effective, with one and two year multipliers greater
than 2.0. Third, how are states, as politically independent agents, motivated to provide increased transfers
to lower income households? The answer is matching (price subsidy) assistance for such spending.
The intergovernmental aid is spent immediately by the states and supports assistance to those most
likely to spend new transfers.

I. Introduction

       The Great Recession and the subsequent passage of the American Recovery and

Reinvestment Act (ARRA) has returned fiscal policy, and in particular the role of state and local

governments in such policies, to center stage in our efforts to return the US economy to full

employment. Passed within the first two months of President Obama’s administration, ARRA has

now spent over $796 billion to stimulate the stimulate the private economy: $381 billion as federal

tax relief and expanded unemployment compensation, $98 billion as direct federal government

spending, and $318 billion as intergovernmental transfers to state and local governments for

education spending ($93 billion), infrastructure spending ($70 billion), financing of lower-income

housing ($6 billion), lower-income Medicaid funding ($101 billion), and low-income assistance ($48

billion).2 The striking features of this legislation have been its scale, clearly the largest fiscal

stimulus since the Great Depression, and its reliance upon intergovernmental transfers to state and

local governments for implementing central government fiscal policy.

       Lying behind ARRA are the implicit assumptions that fiscal policies can stimulate job

growth during recessions, that state fiscal policies alone are not up to the task and thus federal

policies are needed, and that intergovernmental transfers to state and local governments can

therefore be an important component of any central government’s stimulus package. This has been

the received wisdom in the scholarly and policy literature on the design of fiscal policy in economic

unions, at least since the foundational writings of Richard Musgrave (1959) and Wallace Oates

(1972).3 There have been few empirical tests of these propositions, however, with the exception of

important early work by Edward Gramlich (1978, 1979). And Gramlich was skeptical, finding the

federal efforts to escape the 1976 recession with grants to states were too little and too late. ARRA

funding has provided scholars with another opportunity to evaluate the stimulus impact of

intergovernmental aid, and the results are more encouraging; see Wilson (2012), Feyrer and

Sacerdote (2011), and Chodorow-Reich et al. (2012). These studies relate changes in state or county

employment one year after the passage of ARRA to the level of ARRA transfers received by the

coincident state or local government, or their contractors, in the previous fiscal year. Each study

finds a significant positive impact on local private and public employment, with the strongest effects

coming from ARRA support for state Medicaid payments.

        These new results are valuable, but they leave three important questions unanswered. First,

while there are measured gains for the local economy receiving assistance, might they come at the

expense of, or alternatively might they enhance, the job or income gains of neighboring economies?

Specifically, how do these gains aggregate? Second, the local economy studies have (so far) only

been used to reveal economic changes for, at most, one year after ARRA spending. We still need

         Musgrave, in his classic treatise on public finance, devotes one paragraph to the question of states
and macroeconomic stabilization (1959, pp. 181-182). He begins, and concludes, his discussion as follows:

        While some degree of coordination may be attained between the levels (of government), the
        compensatory function must be coordinated for the nation as a whole, and this requires
        central action. . . . The objectives of the Distribution and Stabilization Branches . . . require
        primary responsibility at the central level.

                                                       2
to know: How long will the stimulus effects last? Third, the local impact studies estimate the effects

of ARRA spending as it is spent, but federal aid is fungible; see Craig and Inman (1982) generally

and Conley and Dupor (2013) for ARRA. Might state and local governments have saved ARRA

funds for spending after the recession had subsided or might ARRA aid been used to replace states’

own planned spending or tax relief? This paper seeks to provide answers to these three questions.

Our results suggest ARRA policies might have been re-designed to provide a significantly larger

impact on national economic growth following the Great Recession.

       In Section II we address the original Musgrave-Oates conjecture that state government

stimulus policies, say through increased current debt to finance state spending or tax relief, cannot

significantly influence their small, and economically open, economies. Any fiscal stimulus by a

single state will lead to higher demands for imports from other states and thus the main beneficiaries

will be firms and workers in these other states. Even if new job opportunities are created within the

state, federal economies permit unemployed workers from other states to relocate and compete with

original state residents for the state’s new employment opportunities. Either way, the economic

benefits of the fiscal stimulus will be shared with residents outside the state. Since the bulk of the

cost of the fiscal stimulus will be born largely by current state residents through higher future taxes

to repay the current deficit, states may be reluctant to adopt their own stimulus policies. As a result

of these fiscal spillovers, Musgrave and Oates conclude that only the national government can

efficiently manage stimulative fiscal policies during times of recessions. We summarize work

originally presented in Carlino and Inman (2013) that presents an empirical test of the Musgrave-

Oates conjecture for the US economy. We find significant fiscal spillovers, suggesting possible

advantages using central government fiscal policies.


                                                  3
       In Section III we examine the potential effectiveness of nationally administered fiscal

policies for stimulating aggregate income growth and new job opportunities. The analysis stresses

the importance in federal economies of state governments for implementing stimulative fiscal

policies. By design, national fiscal policies in normal times focus on providing national defense and

national social insurance. State and local governments are the primary providers of infrastructure,

education, and police and fire protection. In the US federal system, the states are also the primary

providers of low income protection and health insurance. Thus in times of recessions, it will be state

governments who make the final decisions on spending for public goods and services and (in the

US) for transfers and health coverage to lower income households. If the national government wants

to finance a coordinated fiscal strategy for stimulating the national economy, it must consider

explicitly how its policies impact the spending and tax decisions of its state and local governments.

The national fiscal policy that most directly impacts the fiscal decisions of the state and local sector

are intergovernmental transfers, exactly the policy that assumed such a central role in the

implementation of ARRA. Section III provides this analysis.

       In Section IV we provide a micro-econometric foundation for the aggregate results reported

in Section III. Here we specify and estimate a budgetary model of state government spending,

taxation, and borrowing for the 48 mainland state for the sample period, 1979 to 2010 to highlight

the full budgetary effects, both in the current and future fiscal years, of exogenous changes in federal

to state aid. The resulting micro-econometric estimates of how states allocate federal aid are shown

to be consistent with the observed macro-econometric estimates in Section III for how federal aid

impacts the aggregate economy.

       In Section V we use our macro-econometric estimates of the impact of federal spending,


                                                   4
federal tax relief, and federal intergovernmental aid to simulate the effects of each fiscal policy on

the private economy to provide a comparative analysis of policy effectiveness. We estimate that

the combination of policies included in ARRA was not as effective as it might have been. A

different mix of fiscal policies, one emphasizing direct tax relief and intergovernmental transfers to

states for lower income assistance, is shown to have a significantly larger stimulus impact than the

policy mix chosen by ARRA.

       Section VI concludes our analysis.



II. Can State Deficits Influence State Economies?

       A. State Deficits: In Carlino and Inman (2013) we test for the impact of state government

deficits on job growth in the state’s, and in surrounding states’, economies to evaluate the relevance

of the Musgrave-Oates conjecture. We do so by regressing the annual rate of growth in each state’s

jobs and state population on an all-inclusive measure of each state’s own deficit lagged one year.

For this analysis, the state’s own deficit is defined as its aggregate “cash flow” deficit across all

state funds, equal to aggregate state own expenditures minus aggregate state own revenues.

Included in aggregate own expenditures are spending for current goods and services plus aid to local

governments, capital spending for infrastructures, state pension benefit spending, and state spending

for unemployment insurance and workmen’s compensation. Included in aggregate state own

revenues are state tax and fees, state and local employee contributions into the state pension plan,

and employee and employer contributions into the unemployment and workmen’s compensation

trust funds. This aggregate cash flow deficit is financed by short-term and long-term borrowing and




                                                  5
by drawing down cash holdings in state savings, trust fund, and pension accounts. 4 Importantly,

states with effective balanced budget rules for the state’s general fund deficit can still run significant

aggregate state deficits for purposes of stimulating the state’s aggregate economy. Excluded from

the state’s own deficit are revenues from federal aid.

        Figure 1(a and b) shows the historical pattern of all states’ own deficits (dashed line) and all

states’ total deficits (solid line) equal to own deficits plus federal exogenous aid; both deficits are

measured in 2004 dollars. Own deficits are always positive – that is, a deficit – while total deficits

are generally negative – that is, a surplus – as federal aid fills the gap between total state spending

and state own revenues.

        B. The Impact of State Deficits on the State Economy: Our analysis focuses on the impact

of the state’s own deficit on state job growth ( N ) and population growth ( H ) specified as.

                 ( N , H ) = f(OwnD(-1), ZAid(-1), Spillovers; Controls) + υst,             (1)

where OwnD(-1) is the state’s own cash flow deficit lagged one fiscal year, ZAid(-1) is

unconstrained (“revenue-sharing”) federal aid to the state lagged one fiscal year, Spillovers is our

measure of inter-state fiscal spillovers defined below, and Controls is a vector of additional variables

added to the estimation equation to control for a variety of non-fiscal determinants of state job and

population growth.5 The regressions’ error terms are specified as υst = vt + vs + vst, with year (vt)

        4
            Since future taxes will be needed to repay each of the fund borrowing, there is a reduction in state
taxpayers’ future wealth. Residents may therefore try to replace the decline in public wealth with an increase
in their private wealth by saving more, perhaps from the tax cuts or spending increases from the deficit
financed stimulus, an outcome known as Ricardian Equivalence; see Barro (1974). If so, the stimulus effect
of the initial deficits will be reduced. The results we present here are the combined (“reduced form”) effects
of the initial income and future wealth effects of deficit financing.
        5
          Unfortunately, the definition and measurement of state incomes changes over our sample period.
Thus we focused on job and population growth as our dependent variables. Included in the vector of Controls
are lagged values of the spillover variables as a control for shocks to “neighboring” economies, changes in

                                                       6
fixed effects to control for common changes in aggregate demand and interest rates and state fixed

effects (vs) to control for stable state amenities, state political and legal environments, and the land

area of each state. Our estimation strategy corrects for serial correlation and heteroscedasticity in

vst.

        Our preferred measure for interstate economic spillovers, Spillovers, is based upon Crone’s

(2004) definition of economic clusters. Crone groups the 48 mainland states into eight economic

clusters that share common business cycle patterns; see Table 1. The advantage of Crone’s grouping

of economic neighbors is that it allows both for supply linkages between the states for intermediate

goods and for final demand linkages between states as households shop across borders.6                     The

variable Spillovers is specified separately for each state’s growth in jobs and population as the job

and population growth, respectively, in each state’s economic neighbors, with the growth rates

weighted by the historic share of each state in the cluster’s total excluding the “home” state.

        The sample includes the 48 mainland states and the period is from 1973-2009 with all fiscal

variables measured in real (2004) dollars per capita. State job and population growth rates are both

stationary as confirmed by the Im-Persaran-Shin (2003) test for stationarity in panel data allowing

for unit roots to differ across states. Stationarity of the dependent variables is required for the



world energy prices interacted with whether the state is an energy-producing state, and changes in state
productivity as measured from the state production function for manufacturing. Other within-state year
controls generally found to be statistically insignificant and therefore excluded from our final results include
decade-to-decade changes in the level of advanced education in the state (percent with college degrees or
more) and in state urbanization (percent of population living in urban areas); losses from major natural
disasters thought to impact the state economy; oil price changes interacted with whether the state could be
considered a major consumer of energy; and population weighted changes in OwnD(-1) of the other states
in each state’s economic region as a control for potential fiscal competition among economic neighbors.
Finally, controlling for region-wide fixed effects had no statistically significant effect on our results.

           For evidence that the Crone economic clusters capture most of the important economic spillovers
across state economies, see Bronars and Jansen (1987).

estimated coefficients to reveal a structural relationship between own deficits and growth rates.

       To correct for the possible endogeneity of state own deficits in the growth equations we use

the value of this variable lagged from four to six years as an instrument to predict OwnD(-1). The

identifying assumptions are first, that deficit changes from fiscal choices made in preceding

legislative regimes have an institutional persistence helping to predict current own deficits, and that,

those lagged deficit changes are not correlated with the current growth performance of the state

except through their impact on current own deficits. An F test for the predictive power of the

instruments exceeds 10, suggesting strong instruments. Exclusion tests that the instruments are not

correlated with current state job or population growth cannot reject the null hypothesis that exclusion

is appropriate.

       Final estimation uses the first differences of the growth rates as our dependent variable as

recommended by Caselli, et. al. (1996). But because we also include lagged growth rates in our

estimated equation, the error term of the differenced equation is likely to be correlated with the

differences of the lagged growth rates. This will lead to biased coefficient estimates for the dynamic

effects of fiscal policy on job and population growth. Thus we will need instruments for the lagged

dependent variables. We adopt the estimation approach of Holtz-Eakin, et. al. (1988) using four or

more year lags of the dependent variables as instruments; Arellano-Bond (1991) tests confirmed the

appropriateness of our choice for lags.

       C. Results: What did we find? The full details of the estimated job and population growth

equations are provided in Carlino and Inman (2013); we summarize the main conclusions here.

Figure 2 summarizes our estimated impact of state own deficits on state job growth. The solid line

shows the estimated percentage change in job growth over time for a state with respect to a one-


                                                   8
time, one percentage increase in the state’s own deficit. The estimated effect after the first year of

a one percent increase in the deficit is an increase in the rate of job growth by one percent; the

estimated effect is statistically different from zero at the 95 percent confidence level.7 The positive

job impact of a current period deficit disappears by the second year, however, suggesting that the

deficits were financing current consumption and a temporary expansion of state aggregate demand

rather than new infrastructure and a supply side improvement in future state productivity. In the

longer run, eleven years after the initial increase in state deficits, the rate of state job growth

declines. Why? That is when state debts must be repaid by running a positive state surplus on the

current accounts. Just as state deficits can stimulate initial job growth, when those deficit must be

repaid by later surpluses, job growth declines.

        When we decomposed the source of the state deficit into tax cuts or spending increases, the

strongest and statistically most important determinant of positive job growth are aggregate state tax

cuts. Spending increases do improve job growth but the estimated effects are never statistically

significant. Unconstrained federal aid to the states, ZAid(-1), is never a significant determinant of

state job growth. The strong positive effect of tax cuts and the weak effect of unconstrained federal

aid is confirmed in our analysis of the macro-economic economy as well.

        The effect of state own deficits on the rate of growth of state population from net migration



        7
           These percentages changes translate directly into new jobs. Suppose a state doubles its own state
deficits from the current state mean of $390/person to $780/person, an increase of $390/person. This 100
percent increase in deficits means a 100 percent increase in the state’s rate of job growth. The average rate
of job growth in the most recent sample years is .012 per annum. Thus the job growth rate increases to .024,
or an improvement in growth of .012. Again for recent years, the typical state has 2.8 million jobs. Thus the
increase of .012 in job growth means an additional 34,000 jobs (= 2.8 million x .012). We can compute the
deficit cost per job as total deficits divided by new jobs. The average state’s population is 6.25 million
residents, so the total cost of the deficit stimulus will be $2.44 billion (• $390/person x 6.25 million
residents). The deficit cost per job will therefore be $71,800 per job (• $2.44 billion/34,000 jobs).

                                                     9
is positive, but small in magnitude and only marginally significant statistically. This makes sense

if the state job gains are temporary as shown in Figure 2. Further we find no significant impact of

state own deficits on the state’s rate of unemployment. But jobs have increased. The constant rate

of unemployment must mean that new workers are entering the labor force at the same rate that new

jobs are created. The small effect of deficits on the rate of in-migration must mean that most of the

new workers are current state residents leaving “home production” and re-entering the labor force.

In Carlino and Inman (2013), we estimate that for a typical state, a 1 standard deviation increase in

the state’s own deficit – $390/resident – will add 34,000 new jobs within a year (a 1.2% increase),

and that 27,000 of those jobs will be filled by state residents and 7,000 filled by in-migrants from

other states. For our typical state with 6.25 million residents, this means an aggregate deficit cost

of $2.44 billion. This $2.44 billion has created 34,000 new jobs. The implied present value cost per

job to an average state’s residents is therefore $71,800 per job.8

        Importantly, there are significant spillover effects from an increase in one state’s own deficits

onto job growth in the other states included in its economic cluster as defined by Crone. To control

for common shocks to the set of states within a cluster we also include in all our regressions year

fixed effects and oil price shocks. We estimate that job growth in the other states of an economic

cluster will increase a state’s own job growth one year later. The implied cross-state job elasticity

is .6 – that is, a 1 percent increase in the combined rate of job growth in all of a state’s cluster will

increase the rate of job growth within the state by 6/10's of 1 percent. The estimated spillover effect

is strongly statistically significant at a 99 percent level of confidence.

        Based on these estimates, Table 2 provides summary estimates for the impact of a state’s


        8
            See fn. 7 above.

                                                   10
own deficit on jobs within the state, and in its economic neighbors in its cluster, one year after the

deficit increase. The increase in the state’s deficit is set equal to $390/resident, a one standard

deviation increase in state own deficits for the national sample. We focus on the largest state in each

of the eight Crone economic clusters; the economic neighbors are the other states within the cluster.

This $390/person deficit ranges from 6 percent to as much as 15 percent of each of the largest state’s

own fund revenues in FY 2008 and implies a sizeable increase in state spending and transfers or a

significant reduction in state taxes and fees. Projected job impacts are estimated to occur over

calendar year 2009.9 There is no evidence of significant job creation after the first year following

the temporary increase in state own deficits; see Figure 2.

        Three alternative simulations are presented in Table 2. The upper panel illustrates the impact

on state jobs of a deficit increase in the region’s largest state alone, with no new deficits by its

economic neighbors. The middle panel shows the impact of deficits by all other states in the cluster,

except the largest state. These two panels illustrate the potential spillovers across states, first from

the largest state to its neighbors and then from the neighbors to the largest state. The lower panel

shows the increase in cluster jobs if all states in the cluster agree to cooperate in a common policy

where each state increases its own deficit by $390/person.

        The $390/person deficit is estimated to add 1.1 percent to the deficit state’s rate of job

growth, which leads in turn to the change in total jobs computed as the 1.1 percent times the actual

level of employment in each state in 2009. The job growth in the deficit state then spills over into


        9
          Table 2 shows the ability of state deficits to create state jobs and in process reveals the temptation
that governors may face to deficit finance state budgets. Particularly so, since any adverse effects of deficit
financing on job creation only occur when the deficits are repaid; see Figure 2. Herein lies a reason for state
balanced budget rules and state rainy day funds. An accumulated rainy day fund ranging from 6 percent
(Massachusetts) to perhaps 15 percent (Florida) of own state revenues would be sufficient to finance a
$390/resident deficit in a current year’s budget and to thus provide the job increases seen in Table 2.

                                                      11
neighboring states through changes in the growth of the cluster’s jobs. This change, which varies

by each state within the cluster, allows a prediction of new job growth and thus new jobs in each

neighboring state. Those new jobs in all states within the cluster are then summed to provide an

estimate of the overall level of job spillovers. Finally, the large state’s own jobs and the spillover

jobs are summed to give the total jobs created in the cluster from the increase in the own deficit of

the largest state. Also reported (within parentheses) is the deficit cost per job created defined as the

increase in the total own deficit in the largest state divided by jobs created.

        The second panel shows jobs created and the deficit cost/job from increasing deficits in each

cluster’s smaller states, without increasing deficits in the largest state. Estimation of job creation

in this case is state by state, allowing for each state to have a spillover effect on all its neighbors.

Here the large state is the recipient of jobs created by its smaller economic neighbors. Finally, the

third panel aggregates the results of the upper two panels to show the impact on total jobs within

each cluster, and the average tax cost/job if all states agreed to jointly increase their deficits by

$390/person.10

        Four conclusions are evident from Table 2. First, own state deficits can create new jobs

within the deficit state. The deficit cost/job created in the state running the deficit ranges from

$72,000 per job in Massachusetts to $91,000 per job in California. These job cost estimates are

comparable to those obtained by the recent evaluative literature of the one year impact of the

American Reinvestment and Recovery Act’s fiscal assistance to SL governments on local job



        10
           The job estimates here are only for the impacts after the first year, and do not allow for any effects
of spillover jobs back onto the economy of the original deficit state. First, the effects of own state deficits
on own state jobs is never statistically significant after the first year. Second, Carlino and Inman (2013)
found no effect of a second period lagged spillover on own state jobs. We are confident that the results in
Table 2 capture most of the important job effects of state own deficits.

growth; see Feyrer and Sacerdote (2011) and Wilson (2012).

        Second, there are quantitatively significant aggregate job spillovers onto neighboring states

within each cluster for relatively large (10 percent or so) increases in the large state’s deficits.11 The

fiscal costs to the neighboring states of these new jobs is $0/job. These spillover benefits create a

strong incentive for the other states within a cluster to free-ride on the large state’s deficit policies.

For comparable deficit levels, very large states can often create more jobs for their neighbors than

the neighbors can create for themselves. For example, in the Far West cluster, the job spillovers

from California deficits (108,561) exceeds its neighbors’ own job creation (90,301) for equal new

deficits; the Far West column in Table 2.

        Third, the potential incentive to free-ride runs in both directions. If the largest state’s

neighbors were to collectively increase their deficits, but the large state did not, then the large state

would receive the spillover jobs. For example, if Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington were

to each increase their deficits by $390/person, California is estimated to receive 43,800 free,

spillover jobs; again, see the Far West column of Table 2. With significant spillovers, all states

may choose to “sit on their hands,” hoping that the other states in their cluster will run deficits in

times of recessions. Or if each state does choose to run a deficit to create jobs within their own state

– as would occur if the state benefits of a new job exceed the state’s own deficit cost/job – there will

likely be a downward bias in each state’s deficit behavior as they would ignore the social benefits

of the spillover jobs created by their own deficits. The resulting equilibrium of such state deficit

behaviors may be no expansionary deficits at all, or positive but still too little deficit financing.


        11
            Recent research, by Beetsma and Giuliodori (2011), Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2013), and
Hebous and Zimmermann (2013) studying aggregate interdependencies among EU economies also find
significant job and income spillovers across economic neighbors from country deficit fiscal policies.

                                                   13
        Finally, the lower panel of Table 2 shows the gains in job creation of a cooperative deficit

policy when all states in the economic cluster run a common $390/person deficit. Total jobs created

will be the sum of total jobs created in the first and second panels when the two sets of governments

operated independently. The deficit cost per job for all residents in the economic cluster will be the

weighted average cost/job after allowing for spillovers. Under a cooperative policy the deficit

cost/job is significantly lower than if each state, or set of states, operated independently.               For

example, in the Far West cluster the “private” deficit cost/job to California is $90,956 per job and

that for the four smaller states is $84,234 per job. But cooperating, so that all five states provide a

$390/person “job-creating deficit,” and allowing for job spillovers, reduces the deficit cost per job

to $52,532. A deficit policy that may not have been attractive for any one state may become

attractive when all states agree to cooperate and collectively share the deficit costs of job creation.12

If so, then there is an argument for centralizing stabilization fiscal policy at the level of a national

government.      By this analysis, the Musgrave-Oates conjecture is correct. The question then

becomes: How should we manage a central government deficit policy to best stimulate aggregate

job creation in a federal economic union?




        12
            Though that decision must ultimately rest on a comparison of the social benefits of job creation
to the social costs of the increase in state own deficits. Whether the benefits of a created job exceed estimated
costs remains an open question. For example, as part of an effort to understand fluctuations in employment
rates, Hall and Milgrom (2008, Table 2) estimate the annual (flow) benefits of job search and/or home
production to a risk-neutral worker of remaining unemployed is 70 percent of the overall gain in added
output. The net social surplus of moving from unemployed to employed would therefore be 30 percent of
the worker’s added output. It is this net output benefit from job gains today offset by any discounted future
job losses that should be compared to the present value of all taxes (including their excess burdens) needed
to finance today’s increase in state own deficits.

III. Macroeconomic Policy in Economic Unions: The Role of Federal Aid

        A. Role of Federal Aid in the US Economy: Economic unions bring together member

countries and territories for the efficient provision of public goods and services. The union’s central

government is to take advantage of economies of scale in production and in risk pooling for large

and common economic shocks by providing national defense, by regulating markets and a common

currency, and by insuring all citizens against common economic, health, and disaster risks. The

union’s state and local governments (hereafter, the SL sector) are to provide those goods and

services were such economies are not decisive, for example, education, police and fire protection,

health care, environmental quality, transportation, and (perhaps above a national minimum) income

support for disadvantaged citizens. This division of responsibility, rational as it is for the financing

and provision of public services, creates a potential problem for the central government’s

management of macroeconomic fiscal policy. If the central government wishes to stimulate the

aggregate union-wide economy, but much of what government does is being financed and allocated

by lower-tier governments, then there may be inadequate policy tools at the level of the central

government for coordinated macroeconomic fiscal policy. One tool that is available is the central

government’s tax and transfer policy, and an important component of that policy are transfers to the

SL sector.13

        That such federal assistance to SL governments has become an important part of US national

fiscal policy is evident from Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 shows the time pattern of total federal aid per



        13
            There is a rich theory for why such transfers to lower-tier governments may be needed for the
efficient financing and provision of SL local public services; see Boadway and Shah (2009; Part II). The
importance of such transfers for macroeconomic policy was initially argued for by Heller (1966, Chapter 3)
and became the basis for the federal policy known as General Revenue Sharing, passed in 1972 (Reischauer,
1975).

                                                   15
capita (denoted as A) and what we will call federal project aid per capita (denoted as AP), and

federal welfare aid per capita (denoted as AW) over the postwar period 1947:1 to 2010:3, each

measured in 2005 dollars: A = AP + AW. This division of total intergovernmental aid into its two

components will prove important to our understanding as to how such fiscal transfers impact the

aggregate economy. By design, project aid can be spent at the full discretion of the state or local

government, known as aid “fungibility,” and is typically allocated to providing public services.

Welfare aid is targeted to income support or services for lower income households and is only paid

during the fiscal year after such expenditures have been incurred.14

        Real federal aid per capita has risen from $47/person in 1947 to $1,787/person in 2009:1,

the last date before the implementation of President Obama’s ARRA fiscal stimulus; see Figure 3.

For comparison, Figure 4 shows the time path of federal purchases of goods and services (denoted

as G) and of federal net revenues defined as taxes paid by household and firms less direct transfers

to household and firms (denoted as R).        Federal project aid as a share of federal government

spending for goods and services has grown from 2 percent in 1947 to over 11 percent by 2008 before

ARRA to 14 percent including ARRA assistance. Including federal welfare aid in total federal

purchases and intergovernmental transfers raises total aid’s share of such spending to 23 percent



        14
            General revenue sharing/project aid (AP) includes general revenue sharing, elementary and
secondary education aid, model cities and urban renewal aid, transportation aid, all federal aid programs
meant to assist SL government finances after recessions (including ARRA’s “stability aid”), and tobacco
settlement payments. The tobacco settlement payments are viewed as de facto “federal aid” financed by a
“tax” on tobacco companies; see Singhal (2008). The two federal aid programs included in welfare aid (AW)
are Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Medicaid. When measuring AP and AW we
specifically allow for the change in funding structure under the Personal Responsibility and Work
Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA). PRWORA transformed funding for public welfare
from a matching aid program – Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) – to an unconstrained,
lump-sum transfer – Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). When specifying AW and AP we
remove AFDC spending from AW in 1998 and add TANF spending to AP in 1998.

                                                   16
before ARRA and to 27 percent including ARRA. Federal aid to SL governments has become an

important aggregate fiscal policy, and thus an eligible policy instrument for stimulating the

aggregate economy. But is it effective?

       B. Estimating Aid’s Impact on the Private Economy: We provide an evaluation of the

effectiveness of aggregate fiscal policy, including federal aid, using structural vector autoregression

analysis (SVAR) as pioneered by Blanchard and Perotti (2002), estimated for the US economy for

the time period 1960:1 to 2010:3. The analysis begins with the estimation of a reduced form VAR

specified as:

          Zt = C(L)CZt-1 + ut, where ZtN = [rt, gt, at, yt] and utN = [urt, ugt, uat, uyt],    (2)

where the vector Zt includes rr as the log of federal net revenues defined as federal taxes net of

transfers to households and firms (R), gt as the log of federal government purchases (G), at as the

log of total federal aid to the SL sector (A), and yt as the log of GDP (Y), each measured at quarterly

intervals and in 2005 dollars per capita. Also included in the initial VAR are the trend variables

time and time squared, and an indicator variable for “deep recessions” (= 1, if the national rate of

unemployment exceeds 8 percent).

       As in Blanchard and Perotti, the lag structure C(L) is a 4 x 4 matrix of three-quarter

distributed lag polynomials, and the vector utN = [urt, ugt, uat, uyt] is a 4 x 1 vector of reduced form

residuals. The reduced form residuals for policy in each quarter are the result of truly exogenous,

or structural, shocks to policy plus contemporaneous (within quarter) changes in policy because of

reduced form shocks to aggregate GDP. Contemporaneous changes in policy because of unspecified

shocks to income are known as automatic stabilizers, where urt is (estimated to be) positively related

to uyt because federal net revenues are progressive, ugt is (assumed to be) unrelated to changes in uyt


                                                     17
within the current quarter because of administrative rules for government purchases of goods and

services, and uat is (estimated to be) negatively related to changes in uyt because such assistance

serves as fiscal insurance for the SL sector. By knowing values for the automatic stabilizers we can

then estimate the truly exogenous shocks to policy from the reduced form residuals. Finally, given

exogenous policy shocks, we can compute the impact of each fiscal policy on income and each

policy’s associated income multipliers. A Technical Appendix provides the full details of the

estimation procedure.

        Our analysis above follows that of Blanchard and Perotti (2002) with one important

difference. In contrast to their analysis which specifies federal net revenues as federal taxes less

transfers to households and firms and transfers to SL governments (R - A), we separate net revenues

into the two fiscal policies: Taxes less transfers to household and firms (R) and transfers to the SL

sector (A). In so doing, we drop the assumption implicit in the specification of Blanchard and

Perotti that SL public officials allocate transfers to government just as would household and firms

– that is, that elected officials are perfect agents for the households and firms they represent. The

vast literature finding a “flypaper effect” to such assistance strongly rejects this assumption; see

Inman (2009). Federal aid to the SL sector must be included as a separate fiscal policy. A failure

to do so leaves a potentially important gap in our understanding of macroeconomic fiscal policy in

a federal economy, one that was particularly evident at the time of the passage of ARRA.15 Tables

3 and 4 present our results. Table 5 examines the sensitivity of our conclusions to alternative


        15
           At the time of congressional deliberations over ARRA, there were no accepted estimates as to how
the SL sector would react to increases in intergovernmental aid nor how such aid would impact the private
economy. As a result The Council of Economic Advisors (Romer and Bernstein, 2009) and the
Congressional Budget Office (CBO Report, 2010) were forced to rely upon estimates of household behavior
for how the SL sector would spend their stimulus money and upon estimates of federal spending and tax cut
multipliers for how SL government spending and tax cuts would impact the private economy.

identification assumptions.16

        C. Results: Table 3 presents our estimates of fiscal multipliers for the original three variable

SVAR of Blanchard and Perotti and for our four variable extension with separate estimates for a

federal aid multiplier. The estimated impact on GDP of each fiscal policy are reported by quarters

for up to 5 years (20 quarters). The multipliers give the increase in GDP for a one-time, $1 increase

in each policy; one standard deviation (68 percent) confidence intervals are reported within

parentheses, and an asterisk indicates when the estimated effect is significantly different from zero

at a 95 percent level of confidence. All multipliers are evaluated at sample means for the fiscal

variable and GDP. Cols. (1)-(4) provide estimates for Blanchard-Perotti’s original analysis, first for

the full sample of observations from 1947:1 to 2010:3, and then for the sample of years beginning

in 1960. Blanchard and Perotti were concerned that the 1950's represented a unique period for the

US economy as it rebounded from WWII and therefore focused their primary analysis on the period

beginning 1960:1. We follow their lead but extend their analysis from their last observation of

1997:4 to 2010:3.

        Table 3 shows unanticipated shocks in federal government spending and federal net revenues

also net of transfers to SL governments (R - A) can have quantitatively and statistically significant

positive impacts on the growth of GDP. A one time increase in G of $1 can increase GDP by $.94

on impact and provide a $.77 gain after the first year of the initial stimulus. A one-time $1 cut in



        16
            Our decision to adopt the SVAR approach to policy identification has been dictated by the
limitations in available data on intergovernmental transfers to the SL sector. The alternative approach to
policy identification, known as “narrative” analysis, is not available because of the limited number of
narrative events for welfare aid; see see Carlino and Inman (2014). Table 5, however, presents a variety of
robustness checks using the Blanchard-Perotti approach, and all of these results are very similar to the
estimated fiscal multipliers obtained using the narrative approach; see Ramey (2011), Romer and Romer
(2010), and Mertens and Ravn (2014).

                                                    19
(R - A) may have an even larger impact, increasing GDP by nearly $2 by the end of first year and

continuing to impact the economy by as much as $1.20 into a second year; Table 3, cols. (1) and (2).

These results remain for the analysis for the period after 1960:1; Table 3, cols. (3) and (4). Our

estimates here are broadly similar in magnitude and in timing to those of the original Blanchard-

Perotti analysis (2002, Tables III and IV). The one significant difference is the larger fiscal

multiplier for net revenues (also net of SL transfers); our estimates are close to -2.0 while their

estimates range from -.70 to - 1.32.

       Table 3 cols. (5) - (7) report our new results where federal net revenues are now defined as

only net of transfers to household and firms (R), while transfers to SL governments (A) are separated

out to test for their own impact on the private economy. The resulting four variable SVAR provides

separate estimates for the multiplier effects of R, G, and A on GDP. Now the multiplier impact of

a $1 cut in household and firms net revenues is $2.80 on impact, $3.30 after one year, $2.20 after

two years, and even as much as $1.50 three years later; Table 3, col. (5). These large net revenue

multipliers are confirmed throughout our analysis and are consistent with recent work of Romer and

Romer (2010) and Mertens and Ravn (2014) who, as here, focus on the impacts of taxes and

transfers to households and firms only. The impact of a one-time $1 increase in G on GDP is now

no more than $.56 on impact and never statistically significant thereafter; Table 3, col. (6). This

weak impact of direct federal government purchases on the private economy is consistent across all

our four variable SVAR estimates and with other recent estimates for the federal purchase

multiplier; see Barro and Redlick (2011) and the overview provided by Ramey (2011).

       Importantly, federal transfers to the SL sector are seen to have their own impact on private

incomes, distinct from that of transfers to households and firms. The multiplier for a one-time $1


                                                 20
increase in A is $.53 on impact, $.71 after one year, $.50 after two years, and still adding to GDP

growth by $.36 three years later; Table 3, col. (7). All impacts are statistically significant at the 95

level of confidence.17

        The important lesson here is that increased federal aid to the SL sector cannot be viewed as

having an identical impact on the private economy as either direct transfers to households and firms

or as direct federal government purchases of goods and services. Federal aid must be treated as its

own policy, not a surprising conclusion once we recognize that the intergovernmental transfers go

to elected officials not to households and firms and are spent on teachers, police officers, and roads,

not on tanks, planes, and research.

        Table 4 extends our analysis of federal intergovernmental transfers by disaggregating total

aid into its two major components, general revenue sharing and project (“shovel ready”) aid (AP)

and targeted welfare aid to fund SL transfers and services to lower income households (AW).

Project aid includes general revenue sharing, elementary and secondary education aid, model cities

and urban renewal aid, transportation and highway aid, and tobacco settlement payments.18 Also

included as part of AP beginning in 2009:1are the ARRA stimulus grants for education (called

“stability” aid), aid for transportation and highways, and miscellaneous assistance for many smaller

state programs. The two federal aid programs included in welfare aid (AW) are Aid to Families with


        17
           It is instructive to note that the estimated multipliers from the Blanchard-Perotti specification for
net revenues inclusive of federal transfers to the SL sector, R - A, is essentially a weighted average of the
separate multipliers for net revenues from households and firms and that for federal intergovernmental aid.
From Figures 3 and 4 federal net revenues to household and firms averages about $2000 per person over our
sample period and transfers to SL governments about $1000 per person. Weighting the multipliers for R in
Table 3, col. (5) by 2/3's and those for A in Table (3), col. (7) by 1/3 approximates the multipliers for the
combined net revenue variable, R - A, reported in Table 3, col. (3).
        18
          The tobacco settlement payments can be viewed as de facto “federal aid” financed by a “tax” on
tobacco companies; see Singhal (2008).

                                                      21
Dependent Children (AFDC) and Medicaid. When measuring AP and AW we allow for the change

in the funding structure of this assistance under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity

Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA). PRWORA transformed AFDC funding from a targeted

matching grant to an unconstrained, lump-sum transfer known as Temporary Assistance for Needy

Families (TANF). We remove AFDC from AW beginning in 1998 and add the new TANF funding

to AP. The increase in Medicaid assistance under ARRA is included in AW, again beginning in

2009:1. The SVAR estimation now involves five variables, R, G, AP, AW, and Y; see the Technical

Appendix for details. Table 4 presents our results for disaggregated intergovernmental aid.

       The estimated multipliers for a one-time $1 increase in federal net revenues from households

and firms (R) and federal purchases (G) are comparable to those reported in Table 3. The impact

of the two forms of federal aid on GDP, however, are significantly different. The multipliers

associated with an innovation in project aid (AP) are initially small, negative, and statistically

significant, then positive thereafter though never statistically significant; see Table 4, col. (3). The

negative effect of AP in the first quarter following the innovation is similar to that found by

Gramlich (1978) in his analysis of the Public Works Employment Act of 1976. There the states

postponed planned construction of state infrastructure in anticipation of receiving federal funding,

but only after federal approval of their planned state projects. When approved, usually with a 3 to

6 month delay, the projects were built. Importantly, though “shovel-ready” the approved projects

were not new projects and did not represent new state spending. Federal AP funds appear to have

substituted for already allocated state revenues. The released state revenues were then allocated

elsewhere in the state budget, perhaps to programs with smaller economic impacts, or used to pay

down debt or even saved; see Section IV.


                                                  22
       Federal aid which does stimulate the private economy is assistance that encourages the

expansion of state transfers to, and provision of services for, lower income households. The

multiplier for one more dollar of AW is large, above 2 at its peak impact, and sustained, lasting up

to three years; see Table 4, col. (4). The estimated impacts of AW on the private economy are all

statistically significant. As we will discover in Section IV, the reasons for AW’s relatively large

impact on the private economy are twofold. First, because AW assistance is paid as a targeted

matching grant, increases in AW directly stimulate new state spending. Second, the new state

spending goes to poor households, either directly as cash transfers or as relief for spending on

medical services. Either way, there is more money in the pockets of lower income households.

Evidence from studies of household behavior is that these lower income households are “credit-

constrained” and the families most likely to spend new cash immediately; see Agarwal, Liu, and

Souleles (2007). Thus there is an immediate and sustained impact on the private economy. We

conclude that if the central government wishes to stimulate the private economy during recessions

using intergovernmental transfers, the most effective policy is matching aid for assistance to lower

income households.

       In Table 5 we present robustness checks of our core SVAR results in Table 4 to alternative

identification strategies, to the inclusion of monetary policy in the vector of policies, and to the

exclusion of the Tobacco Settlement from the list of federal aid programs. Only the results for

federal aid, AP and AW, are reported in the Table 5. (Estimates for multipliers of government

purchases (G) and federal taxes and transfers to households and firms (R) are similar in magnitude

and timing to those reported in Tables 3 and 4.) Table 5, cols. (1) and (2) replace the Blanchard-

Perotti identifying specification for revenue’s automatic stabilizer elasticity with respect to income


                                                 23
of 2.08 with an alternative estimate of 3.0 provided by Mertens and Ravn (2014). With this

adjustment our estimates for the AP and AW multipliers are somewhat smaller than those reported

in Table 4, but the negative impact multiplier for AP assistance in Q1 remains, as do the relatively

larger effects of AW over AP.19 Table 5, cols. (3) and (4) report estimates for an alternative

identifying assumption as to the timing for the impact of federal policies, both upon each other, and

upon GDP. Rather than the initial assumption that federal net revenues pre-determine spending,

here we assume federal spending on purchases and projects (G and AP) pre-determine net revenues

and welfare transfers (R and AW). Again results parallel those in Table 4. Table 5, Cols. (5) and

(6) extend the original five equation SVAR for fiscal policy to now allow for possible confounding

effects of monetary policy; see Rossi and Zubairy (2011). We do so by adding the federal funds rate

and the inflation rate to the analysis as measures of monetary policy. As in Rossi and Zubairy

(2011; Figures 9 and 11), we too find fiscal policy is estimated as less stimulative when monetary

policy is included in the analysis. Monetary policy is less than fully accommodating. But, again

AW is significantly more stimulative than AP assistance. Finally, Table 5, cols. (7) and (8) report

estimates for the restricted sample, 1960:Q1 to 1998:Q3, excluding transfers from the Tobacco

Settlement. Our core results remain in place for this restricted sample as well.

        D. Summary: We conclude, first, that unanticipated increases in federal purchases or tax

relief can stimulate the private economy, and second, that among the available fiscal policies, giving

money to households and firms either directly as tax cuts or indirectly as intergovernmental transfers



        19
           We have also reestimated the core SVAR model setting revenue’s automatic stabilizer with a lower
estimate of 1.6 from Follette and Lutz (2010). With this lower specification, the peak multipliers for AW
is now 2.89, occurring in Q2, and that for AP is .967, also occurring in Q2. Here too we see a statistically
significant, negative impact multiplier (= . -.139) for AP aid. AW aid has a statistically significant effect
on GDP into Q12 (= 1.2) while AP aid has a significant effect until Q8 (= .89).

                                                     24
for lower income transfer and services are the most effective policies. Tax multipliers are - 3 or

larger and the impacts last for up to three years. The multipliers for intergovernmental welfare aid

are always above 1.0, perhaps as large as 2.0, and also continue to impact the private economy for

up to three years after the initial infusion of aid.



IV. States as Agents: Understanding How Federal Aid Impacts the Private Economy

        While informative as to the likely impacts of federal aid on the macroeconomy, the analysis

in Section III leaves unanswered exactly how these transfers might stimulate the private economy,

and in particular, why federal aid for welfare services is so much more effective than federal aid for

state government purchases or tax relief. To shed light on this question, we provide micro-

econometric estimates of state government fiscal behavior in response to intergovernmental

transfers. In short, much of federal project aid (AP) is saved by government and spent only slowly.

Most of welfare aid (AW) is spent within the fiscal year received and is returned to the private

economy as transfers to poor families and or as middle class tax relief.

        A. Specification: To understand how states allocate federal transfers, paid either as project

(AP) or welfare (AW) aid, we specify and estimate a model of state government budgetary behavior

for the 48 mainland states for the years 1979 to 2010. The framework accounts for all state spending

and all state revenues.20 The overall state budget identity is specified by cash flow accounting of

state monies and defined as:

          AP +       (rs - b)   - (gs + k) / SURPLUS = Δc - Δd + Δf                         (3)
        ($504) + ($3063 - $276) - ($3003 + $312) / (-$24) = ($81) - ($55) + (-$50),

           All budgetary data for the analysis are from the Census of Governments, State Government
Finances, various years.

         AP = State project aid per resident;21

         rs =   State revenues per resident defined as all state taxes plus charges and
                fees plus miscellaneous revenues plus profits from state-run utilities

                minus federal aid for welfare and Medicaid: b = B - AW, where AW
                equals the federal matching rate for welfare and Medicaid spending
                times B (AW = mCB), or b = (1 - m)CB;

Project aid (AP) enters the budget identify directly, while welfare aid (AW) is a per dollar subsidy

           All federal programs included in AP for the aggregate analysis of aid are included here for our
state analysis as well; see fn. 14.

families (B). The net cost of welfare spending – b = (1 - m)CB = B - AW – is what must be paid

from the state’s own revenues.

        The LHS of Eq. (3) reports all revenues received by the state less all spending by the state.

The difference defines the cash flow surplus ( SURPLUS > 0) or deficit (SURPLUS < 0) in each

fiscal year. Over our sample period, the average SURPLUS indicates a small average deficit of (-)

$24 per resident, but the standard deviation of SURPLUS is $263 reflecting the cyclical sensitivity

of state fiscal fortunes over our sample period.22 The RHS of Eq. (3) shows where the dollars go

when there is a positive cash flow, or where the dollars come from when there is a negative cash

flow. When there is a positive surplus, extra funds can be saved (Δc > 0), used to repay outstanding

short- and long-term debt (Δd < 0) or be put into insurance trust funds (Δf > 0). When there is a

deficit then savings must be reduced (Δc < 0 or Δf < 0) or short- or long-term government debt must

be increased (Δd > 0).

        To understand how states allocate an extra dollar of project aid or welfare aid across rs, b,

gs, k, Δc, Δd, and Δf, we specify and estimate a behavioral budget model of state finances, specified

generally as:

                (rs, b, gs, k, Δc, Δd, Δf) = f(AP,1 - m; I, é; c-1; X) + (vt + vs + vst),              (4)

where each of the state fiscal choices is determined by a common set of federal aid policies (AP, (1-

m)), the state’s economic environment (mean household income, I, and unanticipated shocks to the

state’s unemployment rate, é),23 the state’s lagged rainy day fund (c-1), and a set (X) of political,


        22
           SURPLUS reported here is the negative of what is reported as the Total Deficit in Figure 1, and
is the annual average over the path of the dark line beyond 1979. The cyclicality of aggregate state deficits
and surpluses is evident in Figure 1.
        23
           Measured as the residual of a regression of the state’s current level of unemployment on lags of
three years of the state unemployment rate. A separate regression is run for each state.

                                                     27
institutional, economic, and natural disaster controls. The specification treats all fiscal outcomes

as jointly determined in response to exogenous changes in the national policy and the state’s

economic and political environments. Eq. (4) is estimated as a linear expenditure system for all

fiscal variables and imposes an adding-up constraint on the impact of each exogenous variable on

fiscal outcomes.

        Included in X are: (i) political controls: the state’s vote for the Republican candidate in the

last presidential election, the Berry et al. (2010) measure of conservative-liberal preferences of state

residents, and whether the budget is set in the year preceding the election of a governor; (ii) an

institutional control: a requirement for contributions to a state rainy day fund; (iii) a control for

natural disasters: the total economic damages from disasters lagged one year, and (iv) additional

economic controls: a state-specific consumer price index, national oil price shocks interacted with

whether the state is an energy- producing or energy-consuming state, and unexpected shocks to

federal defense spending within the state.

        The estimated budget equations also control for unmeasured shocks as year fixed effects (vt)

for common shocks to all states a given year (e.g., interest rate changes, federal tax reforms), state

fixed effects (vs) for stable differences across states that may affect state choices (e.g., budget rules),

and unmeasured within year and state (vst) effects where vst is assumed to follow an AR(1) process

unique to each state. No spatial autocorrelation is assumed. Estimation is by generalized least

squares.

        Key to identifying the effects of federal intergovernmental transfers on state fiscal choices

is the assumption that those transfers as measured here are uncorrelated with the unmeasured (vst)

determinants of state revenues, spending, and savings decisions. We seek to establish the


                                                    28
appropriateness of this assumption by two specification strategies.24 First, aid may be correlated

with economic or political events which also impact fiscal outcomes. We control for this possibility

of omitted variable bias by including year and state fixed effects as well as our control variables (X)

that vary over state and years. Second, care is taken to ensure that federal aid is specified to include

only transfers that are exogenous to each state’s current period budget. Project aid (AP) is specified

as only those programs whose funding is, by design or administration, independent of current-period

state spending.25 Welfare aid (AW) is not included directly in the budget equations as that assistance

is determined in part by the state’s own spending on transfers to lower-income households – that is,

AW = mCB. Shocks to B will be correlated with AW, biasing the estimate of AW’s impact on state

fiscal outcomes. To remove this source of endogeneity, we estimate the effect not of AW but of (1 -

m) on fiscal outcomes, where (1 - m) is exogenous to current state budget choices and can be




        24
            Efforts to address the possible endogeneity of federal aid through instrumental variable estimation
proved unsuccessful. We followed the approach of Knight (2002), using changes in congressional committee
membership for the state’s representatives, tenure of the state’s congressional delegation, and state party
representation relative to party majority in each chamber. In addition, we added changes in the governor’s
party relative to the state’s majority congressional party and whether the state was a potential “swing state”
based upon the closeness of the last presidential election. The resulting first stage F statistics never exceeded
4.0 for our sample period. Weak instruments may worsen the bias of the estimates. We therefore prefer the
specification strategy outlined here.
         Shoag (2010) has developed an alternative approach to measuring the impact of “outside” funds on
state budgets using “unexpected pension” returns from favorable or unfavorable swings in national interest
rates. Those returns are viewed as exogenous and are shown to have budgetary impacts on state spending
comparable in magnitude to what we estimate in Table 6. In our work and Shoag’s, outside money – whether
exogenous federal aid or pension fund windfalls – leads to an approximate $.30 increase in state spending.
        25
          See fn. 13 for the full list of the programs that are included in AP. Program details supporting the
exogeneity assumption for project aid can be found in Craig and Inman (1982) for education, Knight (2002)
and U.S. Department of Transportation (2007, p. 19) for transportation, Gramlich (1978) for jobs and training
programs, Reischauer (1975) for general revenue-sharing, Chernick (1998) for welfare’s TANF support, and
Singhal (2008) for Tobacco Settlement payments.

interpreted as the “net price” of each dollar of state spending on welfare services.26

        B. Results: Table 6 summarizes our results for the impact of the fiscal policy and economic

variables on each of the seven budgetary aggregates. Estimates for Δf are obtained from the budget

identity’s adding-up constraint.      Estimates for the effects of a $1 increase in the state’s mean

household income (I) show state government activities to be normal goods, even own welfare

spending (b). From the first row of Table 6, state revenues (rs) rise by $.024/person, government

current spending (gs) by $.012/person, welfare spending (b) by $.002/person, and capital spending

(k) by $.001/person. This leaves a positive cash flow from the marginal increase in state revenues

of $.009/person ( = $.024 - $.012 - $.002 - $.001), which is then allocated as $.006/person to rainy

day savings (Δc) and $.004/person to insurance trust fund savings (Δf). There is also a $.001/person

increase in state debt (Δd), presumably to finance the $.001/person increase in capital spending.

        Increases in state project aid (AP) have no significant effect on state revenues (rs) or welfare

spending (b), but AP does increase spending on current state operations and transfers to local

governments (gs) and capital outlays (k); see the second row of Table 6. Total state spending rises

by $.51 for each dollar increase in AP, with $.38 allocated to current account spending and $.13 to

capital outlays.27 The $.51 increase in total spending following the government’s receipt of one


        26
             The rate m is known officially as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage and is set each year
based upon the state’s three-year average income relative to the national average income beginning five years
before the rate applies – e.g., the matching rate that applies in 2012 is based on incomes for the years 2007
to 2009. Poorer states have higher rates than richer states. There have been two important “policy moments”
that led to significant changes in the rate – FY 2004 following the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation
Act of 2003 and FY2009 and FY2010 following ARRA. Finally, as controls for possibly omitted influence
of swings in the state economy on the value of m, we also include in all regressions state income per capital
(I) and the unexpected changes in the state unemployment rate (é).
        27
          We tested for possible reallocations of AP in recession years and found no significant differences,
except for a $.02 reallocation of spending from current operations (gs) into capital outlays (k). Overall
spending from an additional dollar of AP remained constant at $.51 with the remaining $.49 saved in rainy

                                                     30
more dollar of AP should be contrasted with the $.02 increase in total spending after households

receive one more dollar of private income. The spending effect confirms once again the presence

of a flypaper effect – “money sticks where it hits” – and stresses the need to evaluate the impact of

intergovernmental transfers separately from transfers to households.28

        The remaining $.49 of AP goes to net savings and equals an increase of $.33 in the state’s

rainy day fund (Δc) and $.19 in the state’s insurance trust fund accounts (Δf), offset by a $.03

increase in state debt (Δd), again used to finance, in part, state capital outlays. Efforts by the federal

government to check the savings motive with “maintenance of effort” provisions are very hard to

enforce for all but new programs for new state services.29 We can only speculate here for reasons

of this strong savings effect of AP funding, but a precautionary motive may be decisive. All of the

AP programs, except for Tobacco Settlement funding, are discretionary, requiring congressional

renewal and often bureaucratic acceptance of a state application. Governors may be reluctant to

create new programs or expand agencies on the unsecured promise of continued federal funding.

        Project aid that is saved is then spent in subsequent years as it is withdrawn from the state’s



day and trust fund accounts.
        28
           Leduc and Wilson (2013) in their recent work on the allocation of ARRA’s transportation aid seek
to unravel the “black box” of the flypaper effect. They find that a dollar of ARRA transportation assistance
led to a $.72 increase in state highway spending and that state politics was the key to understanding this
strong spending effect. Spending for highway projects was highly correlated with contributions by the
construction industry to the controlling political party of the state.
        29
           Maintenance of effort requirements for existing programs are very easy to subvert, since any dollar
being spent can be called a “new dollar” against the unverifiable alternative of a “planned” spending cut. This
was a particular problem for ARRA. The bulk of ARRA assistance for states was for additional funds for
existing state programs: welfare and Medicaid, transportation infrastructure, and schools. Only truly new
programs clearly reveal new dollars. While new programs for state governments were included in the ARRA
stimulus package, the aggregate spending on these programs was very small compared to the total of ARRA
assistance. Given the need for quick passage of policies, there was simply not enough time to design large
new programs; see Grunwald (2012, Chapter 3).

                                                      31
rainy day fund (c), but the rate of withdrawal is very slow and the added spending effects in the near

term are slight. A $1 increase in the lagged value of the rainy day fund (c-1) encourages the state

to withdraw only $.107 from that account each year; Table 6, col. (5). That $.107 is then allocated

as $.006 to own welfare spending (b), $.059 to current accounts spending (gs), and $.01 to capital

outlays (k). Total spending therefore rises by $.075. The remaining $.036 is used to pay down debt

outstanding. From these estimates, the final spending effects of a $1 increase in AP will be $.506

in the year aid is received and $.02 in each year thereafter.30

        Increases in welfare aid (AW) are made by increasing the federal matching rate (m) for

income transfers and services for lower income families. The increase in m lowers the net price (1 -

m) for redistributive services leading the state to increase B, total assistance to poor households.

The net cost to the state’s taxpayers will be own spending, defined as b = (1 - m)CB. The elasticities

of b and B with respect to (1 - m) can be specified as: gb, (1-m) = 1 + gB,(1 - m). Based upon the estimates

in Table 6, elasticities evaluated at the sample means are gb, (1-m) = .57 and gB, (1-m) = -. 43.

        Increasing the federal matching rate lowers the net price for welfare spending (1 - m),

leading to an increase in transfers paid to poor households (B), but to a fall in the state’s own welfare

spending (b). This was the policy adopted in ARRA’s decision to increase m by .10. From Table

6, a .10 increase in m lowers the average net price (1 - m) from .4 to .3, which in turn leads to a fall

in own welfare spending (b) of -$40.59/person ( = -.10 x 405.9; Table 6, col. (2)). Because of the



        30
           The year after the receipt of aid, there is a $.326 increase in cash savings. This $.326 increase is
withdrawn at the rate of -.107 per dollar or by -$.035 (=-.107C.326) in the next fiscal year. This $.035
withdrawal is then allocated as $.025 to increased spending and $.01 to paying down of debt. This leaves
$.291 ( = .326 - .035) in the cash account, which allows for another withdrawal of -$.031 (= -.107C.291)
allocated as $.022 to spending in the third year after the receipt of aid. The sequence is repeated again in year
four and thereafter. The final equilibrium increase in aggregate state spending will be about $.75 per dollar
of AP assistance, with $.506 occurring in the year the aid is received.

                                                       32
lower net price for welfare services, there is an increase in total transfers to poor households of

$95/person ( = ΔB), however. Finally, the .10 ULVH in the matching rate implies an increase for

federal government spending on welfare aid of $135.50/person ( = ΔAW).31

        The expansion of welfare matching aid has important implications for the other portions of

the state budget too. First, government spending on current services (gs) fall by $45.70/person (

= -.10 x 457; Table 6, col. (3)) and capital outlays (k) are reduced by $7.57 ( = -.10 x 75.66; Table

6, col. (4)). Total spending, gs + k, therefore declines by $53.30/person. When joined with the

$40.59 fall in own welfare spending the state now has $$93.86 in additional dollars. What does it

do with the money? The state returns $52.58 immediately as a tax cut (= - .10 x 525.8; Table 6, col.

(1)), and then saves the remaining $41.28 as a small $.70 increase in the rainy day fund (= - .10 x -

7.01; Table 6, col. (5)), a $15.29 paying down of state debts (= -.10 x 152.9; Table 6, col. (6)), and

a $25.30 increase in insurance trust fund savings (= -.10 x - 253).32

        In the end, aggregate state spending for poor families rises by $95/person or approximately

$790 per eligible recipient, assuming the national poverty rate is 12 percent.             This increase in

poverty spending costs the federal government $135/person in additional federal welfare aid. After

paying transfers to poor families, the remaining $40 of federal welfare aid plus the $53 in savings

        31
            Own welfare spending is defined as b = (1-m)CB, where B is transfers to poor households. The
welfare budget before the increase in the state matching rate has b = $276 implying B = $690/person from
B = b/(1 - m) with b (= $276) and m (= .6) evaluated at sample means. After m is increased to .7, b = $276 -
$40.59 = $235.41. Now B = (b/(1 - m) = $785 evaluated at m = .7 and b = $235. The implied increase in
total lower-income transfers per person is therefore ΔB = $785 - $690 = $95/person. The implied increase
in total federal aid is $135.50/person = (m = .7)C(B = $785) - (m = .6)C(B = $690) = ΔAW.
        32
           These reduced form results for the impact of (1 - m) on state budgets, including all income effects
from the reduction in the cost of welfare spending, imply that welfare spending and the provision of
government spending are “political substitutes” while welfare spending and general tax relief for current and
future taxpayers are “political complements.” While the linear expenditure system requires all goods to be
economic substitutes (absent income effects), a strong income effect for taxpayer incomes arising from the
lower price of welfare services accounts for the strong positive impact of the fall in (1 - m) on tax relief.

from reduced government spending are allocated as $53 of tax relief to the middle class and as $40

for increased savings and debt repayment.

       C. Simulated Macro Multipliers: The estimates above of state budgetary behavior provide

important insight into how AP and AW impact the private economy, and in particular, why welfare

aid seems so much more effective than project aid as a stimulus for the private economy. Each form

of assistance has four impacts on state budgetary behaviors: on state revenues (Δrs), on transfers to

lower income households (ΔB), on government purchases (ΔG = Δgs + Δk), and on changes in

publicly held wealth (ΔW = Δc - Δd + Δf). Each budgetary impact in turn has a potential multiplier

effect on the private economy. Tables 7 and 8 combine our estimates of the one year budgetary

impacts of AP and AW assistance with separate, one year (four quarter) multiplier estimates for the

macroeconomic impacts of each budgetary variable on private economic activity. When combined,

we can specify the implied one year AP and AW multipliers for comparison to the econometrically

estimated four quarter multipliers reported in Table 4; see Tables 7 and 8.

       For our estimate of the one year multiplier for changes in state revenues, we use dGDP/drs

= -3.19, the four quarter federal tax multiplier from Table 4. This seems reasonable as many state

tax codes mimic that of the federal code. For our estimate of the one year multiplier for changes in

state spending on goods and services, we use dGDP/dG = .88, the federal spending multiplier after

four quarters; see Table 4. This estimate is comparable in magnitude to the state multiplier estimates

in Clemens and Miran (2012).

       We approximate the one year multiplier for increases in state transfer spending as dGDP/dB

= 1.59. dGDP/dB cannot be specified directly from an estimated tax multiplier. State spending for

lower income households includes not just transfer income but also transfers-in-kind, most


                                                 34
importantly, subsidized health care through Medicaid. One estimate for the impact of Medicaid

spending on household consumption follows from the analysis of the Oregon Medicaid program.

In this program, the average new enrollee received $788/person in additional health care spending

and, as a result, saved $390/person in own health care spending; see Finkelstein et al. (2012, Tables

V and VII). This result suggests that about half of every dollar of Medicaid spending becomes new

income for Medicaid recipients. If so, then the multiplier for dGDP/dB can be approximated as half

the multiplier for dGDP/drs or, after a sign change for receipt of transfer income, as 1.59.

       Finally we approximate the macroeconomic multiplier for increases in household public

savings wealth, dGDP/dW, as the real interest rate (.03) times the (absolute) value of the revenue

multiplier, or as dGDP/dW = .03C3.189 = .10.

       Table 7 combines our estimates of the budgetary impacts of AP assistance with the estimates

of the one year multipliers for each impact to approximate a reduced form multiplier for federal

project aid. A $1 increase in AP has zero impact on state revenues (= Δrs), increases transfers to

poor households by $.02 ( = ΔB), increases state spending by $.50 (= ΔG), and increases public

savings by $.48 (= ΔW). Multiplying each budgetary impact by its one year multiplier, implies an

aggregate multiplier for AP aid of .52; see Table 7.

       Table 8 combines our estimates for the budgetary impacts of AW assistance with their

separate one year multipliers to approximate an implied multiplier for welfare aid, where the source

of the additional welfare aid is an increase in the federal government’s matching rate for state

welfare spending. Table 8 assumes the matching rate is increased by .10. As estimated in section

B above, this increase in the matching rate will lead to a $53/person fall in state revenues (= Δrs),

a $95/person increase in transfers to poor households (= ΔB), a $53/person fall in state purchases


                                                 35
(= ΔG), and a $41/person increase in government savings (= ΔW). All of these changes imply a

$135/person increase in total federal welfare aid (ΔAW). The implied impact of $1 more of AW

would then be a $.39 fall in state revenues, a $.70 increase in state welfare spending, a $.39 fall in

government purchases, and a $.30 increase in public savings; see Table 8. Multiplying each

budgetary impact by its one year multiplier, implies an aggregate multiplier for AW aid of 2.04.

       D. Summary: The simulated multipliers for AP and AW implied by our micro-econometric

estimates of state budgetary policies are comparable in magnitude to those estimated from our

SVAR macro-econometric estimates of federal aid policies, and strikingly close to those for AW

assistance. Like the direct macro-econometric estimates, the simulated multipliers show AW to be

significantly more stimulative than AP aid.

       Our micro-econometric analysis of state budgets helps us to understand why. States allocate

one dollar of unconstrained AP aid as $.51 to government spending, which has a relatively modest

stimulus impact, and $.49 to government savings. The savings motive is likely to be strongest for

temporary AP aid. Maintenance of effort provisions to check savings behaviors are very difficult

to enforce. The saved resources are only slowly “leaked” back into the spending budget at a rate

of $.03 per year. Resources that are saved are assumed to have a wealth effect, but that multiplier

is very modest. AP aid provides no taxpayer relief and no additional resources for transfer spending.

As a rough guide, AP aid to the SL sector can be expected to have approximately half the impact

on the aggregate economy as federal government direct purchases.

       In contrast, AW aid when paid as a matching grant for increased state welfare spending has

a strong impact on reallocating state resources away from government purchases and towards tax

relief for households and firms and increased transfers to, and health care services for, lower income


                                                 36
families. A dollar of AW aid induces $.39 in tax relief for middle class households and businesses

and $.70 additional spending for lower income households. Both those fiscal changes have strong

stimulative impacts on the private economy. The “extra” $.09 comes from the cut in state spending

of $.39 allocated in part to a $.30 increase in state savings. In the end, we lose the stimulative

impact of state spending but it is more than offset by the advantages of returning dollars directly to

households, particularly credit-constrained lower income families. For these reasons, matching AW

assistance is the most effective SL policy for stimulating the private economy.



V. Federal Aid as a Fiscal Stimulus: What Works?

        Table 9 presents the results of a macro-econometric simulation based upon our five variable

SVAR to illustrate the relative effectiveness of the four alternative fiscal policies considered here:

central government tax cuts (ΔR) and direct government purchases (ΔG), increases in SL project aid

(ΔAP), and increases in SL welfare aid (ΔAW). To illustrate the relative impact of the four policies,

we use the actual allocations implemented by ARRA in the year following the passage of the act.

For purposes of our simulations, we have re-estimated the five variable SVAR of Eq. (3) for the pre-

ARRA sample period 1960:1 to 2009:1.                 Based on these estimates, we then simulate the

performance of the economy without, and then with, ARRA policy innovations.33 The analysis here


        33
            That ARRA qualifies as a policy shock is clear from its legislative history; see Boone, Dube, and
Kaplan (2014). The legislation introduced structural policy shocks to federal net revenues, federal purchases,
SL project aid, and SL welfare aid. Simulations for the path of GDP following the fiscal innovations are
calculated in three steps. First, each policy innovation is transformed into a corresponding structural shock
for the five variable specification of Eq. (3) denoted as (vrt, vgt, vapt, vawt), where shocks are the percentage
change from the quarter preceding the innovation. Second, the estimated SVAR as specified in the Technical
Appendix is used to provide vectors of the seasonally adjusted reduced form fiscal shocks (uCt) for each year
(t). Third, the reduced form fiscal shocks and the originally estimated VAR specified by Eq. (2) with the
control variable “deep recession” set equal to 1 are used to provide a projected path for GDP following each
fiscal innovation.

is offered only to illustrate the relative effectiveness of the alternative policies and should not be

taken as an evaluation of ARRA per se.34

        For policy innovations in federal net revenues we use the total tax savings and direct

transfers to households and firms that occurred in the first quarter after the passage of ARRA: ΔR

= $45.2 billion in 2009:2. For government purchases, we assign the innovation to the quarter when

actual purchases are first observed, with the level of the innovation equal to purchases in that

quarter: ΔG = $11.83 billion in 2010:1. Innovations in AP include additional funding for three

existing federal aid programs: aid to K-12 education (called “stability” aid), aid for infrastructure

spending for roads and bridges, and aid for construction of public housing. Education assistance was

paid immediately in 2009:2 and this policy innovation was assigned the actual allocation in that

period: ΔAP = $8.686 billion.         Because of a required application review, funding for the

infrastructure projects and public housing was not observed until 2010:1 but then equaled ΔAP =

$18.753 billion. Finally, the innovation for welfare aid included added support for SL spending for

family services, child support, low-income housing allowances, and most importantly Medicaid.

This aid was first paid in 2009:2 at a level of ΔAW = $37.032 billion.35

        The predicted path of GDP without policy innovations is provided as a benchmark; Table

9, col. (1). Predictions for the incremental effects of individual policies on GDP are computed as



        34
            As is clear from estimates for our no-policy benchmark, our simulated economy is predicted to
recover much more quickly than has the actual economy. Most of the adverse shocks in our estimated
economy are from real side economic declines – for example, rising oil prices – and not like our recent
economic decline due to an adverse shock to the financial sector. Economies recover much more slowly from
financial shocks; see Reinhardt and Rogoff (2009).
        35

Romer and Romer (2010). Estimates for ARRA’s revenue innovation (ΔR) are from:

the difference between the predicted path of GDP with and without the innovation; Table 9, cols.

(2)-(5). The predicted path of GDP following the introduction of all four stimulus policies together

is shown in Table 9, col. (6). The most effective of the individual policies is direct tax relief (ΔR).

New welfare aid (ΔAW) is also an effective stimulus to income growth. The least effective of the

four policies as an economic stimulus are increases in federal government direct purchases (ΔG) and

increases in federal project aid (ΔAP).36 The reason for these differential impacts is not the level

of spending on the individual policies but rather the significantly higher estimated multipliers for

tax reductions and welfare spending increases. The combined impact of all four policy innovations

working in concert is reported in Table 9, col. (6). As a policy package the estimated maximal

impact is $823/person occurring in 2009:Q4. The implied increase in the economy’s growth is 1.8

percent over the economy’s no-policy benchmark.

        The performance of the original policy package can be improved by reallocating all of

stimulus funding to its two most effective policies, tax cuts and increased matching welfare aid. For

example, all of the increase in federal purchases (ΔG) can be reallocated to tax cuts, increasing the

innovation in ΔR to $57.03 billion in 2009:2. All of new project aid spending (ΔAP) can be

reallocated to the innovation in welfare aid raising ΔAW to $64.473 billion, also in 2009:2. For

these targeted policies, peak GDP growth again occurs in 2009:4, but now equals $1094/person and

continues to have a significant impact on GDP growth well into 2012. With this more targeted

stimulus package, the simulated increase in the economy’s growth rate is 2.6 percent over the no-

policy benchmark. This is an approximate 30 percent improvement in GDP growth over the original

        36
            A point anticipated by Alice Rivlin’s critique of the ARRA in a speech given at the Brookings
Institution when ARRA was first proposed: “A long-term investment program should not be put together
hastily and lumped in with the anti-recession program. . . . (It) will not create many jobs right away.” Quoted
in Suskind (2011, p. 162).

mix of policies.

       Finally, from the simulated growth in GDP and Okun’s Law, we can estimate the likely

increase in national employment arising from the original policy package. Okun’s Law describes

the relationship between changes in the growth rate of GDP and changes in the rate of employment.

Ball, Leigh, and Loungani (2013) have estimated this relationship for the US economy and find that

a 1% increase GDP growth implies a ½ percent increase in the rate of employment. The

employment level of the US economy at the time of the introduction of proposed policies (January,

2009) was 142 million workers. The original policy would imply a 1.8 percent increase in GDP

after one year or, by Okun’s Law, a 9/10's of 1 percent increase in employment. That would be 1.3

million new jobs. The more targeted stimulus policy using only tax cuts and welfare aid implies a

2.6 percent rate of income growth after one year, and by Okun’s Law, a 1.3 percent increase in

employment. This would be an increase of 1.85 million jobs. And the cost per job? The total cost

of the original stimulus over the year 2009:1 to 2010:1 for all four policies was $112.82 billion.

Thus the cost per job for the original ARRA policies is $86,700 per job. For the more “efficient”

targeted policy package, the cost falls to $61,000 per job.



VI. Conclusion: What Role for States?

       The received wisdom, at least since Musgrave (1959) and Oates (1972), is that state

governments have little role to play in the design and implementation of macroeconomic fiscal

policy. The argument comes from either of two assumptions. First, as small open economies, state

governments cannot impact their own economies through the use of expansionary fiscal policies.

The summary in Section II of our work in Carlino and Inman (2013) rejects this assumption.


                                                40
Increases in a state’s own deficits can stimulate state job growth. Or second, if there are job gains

for any one state, there may also be significant job spillovers for their neighboring states. Our work

in Carlino and Inman (2013), and the work of others studying policy interdependencies among

central European economies, finds strong support for the presence of spillovers. If so, states may

underprovide the socially efficient level of deficit policies, hoping their neighbors will incur the

costs of job creation. In this case, central government fiscal policies will be needed to internalize

the relevant externalities.

        That said, states may still be needed. In mature economic unions, states are the main

providers of most government goods and services (defense is the exception) and often play a central

role in the financing and provision of transfers and services to lower income households. If so, then

for the central government to increase aggregate government purchases or to transfer income to

lower income households it must “use” the states. There remains a role for states, but now as the

economic “agents” of the central government. The central government may “command” state fiscal

policies, but more often than not (or because US law does not allow unfunded mandates) the central

government must “control” state behavior through the use of intergovernmental transfers. In

sections III and IV we study the ability of such transfers to impact state fiscal policies and to

ultimately stimulate income and job creation in the national economy. We find the most effective

transfer policies are incentive based and use matching aid to encourage general state tax relief and

income and service assistance for lower income households.

        Why then did ARRA use relatively inefficient project aid? Boone, Dube, and Kaplan (2014)

suggest that project aid was the “political” price required for the timely passage of ARRA by a

Congress whose members’ political futures are closely tied to the fiscal needs of their state political


                                                  41
allies. As a result, the poor urban states got additional welfare aid, the richer and more rural states

got additional infrastructure aid, and everyone got more unconstrained assistance for public

education; see Inman (2010).        Here then, may be the most important role for states in

macroeconomic policy-making in economic unions: Not just as agents for implementing approved

policies, but also as principals who collectively design these policies.

        Economic regions are defined as in Crone (2004). Crone’s economic regions differ from
the BEA definitions by moving West Virginia into the Great Lakes region and Louisiana into the
“Energy Belt” region, both from the BEA’s Southeast region. Minnesota is added to the Great
Lakes region from the BEA’s Plains region. South Dakota and North Dakota are moved to a new
Mountain/Northern Plains region from the BEA’s Plains region. Wyoming. Utah, and Colorado are
moved to the “Energy Belt” region from BEA’s Rocky Mountain States region. Finally, Arizona
is moved to the Far West region from the BEA’s Southwest region. The BEA’s Southwest region
is now omitted.

         All results are for sample period, 1960:1 to 2010:3. Cols. (1) and (2) use a more elastic coefficient specifying the
       automatic (same quarter) impact of GDP on federal net revenues. Cols. (3) and (4) allow for monetary policy variables
       (federal funds rate and rate of inflation) within the SVAR specification with fiscal policy ordered before monetary policy.
       Cols. (5) and (6) report results for the alternative ordering of government fiscal policy with government spending (G and AP) ordered
       first, then revenue policies (R, AW), followed by GDP. Cols. (7) and (8) report results for the restricted sample period, 1960:1 to
       1998:3 excluding the Tobacco Settlement and subsequent quarters. Each cell gives the point estimates of the fiscal multiplier
       impacting GDP evaluated at the sample means for fiscal policies and GDP, and then the lower and upper bounds (within
       parentheses) for the one standard deviation (68 percent) error band. Multipliers that are significantly different from 0 at
       the 95 percent level of confidence are indicated by an *.

      Budget equations reported in columns (1) to (7) are estimated by generalized least squares allowing for state-specific AR(1)
    processes. Heteroskedastic-corrected standard errors are reported within parentheses; coefficients twice their standard errors are
    indicated by an *. Column (7) reports the implied impact of each independent variable required for budgetary “adding up” for the
    residual category “net contributions to trust fund accounts” denoted as Δf (/ AP + rs - (b + gs + k) - Δc + Δd). In addition to I, AP,
    (1-m), and c-1, each regression also includes as independent variables: year and state fixed effects plus state-year controls for the cost
    of living in the state, citizen preferences measured on a liberal-conservative spectrum, the state’s republican vote in the previous
    presidential election, a (1,0) indicator variable for whether the budget is decided in an election year for governor, a (1,0) indicator
    variable for the presence of a state rainy-day fund requirement, national oil price shocks interacted with regional indicator variables
    for consuming states in New England, Great Lakes, and the Mid-East or producing states in the Southwest and Rocky Mountain
    regions, shocks to state military contracts and payroll, and the lagged level of real per capita property damages within the state caused
    by “billion dollar” natural disasters, and shocks to the state unemployment rate. . Sample means are listed below each variable.

                    SVAR Specification and Identification of Fiscal Multipliers

        The four variable SVAR estimates the impact of federal net revenues paid by households and

firms (R), federal government purchases (G), and aggregate federal aid (A) on national GDP (Y).

The analysis begins with the estimation of a reduced form VAR specified as:

                                          Zt = C(L)CZt-1 + ut, where                            (A1)

                             ZtN = [rt, gt, at, yt] and utN = [urt, ugt, uat, uyt],

and where rr is the log of federal net household and firm revenues (R), gt is the log of federal

government purchases (G), at is the log of aggregate federal aid (A), and yt is the log of GDP (Y),

each measured at quarterly intervals and measured as real (2005) dollars per capita. Also included

in the initial VAR are the trend variables time and time squared, and an indicator variable for “deep

recessions” (= 1, if the national rate of unemployment exceeds 8 percent).

        The lag structure C(L) is a 4 x 4 matrix of three-quarter distributed lag polynomials, and ut

is a 4 x 1 vector of reduced form innovations, specified as utN = [urt, ugt, uat, uyt]. The three quarter

lag allows for seasonal patterns in the responses of fiscal variables to GDP. The AIC test statistic

indicates that three quarter lags of the endogenous variables are optimal; three lags are also

sufficient to remove serial correlation from the residuals.

        To recover the exogenous structural shocks to net federal revenues, federal government

purchases, and federal aid, denoted as vrt, vgt, and vat, respectively, we follow the methodology of

Blanchard and Perotti (2002). First, we take advantage of quarterly variation in our data and impose

the restriction that discretionary changes in fiscal policy take at least one quarter to respond to

changes in GDP. Thus the contemporaneous discretionary response of net revenues, purchases, or


                                                     A-1
aid to GDP is zero.

        Second, we impose constraints on the ordering of discretionary policy changes, requiring

discretionary revenues to be set prior to discretionary spending for either purchases or aid, and then

within spending, that purchases (largely defense spending) are set prior to federal aid to the SL

sector. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and subsequent

legislation have established aggregate revenues as the first decision for congress when setting the

federal budget; see Keith and Schick (2004) and Auerbach (2003). Formally, federal net revenues

are seen to Granger-cause federal purchases.1 We assume discretionary government purchases

predetermine spending for federal aid as, politically, defense spending “trumps” discretionary

domestic spending. We cannot rule out the possibility that domestic spending may hold priority

over defense spending by a Granger-causality test.2 As a pre-caution, therefore, we redo our analysis

with federal purchases pre-dating revenues in the policy process and report those results as a

robustness check in Table 5.3

        Third, we identify the built-in responses of federal tax and transfer policies and federal

purchases to contemporaneous (same quarter) changes in GDP following the specifications proposed

originally by Blanchard and Perotti (2002). The built-in contemporaneous elasticity of federal net

household and firm revenues to changes in GDP is set equal to 2.08; sensitivity test for alternative


        1
          For the full sample period (1947:1 to 2010:3) we reject the null hypothesis that revenues do not
Granger-cause spending (χ2 = 14.01), but we cannot reject the null that spending does not Granger-cause
revenues (χ2 = 3.84).
        2
          For the full sample period (1947:1 to 2010:3) we cannot reject either the null hypothesis that federal
aid Granger-causes federal purchases (χ2 = 14.26) or the null hypothesis that federal purchases Granger-cause
federal aid.
        3
         We have tested for the sensitivity of our core results to the alternative ordering within spending that
places domestic spending politically “prior” to defense spending, and the results remain essentially the same.

                                                     A-2
 specifications are reported in Table 5. An estimate of the contemporaneous (same quarter) built-in

 effects of GDP on federal aid to the SL sector is obtained from a panel regression for the period

 1970-2010 relating the log of total federal-to-state aid to the log of gross state product (GSP)

 conditional on year and state fixed effects; our preferred elasticity estimate is -.35 (s.e. = .10).

         The vector of reduced form residuals is then specified as a linear combination of structural

 shocks. After subtracting all contemporaneous responses among the reduced form residuals, net

 residuals (uC,C) can be specified as:

                          uC,rt / (urt - αr,yCuyt) = βr,gCvgt + βr,aCvat + vrt,

                          uC,gt / (ugt - αg,yCuyt) = βg,rCvrt + βg,aCvat + vgt,

                          uC,at / (uat - αa,yCuyt) = βa,gCvgt + βa,rCvrt + vat,             (A2)

                          uC,yt / (uyt - αy,rCurt - αy,gCugt - αy,aCuat) = vyt,

where each coefficient αp,y specifies the built-in (programmatic) elasticity of fiscal policy (p = r, g,

a) to GDP and each coefficient αy,p the response of GDP to contemporaneous (including exogenous)

changes in each fiscal policy ( p = r, g, a).

        Our core estimates set αr,y = 2.08, αg,,y = 0, and αa,y = -.35. From the identification strategy for

the timing of fiscal policy decision-making, βr,g = βr,a = 0 from the priority of federal revenues over

spending and βg,a = 0 from the priority of government purchases over SL aid. With these restrictions,

we identify the remaining six free parameters (βg,r, βa,g, βa,r, αy,r, αy,g, αy,a) and compute a distribution

for the exogenous structural errors, vtN = [vrt, vgt, vat, vyt]. We can then compute impulse response

functions for GDP following exogenous shocks in fiscal policy drawn from the estimated

distributions of the structural errors, and then from the impulse response functions we can estimate

multipliers evaluated at the sample means for GDP and each policy; see Table 3.


                                                     A-3
        A similar specification and identification strategy is used when the analysis is extended to a

five variable SVAR to evaluate the separate effects for project aid (AP) and welfare aid (AW). Here

the vector of policies and GDP is specified as ZN = [rt, gt, awt, apt, yt], where awt is the log of federal

matching aid for state-funded transfers to lower-income households including Medicaid (AW) and

apt is the log of federal project aid for general state and local government spending or tax relief (AP).

The corresponding vector of exogenous residuals to be estimated is now vtN = [vrt, vgt, vawt, vapt, vyt].

The five variable SVAR is specified as:

                uC,rt / (urt - αr,yCuyt) = βr,gCvgt + βr,awCvawt + βr,apCvapt + vrt,

                uC,gt / (ugt - αg,yCuyt) = βg,rCvrt + βg,awCvawt + βg,apCvapt + vgt,

                uC,awt / (uawt - αaw,yCuyt) = βaw,rCvrt + βaw,gCvgt + βaw,apCvapt + vawt,      (A3)

                uC,apt / (uapt - αap,yCuyt) = βap,rCvrt + βap,gCvgt + βap,awCvawt + vapt,

                uC,yt / (uyt - αy,rCurt - αy,gCugt - αy,awCuawt - αy,apCuapt) = vyt,

where we again specify αr,y = 2.08 and αg,,y = 0; βr,g = βr,aw = βr,ap = 0 by the budgetary priority of

revenue over spending; and βg,aw = βg,ap = 0 from the budgetary priority of government purchases

(largely defense) over grants to the SL sector. Initially we specify formula welfare aid as prior in

budgeting to discretionary federal program aid and set βaw,ap = 0. For the five variable SVAR, we use

estimates of the contemporaneous built-in effects of GDP on the two components of federal aid, again

obtained from state panel regressions now relating the log of welfare and program aid to the log of

gross state product (GSP), conditional on year and state fixed effects. Here the preferred estimates

are αap,y = -.40 (s.e. = .15) and αaw,y = -.19 (s.e., =.07).4 Both sets of aid policies are progressive,

         4
            Explicitly including the contemporaneous effect of changes in GDP on AW and AP removes
 possible bias in our multiplier estimates that could arise if congress responds to a recessionary shock with
 immediate additional assistance for the SL sector. Historically, Congress has introduced intergovernmental
 aid programs two and three years after recessions to help states cover their recession-induced shortfalls in

                                                     A-4
increasing as income declines. Our assumed ordering of fiscal policy again has Congress first

determine revenues, then government purchases, then welfare aid, and finally project aid. With these

restrictions we can identify the 10 free parameters (βg,r, βaw,r, βaw,g, βap,r, βap,g, βap,aw, αy,r, αy,g, αy,aw, αy,ap)

and the resulting vector of exogenous residuals vtN = [vrt, vgt, vawt, vapt, vyt]. We can then compute the

impulse response functions for GDP following exogenous shocks in fiscal policy, and from these

impulse response functions we can estimate fiscal multipliers evaluated at the sample means for GDP

and each policy, now including those for welfare aid (AW) and program aid (AP); see Tables 4 and

5.




 revenue. But the fact that the lagged influence of income on policy is never statistically significant beyond
 3 to 4 quarters leads us to view these programs as exogenous shocks to fiscal policy.
