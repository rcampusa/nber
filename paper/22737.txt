                                           ABSTRACT

We study how the financial conditions in the Center Economies [the U.S., Japan, and the Euro
area] impact other countries over the period 1986 through 2015. Our methodology relies upon a
two-step approach. We focus on five possible linkages between the center economies (CEs) and
the non-Center economics, or peripheral economies (PHs), and investigate the strength of these
linkages. For each of the five linkages, we first regress a financial variable of the PHs on financial
variables of the CEs while controlling for global factors. Next, we examine the determinants of
sensitivity to the CEs as a function of country-specific macroeconomic conditions and policies,
including the exchange rate regime, currency weights, monetary, trade and financial linkages with
the CEs, the levels of institutional development, and international reserves. Extending our
previous work (Aizenman et al. (2016)), we devote special attention to the impact of currency
weights in the implicit currency basket, balance sheet exposure, and currency composition of
external debt. We find that for both policy interest rates and the real exchange rate (REER), the
link with the CEs has been pervasive for developing and emerging market economies in the last
two decades, although the movements of policy interest rates are found to be more sensitive to
global financial shocks around the time of the emerging markets’ crises in the late 1990s and
early 2000s, and since 2008. When we estimate the determinants of the extent of connectivity, we
find evidence that the weights of major currencies, external debt, and currency compositions of
debt are significant factors. More specifically, having a higher weight on the dollar (or the euro)
makes the response of a financial variable such as the REER and exchange market pressure in the
PHs more sensitive to a change in key variables in the U.S. (or the euro area) such as policy
interest rates and the REER. While having more exposure to external debt would have similar
impacts on the financial linkages between the CEs and the PHs, the currency composition of
international debt securities does matter. Economies more reliant on dollar-denominated debt
issuance tend to be more vulnerable to shocks emanating from the U.S.

1. Introduction
       On the eve of the 20th year anniversary of the East Asian crisis, we investigate the impact
of balance sheet exposures, economic structure and trilemma choices on the exposure of
countries to shocks emanating from the center. Events over recent decades have vividly
illustrated that balance sheet exposure impact monetary and fiscal spaces, capital mobility, and
exchange market pressure. The evolution of global dynamics during the post-Global Financial
Crisis period led Rey (2013) to propound the hypothesis that exchange rate regimes no longer
insulate countries from global financial cycles – in other words, the demise of the Mundellian
Trilemma. In this paper, however, we investigate whether Rey’s view means the end of the
trilemma hypothesis or a prematurely prediction that is not supported by the data. In order to
gain further insights regarding these developments, we examine how the financial conditions of -
- and shocks propagated from -- the Center Economies [dubbed CEs, namely the U.S., Japan, and
the Euro area], impact the non CEs economics. Extending our previous work (Aizenman et al.
(2016)), we devote special attention to the impact of currency weights in the implicit currency
basket, balance sheet exposure, and currency composition of external debt.
        Our empirical method relies upon a two-step approach. We first investigate the extent of
sensitivity of policy interest rate, the real effective exchange rate (REER) and several other
macro variables to those of the center economies while controlling for global factors. The
estimation is done for the sample period is 1986 through 2015, using monthly data and in a
rolling fashion. Next, we examine the association of these sensitivity coefficients with country’s
trilemma choices, the real and financial linkages with the CE, the levels of institutional
development, balance sheet exposure, and the like. Using the methodology of Frankel and Wei
(1996), we estimate the currency weights of the non-ECs economies, and study the impact of
these weights on the transmission of shocks from the ECs to non-ECs countries (or peripheral
economies, “PHs”).
       We find that for both policy interest rates and the REER, the link with the CEs has been a
dominant factor for developing and emerging market economies [EMGs] in the last two decades.
Furthermore, the developing and EMGs policy interest rates are more sensitive to global
financial shocks around the time of EMGs’ crises in the period surrounding the turn of the
century, and again since the Global Financial Crisis [GFC] of 2008. In contrast with Rey’s
conclusions, we find that the type of exchange rate regime and country’s currency weights or

                                                 2
currency composition in international debt do matter: developing countries or EMGs with more
stable exchange rate and more open financial markets are more affected by changes in the policy
interest rates in the CEs. Exchange rate stability, financial openness, and IR holding are jointly
significant for the group of developing or emerging market countries.
       Distinct from our earlier results, we find evidence that the weights of major currencies,
the extent of external debt, and the currency composition of debt are significant factors. Having a
higher weight of the dollar (or the euro) enhances the responsiveness of a financial variable such
as PH REER and EMP to a change in key variables in the U.S. (or the euro area). While having
more exposure to external debt has similar effects on the financial linkages between the CEs and
the PHs, the currency composition of international debt securities has a differential impact.
Those economies more reliant on the dollar for debt issuance tend to be more vulnerable to
shocks occurring in the U.S.
       In what follows, we present the framework of our main empirical analysis in Section 2.
Each of the two steps for the estimation is explained in this section. In Section 3, we present
empirical results for the baseline estimations. In Section 4, we focus on the impacts of currency
weights, trade with currency zones, external debt, and currency composition of international
debt. We make concluding remarks in Section 5.




2   The Framework of the Main Empirical Analysis
       Methodologically, we extend the same approach as followed in Aizenman et al. (2016),
with special focus on different determinants of linkage strength between the CEs and the PHs. To
recap, our analytical process is similar to the two-step estimations employed by Forbes and
Chinn (2004). As the first step, we focus on the five possible linkages between the PHs and the
CEs and investigate the degree of the sensitivity through those linkages. For each of the five
linkages, we regress a financial variable of the PHs on another (or the same) variable of the CEs
while controlling for global factors. In the second step, we treat the estimated degree of
sensitivity as the dependent variable, and examine their determinants among a number of
country-specific variables, including the roles of countries’ macroeconomic conditions or
policies, real or financial linkage with the center economy, or the level of institutional
development of the countries. In this study, our discussion centers on the effect of variables

                                                  3
pertaining to balance sheets of the sample countries such as external debt, the weights of major
currencies in the currency basket, and the share of currencies for debt denomination.


2.1 The Five Linkages – The Channels through which PHs are Susceptible to Changes in
    CEs’ Financial Conditions
         Before we investigate the linkages between the CEs and the PHs, we must identify what
kind of linkages we focus on. In that regard, Figure 1 is helpful. It illustrates how the variables of
our focus tend to be more affected by spillovers of shocks around the globe. More specifically,
the five linkages between the CEs and the PHs are as follows.
         Link 1 – Short-term, policy interest rate in the CEs  Short-term, policy interest rate in
the PHs: If country i has its monetary policy more susceptible to the monetary policy of one (or
more) of the CEs, the correlation of the policy interest rates between the CEs and PHs should be
significantly positive, implying a closer linkage between the CEs and PHs. However, a
significantly negative correlation could also mean a closer linkage. If a rise in a CE’s policy rate
could draw capital from the PHs, that could reduce money demand among PHs and therefore
lower the policy rates among them while the CEs experience a rise in both money demand and
the policy rate, thus making the correlation negative.4
         Link 2 – Short-term, policy interest rate in the CEs  REER in the PHs: A rise in the
short-term interest rate in the CEs could be followed by a rise in PH’s REER (i.e., real
appreciation) if PHs pursue more stable exchange rate movements against the currencies of the
CEs. If not, a rise in the short-term interest rate in the CEs could draw more capital from PHs,
pushing down their REER.
         Link 3 – REER in the CEs  REER in the PHs: As was in the previous case, real
appreciation (depreciation) of CEs’ currencies can be followed by real appreciation
(depreciation) of PHs’ currencies, making the correlation positive, which is more likely if PHs
pursue greater exchange rate stability. Or, highly indebted PHs may also try to have their REER




4
  In other words, if a rise (fall) of the short-term interest rates in the CEs is followed by a fall (rise) in the money
growth (or supply) of the PHs, the correlation of the interest rates between the CEs and PHs will be positive. If a rise
(fall) in the CEs’ interest rates is followed by a fall (rise) in money demand among PHs (i.e., a fall in the policy
rate), the correlation would be negative. The latter could more likely happen if PHs have more flexible exchange
rate arrangements as we will see later on.

                                                           4
to follow that of the CEs if their debt is denominated in the currencies of the CEs to prevent debt
burden in their domestic currencies from rising.
           Link 4 – Change in REER in CEs  the Exchange Market Pressure (EMP) in PHs:
When the CE’s experience real appreciation of their currencies, given some price stickiness, that
would create (expected) nominal depreciation pressure on a peripheral economy, raising the
expected rate of return from holding CE’s assets in terms of PH’s currency. If the PHs does not
pursue exchange rate fixity, its currency would depreciate. If it does pursue exchange rate fixity,
then the PH’s monetary authorities would intervene the foreign exchange market, decrease its
holding of foreign reserves, and end up having a higher policy interest rate. Given that the EMP
index is defined as a weighted average of monthly changes in the rate of depreciation, the
percentage loss in international reserves, and the change in the nominal interest rate, whether
PH’s monetary authorities pursue exchange rate fixity (i.e., no currency depreciation but a rise in
the interest rate and a reduction in IR holding) or not (i.e., currency depreciation with no or less
change in the interest rate or IR holding), its EMP should rise. Hence, the CE’s REER should be
positively correlated with the non-center’s EMP.
           Link 5 – REER in CEs  Stock market prices in PHs: In 2013, the U.S. Federal Reserve
hinted at the eventual taper in its purchases of long term Treasury’s and agency bonds (i.e.,
quantitative easing (QE)); that created downward pressure for some emerging market
economies’ currencies, and subsequent downturns in their respective equity markets. This “taper
tantrum” episode and market jitters in the “Fragile Five” (i.e., Brazil, India, Indonesia, South
Africa, and Turkey) constitutes the prime example of how a rise in the exchange rates of the CEs
can lead to a fall in stock market prices of the PHs. Besides this kind of portfolio effect, it can be
anticipated that currency appreciation of the CEs creates expected currency depreciation for the
PHs, and if the PH of concern is more often to international trade, currency depreciation would
give exporters more trade competitiveness, so that stock market prices could rise, reflecting a rise
in future income flows of the firms in the PH.
           We estimate the five linkages with or sensitivity to the CEs’ financial conditions by
applying the same methodology as we employed in Aizenman et al. (2016).5

    Links 1 and 3 are already investigated in Aizenman, et al. (2015).

2.2 The First-Step: Estimating Sensitivity Coefficients
         The main objective of this first step estimation is to estimate the correlation between a
financial variable of the CEs and another (or the same) financial variable of peripheral economy
i, while controlling for global factors. We focus on the estimated coefficient ˆFi

                                                                                    which represents

the extent of sensitivity of the financial variable Yit of country i to another (or the same)

financial variable ( X itC ) of each of the three CEs, i.e., the U.S., the Euro area, and Japan, as
shown in (1): 6

where Z iG is a vector of global factors, and X iC is a vector of cross-country factors.

         We estimate  itC for the five linkages as we discussed in the previous subsection, using
the following variables.

         For money market rates that represent policy short-term interest rate, using official policy
interest rates may not capture the actual state of monetary policy because all of the CEs have

6
  We do not include China as one of the CEs. Aizenman, et al. (2015) find that despite the recent impressive rise as
an economic power, China’s contribution in the financial sector still seems negligible in a historical context.
Considering that the Shanghai stock market crash in the summer of 2015 and the winter of 2016 significantly
affected financial markets in the U.S., Japan, and Europe, one expects that the role of China as a CE and
connectivity with it will become substantial in the near future. The same kind of argument can be made about
whether other large emerging market economies such as Brazil, Russia, and India can be the center economies that
exert global influence. While their role as major economies in the world has been rising, we would still have to wait
for future research to identify their increasing influence in the global economy.
7
  For the Euro Area’s variables before the introduction of the euro in 1999, the GDP-weighted average of the
variable of concern for the original 12 Euro countries is calculated and included in the estimation.

                                                          6
implemented extremely loose monetary policy, whether conventional or unconventional one, in
the aftermath of the GFC.8 Hence, we use the “shadow interest rates” to represent a more
realistic state of liquidity availability for the three advanced economies. For the U.S. and the
Euro area, we use the shadow interest rates estimated by Wu and Xia (2014). For Japan, we use
the shadow rates estimated by Christensen and Rudebusch (2014).
         For the stock market price indices as well as the REER, we use data from the IMF’s
International Financial Statistics (IFS). Also, we calculate the EMP index, using the data for
policy interest rates, nominal exchange rates, and international reserves from the IFS. For more
details on the EMP, refer to Data Appendix.
         We also have global factors ( Z iG ) as a group of control variables in the estimation. The
vector of “real” variables includes global interest rates (for which we use the first principal
component of U.S. Federal Reserve, ECB, and Bank of Japan’s policy interest rates); oil prices;
and commodity prices.9 Z iG also comprises another vector of “financial” global factors, namely,
the VIX index from the Chicago Board Options Exchange as a proxy for the extent of investors’
risk aversion as well as the “Ted spread,” which is the difference between the 3-month
Eurodollar Deposit Rate in London (LIBOR) and the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill yield. The
latter measure gauges the general level of stress in the money market for financial institutions.
         We apply the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method to do the estimation for each of the
sample countries for the five links and for about 100 countries, which include advanced
economies (IDC), less developed countries (LDC), and emerging market countries (EMG) the
latter of which is a subset of LDC.10 Inevitably, the sample size varies depending on data
availability. The sample period is 1986 through 2015, using monthly data, with regressions
implemented over non-overlapping three year periods.11 That means that we obtain time-varying


8
  This is true especially after the ECB and the Bank of Japan lowered their policy rates down to zero but before they
adopted negative interest rates.
9
  Whenever we include a variable for the policy interest rate, whether as a level or a change, in XC (such as the
estimations for Links 1 and 2), we do not include the first component of U.S. FRB, ECB, and Bank of Japan’s
interest rates as part of the global factor vector to avoid redundancy with XC. We also use the first principal
component of oil and commodity prices – to avoid multicollinearity or redundancy – as a control variable for input
or commodity prices.
10
   The emerging market countries (EMG) are defined as the countries classified as either emerging or frontier during
the period of 1980-1997 by the International Financial Corporation plus Hong Kong and Singapore.
11
   The starting date for the sample period is chosen mainly based on data availability for the second-step estimation.
Conceptually, the mid-1980s is also the time when global spillover effects became more evident after financial
integration started taking place first among advanced economies then among less developed countries.

      across the panels. For all the estimations, we exclude the U.S. and Japan. As for the Euro
member countries, they are removed from the sample after the introduction of the euro in
January 1999 or they become member countries, whichever comes first.12

                                                                                      on a number of
country-specific variables. To account for potential outliers on the dependent variable, we apply
the robust regression estimation technique to the following estimation model.13

        Here, the choice of variables is based on a wide variety of literature pertaining to
spillover effects and global synchronization of financial or macroeconomic variables. Hence, we
assume that the above estimation model takes a reduced form, rather than a structural form, by
which we can address various theoretical predictions at once, rather than relying on one
particular theory.
        There are four groups of explanatory variables. The first group of explanatory variables is
a set of open macroeconomic policy choices ( OMPi ), for which we include the indexes for
exchange rate stability (ERS) and financial openness (KAOPEN) from the trilemma indexes by
Aizenman, et al. (2013). As another variable potentially closely related to the trilemma
framework, we include the variable for IR holding (excluding gold) as a share of GDP because
we believe the level of IR holding may affect the extent of cross-country financial linkages.14
        The group MCi includes macroeconomic conditions such as inflation volatility, current
account balance, and public finance conditions. As the measure of public finance conditions, we
include gross national debt expressed as a share of GDP.



12
   Endogeneity can be an issue for this type of estimation. As a robustness check, we re-estimated the first-step
model by lagging the right-hand-side variables. However, it did not change the characteristics of the results (not
reported). Hence, we keep the estimation method as it is.
13
   This estimation method keeps recursively down-weighting the outliers until it obtains converged estimates.
14
   Aizenman, et al. (2010, 2011) show the macroeconomic impact of trilemma policy configurations depends upon
the level of IR holding.

                                                         8
       In addition, we include variables that reflect the extent of linkages with the center
countries (LINK). One linkage variable is meant to capture real, trade linkage, which we measure
as: TR _ LINKip  IMPipC GDPip where IMPi C is total imports into center economy C from

country i, that is normalized by country i’s GDP. Another linkage variable is financial linkage,
FIN_LINKip. We measure it with the ratio of the total FDI stock and bank lending from country
C in country i both as shares of country i’s GDP.
       Another variable that also reflects the linkage with the major economies is the variable
for the extent of trade competition (Trade_Comp). Trade_Comp measures the importance to
country i of export competition in the third markets between country i and major country C.
Shocks to country C, and especially shocks to country C that affects country c’s exchange rate,
could affect the relative price of country C’s exports and therefore affect country i through trade
competition in third markets. See Appendix for the variable construction. A higher value of this
measure indicates country i and major economic C exports products in similar sectors so that
their exported products tend to be competitive to each other.
       The fourth group is composed of the variables that characterize the nature of institutional
development (INST), namely, variables for financial development and legal development. For the
measure of the level of financial development, we use the first principal component of financial
development using the data on private credit creation, stock market capitalization, stock market
total value, and private bond market capitalization all as shares of GDP. Likewise, we measure
the level of legal development using the first principal component of law and order (LAO),
bureaucratic quality (BQ), and anti-corruption measures (CORRUPT). Higher values of these
variables indicate better conditions.
       To control for economic or financial disruptions, we include a vector of currency and
banking crises (CRISIS). For currency crisis, we use a dummy variable based on the exchange
market pressure (EMP) index which is calculated using the exchange rate against the currency of
the base country. The banking crisis dummy is based on the papers by Laeven and Valencia
(2008, 2010, 2012).
       The variables in MC and INST are included in the estimations as deviations from the
U.S., Japanese, and Euro Area’s counterparts. The variables in vectors OMP, MC, and INST are
sampled from the first year of each three year panels to minimize the effect of potential



                                                 9
endogeneity or bidirectional causality.15 Also, in order to capture global common shocks, we also
include time fixed effects.


3    Empirical Results for the Baseline Estimation
3.1 First-Step Estimations – Connectivity with the CEs
          As the first step, we estimate the extent of correlation for each of the five financial
linkages while controlling for two kinds of global factors: “real global” and “financial global,”
using the three-year, non-overlapping panels in the 1986-2015 period.
          To gain a birds-eye view of the empirical results and the general trend of the groups of
factors that influence the financial links, we focus on the joint significance of the variables
included in the real global and financial global groups, and vector XC the latter of which includes
the financial variables of the CEs for each of the five potential financial links (Table 1 and
Figure 1).
          Figure 2 illustrates the proportion of countries for which the joint significance tests are
found to be statistically significant (with the p-value less than 5%) for the real global and
financial global groups, and vector XC for the five financial links. While we present the
proportion for the groups of advanced economies (IDC) and less developed economies (LDC)
after 1992, our discussions focuses on the results of developing countries.16
          The graphical depictions in Figure 2 lead to the following conclusions. First, the
influence of the CEs is the greatest for the policy interest rates and the real effective exchange
rates. That is, the policy interest rates and the REER of the CEs affect most joint-significantly
those of the PHs, respectively. This is consistent with the findings reported in Aizenman et al.
(2016).
          Second, the REER of the CEs significantly affects the stock market price changes of the
PHs during and after the GFC of 2008, though the impact dwindles toward the end of the sample
period. This and previous findings are consistent with the reactions expressed by emerging



15
   Sampling data from the first year of each three-year panel could still entail bidirectional causality. As another way
of mitigating endogeneity or bidirectional causality, we could lag the right-hand-side variables, but by one three-
year panel. Lagging the right-hand-side variables this way could mean that we assume it takes three to five years for
the right-hand-side variables to affect the dependent variable, which we do not think is plausible.
16
   We also conduct the same exercise for the subgroup of EMGs. The figures for the EMG group are usually
qualitatively similar to those of the LDC group. Hence, we omit discussing them here.

                                                          10
market policy makers – especially those in “Fragile Five” – to the taper in Fed quantitative
easing and the Federal Fund rate increase in December 2015.
       Third, the policy interest rates of the CEs do not affect the REER of many PHs. Even
during the GFC and its immediate aftermath, the proportion of the countries for which the policy
interest rates of the CEs are jointly significant is about 20%. A similar observation can be made
for the REER-EMP link.
       Fourth, as far as the policy interest rate link between the CEs and the PHs (Link 1) is
concerned, the proportion of joint significance is also relatively high for the group of “financial
global” variables during the GFC and the last three year panel for developing countries and since
the GFC for developed countries and emerging market countries, suggesting global financial
factors have been playing an important role in affecting the policy interest of countries regardless
of income levels. This result is consistent with the Rey’s (2013) thesis of “global financial
cycles.” Not surprisingly, economies are more exposed to global financial shocks during periods
of financial turbulence while also following CEs’ monetary policies.
       Figure 3 disaggregates the effect of the CEs. The bars illustrate the proportion of the
countries with significant 𝛾̂’s for the three CEs: the United States, the euro area, and Japan. We
see the U.S. financial variables exerting the most significant effects on the financial variables of
the PHs for the policy interest rate link and the REER link in most of the time period, and for the
REER-stock market price link during the GFC years. For the policy interest rate and the REER
links, we see the euro area affecting the financial variables of the PHs as well.


3.2 Results of the Second-Step Estimation
       Now, we investigate the determinants of the extent of linkages, ˆFit
                                                                         C
                                                                             , using the estimation
model based on equation (2). Table 2 reports the estimation results for the five linkages for the
LDC and EMG samples. The bottom rows of the tables also report the joint significance tests for
each vector of explanatory variables.
       We begin by discussing the results for the open macro policy arrangements, namely,
exchange rate stability, financial openness, and IR holding. While PHs with more open financial
markets tend to follow the monetary policy of the CEs, the extent of exchange rate stability they
pursue does not matter (columns 1 and 2). Aizenman et al. (2016) found a significantly positive



                                                 11
estimate for the exchange rate variable, but our estimates are also positive but not statistically
significant.17
         The more stable a PH country’s exchange rate movements are, the more sensitive its
REER to the CEs’ policy interest rates or REER (columns 3-6). These results make sense; PHs
preferring more exchange rate stability follow the CEs’ monetary policy or real appreciation of
the CEs’ currencies, which is what we have observed among emerging market economies in
2013-15.
         Interestingly, higher levels of IR holding would make it easier for both developing and
emerging market countries to follow the currency real appreciation of the CEs, though there is a
possibility this correlation is capturing reverse causality. Also, not surprisingly, PHs with more
open financial markets tend to guide their REER to follow that of the CEs, though the estimate is
marginally significant. Such an observation cannot be made for the EMG group (columns 5 and
6).
         When the CEs experience real appreciation, the more exchange rate stability a PH
pursues, the less pressure it faces on its EMP (columns 7 and 8). At the same time, if the PH has
more open financial markets, it would face less pressure on its EMP when the CEs’ currencies
are appreciating in real terms. The interpretation of this result is difficult; it could be that more
open financial markets are associated with more developed financial markets, that are more
robust to shocks emanating from abroad. Alternatively, countries that are subject to shocks tend
to implement capital controls.
         Open macro policies do not seem to matter for the link between the CEs’ REER and the
PHs’ stock market price movements (columns 9 and 10). The F-test for the joint significance for
the open macro variables is far from significant. Instead, the groups of macroeconomic
conditions and institutional characteristics are found to be jointly significant. Interestingly, PHs
with higher debt levels or higher levels of inflation volatility tend to have their stock market
prices falling when the CEs experience currency real appreciation. We infer that weak
macroeconomic conditions lead to capital flight once the CEs experience real appreciation,
which in turn leads equity market declines. The negative estimate on the current account variable



17
  We do not include the growth rate of industrial production in the first-step estimation to maximize the sample size
of the gammas. This, along with the extended sample period, may explain the different estimation results for the
exchange rate stability index.

                                                         12
indicates that while PHs running current account deficit tend to experience real depreciation
when the CEs’ currencies appreciate in real terms, weaker currencies of PHs could allow their
firms to experience a rise in their income flows, pushing up the stock market prices in those
economies.


4. Impacts of Currency Weights and External Debt
        In addition to the baseline model, we investigate the impact of other factors, especially
those which are related to the balance sheets of the countries. The first factor we investigate is
the extent of belonging to the dollar or euro zone. Clearly, the United States was the epicenter of
the GFC. That means that countries that are dollar-oriented or dollar centric in their trade of
goods and services as well as financial assets must have been more exposed to shocks arising
from the U.S. We can make a similar argument about the extent of belonging to the euro zone
especially since the euro area experienced the debt crisis in the 2010s.
        The other factor, closely linked with the previous factor, is how exposed countries are in
terms of being indebted externally. Highly indebted countries can be more susceptible to external
shocks, especially if the debt is denominated in foreign currencies. We also investigate the
interactive effects of external debt exposure and the extent of reliance on the major currencies for
debt denomination.
        This is a timely question. For the last two decades, the extent of “original sin” – the
inability of developing countries to issue debt in their domestic currencies in international
markets – has been perceived to be declining.18 That stands in contrast to the situation during
emerging market crises of the 1980s through early 2000’s, when all external debt was essentially
foreign currency denominated debt. In such cases, cross border asset-liability currency
mismatches combined with large cross-border holdings meant that currency depreciations could
easily cause liquidity crises.




18
  See Hausmann and Panizza (2011), who argue that the decline in the extent of original sin has been only anecdotal
by showing that the decline in original sin has been modest if any. Ito and Rodriguez (2015) also show that the
extent of reliance on foreign currency denomination for issuing international debt has not changed much for the last
two decades.

                                                        13
4.1 Impacts of Currency Weights and Trade with Currency Zones
4.1.1 Model Framework
         We now investigate the impact of the extent of belonging to a major currency zone.
When PHs’ monetary policy makers make decisions, they almost inevitably incorporate the
monetary policy of the issuer of a major currency which they reference to, or they refer to an
implicit, or de facto, currency basket composed of several major currencies. Hence, once a shock
arises in a CE, reactions by the PHs could be affected by the composition of the major currencies
in the currency basket. That is, the degree of sensitivity among the PHs to the policies and
economic conditions of the CEs can depend upon the weights of the currencies in the basket. In
the analysis below, when, say, the dollar has the highest weight in the basket, we regard the
economy of concern as dollar-oriented or belonging to the dollar zone. The currency weights can
be independent of the degree of exchange rate stability a country pursues.
         Using the widely-used method developed by Haldane and Hall (1991) and popularized by
Frankel and Wei (1996), we estimate the weights of the dollar, the euro (or the German deutsche
mark and the French franc before the introduction of the euro in 1999), the yen, and the British
sterling with a rolling window of 36 months.19
         With the estimated weights, we can test whether and to what extent the weights of
currencies in the basket affect the extent of connectivity between the CEs and the PHs (i.e., 𝛾̂’s )
using the following model:

                                                                                         uFit ,         (3)


where C refers to the CEs: the U.S., the Euro area, and Japan and F to the five financial linkages.
CZWUS, Euro is the estimated weights for the dollar and the euro. 𝐷Γ represents the dummies for
𝛾 𝑈𝑆 and 𝛾 𝐸𝑢𝑟𝑜 .20

19
   The basic assumption of this exercise is that monetary authorities use an implicit or hypothetical basket of
currencies as the portfolio of official foreign exchange reserves, but that the extent of response to the change in the
value of the entire basket should vary over time and across countries. If the authorities want to maintain a certain
level of exchange rate stability, whether against a single currency or a basket of several currencies, they should
allow the currency value to adjust only in accordance with the change in the entire value of the basket of major
currencies. The examples of the application of this method can be found in Frankel and Wei (1996) among many
others.
20
   Keep in mind that we have 𝛾 𝑈𝑆 , 𝛾 𝐸𝑢𝑟𝑜 , and 𝛾 𝐽𝑃 for country i in year t as the dependent variable.

                                                           14
        We focus on 𝜃7 , which includes the interaction term between the dummy for 𝛾 𝑈𝑆 and the
currency zone weight for the dollar (CZWUS) and the one between the dummy for 𝛾 𝐸𝑢𝑟𝑜 and the
currency zone weight for the euro (CZWEuro).
        If the extent of belonging to a currency zone matters, 𝜃̂7 must be statistically significant.
Because we have the two dummies for 𝛾 𝑈𝑆 and 𝛾 𝐸𝑢𝑟𝑜 , the sensitivity to a shock in Japan is
treated as the baseline. Hence, 𝜃6 represents how the dollar or euro currency weight affects the
degree of sensitivity to a shock originating in Japan.
        Hence, for example, if Korea has a high dollar zone weight, the degree of sensitivity to a
financial shock arising from the U.S. (𝛾̂ 𝑈𝑆 ) should be higher if the dollar zone weight (CZWUS) is
higher. Likewise, the impact of the euro weight can be found in 𝜃7 . Also, the dollar or euro zone
weight (CZWUS or Euro) should matter less to the shocks occurring in Japan (𝜃6).21
        One merit of having estimated currency weights for our sample countries is that, using
the estimated currency weights, we can divide the currency zones’ partners of each non-major
currency economy into five currency zones.22 To do so, every non-G5 economy is divided into
G5-currency zones, based on the estimated G5-currency weights, i.e., ˆiht , for the economy. For
example, if Thailand has a currency basket, with the USD weight of a%, the DM weight of b%,
the FF weight of c%, the BP weight of d%, and the yen weight of e%, then we assume that a% of
Thailand’s economy belongs to the USD zone, b% to the DM zone, c% to the FF zone, d% to the
UKP zone, and e% to the yen zone. All other non-G5 economies are similarly divided into G5
currency zones. On the other hand, each of the G5 countries is assumed to constitute its own
currency zone. Then, the trade share of a non-G5 economy (say India) with countries belonging
to a major-currency zone can be calculated first by multiplying ˆiht with bilateral trade with each
partner (say Thailand, while bilateral trade between India and Thailand is defined as the sum of
bilateral exports and imports), and then by summing up all the products over all the bilateral




21
  That means 𝜽6 should have the opposite sign to 𝜽7 or be insignificant.
22
  The choice of the G5 countries is based on the currencies represented by the SDR basket during the sample
period, see https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_sdrv.aspx.

trade pairs. The ratio of this sum to the economy’s (India’s) total trade is regarded as its trade
share with one of the “major-currency zones.”23
            Now, we include the share of trade with respect to the dollar and the euro zones instead
of the dollar and the euro zone weights as follows:

                                                                                  TH _ CZ Fit

                                                                                                       uFit .      (4)


            Like in the previous case, if the shares of trade with countries in the dollar zone or those
                         ̂7 should be statistically significant, and 𝜃̂6 would capture the impact of
in the euro zone matter, 𝜃
trade with the dollar or euro zone countries on the sensitivity to a financial shock arising from
Japan.24


4.1.2 Estimation Results
            Table 3 reports the results for each of the five link regressions. To conserve space, we
only report the estimates for the open macro variables and the variables pertaining to currency
weights.
            Although the extent of belonging to the dollar zone does not matter for the link between
the CEs’ policy interest rates and the PHs’ REER (Link 2), it does matter for the link between
the CEs’ REER and the PHs’ REER (Link 3). If the U.S. experiences a positive (i.e.,
appreciation) shock to its REER, developing countries with higher USD weights tend to
experience REER appreciation, which also applies to the EMGs. The euro weights are always
positive factors for both subgroups. We can also see for both subgroups, the variable for
exchange rate stability is found to be a significantly positive factor. With these results, we see
that both developing and emerging market countries with higher weights of major currencies in
their baskets tend to have the “fear of floating.” These countries are also affected by greater
financial openness and IR holding as well.

     To avoid redundancy, the variable for trade demand by the CEs is removed.

                                                                16
        U.S. REER appreciation would lead to an increase in EMP (Link 4) for both LDCs and
EMGs if they have higher dollar zone weights, and more euro-oriented economies tend to have
smaller or more negative impacts.
        U.S. REER appreciation would cause declines in stock markets in LDCs and EMGs if
their dollar zone weights are higher (Link 5), suggesting that U.S. REER appreciation may cause
capital flight from dollar-oriented countries.
        When we include the share of trade with respect to the dollar and the euro zones,
generally, the estimation results for these variables remain intact qualitatively but usually with
stronger statistical significance. Obtaining essentially consistent results indicate that both
currency weights and the share of trade with the dollar and euro zones matter for the extent of
spillover linkages to the CEs.


4.2 Impacts of External Debt
       We shift our attention to the impact of other balance sheet factors on the extent of
susceptibility to shocks occurring in the CEs. In particular, external debt is our focus since it has
long argued that it increases the level of risk exposure.
       We examine the impacts of the following variables.
           External debt as a share of exports
           External debt as a share of GNI
           Short-term debt as a share of exports
           Short-term debt as a share of total external debt
           Short-term debt as a share of IR


       We report the results for the five links’ estimations in Table 4. The results for Link 1:
policy interest rate link between the CEs and the PHs show that this link is not affected by how
much PHs owe externally. The estimate for the size of (outstanding) international debt securities
is positive, but it is not statistically significant.
       However, the link between the CEs’ policy interest rates and PHs’ REER (Link 2) is
affected by the size of external debt. The estimate for international debt (as a share of GNI) and
the one for external debt (as a share of exports) are significantly negative for the EMG countries.



                                                        17
The results indicate that, for example, a rise in the U.S. policy interest rate would lead more
toward currency real depreciation of a PH if its total external debt is larger.
      Such a negative impact of external debt is also observed when we focus on the REER link
between the CEs and the PHs (Link 3). The estimate on the variable for external debt (as a share
of GNI) is significantly negative among the EMGs. For the LDC group, not just external debt (as
a share of GNI) but also short-term debt (as a share of exports) are found to be negative
contributors to the REER link. These findings suggest that developing or emerging market
countries would find it harder to pursue exchange rate stability against the CEs’ currencies when
they are loaded with external debt.
      Greater levels of external debt or short-term debt would also make PHs’ EMP more
positively correlated with CE’s REER especially among emerging market countries (Link 4).
These results suggest that if the CEs experience real currency appreciation, that would draw
capital flows from emerging market countries, thereby creating upward pressure on the EMP,
explaining why emerging market crises often unhappy when the CEs -- particularly the U.S. --
implement contractionary monetary policy.
      The link between the CEs’ REER change and the PHs’ stock market price changes
become more negative when the PHs are more indebted short-term. Consistent with the previous
case, CEs’ real currency appreciation would cause capital outflows from emerging market
countries, which would cause their stock market prices to fall. Again, being indebted short-term
increases the risk of negative spillover effects from the CEs.


4.3 Impacts of Currency Composition of Debt
      We turn now examining how the composition of external debt, holding constant the level
of debt, affects the linkages. For instance, if a peripheral economy has more dollar-denominated
debt, such an economy should be more vulnerable to spillover effects from the U.S., more so
than to spillovers from other CEs. Hence, the currency composition of the debt is important.
      As has been widely evidenced, many economies are reliant on the dollar or other hard
currencies to issue international debt. However, such reliance would entail intrinsic instability
because currency depreciation would increase the debt burden in terms of the domestic currency
and cause currency mismatch. If a peripheral country issues a large portion of its international



                                                 18
debt in the dollar while pegging its currency to the dollar, expected depreciation would cause a
self-fulfilling twin (i.e., currency and debt) crisis.
       Hence, we take a look at the impact of currency compositions in international debt
denomination, focusing the share of dollar-denominated debt. For that, we use the following
specification.

where CSHUS is the share of the dollar in a certain variable for debt, namely, either public and
publicly guaranteed debt or international debt securities. More specifically, we test the following
six variables for the share of the dollar in debt denomination:


           Dollar-denominated International debt (%) = share of the dollar-denomination in
            total international debt securities, Extracted from the Bank for International
            Settlements (BIS) Debt Securities Statistics.
           Public debt denominated in the dollar (%) = share of dollar-denominated external
            long-term public and publicly-guaranteed debt in total PPG. Extracted from the
            World Bank’s Global Development Indicators.
           Dollar-denominated International debt (%) – financial Institution = share of the
            dollar-denomination in total international debt securities issued by financial
            institutions.
           Dollar-denominated International debt (%) – non-financial Institution = share of the
            dollar-denomination in total international debt securities issued by non-financial
            corporations, BIS
           Dollar-denominated International debt (%) – government sector = share of the
            dollar-denomination in total international debt securities issued by government
            sector, BIS


        We include these variables as both individually and interactively with the dummy for the
correlation with the U.S. (𝛾 𝑈𝑆 ) as we did with the currency weights variables or the variables for

                                                     19
the share of trade with the dollar and the euro. Likewise, the estimate of our focus is 𝜃̂7 , which is
supposed to capture whether and to what extent the share of the dollar in debt affects the
spillover effects arising from the U.S. Since we only focus on the effect of the dollar, 𝜃̂6 would
capture the effect on the share of the dollar in debt denomination on the spillover effects from the
euro area or Japan.
        We report the estimation results in Table 5. In the section for Link 1, the policy interest
rate link, we see that for both the LDC and EMG groups, the estimated extent of linkage is
weaker or more negative if the share of the dollar in international debt securities issued by
financial institute is higher. This result is consistent with the result we obtained when examining
the impact of the dollar weight. Considering that the dollar share in international debt and the
dollar weight in the currency basket are correlated (McCauley and Chen, 2015; Ito, McCauley,
and Chen, 2015), this finding is unsurprising.
        The higher dollar share in international debt securities a PH has, the more positively
correlated its REER to a policy interest rate change in the U.S. (Link 2). However, that applies
only to the dollar share in international debt securities issued by the government sector of the
PH, and the estimates are not statistically significant. One possible explanation is that the PH
would fear fluctuations in its exchange rate against the dollar if it has more government debt
denominated in the dollar (“fear of floating”).
        Such fear of floating is more clearly evidenced in the REER-REER link (Link 3),
whether the debt is issued by financial institution, non-financial institution, or government
sector. The estimates of the interactions terms between the U.S. gamma and the dollar share in
the three types of international debt are all significantly positive for the LDC sample. Simply, if
PH’s international debt is more denominated in the dollar, the PH would try to align its REER
with that of the U.S. In fact, it is not just for international debt securities, the dollar share in
public and publicly guaranteed debt also makes the PH’s REER more sensitive to the U.S.
REER.
        Given the above result for Link 3, it is not surprising that we also find similar results for
the link between PHs’ EMP and the U.S. REER (Link 4). If the U.S. experiences currency real
appreciation, the PHs’ EMP would be more responsive if the dollar share is higher in the
denomination for international debt issued by either financial or non-financial institutions, or for
public and publicly guaranteed debt.

                                                    20
       PHs with more dollar-denominated international debt or public debt also tend to respond
to a change in the U.S. REER more negatively (Link 5). As it happened at the time of the “taper
tantrum,” a rise in the U.S. REER leads to stock market price declines among the PHs with
dollar-denominated international debt or public debt.


5   Concluding Remarks
       Since the U.S. started winding down its unconventional monetary policy in 2013,
emerging market policymakers have anxiously awaited the direction of monetary policy
conducted by advanced economy monetary authorities, especially the Fed. Such concerns
intensified when the Fed terminated its zero interest rate policy in December 2015. In
increasingly integrated global financial markets, connectivity between the center economies and
the peripheral economies has become tighter, increasing the speed and intensity of transmission
and spillover of monetary, financial and policy shocks. This environment has created more
challenges for the policy makers in non-center economies, and indeed has prompted a re-think of
the role of monetary policy and the trilemma hypothesis.
       This paper investigates the questions of whether and how the financial conditions of
developing and emerging market countries are affected by the movements of financial variables
in the center economies (the U.S., Japan, and the Euro area). Our empirical method relies upon a
two-step approach. We first investigate the extent of connectivity for the five linkages between a
financial variable of the CEs and another (or the same) financial variable of the PHs while
controlling for global and domestic factors. In the second step, we treat these estimated
sensitivities as dependent variables, and relate them to a number of country-specific
macroeconomic conditions or policies, real or financial linkages, and the levels of institutional
development. Among these variables, we focus on the impact of balance sheet-related factors,
namely, the weights of major currencies, external debt, and currency compositions of debt.
       From the first-step estimation, we find that for both policy interest rates and the REER,
the link with the CEs has been dominant for developing and emerging market economies in the
last two decades. At the same time, the movements of policy interest rates are found to be more
sensitive to global financial shocks around the time of the emerging markets’ crises in the late
1990s and early 2000s, and since the time of the GFC of 2008.



                                                21
       In the second-step estimation, we generally find evidence that the weights of major
currencies, external debt, and currency compositions of debt affect the degree of connectivity.
We summarize our findings in Table 6.
       More specifically, having a higher weight of the dollar or the euro in the implicit
currency basket would make the response of a financial variable such as REER and EMP in the
PHs more sensitive to a change in key variables in the CEs such as policy interest rates and
REER. Having more exposure to external debt would have similar impacts on the financial
linkages between the CEs and the PHs. Lastly, we find that currency composition in international
debt securities matter. Generally, those economies more reliant on the dollar for debt issuance
tend to be more vulnerable to shocks occurring in the U.S.

    extracted from the IFS.
Gross national debt and general budget balance – both are included as shares of GDP and
    obtained from the World Economic Outlook (WEO) database.
Trade demand by the CEs – TR _ LINKip  IMPipC GDPip where IMP is total imports into center
                                                                       i

    economy C from country i, that is normalized by country i’s GDP based on the data from the
    IMF Direction of Trade database.
FDI provided by the CEs – It is the ratio of the total stock of foreign direct investment from
    country C in country i as a share of country i’s GDP. We use the OECD International Direct
    Investment database.
Bank lending provided by the CEs – It is the ratio of the total bank lending provided by each of
    the CEs to country i shown as a share of country i’s GDP. We use the BIS database.
Trade competition – It is constructed as follows.

    ExpWC ,k is exports from large-country c to every other country in the world (W) in industrial
   sector k whereas ExpWW ,k is exports from every country in the world to every other country in
   the world (i.e. total global exports) in industrial sector k. ExpWi ,k is exports from country i to
   every other country in the world in industrial sector k, and GDPi is GDP for country i. We

   assume merchandise exports are composed of five industrial sectors (K), that is,
   manufacturing, agricultural products, metals, fuel, and food.
   This index is normalized using the maximum value of the product in parentheses for every
   country pair in the sample. Thus, it ranges between zero and one.25 A higher value of this
   variable means that country i’s has more comparable trade structure to the center economies.
Financial development – It is the first principal component of private credit creation, stock
   market capitalization, stock market total value, and private bond market capitalization all as
   shares of GDP.26
Legal development – It is the first principal component of law and order (LAO), bureaucratic
   quality (BQ), and anti-corruption measures (CORRUPT), all from the ICRG database. Higher
   values of these variables indicate better conditions.
Currency crisis – It is from Aizenman and Ito (2014) who use the exchange market pressure
   (EMP) index using the exchange rate against the currency of the base country. We use two
   standard deviations of the EMP as the threshold to identify a currency crisis.
Banking crisis – It is from Aizenman and Ito (2014) who follow the methodology of Laeven and
   Valencia (2008, 2010, 2012). For more details, see Appendix 1 of Aizenman and Ito (2014).
Exchange market pressure (EMP) index –It is defined as a weighted average of monthly changes
   in the nominal exchange rate, the international reserve loss in percentage, and the nominal
   interest rate. The nominal exchange rate is calculated against the base country that we use to
   construct the trilemma indexes (see Aizenman, et al., 2008). The weights are inversely
   related to each country’s standard deviations of each of the changes in the three components
   over the sample countries.

   b stands for the “base country,” which is defined as the country that a home country’s
   monetary policy is most closely linked with as in Shambaugh (2004) and Aizenman, et al.
   (2013). The base countries are Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, India, Malaysia, South
   Africa, the U.K., and the U.S. The base country can change as it has happened to Ireland, for
   example. Its base country was the U.K. until the mid-1970s, and changed to Germany since
   Ireland joined the European Monetary System (EMS).
   To construct the crisis dummies in three-year panels, we assign the value of one if a crisis
   occurs in any year within the three-year period.
Share of export/import – The share of country i’s export to, or import from, a major currency
   country (e.g., Japan) in country i’s total export or import. The data are taken from the IMF’s
   Direction of Trade.

   Because the private bond market capitalization data go back only to 1990, the FD series before 1990 are
extrapolated using the principal component of private credit creation, stock market capitalization, and stock market
total values, which goes back to 1976. These two FD measures are highly correlated with each other.

                                                                                                 28
Commodity export/import as a percentage of total export/import – Data are taken from the
   World Bank’s World Development Indicators and the IMF’s International Financial
   Statistics.
Currency weights (CZW) – First, we run the following estimation model:
            eitUSD  i  iJYt eitJY  iBPt eitUKP  iDMt eitDM  iFFt eitFF   it .

        Here, eit is the nominal exchange rate of home currency i , against the dollar (USD), yen (JP),
        pound (UKP), Deutsche mark (DM), and French franc (FF). The major currencies in the
        right-hand side of the estimation equation can be thought of comprising an implicit currency
        basket in the mind of the home economy’s policymaker. Therefore, ̂ ih , the estimated
        coefficient on the rate of change in the exchange rate of major currency h vis-à-vis the U.S.
        dollar, represents the weight of currency h in the implicit basket. The weight of the dollar
                                                                                
        can be calculated as ˆiUSt  1  ˆiJYt  ˆiBPt  ˆiDMt  ˆiFFt .27 We apply the estimation model
        to each of our sample currencies, but estimate it over rolling windows of 36 months. Hence,
        the coefficients ̂ ih ’s are time-varying in monthly frequency to reflect the assumption that
        policymakers keep updating their information sets and, thus, currency weights. This rolling
        regression is not run for the G5 currencies, but their currency weights are set at the value of
        one, that is, each of the G5 countries is assumed to constitute its own currency zone without
        depending on other major-currency exchange rates. For the estimations, we use monthly
        data from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics. Outliers observed for the estimated
         ˆiht due to financial or macroeconomic turbulences are deleted on a monthly basis. Any
        significantly negative ˆiht is assumed to be a missing estimate and a statistically
        insignificant negative ˆiht is replaced with a value of zero. Likewise, any ˆiht that is
    significantly no greater from the value of one is replaced with the value of one, while ˆiht
    significantly greater than one is replaced with a missing variable. Once outliers are removed
    and some estimates are replaced with other valued on a monthly basis, they are annually
    averaged to create annual data series.
Trade share with respect to each currency zone (TSH_CZ) – Using the estimated currency
   weights, we first divide the trade partners of each non-major currency economy into five
   currency zones. Each of major currency countries is assumed to constitute its own currency
   zone. Then, the trade share of a non-G5 economy (say India) with countries belonging to a
   major-currency zone can be calculated first by multiplying ˆiht with bilateral trade with each
   partner (say Thailand, so bilateral trade between India and Thailand is defined as the sum of
   bilateral exports and imports), and then by summing up all the products over all the bilateral
   trade pairs. The ratio of this sum to the economy’s (India’s) total trade is regarded as its trade
   share with one of the “major-currency zones.”
Foreign currency-denominated international debt (% of GNI) – International debt securities
   denominated in any currency than the domestic currency (of the issuer), normalized by Gross
   National Income. The external debt data are extracted from the BIS International Debt

     If the home currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar (e.g., Hong Kong dollar), then ˆiUSt  1 and          ˆ  0 . For
