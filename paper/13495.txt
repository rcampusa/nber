                                              ABSTRACT

This paper reexamines differences found between income gradients in American and English children's
health, in results originally published by Case, Lubotsky and Paxson (2002) for the US, and by Currie,
Shields and Wheatley Price (2007) for England. We find that, when the English sample is expanded
by adding three years of data, and is compared to American data from the same time period, the income
gradient in children's health increases with age by the same amount in the two countries. In addition,
we find that Currie, Shields and Wheatley Price's measures of chronic conditions from the Health Survey
of England were incorrectly coded. Using correctly coded data, we find that the effects of chronic
conditions on health status are larger in the English sample than in the American sample, and that
income plays a larger role in buffering children's health from the effects of chronic conditions in England.
We find no evidence that the British National Health Service, with its focus on free services and equal
access, prevents the association between health and income from becoming more pronounced as children
grow older.

I. Introduction

A growing empirical literature examines the relationship between family income and child

health. An article by Case, Lubotsky and Paxson (2002) (CLP) shows that, in the United States,

the socioeconomic gradient in adult health has its origins in childhood. Using data from 1986 to

1994, they find that poor children are reported by their parents to be in worse health than wealthy

children, and this gradient becomes larger as children grow older. These results suggest that the

relationship between income and health that is observed in adulthood has its roots in childhood.

Currie and Stabile (2003) present evidence on income gradients in the health of Canadian

children at different ages. The Canadian and American results are strikingly similar, and suggest

that the adoption of a Canadian-style universal health insurance program in the US would do

nothing to reduce the differences in health status between poor and rich children.

       A recent article in this journal, “The child health/family income gradient: Evidence from

England” (Alison Currie, Michael A. Shields and Stephen Wheatley Price, 2007) argues that

income gradients in the health of English children differ from those observed in either the US or

Canada. Using data from the 1997 to 2002 Health Survey for England (HSE), Currie, Shields and

Wheatley Price (CSW) conclude that English health gradients in income are small and increase

little as children grow older. These findings are consistent with other research from England,

which indicates that SES gradients in health that are present in earlier childhood flatten or

disappear in adolescence, and reappear in adulthood (West, 1997; West and Sweeting, 2004).

CSW suggest that the British National Health Service, with its focus on free services and equal

access, may prevent the association between health and income from becoming more

pronounced as children grow older.
       CSW also follow CLP by investigating the role of chronic conditions in the gradient in

health. The American evidence indicates that poor children are more likely than wealthy children

to experience some (although not all) chronic health conditions; these differences in the

prevalence of chronic conditions across income groups can explain part of the association

between income and health status. In addition, among US children with the same health

conditions, those who are richer are reported to be in better health than those who are poorer,

suggesting that the chronic conditions of wealthier children are less severe, or are better

managed. The results in CSW differ from CLP in that a number of the chronic conditions they

examine are not associated with worse health status. For example, they find that asthma—a

relatively common chronic condition in both countries—is positively, although not significantly,

associated with better health in the HSE. CSW also find little evidence that income buffers health

status from the adverse effects of chronic conditions.

       These cross-country differences may provide information on the effectiveness of national

health systems. However, they may also reflect other factors—such as differences in research

methods, sample sizes, sample periods and variable definitions. This paper re-examines

differences between American and English income gradients in children’s health, paying careful

attention to these issues. We find that, when the English sample is expanded by adding three

years of data, and is compared to American data from the same time period, the income gradient

in children’s health increases with age by the same amount in the two countries. It is still the case

that the income gradient in children’s health is smaller in England than in the United States. This

may be due to genuine differences in the gradient, or differences in how health status is reported.

Finally, we note that the CSW’s measures of chronic conditions were incorrectly coded. We

present and discuss results based on correctly coded data from the HSE. These indicate that the




                                                 2
effects of chronic conditions on health status are larger in the English sample than in the

American sample, and that income plays a larger role in buffering children’s health from the

effects of chronic conditions in England.



II. Data

Our results from England are based on the 1997-2005 Health Surveys for England (HSE). The

HSE comprises a series of annual surveys designed to provide information on the nation’s health.

Starting in 1995, up to two children per household, aged 2 to 15, were included in the survey. In

2001, the survey was extended to include infants and toddlers (under 2 years old). In addition to

the general population sample, each year the HSE has a special focus on a different demographic

group, such as ethnic groups, children and young people, or older people.

       Following CSW, we use only observations from the general population sample, which

provides a sample of 22,077 children aged 15 and under. We drop the observations for which

parents’ data cannot be matched to that of their children, or parental responsibility lay solely with

grandparents or siblings. In addition, we drop observations for which income data are not

provided by a parent and those for which self-assessed general health variable is not reported,

resulting in a sample of 19,567 children. Our sample for the years 1995 to 2002—the time period

CSW use—contains 13,781 observations, very close to the 13,745 observations used in CSW.

Adding the 2003-2005 years to CSW’s dataset increases the sample size most dramatically for

children under 2 years of age, who were not covered by the HSE until 2001.

       Results for the United States are based on the National Health Interview Study (NHIS).

This survey collects annual data on health for children and adults from large nationally-

representative samples. We use samples from two time periods: 1986-1995 and 1998-2005. The




                                                 3
earlier NHIS sample is identical to that used for CLP with the exception that, to make our results

comparable to those in CSW, we exclude children ages 16 and 17. This yields a sample of

206,640 children between the ages of 0 and 15. For the 1998 to 2005 period, we adopted sample

selection criteria that matched those of CSW as closely as possible: we excluded those children

for whom parent information could not be matched to that of their children; those who were not

cared for by a parent; and those for whom income data were missing. The NHIS was redesigned

between 1996 and 1997. We did not use the 1997 NHIS because the variables needed to link

children to their parents’ records were not included in this year. After the redesign, the NHIS

collected a limited amount of health information for all family members, and more detailed

information for a randomly-selected “sample adult” and (if relevant) “sample child”. We use data

on children from the “family” files, since they contain all the variables we need and yield a larger

sample of 142,326 children between the ages of 0 and 15.

       The key health measure we use is an ordinal rating of the child’s health, referred to as

“health status.” It is important to note that the response categories for health status differ across

the two countries. In the HSE, the response categories are 1=very good, 2=good, 3=fair, 4=bad,

and 5=very bad. In the United States, the response categories are 1=excellent, 2=very good,

3=good, 4=fair, and 5=poor. The distributions of health status for children ages 0-15 from the

1997-2005 HSE and the 1998-2005 NHIS are shown in Table 1.

       The difference in the wording of the categories makes it impossible to draw conclusions

about differences in the levels of health status between English and American children. If

respondents in the two countries interpreted the wording of the response categories literally and

identically, these numbers suggest that American children are in better health than English

children: 84.2 percent of American children are in “very good” or “excellent” health whereas




                                                  4
only 57.4 percent of English children were in the top category of “very good” (which, if the

categories are taken literally, should include children in “excellent” health.) If, instead,

respondents answer the question so that a response of 1 in England means the same as a response

of 1 in the United States, and so on, then these distributions imply that the health status of

English children exceeds that of Americans. Another feature of the data that make comparisons

difficult is that, in the HSE, children ages 13 to 15 reported their own health status. In the NHIS,

children under the age of 17 were not given the option of reporting on their own health. If

children ages 13 to 15 use different criteria, or weight criteria differently, when assessing their

health than do their primary care givers, this could have an effect on the gradients estimated for

them. For this reason, we highlight the differences in English and American results among

children ages 0 to 12.

       Our focus is on the relationship between health status and family income. In both the

HSE and the NHIS, family income is coded in brackets. In the 1998-2005 NHIS, the 11 brackets

used are in increments of $5,000 up to $25,000, and then in increments of $10,000 up to the

highest category of “$75,000 and above”. The HSE uses 31 brackets that range from less than

₤520 to more than ₤150,000. For the HSE and the 1998-2005 NHIS, we follow CSW and assign

each child an income level at the mid-point of the bracketed value, with income top-coded at the

maximum bracket value. The resulting income values were then adjusted for the changes in the

cost of living over time. This was done using the monthly Average Earnings Index for the HSE,

and the quarterly Consumer Price Index for the 1998-2005 NHIS. CLP used a slightly different

procedure for handling bracketed values for the 1986-1995 NHIS. They used income data from

the Current Population Survey (which is not bracketed) to compute average income within




                                                  5
brackets, assigned those averages to children in the NHIS, and then deflated using the consumer

price index. However, the results are not sensitive to the procedure used.

III. Income Gradients in Children’s Health

Table 2 presents results on the income gradients in children’s health in the HSE and the NHIS,

for the full samples and for children of different age groups. We show coefficients from ordered

probit regressions, in which the five-point scale of health status is regressed on the logarithm of

family income and a set of additional controls. Note that the ordered probit regressions should

produce results that are comparable across data sets despite the differences in the response

categories for health status. The ordered probits estimate a function that relates an unobserved,

continuous health measure to the logarithm of income and the other controls. If this underlying

function is correctly specified and identical in the two countries, then the same point estimates

should be obtained even if the “cut points” that define the ordered categories differ.

       The controls included in the ordered probits are chosen to match those used by CSW, and

include age and year dummies, indicators for the child’s sex and ethnicity, the logarithm of

family size, the age of each of the parents, and indicators for whether the mother and father were

absent from the household.1 We do not know if CSW weighted their regressions using the

sampling weights provided in the survey. All the results we show use weights, although their use

makes very little difference to any of the estimates.

        Panel A contains results from the HSE. We first show estimates from the first panel of

Table 1 from CSW, for the 1997-2002 HSE, followed by our replication of these results using

data from the same time period. The third set of estimates in Panel A is based on the larger 1997

to 2005 sample. Panel B shows results from the NHIS. The first set of estimates in this panel, for

1
 The parents’ ages were interacted with an indicator equal to 1 if the parent is present, and 0
otherwise.


                                                 6
1986-1995, are similar to those published in CLP. They differ only in that 16- and 17-year olds

are excluded, the regressions are weighted, and the same controls as in CSW are included in the

models. This permits direct comparisons across the samples, with the caveat that 13 to 15-year-

olds report for themselves in the HSE and are reported on by their parents in the NHIS. The

second set of results in Panel B is for the 1998-2005 NHIS. The most directly comparable sets of

numbers across the two countries are for children ages 0-12 in the 1998-2005 NHIS and the

1997-2005 HSE.

       The results in Panel A indicate that we are able to nearly replicate of CSW’s published

results for the 1997-2002 HSE, despite small differences in our samples. Higher incomes are

associated with better health status (note that higher values of health status correspond to worse

health). The coefficient on the logarithm of income over all children is approximately –0.19. The

gradient is smallest—a value of about –0.14—for children ages 0 to 3. It increases to –0.212 for

children ages 4 to 8, and then stabilizes. However, the conclusion that the gradient does not

increase with age after age 4 is sensitive to the years of the HSE that are used in the analyses.

When the 2003-2005 survey years are added, the income gradient in health increases through age

12. The gradient continues to be smaller for children ages 13-15 years old than for those ages 9-

12. This may be a genuine decline or an artifact of the switch from parent reporting to child

reporting.

       Like CSW, we find that income gradients in children’s health increase with age more for

the 1986-1995 NHIS (first set in Panel B) than for the 1997-2002 HSE. Between ages 0-3 and 9-

12, the income gradient increases (in absolute value) by 0.104 using the 1986-1995 NHIS, and

by 0.060 using the 1997-2002 HSE. However, this difference in the increase in the gradient with

age vanishes when results for the 1997-2005 HSE are compared with those from the 1998-2005




                                                  7
NHIS. Using these samples, the increase in the gradient from ages 0-3 to 9-12 is 0.088 for the

HSE and 0.065 for the NHIS. This convergence is driven by two factors. The first is that the

increase in the English income gradient becomes larger when 3 years of data are added to the

HSE. The second is that the increase in the American income gradient becomes smaller when the

more recent NHIS sample is used.

        Although the income gradient in health status increases by the same amount across the

two countries when similar years of data and larger sample sizes are used, there is nonetheless a

substantial difference in the size of the income gradient across the two countries. The coefficient

on the logarithm of income for all children combined is –0.194 using the 1997-2005 English

data, relative to –0.262 using the more recent American data. One possible reason for this

difference is that, in England, there may be smaller disparities in health status across wealthier

and poorer children with the same chronic conditions. CSW addressed this possibility in their

paper; we re-examine this in the next section.



IV. Health conditions and health status

Like CLP, CSW present estimates of regressions of a measure of health status on whether the

child has a chronic condition, the child’s family income, and the interaction between the two.

These estimates provide evidence on whether chronic conditions result in worse health status,

and whether higher incomes buffer children from the adverse effects of chronic conditions on

health status.

        We were unable to replicate any of CSW’s estimates that used measures of chronic

conditions. In addition, our estimates of the prevalence of chronic conditions among children in

the HSE are substantially different from those reported in CSW. Table 3 shows CSW’s published




                                                 8
prevalence rates, and our estimates of rates using the 1997-2002 and the 1997-2005 HSE. The

rates published by CSW are much too high for some conditions: they show 5.4 percent of

children having arthritis, 3.6 percent as having experienced a cerebral hemorrhage, 3.3 percent

having diabetes, and 2.9 percent having hypertension. Our estimates show markedly lower rates

for these conditions, and somewhat higher rates for some more common childhood conditions

such as asthma (10.5 percent in our replication versus 7.5 percent in CSW) and skin complaints

(3.8 percent versus 2.7 percent.) Personal correspondence with one of the authors of CSW

confirmed that an error had occurred when the measures of chronic conditions were coded.

       Even with correctly coded measures, there are several reasons why comparisons between

results based on the HSE and the results in CLP are difficult. The first is that the questions that

elicit information about chronic conditions differ across the surveys. The conditions shown in

Table 3 are drawn from the HSE’s questions about “long-standing illnesses”. Parents (or, for

children ages 13-15, children) were asked whether the child has a long-standing illness. If so, the

respondent was asked to list up to six illnesses. These reports can be used to construct measures

of chronic conditions, such asthma, bronchitis, mental illness and digestive problems. The 1986-

1995 NHIS followed different procedures for measuring chronic conditions. Before the redesign,

the NHIS randomly allocated families to “condition lists” that focused on subgroups of illnesses,

and information was collected on all illness on the list for each family member. The NHIS

questions on conditions were typically of the form “Has a doctor ever told you that [child] has

[condition]?” Although some of the chronic conditions, such as asthma, are narrowly-enough

defined that they are plausibly comparable across the data sets, others—such as mental illness in

the HSE—have no analog in the NHIS. A second issue is that precise estimates of the effects of

rare chronic conditions on health status require large sample sizes. The HSE sample is too small




                                                  9
to examine how conditions such as hypertension or diabetes, which are quite rare in children, are

related to health status.

        Table 4 presents results from the 1986-1995 NHIS and the 1997-2005 HSE. We first

show results for a subset of four chronic conditions—asthma, bronchitis, blindness or vision

problems, and digestive problems—that are roughly comparable across the surveys and have a

prevalence in excess of 1 percent in the HSE. Following CLP, we estimate equations of the form:

(1)     h = β 0 + β1 (ln y − ln y ) + β 2 C + β 3 [C × (ln y − ln y )] + Xδ + ε ,

where h is an indicator of poor health (fair or poor in the NHIS; fair, bad or very bad in the HSE);

(ln y − ln y ) is the deviation of the logarithm of income from its sample mean, C is an indicator that a

child has a health condition, and X denotes the controls listed in the note to Table 2. Because income is

centered around its mean, β 2 measures the effect of the condition on health status at mean income. The

coefficient β 3 shows how the effects of the chronic condition on health status differ across higher and

lower income children. CLP estimated (1) separately for each condition because the 1986-1995 NHIS

surveys did not collect information on all conditions for any single child. However, for data sets such as

the HSE where complete information is collected for each child, it is possible to estimate regressions that

include indicators for all conditions and their interactions with income. Including all conditions at once

mitigates biases that result from co-morbidity.

        Table 4 first shows results from the 1986-1995 NHIS. The estimation technique is identical to

that in CLP, except that we have restricted the sample to children ages 0-15 and have weighted the

regressions, and the estimation results are very similar to those in CLP. Each of the conditions listed is

associated with worse health status. For example, the estimates of β 2 indicate that, at mean log income, a

child with asthma is 9.5 percentage points more likely to be in fair or poor health, and a child with

digestive problems is 7.0 percentage points more likely to be in fair or poor health. The estimates of

β 3 indicate that the effect of each condition on health status declines as income rises. For example,



                                                     10
asthma is associated with an increase in the probability of being in fair or poor health of 12.3 percentage

points when family income is at the 25th percentile and by 6.3 percentage points when family income is at

the 75th percentile.

        The second and third sets of results in Table 4 indicate that, in the HSE, chronic conditions have

larger effects on health status than in the NHIS, and income plays a larger role in buffering health from

the adverse effects of chronic conditions. The estimates in the middle panel are based on regressions that

include one condition at a time, and so are comparable to the NHIS results. The estimates of both β 2 and

β 3 for the HSE are larger (in absolute value) than those for the NHIS. The English estimates of β 2 are

more than double those for the US. The last two columns of Table 4 show results of a regression that

includes all of the conditions listed in Table 3 and their interactions with income. (The very low

prevalence conditions are grouped together under “all other conditions.) When all conditions are included,

the effects of each of the original four conditions on health status are somewhat attenuated, as are the

coefficients on the interaction terms, but both sets are still large and highly significant. These results

indicate large differences in the health status of poorer and wealthier English children with the same

chronic conditions.



V. Conclusion

Measured using the association between the log of family income and children’s reported health

status, income gradients in children’s health status are larger in the US than in England. One

possible explanation for this finding, and one offered by CSW, is that English children have

equal access to high quality health care, whereas poor American children receive less and/or

lower quality health care. However, two of our results are not consistent with this explanation.

First, the increase in the gradient with age is the same in England and the United States, at least

up through age 12 (which is the oldest age for which the measures of health status are




                                                      11
comparable.) If health care is responsible for the smaller income gradient in health status in

England, these positive effects do not appear to accumulate as children grow older. Second,

chronic health conditions have larger adverse effects on English children’s health status, and

income plays a larger role in buffering their health status from the effects of chronic conditions.

One would expect that accessible and high quality health care would dampen the effects of

chronic conditions on health status, and make the effects of conditions on health status less

dependent on income.

         It is possible that the differences in the results across the two countries do not reflect

anything about the environments of or systems of health care in the two countries. Instead, it may

be that comparisons based on different surveys—with different wording of questions, data

collection protocols, and sample sizes—make precise comparisons impossible.

Notes: All results shown for the HSE are based on a sample of 19,567 children. The NHIS sample sizes differ because different families
were randomly assigned to different sets of health questions. The regressions are estimated using ordinary least squares, and are weighted
using sampling weights. The numbers in parentheses are robust standard errors.
The regressions are of the form: h = β 0 + β1 (ln y − ln y ) + β 2 C + β 3 [C × (ln y − ln y )] + Xδ + ε , where h is an indicator of poor
health, as noted above; (ln y − ln y ) is the deviation of the logarithm of income from its sample mean, C is an indicator that a child has
a health condition, and X are the controls listed in the note to Table 2. The first 5 columns show results of regressions that includes one
condition and one interaction between the condition and income. The last two columns show results in which all conditions and their
interactions with income are included in a single regression.
