                                           ABSTRACT

     Although it is evident that R&D has undergone a process of internationalization, and that the
less-advanced economies are becoming increasingly involved in this process, the substantial body
of literature in this area has been based largely on the experiences of the developed countries. This
paper aims to contribute to the understanding of this issue by examining R&D internationalization
within a newly-industrializing economy, a prime example of which is Taiwan, and focuses
especially on factors underlying locational advantage in attracting multinationals’ offshore R&D.

     We begin with an examination of the literature on R&D internationalization and globalization,
based upon which we emphasize the significance of ‘first-tier supplier advantage’ in a Taiwanese
context. We take advantage of an official database to reveal the patterns of foreign corporate R&D
in Taiwan and to systematically examine the determinants of the R&D intensity of foreign affiliates
at industry level. Our empirical results show that within Taiwan, foreign affiliates with higher R&D
intensity tend to be more export oriented, are localized within Taiwan in terms of their sourcing of
materials and capital goods, and belong to sectors with a larger pool of R&D labor.

INTRODUCTION
Recent decades have witnessed the upsurge of East Asia as a major manufacturing base
within the developing world, initially as a result of the catching-up of Asian ‘newly
industrializing countries’ (NICs), and more recently as a result of the emergence of newly
developing econom within the region, mainland China in particular. This has much to do
with both indigenous innovation and the relocation of the value chain activities of
multinationals (MNCs). Lall (2003) elaborates on these two points, arguing that the
performance of economies such as Taiwan and Korea may be attributed more to the
former, whilst other less-advanced economies within the region may be gaining more
momentum from the latter.
     There has, however, been a growing trend for countries in East Asia to seek to attract
the R&D facilities of MNCs. On the one hand, not all foreign direct investment (FDI) has
equal value because many of the MNCs’ subsidiaries are as footloose as ‘branch plants’,
which can of course lead to the so-called ‘branch plant syndrome’ (Firn, 1975). By contrast,
MNCs’ subsidiaries with strong R&D mandates as well as strategic geographical or product
range responsibilities tend to adhere more to the host economy and are hence considered to
be highly desirable in terms of their effects on local wealth generation. There is, on the other
hand, a matching trend within the process of globalization, which has MNCs consolidating
the R&D activities of their subsidiaries on a global scale (Petrella, 1989; OECD, 1997; Patel
and Pavitt, 1998; Guellec et. al., 2001; Kaufmann and Tödtling, 2001).
     More importantly, the outreach of MNCs’ R&D activities was initially geared to the
developed countries, but this has more recently focused on the developing world (Reddy,
2000). In particular, countries such as India (Reddy, 2000) and China (Xue and Wang, 2001;
Chen et al., 2002; Walsh, 2003) have been documented as less advanced but nevertheless
high-profile host countries for MNCs’ offshore R&D facilities. The literature on R&D
internationalization has proliferated over the past decade, focusing mainly on issues such as
the current trends (OECD, 1997; Patel and Pavitt, 1998; Cantwell and Santangelo, 1999;
Gerybadze and Reger, 1999; Voelker and Stead, 1999; Patel and Pavitt, 2000; Kumar, 2001;
Guellec et. al., 2001), organizational evolution (Zedtwitz, 2002; Gassman and Zedtwitz, 2002),
and MNCs’ motives (De Meyer, 1993; Paoli and Guercini, 1997; Cantwell and Santangelo,
1999; Gerybadze and Reger, 1999; Zander, 1999). More recent research has addressed the
locational aspect of MNCs’ R&D facilities, especially within a host country (Cantwell and
Mudambi, 2000; Cantwell and Iammarion, 2000; Frost and Zhou, 2000). However, the
relevant literature remains largely based on the experiences of the developed countries.

                                               1
     Furthermore, less attention has been paid to research issues concerning the deepening
of foreign corporate R&D activities in host countries, especially for those that are less
advanced. Foreign corporate R&D deepening has been recognized as a means for host
countries to anchor foreign-owned firms (Kearns and Ruane, 2001). This is particularly
important for a less-advanced country aiming to enhance the commitment of MNCs to its
domestic economy even as its comparative advantage shifts. Moreover, the deepening of
foreign corporate R&D in the domestic regions is useful in terms of capitalizing on the
agglomeration effect of corporate R&D activities (Carrincazeaux, et al, 2001). Nonetheless,
the substantial body of the ‘site-selection’ literature has focused mainly on the geography of
new R&D facilities and investment by MNCs whilst completely disregarding the fact that
this may involve a cumulative process of expansion, contraction and adaptation of firms’
existing facilities in host-country locations (Frost and Zhou, 2000).
     Set against the above background, this paper aims to contribute to the current
understanding of R&D internationalization by exploring factors underlying R&D activities
in less-advanced economies, with Taiwan standing out as a prime example. The authors
are aware that countries such as China and India have drawn considerable attention with
regard to this issue (for example Reddy, 2000; Xue and Wang, 2001; Chen, et. al., 2002;
Walsh, 2003), but on the one hand, little systematic evidence has yet been produced on
this issue, whilst on the other hand, their unique attributes, such as huge market potential,
may undermine the applicability of the experiences of these two countries to other
less-advanced economies. By contrast, Taiwan, like the majority of the less-advanced
economies, has a small domestic market; hence our empirical analyses will focus on the
industrial and/or micro aspect of the issues concerned. In particular, our studies aim to
identify industrial conditions in a less-advanced country that may lead to the deepening of
the offshore R&D activities of MNCs. Whilst the determinants of foreign R&D have been
explored within the current research using aggregate macro-level country-specific data,
the role played by industrial conditions in a less-advanced host country remains largely
unexplored to date.
     Our empirical work draws on the ‘Statistics on Overseas Chinese and Foreign
Investment’ a Taiwanese government database concerning foreign corporations’ business
operation activities in Taiwan, which enables us to utilize the aggregate industrial level
and time-series data to examine the issues concerned. The paper is organized as follows.
The next section begins with an examination of the literature on R&D internationalization
in order to highlight factors that may be considered as locational advantages for a

                                               2
less-advanced host country in attracting MNCs’ offshore R&D. We borrow the concept of
‘locational advantage’ from Dunning’s well-known eclectic paradigm and emphasize the
significance of ‘first-tier supplier advantage’ in a Taiwanese context. In the third section,
we take advantage of an official database to reveal the patterns of foreign corporate R&D
in Taiwan, followed in the subsequent section by a description of the research strategy
employed in the paper, in terms of the model specifications and data source. The empirical
results are presented and discussed in the penultimate section, followed in the final section
by some general conclusions drawn from this study.


LOCATIONAL ADVANTAGE OF R&D INTERNATIONALIZATION

In the studies on R&D globalization, the bottom line appears to be that although not yet
truly globalized, R&D is undergoing a process of globalization (Howells, 1992) and that
its progress varies across sectors and economies (Casson and Singh, 1993; Dunning, 1994).
Although more recent literature (OECD, 1997; Patel and Pavitt, 1998; Guellec, et. al.,
2001; Cantwell and Santangelo, 1999; Gerybadze and Reger, 1999) has also confirmed
that this is an escalating trend, despite this trend, the globalization of R&D has largely
been considered as a developed country-centric phenomenon.
     Reddy (2000), amongst others, has revealed a rising trend in terms of the R&D
operations of MNCs in the developing world. The factors underlying this trend, as
highlighted by Reddy, can be summarized as follows. In specific terms, MNCs are
themselves facing an increasing need to monitor and learn the new global trends, and
hence, to engage in multi-sourcing of technology inputs, partly because of rising R&D
costs, the increasing demand for R&D personnel and a shortage of R&D personnel in the
industrialized countries. Conversely, some, if not a great many, of the less-advanced
economies are able to provide an abundant supply of R&D personnel or skills, especially
with regard to the so-called ‘non-core’ R&D areas. This match of supply and demand has
been facilitated by factors such as improved information and communication technologies,
the flexibility of new technologies which allows de-linking of manufacturing and R&D,
and the comparative advantages of the less-advanced host countries.
     For our empirical work, we propose a concept framework for further analysis which
is essentially based on Dunning’s (1993) eclectic paradigm, with a strong flavor of the
evolutionary approach to technology (Nelson and Winter, 1982; Frost and Zhou, 2000).
According to Dunning, where firms possess advantages of ownership and internalization,


                                             3
and host countries enjoy locational advantages, international production may take place. In
our view, Dunning’s paradigm may be useful for analyzing the offshore R&D activities of
MNCs if one interprets ownership, internalization and locational advantages in the context
of R&D, with these advantages being related mainly to the technological routines and
trajectories of the firms and the host countries (Dosi, 1982). In short, what a firm and an
economy can do, or is about to do, is linked strongly to their routines and previous bases.
     In our opinion, the ownership advantages of MNCs generally lie in their core
technology and world-class brand names. Their core technologies allow them to set the
agenda, at an international level, and influence the way in which technology will progress,
whilst their world-class brand names enable them to gain direct access to customers and
marketplaces, which in turn facilitate their initiation of concepts for product development
and the means of further exploiting market potential elsewhere.
    The internalization advantages of MNCs may include systems integration capabilities,
product planning capabilities, market access advantages and information and
communication networks. In particular, with systems integration capabilities and
information and communication networks at their disposal, they may be able to deploy
core and non-core R&D across boundaries, whilst maintaining control over the profits
generated during the whole process. Likewise, the possession of product planning
capabilities and market access advantages means that MNCs have control over the two
ends of the ‘smiling curve’ and hence, have the final say in the benefits derived from the
entire value-chain they face.
     With regard to Taiwan as a location for offshore R&D by MNCs, we have to refer to
the way in which economic development has evolved on the island, since it is well known
as a typical example of the export-oriented industrialization paradigm. Although this goes
hand in hand with the process of migration from labor-intensive sectors towards
high-technology and capital-intensive industries, Taiwan’s major sectors are characterized
by their vertical disintegration and the pursuit of ‘original equipment manufacturer’ or
‘original design manufacturer’ (OEM/ODM) contracts for brand marketers, without direct
access to the final market. In terms of R&D, local firms may, in general, lack systems
integration capabilities and the ability to take the initiative in product and technology
development; however, some of the industrial players may be positioned as ‘first-tier
suppliers’ possessing innovation capabilities in certain areas and industrial segments,
which could be considered as Taiwan’s main locational advantage in offshore R&D. A
notable example at issue is Intel which has recently set up an R&D and innovation center

                                             4
in Taiwan dedicated to product innovation in WLAN partly because Taiwan has been the
major global supplier of WLAN sets. Other examples involving Sony and HP seem to
follow the same logic. This is particularly feasible for a sector such as information
technology (IT), because Taiwanese IT firms have evolved from pure manufacturers
towards integrated service providers, giving rise to intensified interdependence between
the network flagships and their Taiwanese subcontractors (Chen, 2002). That said, even in
an industry such as footwear, we can find the collocation of Nike’s main offshore R&D
center and its main supplier, Pao Cheng Industrial Corporation, in Taichung.
     In order to elaborate on this point, within an economy such as that of Taiwan,
industrial clusters co-evolve with the international industrial structure of the sectors
concerned. In addition, whether or not these industrial clusters are sustainable depends
heavily on the extent of ‘localization’ which may involve at least two things: firstly, the
presence of indigenous firms with substantial innovation capabilities; and secondly, the
ability to ‘anchor’ the ‘network flagships’. With regard to the latter, we mean more than
the local operations or investments of the network flagships because they can be as
footloose as ‘branch plants’, as compared to ‘performance plants’. Instead, we mean
something like international linkages that are so enduring as to enable those indigenous
firms to leverage for industrial upgrading.
     Moreover, the trend towards globalization involves a process of increased
disintegration, certainly of production, but even of innovative capabilities around the
globe (Feenstra, 1998), with the result that some, if not many, of the indigenous firms
and/or industrial clusters in the less-advanced economies are nowadays able to shoulder
important functions that used to be undertaken by their counterparts in the developed
world. For one thing, outsourcing has become a widely adopted practice in quite a number
of industries as a means of ensuring that brand marketers remain cost-competitive. As a
result, many network flagships have become ‘hollowing-out’ corporations, focusing their
operations on the two ends of the ‘Smiling Curve’ namely the R&D and marketing
functions (Chen and Ku, 2000; Kotabe, 1996; Swamidass and Kotabe, 1993; Venkatesan,
1992), leading to a certain degree of de-linking of R&D and manufacturing for the sector
concerned; typical examples at issue include Ericsson in the handset industry and IBM in
the PC industry. Within this process, the brand marketers are increasingly linked up with
other firms that may not even be in the same neighborhood.
     In addition, in many cases, innovation involves technical systems that are inherently
large, comprising of a set of jointly-consumed interdependent products (Windrum, 1999).

                                              5
Because of network effects and product compatibility, successful innovations for technical
systems entail intensive interfaces between multiple actors with different knowledge and
skills bases, termed as ‘innovation networks’. By implication, not only does such an
innovation often result from the collective efforts of interrelated firms, but it also
demonstrates that the value chain does not need to be completely internalized within
individual firms. Therefore, in many cases, industrial competition takes place between
rival technological and production networks that contain a multiplicity of differentiated
firms, rather than between vertically integrated oligopolists.
     In a sense, the evolutionary approach to technology (Nelson and Winter, 1984) is a
constructive building block underlying the concept of international linkages. The essence
of this approach, in short, is that what a firm or an economy can do, or is about to do, is
linked strongly to their routines and previous bases. In technological terms, a firm can be
considered as a producer, repository and user of knowledge, producing or acquiring
knowledge and putting it to the most efficient use. Each firm’s competitive advantage lies
in its stock of knowledge, and because firms possess idiosyncratic knowledge they are
likely to be heterogeneous. Product innovation involves an assortment of knowledge
related to various stages of the value chain. Knowledge applied to manufacturing,
marketing and customer services is complementary to the knowledge used in product
innovation. Vertical integration of the innovation function in the value chain is only
justified, however, if internalization is the best way to acquire the relevant knowledge, and
this is not often the case. Since product innovations address the needs of customers, the
knowledge most valuable to product innovation is that obtained from interacting with
customers, in other words, marketing. Therefore, product innovation combined with
marketing may be the optimal mix of services offered by a firm, which may involve
interactions between firms and their customers and suppliers.
     Relevant studies on this issue highlight some additional motives for MNCs’ offshore
R&D. A substantial part of the literature jointly suggests that the locational decisions of
MNCs’ offshore R&D are generally determined by the following four major factors.
Firstly, MNCs need to be close to their clients for the purpose of offshore R&D. The host
country’s industrial advantages can therefore be regarded as a driving force to anchor the
offshore R&D of MNCs. In this regard, the accumulated production experiences and
capabilities of a host country may serve as an important local condition in attracting
MNCs’ R&D facilities. For example, Fors and Zejan (1996) suggested that MNCs’
offshore R&D is, to a large extent, found in locations where overseas production is taking

                                              6
place. Such expatriated R&D investment generally supports the local use of production
technology and products, which are designed or created outside the home country.
     Secondly, MNCs may undertake offshore R&D in order to access new foreign
technologies for the development of new products and production processes. Due to the
dynamics of technology, some R&D-oriented firms, those based in Asia and Europe for
example, have set up labs in the US to take advantage of ‘centers of excellence’
(Dambrine, 1997; Voelker and Stead, 1999). Fors and Zejan (1996) argue that MNCs tend
to locate their R&D in the host regions which are relatively specialized, technologically, in
the firms’ own areas, as a means of gaining access to foreign centers of excellence and
taking advantage of localized knowledge spillovers. Similarly, Niosi (1999) indicated that
learning is a critical element in the new trend of international R&D, which often entails
locating closely to major innovation centers in order to broaden the scope of the parent’s
technological portfolio.
     Thirdly, it is regarded as becoming increasingly important for MNCs to relocate their
R&D overseas in order to hire foreign R&D labor. Having examined locational choices
for overseas R&D investment by MNCs based in the US and Japan, Kumar (2001) argued
that a country with an abundant R&D labor force will enjoy a locational advantage in
attracting MNCs’ R&D investment.
     Fourthly, the locational choice of MNCs’ overseas R&D can be motivated by the
ability to serve local markets. In an examination of determinants of foreign affiliates’
R&D investment in sixteen OECD countries, Gao (2000) highlighted the market size of
host countries as a critical factor. Besides stressing the significance of foreign market size,
Kumar (2001) summarized three locational advantages of host countries in driving foreign
R&D investment; these were a large domestic market, an abundance of low cost R&D
manpower, and the overall scale of national technological effort. From an alternative
perspective, Westney (1992) identified four research mandates for the offshore R&D of
MNCs in terms of technology activity; these were technology transfer, product
modification, new product development and basic research. Each of these research
mandates had its own types of linkages with the host economy. Foreign R&D sites can be
similarly classified into two categories, namely, a home-base augmenting site and a
home-base exploiting site (Kuenmerle, 1997). A mandate for basic research, as in a
home-base augmenting site, will require close linkages with local basic research centers,
such as universities and research institutions. In contrast, for a home-base exploiting site, a
mandate for local product modification will require close linkages to consumers.

                                              7
     The foregoing studies have relied mainly upon case studies, questionnaire surveys or
aggregate country data to examine the determinants of locational choices for MNCs’
offshore R&D, and most of these studies were based on the experiences of the advanced
countries. In light of this, we are motivated to apply industry level data to examine the
determinants of MNCs’ R&D activities overseas in a newly-industrialized economy, such
as that of Taiwan.


FOREIGN CORPORATIONS’ R&D IN TAIWAN

Many of the East Asian economies, including Taiwan, have orchestrated programs to
attract foreign-owned R&D units, jumping on the bandwagon of promoting their local
economies as international innovation ‘hubs’. This gives rise to an important question
concerning what factors may drive MNCs’ offshore facilities to become engaged in R&D
activities. In a sense, foreign affiliates engaging in R&D activities may involve an
evolutionary process of upgrading their strategic mandates. Ferdows (1997) described the
path of MNCs’ foreign plants to higher strategic roles. Foreign affiliates that are
upgrading their mandates may have started from a lowly position, which could even be an
offshore factory with the purpose of accessing low-cost production resources, a server
factory for the purpose of proximity to market, or an outpost factory for the purpose of
collecting information. They may, in due course, be upgraded to a higher position, which
may be a source factory for low-cost production, and which will result in them having
greater authority over procurement or, perhaps a contributor factory for the purpose not
only of serving specific national or regional markets, but also for product or process
engineering and the development and choice of suppliers. Finally, foreign affiliates
promote their mandates to the position of a ‘leading factory’ for the purpose of creating
new processes, products and technologies for the entire firm. This upgrading process of
foreign affiliates’ mandates spotlights the importance of a few intangible benefits in
technology sourcing, namely learning from foreign clients, local suppliers, competitors
and foreign research centers, and attracting talent globally, as opposed to tangible assets,
namely reducing direct and indirect costs, capital costs, taxes, logistical costs, and
jumping tariff and non-tariff barriers.
     Although it is well-documented that FDI has played an important role in Taiwan’s
economic development, it is seldom realized that to some degree, some of the MNCs in
Taiwan have also invested in R&D. From the dataset provided by the Investment


                                             8
Commission at the MOEA, we can calculate that Taiwan’s estimated average R&D
intensity for foreign-owned subsidiaries, over the periods 1996-91, 1992-96 and
1997-2000, was 1.22 per cent, 1.48 per cent and 2.49 per cent, respectively; this perhaps
indicates that Taiwan’s mandate has significantly improved in terms of MNCs’ regional or
global innovation networks. The last figure becomes more significant if we take into
account the fact that Taiwan’s total R&D expenditure accounted for just 2.16 per cent of
the island’s GDP in 2001 (Table 1).

      As Table 2 shows, the survey for the whole period from 1987 to 2000 reveals that the
electrical and electronic machinery industry registers the highest R&D intensity of foreign
corporations, followed by the primary metal and metal products, and machinery industries.
By contrast, both the food and beverages, and lumber, wood products and furniture
industries are the industries with the lowest R&D intensity of foreign corporations in
Taiwan. Not surprisingly, these industries with high foreign R&D activities tend to fall in
the category of the so-called high-tech industries, whilst the traditional industries
registered a relatively lower level of foreign R&D intensity.

     It should be noted that the Pearson correlation ratio shown in Table 2 reaches a level
of 0.725, pointing to a high and positive correlation between foreign corporate R&D
intensity and the distribution of capital inflow within the manufacturing industry.
Similarly, data on OECD members reveals a positive correlation between the share, on an
international scale, of foreign affiliates’ manufacturing turnover and that of manufacturing
R&D (OECD, 2001). This may mean, on the one hand, that the former is a necessary
condition for the latter, whilst on the other hand, in a Taiwanese context, this may suggest
that an industry characterized by higher foreign R&D investment has become a major FDI
target in recent decades. Those industries with high R&D intensity, such as Taiwanese IT
firms in the electrical and electronic machinery and machinery sectors, have evolved from
pure manufacturers towards integrated service providers, and that these are indeed
Taiwan’s primary export industries.


RESEARCH STRATEGY

We draw on an official databank for our empirical work and employ a regression
technique to explore the factors determining the R&D intensity of foreign affiliates in
Taiwan. This section discusses the research strategy and the key features of the empirical
studies.


The Model

The principal aim of our empirical enquiry is to explore features which characterize
foreign affiliates with a higher R&D intensity. The dependent variable is therefore denoted
as Rdr, the R&D intensity of foreign corporations at industry level. Rdri is measured as
the logarithm of the ratio of foreign corporations’ total R&D expenditure performed to
total sales in industry i. In this way, the total R&D expenditure of foreign subsidiaries is
normalized by their sales to control for the size effect. In terms of explanatory variables,
the study follows Varsakelis (2001) to incorporate the local procurement ratio, in both
materials (LOCMR) and capital goods (RAT1), along with export orientation (EXR), into
the regression equation of foreign corporations’ R&D intensity (RDR). We also examine
the impact of R&D labor force (LRDP) and local industrial R&D capabilities (IRDR) on
foreign corporate R&D activities. The definitions and measurements of the explanatory
variables in the empirical model are described as follows:



                                            10
KLR: Capital labor ratio, measured by the ratio of the book value of fixed capital stock to
total labor expenditure. We attempt to examine whether KLR has a statistically significant
coefficient in the R&D intensity equation. This variable characterizes the attributes of the
production technologies employed by foreign affiliates. Ramstetter (1999) compared
foreign multinationals and indigenous firms in Asian manufacturing industries and found
that MNCs generally adopt relatively high capital-intensive production technologies,
which may suggest MNCs’ endowments of firm-specific assets. However, a high KLR
may, to some extent, indicate the homogeneity of products. An industry with high KLR
provides high homogenous products with lower product differentiation. For this reason,
we presume that a foreign firm associated with high capital intensity has a low incentive to
undertake R&D investment in the host countries.


LOCMR: is a local content ratio, measured by the share of the value of local materials to
the value of purchased materials. The variable is designed to examine the locational
advantage of a host country in terms of industrial capability. As argued by Reddy (2000),
one of the main factors determining R&D investment by MNCs in the less-advanced
economies is the capability of local industry to produce advanced manufactured products.
This will be helpful for MNCs to exploit their innovation assets and enhance their market
competitiveness. LOCMR may reflect the local dependency of foreign affiliates, in terms
of supply chains, underlining the industrial capabilities of the host countries. Thus, the
coefficient of variable is presumed to be statistically significant and positive in the model.
     In addition, LOCMRS, a square term of LOCMR, is used in this model to take into
account a possible non-linear influence on RDR. That is, the increasing marginal R&D
investment to foreign affiliates’ local content can be confirmed when the possible
coefficient for LOCMRS in this model is positive. By contrast, there is a decreasing
marginal R&D investment in foreign affiliates’ local content if the possible coefficient for
LOCMRS is negative.


RAT1: This the local capital investment ratio, measured by the ratio of local capital
purchased to sales, by controlling the size effect. Similar to LOCMR, in this paper RAT1 is
intended to examine whether the industrial capability of a host country can be a locational
advantage in leveraging R&D investment by foreign affiliates. A host countries’ effective
industrial infrastructure, in terms of vertical industrial linkage, may attract foreign affiliates
to undertake R&D activities in order to effectively interact with the local suppliers of capital

                                               11
goods for innovation. In addition, this research compares the effects of RAT1 with RAT2,
which is the imported capital investment content, measured by the ratio of imported capital
purchased to sales, on foreign corporate R&D intensity. We presume that the coefficient of
RAT1 is positive in equation (1) and higher than that of RAT2.


EXPR: Export propensity, measured by the logarithm of the ratio of exports to sales. It is
well documented that the market size of a host country plays an important role as a
locational advantage in attracting foreign R&D to serve the local market and/or customize
products for the local market. However, in some cases, foreign affiliates may function
simply as an export outpost for their parent companies (Kumar, 2001). This may be
particularly true for an economy such as Taiwan, given its small market size. It is therefore
possible that the R&D operations of MNCs’ subsidiaries in Taiwan may be capitalizing on
Taiwan’s locational advantage in order to serve the international market. Thus, we presume
that the coefficient of EXPR in the equation is statistically positive and significant.
     It can in fact be argued that there exists a significant linkage between foreign
corporations’ decisions on local procurement and their product markets in terms of exports
and imports. In the case of tariff jumping FDI, foreign affiliates tend to utilize imported
material and components in the production of goods to serve the host country markets. In
particular, Chen and Wang (1995) revealed that MNCs in Taiwan producing electronic
goods for export were inclined to utilize imports of materials and components; hence,
there was a significantly negative relationship between MNCs’ local content and their
export orientation. Accordingly, this study aims to determine the interactive effect on
MNCs R&D investment from their foreign affiliates’ local content and product exports;
this is done by including a cross term combining EXPR with LOCMR in the model. We
consider that MNCs’ affiliates with a high mandate may play the role of nexus, linking the
host country’s industries to their global production. Furthermore, foreign affiliates with a
greater R&D commitment for new process technologies and products in the host countries
may shoulder a higher strategic role in terms of local sourcing.


LRDP: Local industrial R&D capabilities, measured by the logarithm of numbers of R&D
employees for each industry. This variable is a proxy for the availability of R&D labor in
the local industries. As shown in many studies, sourcing available R&D labor may
motivate MNCs to relocate their R&D operations abroad (Kumar, 2001). Thus, we
presume that the coefficient of LRDP in the R&D intensity equation to be positive.

                                                12
     In order to examine the determinants of foreign corporate R&D intensity,
industry-specific attributes are also taken into consideration in this study, with a summary
of the variable definitions being provided in Table 3. It should be noted, however, that this
model does not consider certain omitted variables, including Taiwanese corporations’
R&D investment and coordination costs of cross-border R&D, which are emphasized in
many studies, such as Cantwell and Iammarino (2000) and Fischer and Behrman (1979).
Taking the attribute of pooling data into account, we need to specify the fixed effects and
random effects models. In addition, in the estimation of the regression models, we
consider the influence of 10 manufacturing industries, but exclude the leather sector
because of too many missing observations.

     Based on the above discussion, the study derives a set of regressions for industry i,
with the equation being:

                     Rdrit = a0 + a1 EXPRit + a2 LOCMRit + a3 EXPRit * LOCMRit
                                                                                             (1)
                            + a4 RAT 1it + a5 RAT 2 it + a6 KL + a7 LRDPit

     where LOCMRit is the ratio of local material expenditure to total material expenditure
in percentage terms; EXPRit denotes the proportion of exports to total sales in percentage
terms; LOCMRit * EXPRit refers to the cross-term of LOCMRit and EXPRit; Klrit is the

ratio of capital stock to total labor costs; RAT1 and RAT2 denote respective local capital
investment ratio and imported capital investment ratio; and LRDPit denotes the total R&D
labor force in industry i in year t. All the variables are taken in terms of the derivative of
the natural logarithm in the empirical models, whilst other specific industry attributes are
reflected in the fixed effects or random effects model.
     Within the literature, equation (2) is known as the fixed effects model if the intercept
differs across individual groups (here the 10 industries) and each individual intercept does

                                                     13
not vary over time. Thus, equation (1) can be rewritten as:

                     Rdrit = a0 + a1 EXPRit + a2 LOCMRit + a3 EXPRit * LOCMRit
                                                                                                                  (2)
                    + a 4 RAT 1it + a5 RAT 2 it + a 6 KL + a 7 LRDPit + ∑ λi INDi + ε it

      In other settings, we may view each individual specific constant term as randomly
distributed across individual groups. It follows, therefore, that equation (1) can be
reformulated as the following equation:

                     Rdrit = a 0i + a1 EXPRit + a 2 LOCMRit + a3 EXPRit * LOCMRit
                                                                                                                  (3)
                             + a 4 RAT1it + a5 RAT 2 it + a 6 KL + a 7 LRDPit + ε it

      where a 0i is the intercept with random disturbance characterizing the ith

observation and can be expressed as a 0i = a 0 + u i , i=1,2,…,10, and u i is a random error

term with a mean value of zero and variance of σ u .

The Data

The data were collected from two sources over a period of fourteen years. The
industry-level dataset used in this study is provided by the Investment Commission,
MOEA, Taiwan, and contains information on production and R&D by foreign affiliates in
the manufacturing sector. Industry-specific R&D data is taken from the National Science
Council. After missing values were deleted, the available industrial data over the period
1987-2000 was pooled together to provide our sample. Table 4 presents a summary of the
descriptive statistics of these variables from 137 available observations.

correlations exist between EXPR*LOCMR and EXPR, and LOCMR and LOCMRS;
however, all the other correlation coefficients are rather small, suggesting that no serious
problem of multicollinearity exists within our empirical model.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS

This section presents and discusses the empirical results, which are summarized in Table 6.
The general specification in columns (1) to (4) of Table 6 include export dependence,
local input content and their cross-terms, whilst columns (5) to (8) also take capital labor
ratio into account. Based on the OLS residuals, Lagrange multiplier test statistics for χ2
were undertaken for each regression equation; the statistics for each equation are
significant at the 5 per cent level. It is therefore necessary for us to apply the Hausman test
to each equation in order to examine the statistical robustness of the fixed and random
effects models. The Chi-square values of equations (1), (2), (3) and (6) in Table 6 are
statistically significant, suggesting that these models favor the fixed effects model as
opposed to the random effects model.1 We go on to examine the effect of time trend,
referred to as YEAR, on the R&D intensity of foreign affiliates in Table 7. The
coefficients of time trend on each equation are positive but insignificant; thus, the
following discussion is based mainly on Table 6. The overall results suggest that six of the
explanatory variables, EXPR, LOCMR, LOCMRS, EXPR*LOCMR, RAT1 and LRDP
are significant (all at the 5 per cent level) in some, if not all, of the equations.


1
   After taking into account the effect of period on the regression models, we measure the Hausman
Chi-square static for each equation in Appendix Table 1, which suggests that these models favor the
two-way random model as opposed to the two-way fixed model. Generally, in terms of empirical outcome,
the differences between Table 6 and Appendix Table 1 are only minor.

     Foreign-owned subsidiaries with higher R&D intensity are found to be characterized
by a greater degree of localization in terms of their sourcing of both production materials
and capital goods. To interpret this finding, we can refer to Westney’s (1990) argument that
if their ties with the local scientific and technical community are gaining strength (and
probably, therefore, greater R&D intensity) MNCs’ offshore R&D units are given higher
hierarchical mandates. To put this another way, Reddy (2000) championed the concept of
‘first-tier supplier advantage’ as a locational advantage for attracting MNCs’ R&D units,
which may imply that foreign-owned subsidiaries with a higher degree of localization may
need to devote more effort to R&D in order to effectively interact with their local suppliers.
     In addition, we find that where Taiwanese industrial sectors have a larger pool of
R&D employees, their constituent foreign affiliates tend be more R&D intensive. On the
one hand, this seems to imply that the R&D efforts of foreign affiliates in Taiwan are
driven by a local technology pool. On the other hand, assuming that a larger pool of R&D
employees in a sector implies that its local firms are more technology aggressive, one can
argue that indigenous R&D efforts serve as a complement to, rather than a substitute for,
the R&D activities of foreign affiliates. We categorize below three main effects, namely
the local industry capability effect, market linkage effect and R&D labor resource effect,
for further discussion.


Local Industrial Capability Effect

Columns one and two in Table 6 includes the LOCMR and LOCMRS measures. The
coefficient of LOCMR is positive and statistically significant, revealing that foreign
affiliates in Taiwan using more local materials in their production have higher R&D
investment. The significant and positive coefficient for LOCMRS reveals the increasing
scale of foreign affiliates’ R&D investments to their local procurement of materials and
components.
     Two aspects stand out from these empirical results. Firstly, the results support our
hypotheses, in the previous section, that a host country’s excellence in production
capabilities, in terms of the industry value chain, can be regarded as a locational advantage
in leveraging foreign corporations to increase their R&D investment, even in a
less-advanced host country. Therefore, MNCs may need to establish their offshore R&D
centers close to their production partners for the purpose of time to market due to the
severe global competition. Secondly, the extent of local sourcing in terms of both


                                              18
production materials and capital goods not only reflects the degree to which MNCs’
offshore facilities are localized in the host country, but may also prompt them to upgrade
their local operations in R&D terms.
     Consistent with this, we also compare the effects of RAT1 and RAT2 on foreign
corporate R&D intensity. From Columns (2) and (6) in Table 6, the coefficients of RAT1
are not only statistically significant and positive, but also larger than those of RAT2,
further demonstrating that local industrial infrastructure does matter in terms of driving
foreign corporate R&D in a host country.


Market Linkage Effect

Whilst much of the literature on R&D internationalization emphasizes the importance of
market access for MNCs’ offshore R&D, for an economy with small domestic market size,
such as that of Taiwan, the market linkage effect may mean more to this issue and hence
may be regarded as a location-specific advantage for such a host country in leveraging
foreign R&D investment. For all specifications we find that those foreign-owned firms in
Taiwan with a higher export propensity tend to be more R&D intensive. As an economy
characterized by international competitiveness and export-orientation, Taiwan may be able
to act as a host for some MNCs in order to capitalize on its comparative advantages to
serve the international market. Indeed, in a questionnaire survey undertaken for a separate
study (Liu, et. al., 2002), R&D performers of foreign affiliates were asked to identify their
highest level R&D activities in Taiwan. The results showed that the level appeared to be,
predominantly, the modification and development of products for the international market.
Without denying the importance of market access to R&D internationalization, the
evidence gleaned from that study suggests that given accumulated comparative advantage
in production and the industrial value chain, host countries can still attract foreign R&D
investment by playing the role of a hub for access to the international markets, even
without large domestic market size.
     It is interesting to note that the coefficient of the cross term EXPR*LOCMR is
positive at the 5 per cent level of statistical significance, indicating that there exists an
important interaction effect between foreign affiliates’ export propensity and local content
ratio in enhancing foreign affiliates’ incentives to undertake local R&D. The coefficient of
the cross-term EXPR*LOCMR is significantly positive, indicating that in Taiwan,
foreign-owned firms with higher export propensity tend to be more R&D intensive in


                                             19
order to utilize more local materials and components. As is widely known, quite a
substantial part of the manufacturing industry in Taiwan is internationally competitive and
export-oriented, with local players in many of the sub-sectors enjoying first-tier supplier
status. By analogy, their MNC counterparts in Taiwan may have to act in the same way in
order to exploit Taiwan’s advantages. This may also indicate that as foreign affiliates in a
host economy, such as that of Taiwan, begin to increase their R&D investment, there is a
shift in their role, as they take on the role of nexus linking the local production capacity to
their global production network.
     The empirical results discussed above are quite in line with the evolutionary process of
foreign affiliates in upgrading their strategic roles within their parents’ global production
networks, as described by Ferdows (1997). In our view, foreign affiliates’ R&D investment
in the host countries may go hand in hand with their rising mandate within their parents’
global networks. From the perspective of Ferdows (1997), foreign affiliates can enjoy
greater authority over procurement, production planning, process change, outbound logistics,
product customization and redesign decisions, as their mandates are upgraded from an
offshore factory, or a server factory, to a source or contributor factory. By analogy, foreign
affiliates may increase their R&D investment and raise their local procurement and exports
simultaneously. This empirical outcome is also consistent with Jarillo and Martinez (1990)
which examined the different roles played by MNCs’ subsidiaries in Spain. They found that
subsidiaries tended to receive stronger mandates from their headquarters if they engaged in
geographical localization in terms of R&D, purchasing, manufacturing, and marketing in the
host countries, whilst also aggressively integrating themselves into their groups
(headquarters plus other subsidiaries). Thus, it is reasonable to argue that foreign affiliates
with a higher R&D intensity may reflect the upgrading of their mandates in the business
groups in terms of their localization and integration strategies.


R&D Labor Resource Effect

Finally, turning to the explanatory variable, LRDP, the estimated parameter has the
expected positive sign in the regression model and is significant at the 5 per cent level in
the random effects models. It therefore follows that the local R&D labor pool at industry
level is positively and significantly related to the corresponding foreign affiliates’ R&D
intensity, confirming our hypothesis that MNCs tend to locate their overseas R&D
investment to countries with abundant R&D resources. This result is also consistent with


                                               20
much of the research emphasizing the escalating importance of supply-side forces in
driving R&D internationalization. By implication, it can be argued that a host country
needs to demonstrate its technological strengths in certain industrial segments in order to
attract offshore R&D by MNCs.


CONCLUSIONS

Within the overall process of globalization, international economic development has much
to do with the relocation of the value chain of MNCs and indigenous innovation. These
two factors are, however, interrelated. Given the footloose nature of MNCs’ cross-border
operations, it is deemed increasingly important for a host country to attract MNCs’
facilities with strategic mandates, such as R&D. Therefore, R&D internationalization has
become a trend that is no longer confined to the developed world, since the less-advanced
economies are becoming increasingly involved in this process. This gives rise to an
important question as to what locational advantage a country may have and may be able to
develop in order to attract MNCs’ R&D activities.
     In studying this issue, Taiwan appears to provide an interesting case. Although within
this issue, such high-profile countries as China and India each have a large domestic market
and a large pool of R&D labo, this is obviously not the case in Taiwan. In addition, Taiwan
is not an economy characterized by technological leadership, which would be a distinct
advantage in attracting technology-seeking FDI. However, despite these drawbacks, the
Taiwanese case is more meaningful to many countries, including both developed and
developing countries; indeed, this paper goes a step further than the previous research by
exploring the issue at industry level, which appears to be more insightful.
     Our empirical results show that in Taiwan, foreign affiliates with higher R&D
intensity tend to be more export-oriented and localized in terms of their sourcing of
materials and capital goods. Of interest, is the finding that such foreign affiliates also tend
to be more R&D-intensive. To interpret this finding, we can refer to Westney’s (1990)
argument that MNCs’ offshore R&D units are given higher hierarchical mandates if their
ties with the local scientific and technological community are gaining strength (and
probably, therefore, greater R&D intensity). In fact, foreign affiliates tend to increase their
R&D investment and have greater authority over material and component procurement,
functioning as key suppliers and serving a specific regional market as they upgrade their
strategic roles towards becoming a so-called ‘leading factory’.


                                              21
     Reddy (2000) championed the concept of ‘first-tier supplier advantage’ as a
locational advantage for attracting MNCs’ R&D units, which may imply that
foreign-owned subsidiaries with a higher degree of localization may need to devote more
effort to R&D in order to effectively interact with their local suppliers. Moreover, we also
find that foreign affiliates with a higher export propensity tend to be not only more R&D
intensive, but also the effects of their export propensity has a positive interaction with the
effects of the local sourcing of materials. This may have something to with the heritage of
Taiwan’s economic development, which is widely known as being based upon export-
oriented industrialization. In specific terms, some Taiwanese industries have successfully
penetrated the international market, giving rise to a sound industrial infrastructure and
capability. As a result, their foreign affiliate counterparts may be driven to invest more in
R&D in order to capitalize on the Taiwanese comparative advantage, particularly if they
are more reliant on local materials.
     We are able to prove with statistical robustness that those sectors with a larger pool
of R&D labor tend to attract more foreign affiliates’ R&D activities. Whilst some of our
results are consistent with the previous findings, others may need to be interpreted in the
context of the Taiwanese economy. For example, the size of the local R&D labor force
may reflect Taiwan’s technological strengths in certain industrial sectors, which may in
turn attract MNCs’ to invest in R&D in Taiwan. This is in line with the so-called
technology-related motive, namely, tapping into foreign science and technology resources.
     Throughout the paper, there has been a focus on the concept of an evolutionary
approach to technology in interpreting Taiwan’s inward R&D internationalization.
Without denying the possibility of leapfrogging development, we would like to emphasize
the significance of a cumulative process of expansion to the efforts of less-advanced
economies to anchor MNCs’ offshore R&D. As Ernst (2000) puts it, an ideal location for
knowledge-intensive activities is characterized by three conditions, attractive lead markets,
a highly developed production structure and excellent research environments, but not all
of the criteria can be met at the same time by many locations in the less-advanced
economies. The experiences of Taiwan seem to suggest that even without world-leading
R&D centers of excellence, a less advanced economy can still build up a competitive
production base as a starting-point to take part in global production networks and, in due
course, this accumulated production capability can become an incentive for foreign
affiliates to invest in R&D.
