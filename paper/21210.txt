                                               ABSTRACT

Framing remains one of the pillars of behavioral economics. While framing effects have been found
to be quite important in the lab, what is less clear is how well evidence drawn from naturally-occurring
settings conforms to received laboratory insights. We use debt obligation to the UK government as
a case study to explore the ‘omission bias’ present in decision making with large stakes. Using a natural
field experiment that generates nearly 40,000 observations, we find that repayment rates are roughly
doubled when the act is reframed as one of commission rather than omission. We estimate that this
reframing of the perceived nature of the action generated over $1.3 million of new yield. We find
evidence that this behavior may result from a deliberate ‘omission strategy’, rather than a behavioral
bias, as is often assumed in the literature. Our natural field experiment highlights that behavioral economics
is much more than a series of empirical exercises to quench the intellectual curiosity of academics.

Day after day deceitful acts permeate our society, from rule-bending by consumers,
welfare claimants, and corporate citizens, to outright fraudulent behaviours by firms
and even governments themselves. While literatures have developed to explain such
acts,1 officials often find it difficult to address these behaviors through traditional
enforcement methods (for example, fines and prosecution). In this note, rather than
explore how we can use traditional economic variables to combat dishonorable acts,
we take this literature in a different direction. We leverage behavioral economics, and
use ‘omission bias’ as a starting point. Our main hypothesis is that when considering
engaging in many types of mendacious acts, many people fall short of acting
honourable due to an omission strategy. If true, then we should be able to affect the
prevalence of such acts by simply reframing acts of omission as acts of commission
(i.e. doing nothing is an active choice).
    Of course, psychologists and behavioural economists have argued for years that
the manner in which a decision is presented is important (see, e.g., the endowment
effect (Thaler, 1980), status quo bias (Samuelson & Zeckhauser 1988), and
differences between Hicksian surplus values (Hanemann, 1991).2                              Although
considerable laboratory evidence consonant with framing effects has accumulated in
the literature,3 a natural inclination for many economists is to discount such results on
the grounds that they reflect inexperienced subjects or maladroit designs. While work
has begun to extend the empirical results to the field (see, e.g., List, 2003; 2004),
there is limited evidence on first-order questions such as: can framing manipulations
have important economic effects in naturally-occurring markets?4                         This is not
surprising in light of the difficulties associated with executing a clean test in the field.
    To lend insights into both this methodological query and the importance of
‘omission bias’ in the field, we use as a case study repayment of debt.                            Our

  The economic analysis of crime began on a very high plane with the work of Beccaria and Bentham
in the 18th and 19th centuries, but its revival in modern times dates only to 1968, when Gary Becker's
article on the economics of crime (Becker, 1968). Since then there has been an outpouring of
economic work on crime in the following areas: the optimal trade-off between certainty and severity of
punishment, the comparative economic properties of fines and imprisonment, the economics of law
enforcement and criminal procedure, and above all the deterrent and preventive effects of criminal
punishment (including capital punishment).
2
  Philosophers have long been interested in this area – see Singer (1979) and Steinbock (1980).
3
  Using lab experiments, Cox et al. (2013) find that people act more reciprocal (both positive and
negative) when another’s behavior results from acts of commission rather than acts of omission. They
argue that the most fruitful future area of examining the omission-commission distinction is using field
experiments to understand their real world importance.

  Yet, see the recent work of Fryer et al. (2012) with teachers and Hossain and List (2012) with factory
workers. On dishonesty, the interested reader should see, e.g., Gneezy (2005), Sutter (2009), and
Cappelen et al. (2013), who explore the prevalence and importance of dishonesty.

experimental platform is the recent approach taken by Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs (the UK Government Tax Office) to debt collection.               We view the
collaboration with the UK Government Tax Office as representing a perfect setting
for our inquiry because the experimental subjects are people who actually have failed
to repay overpaid government benefits, which presents a clear opportunity to profit
through acts of omission. We augment the Government’s traditional repayment letter
by including the following message in our ‘omission to commission’ letters:
“Previously, we treated your lack of response as an oversight. Now, if you do not call
[telephone number], we will treat this as an active choice.”
   Our letters were randomized across a section of the UK population who owed
money in 2012. Making use of information gathered from nearly 40,000 letters, we
find that in the control treatment roughly 12% of letter recipients repay their debt
obligation within 30 days. This is considerably less than the repayment rates of those
receiving omission messages (~23%), which almost doubled the likelihood of paying
money back to the Government. The stakes in our experiment are quite large in that
the ‘omission to commission’ treatments led to over £1.2 million (i.e. $1.8 million) in
revenue being accelerated over a 30-day period. Moreover, we estimate that the
treatments ultimately led to £0.88m ($1.3m) of new (not accelerated) yield because of
the way the debts were subsequently treated. The observed treatment effects are
significantly larger than treatment effects we find from providing more information
on how to pay, helping recipients plan their payment, or summarizing the letter
content.
   Our preferred interpretation is that people believe that non-payment in the
omission to commission treatment will result in greater punishment compared to non-
payment in the control treatment (see the excellent discussion in Spranca et al., 1991;
DeScioli et al., 2011). This interpretation is confirmed in a companion survey, which
reveals that 80% of people believe that non-payment in the omission to commission
treatment will result in greater punishment compared to non-payment in the control
treatment. Our data, therefore, suggest that agents responding to the commission
message are rational in the sense that they anticipate greater punishment if they do not
act honestly. This is at odds with the traditional ‘omission bias’ literature, which
interprets omission as a bias rather than a strategic choice. In this way, an ‘omission
strategy’ can be part of an equilibrium explaining why such framing manipulations
work.


                                           3
         The remainder of our study proceeds as follows. The next section details the
experimental design. Section II summarizes the results. Section III concludes.


                                  I.       Field Experimental Design
         While there are many forms of dishonesty, we focus our case study on the
interaction between individuals and authorities. There are many instances in which
individuals are required to comply with government requests to give an honest and
accurate report of their circumstances. We take the example of the disbursement of
government benefits.         The US government offers over 1,000 different benefits
programs, and total transfer receipts to individuals from governments in the US stood
at $2.25 trillion in 2011 (Benefits.gov, 2013; Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2013).
Many of these benefits require certain conditions to be met, and require the recipient
to notify the disburser if this ceases to be the case. There is thus the potential for a
recipient to fail to make such a notification, and thereby profit by omission.5 This
potential also exists in the UK benefits system, and therefore the UK represents a
fertile ground to explore the effect of omission and commission.
         In this spirit, we address a particular compliance challenge: collecting
overpaid Tax Credits, a form of benefit provided by the UK government.6 Reasons
why a recipient may be paid too much through UK Tax Credits include: a failure to
notify the authorities of a change in the recipient’s situation, providing incorrect
information, or a failure to renew credits on time.7 If this happens, then the UK
government has a duty to reclaim the overpaid Tax Credits, since they constitute a
debt. Individuals receive an initial statement of the debt; if they do not respond to this
statement, then they are sent targeted letters requesting payment, followed by further
enforcement actions, if appropriate.8

  For example, in 2012 10.5% of Unemployment Insurance benefits were overpaid (some owing to
agency error), amounting to $4.5 billion in total. Only 21% of these overpayments were recovered
(United States Department of Labor, 2013). Meanwhile, the cumulative amount owed through social
security payments nearly doubled between 2001 and 2011, to stand at $7.3 billion (United States
Government Accountability Office 2012). In addition, improper payments represented 10.1% of
Medicare spending in FY 2013, amounting to $36 billion. (Department of Health and Human Services,
2013, 165). It is worth noting that Thurman (1991) offers evidence that omission bias is present in tax
evasion, which has several similarities to the inappropriate receipt of government benefits.

  Tax credits come in two main forms: Child Tax Credit, awarded to support the raising of children,
and Working Tax Credit, paid to those who are in work but have a low income. For more information,

  The enforcement actions include telephone calls and personal visits from an HMRC officer. If no
contact can be made, or the benefit recipient refuses to pay, then HMRC may: refer the debt to a private

Methodology
        As our control, we employ the original letter typically used by the UK
Government Tax Office – see Appendix.                In this way, the control condition is
essentially a form letter that includes basic information about the size of debt and how
to pay. The experimental treatment letters were identical to the control apart from
inclusion of various short messages (see Appendix for both the control and the
Collective Omission to Commission letters). The first, and most important, departure
from the control letter is our omission to commission letters. In these cases, we
simply add the following to the control, as can be seen in the Appendix: “Previously,
we treated your lack of response as an oversight. Now, if you do not call [telephone
number], we will treat this as an active choice.”
        Constructing any message clearly involves making many choices about
features such as tone, vocabulary, and length. However, in this situation one aspect of
the test messages in particular is likely to affect their impact: the nature of the sender
(Dolan et al., 2012). The ‘omission strategy’ is based on anticipated blame, and the
salience of this blame is likely to vary according to its source. In this situation, there
are two overlapping sources, since the letter is addressed from both an organization
(i.e. the UK tax office) and an individual within that organization (i.e. a specific
collector).9    As such, there is a case for examining whether emphasizing the
individual or the collective influences compliance. While this specific issue is rarely
examined, Tausczik and Pennebaker (2010) note that there is much evidence that
lower status speakers make greater use of the first person singular “I”, whereas higher
status speakers use the first person plural “we” more often. In addition, studies such
as Bargh (2006) show that priming with collective (as opposed to singular) pronouns
can increase levels of demonstrated altruism. Therefore, we introduce a subordinate
hypothesis: Individuals who receive a message, at the point of decision, that states
that non-compliance will be an act of commission will be more likely to comply if the
sender is framed as a collective, rather than an individual.



debt collection agency; seek to remove it automatically from payrolls; or consider seizing goods to
recoup the amount owed. A summary of the process can be found at:
http://www.revenuebenefits.org.uk/tax-credits/guidance/how-to-deal-with-hmrc/dealing-with-debt/. We
discuss the particular actions applied to these debts later in the article.

  The name of the individual sender has been excluded from the letter examples in the Appendix.


                                                5
       Two messages were constructed to test this hypothesis.           The first was:
“Previously, I treated your lack of response as an oversight. Now, if you do not call
[telephone number], I will treat this as an active choice” (we call this ‘Individual
Omission to Commission’). The second was: “Previously, we treated your lack of
response as an oversight. Now, if you do not call [telephone number], we will treat
this as an active choice” (‘Collective Omission to Commission’). Note that the two
messages are identical except for the pronouns; by limiting the changes in this way,
we can isolate the effect of the individual/collective framing.
       We also took the opportunity to compare countering the omission strategy
with an alternative approach for increasing compliance, based on offering additional
help and lowering perceived barriers to resolving the recipient’s debt situation. This
more “customer focused” approach has been discussed extensively as a means of
creating a good relationship between tax authority and citizen – which in turn has
been found to boost voluntary compliance (Kirchler, 2007; Braithwaite, 2003; Smith,
1992). There is some field experimental evidence from the UK that messages of this
kind can raise tax compliance (Hasseldine et al., 2007; Hallsworth et al., 2014).
       In our field experiment, these additional letters provided more information
about call centre opening times (denoted ‘Opportunity’), pointed out that the tax
authority was attempting to resolve the issue (denoted ‘Reciprocity’), suggested
making a plan to call the tax authority (denoted ‘Planning’), and provided a summary
box of the main points in the letter (denoted ‘Summary Box’) (see Table 1). These
other treatments provide a reference effect size and place our main treatment effects
in perspective.
       The letters requesting payment of debts included in our field experiment were
issued in January 2012. The experimental sample of 38,800 cases consisted of all
debtors for whom the outstanding amount could not be recovered via payroll
deductions. We calculated that an equal allocation amongst the seven messages
detailed above would allow us to detect a 2.7% ATE with 80% power, which is
similar to the smaller effects obtained by Hasseldine et al. (2007) and Hallsworth et
al. (2014). Individual cases were randomized using the random number function in
SAS, with no blocking and roughly equal allocation to each group. Letters were then
issued over five sequential days. It was not possible to randomize the issue of letters
across these days. Instead, letters were issued in tranches organised by debt size –



                                            6
since the randomisation was successful, this resulted in equal proportions of each
letter being issued each day (see Table 1).


                             II.     Field Experimental Results
       We first check the balance of the randomization on the background variables.
Table 2 shows the regressions on these variables, with the treatment groups as
independent variables and the reference group as the control group. Regressions (I) to
(VI) show that there are no significant differences between control and treatment
groups on four covariates available to us: gross income for the tax year; log gross
income; gender; and (female) title. We also test the latter four regressions using a chi-
squared test and find similar negligible differences.
       Our main results are contained in Table 3, which presents the marginal effects
from a logit regression where the dependent variable is whether the recipient made a
payment within 30 days of being sent the letter. Thirty days represents the last point
at which we can be confident that individuals had not received the subsequent letter
asking for payment (which did not form part of this experiment). Around 12% of
recipients in our control treatment made such a payment within 30 days.
       Regression (I) is the basic specification, with the treatment groups as the
independent variables. The ‘Reciprocity’, ‘Planning’, and ‘Summary box’ treatments
do not have a significant effect on repayment rates. The ‘Opportunity’ treatment
produced a 2.2% increase in payments. The effect in comparison to the control group
is an 18.5% (0.06 standard deviations) effect size.
       In terms of the omission to commission messages, the ‘Collective Omission to
Commission’ group created an 11.2 percentage point increase in payment rates. This
is equivalent to a 94.1% (0.33 standard deviations) treatment effect size. Moreover,
the ‘Individual Omission to Commission’ group produced a 10.9 percentage point
increase. This is equivalent to a 91.6% (0.32 standard deviations) treatment effect
size. These results are not statistically significantly different from each other, which
does not support our secondary hypothesis. However, they are significantly different
from the other treatment effects and the control at conventional significance levels,
confirming our primary hypothesis (p<0.001).
       Regression (II) in Table 3 includes the individual’s gross income for that year
and their gender (dummy being male). Importantly, when we include these variables
the coefficients on our treatments do not change. As far as the observables, we find


                                              7
that individuals with higher incomes are more likely to repay the Tax Credits. For
each pound sterling that someone earns, they are 0.0002% more likely to pay the tax
back within 30 days.          To place the 11.2 percentage increase found above for
“Collective Omission to Commission” in context, we would have to raise incomes by
£50,000 to obtain the same effect.
        We find that men are five percentage points less likely than women to repay
their tax credits. This result accords with the relatively limited evidence on gender
and tax compliance (Kastlunger et al., 2010; Jackson and Milliron, 1986). Regression
(III) interacts the income and gender variables with the six treatment variables. The
interactions are neither large nor statistically significant.
        Table 4 examines the impact of the treatments on the payment date. This
dependent variable is different from that presented in Table 3, which represented
whether the individual had made a payment within 30 days of the letter being issued.
The dependent variable in this case is ‘day of payment,’ which is a continuous
variable measuring the actual numbers of days until the first payment is made by the
individual. In this way, it potentially provides more information than Table 3, since it
extends beyond the initial 30 day period. Any person who still had not paid at the
time we extracted the data received the maximum value of 412 days.
        Regression (I) in Table 4 shows that the omission to commission groups pay
much earlier than the recipients in the control and the other treatment groups. The
“Collective Omission to Commission” group made their payment 22 days earlier than
the control, and the “Individual Omission to Commission” group made their payment
18 days earlier than the control. In comparison to the control, the effect sizes are 9%
(0.13 standard deviations) and 7.3% (0.11 standard deviations), respectively.
Surprisingly, the ‘Planning’ treatment group made payments seven days earlier than
the control group. This is interesting: it implies that the planning message had an
initial effect on payments that was not sustained over the longer term.10
        Regression (II) in Table 4 introduces income and gender. Consistent with
Table 3, we find that individuals with higher gross incomes are more likely to repay
the government – with each extra pound sterling of income they are likely to pay it
back 0.003 days quicker. Moreover, men wait 40 days longer than women to make a

10
   A comparison with Table 3 shows that overall the Planning letter did not lead to a higher payment
rate at 30 days. However, it did mean that people paid earlier on average, and (since the randomisation
is robust) it is very likely that is because of different behavior within the first thirty days.


                                                  8
payment. Regression (III) interacts the treatment variables with both income and
gender. In contrast to the previous Table, we find three significant interactions.
Those with higher gross incomes who receive either the ‘Planning’ or ‘Collective
Omission to Commission’ treatment take longer to pay than those with lower
incomes. In addition, we find that men who receive the ‘Collective Omission to
Commission’ treatment take considerably longer to pay than women from that same
treatment group.
        Using the estimates from regression (I) Table 3 we can provide an estimate of
the benefits from this study. First, we can estimate the accelerated yield at 30 days.
The control group in the first 30 days paid £602,344 back to the government. The
‘Collective Omission to Commission’ group paid £1,351,414 in the first 30 days and
the ‘Individual Omission to Commission’ group paid £1,120,331 in the first 30 days –
the gross marginal yield was therefore around £1.27million.11
        Second, we can estimate the total additional (rather than accelerated) yield.
To do this, we first identify the debts with a value of less than £3,500. Debts above
this amount were sent for enforcement action that consisted of seizure of goods, and
therefore any gains in this group are likely to consist of accelerated revenue only.
However, debts below this amount were subjected only to a series of letters, which
were completed within 80 days after the trial began. Therefore, any marginal gains
that still existed at this end point represent additional (rather than accelerated) yield.12
At this time, the new marginal yield on sub-£3,500 debts was £512,604 (‘Collective
Omission to Commission’) and £366,920 (‘Individual Omission to Commission’) –
the aggregated new marginal yield was £879,525.13 It should be noted that the
additional marginal cost to the government from this intervention was effectively
zero, since these letters would have been sent regardless.


                                            III.       Discussion
        Economic theory is consequentialist: utility is determined solely by final
outcomes. Yet, there are important cases where the actions that result in those final
outcomes are important. For example, we judge people less harshly if they withhold
11
   These calculations are made by multiplying the absolute treatment effect per group by the number of
individuals in each group and the amount of debt in each group.
12
   No further enforcement action was planned to take place after the data period we can observe. To the
best of our knowledge none did take place, but we cannot guarantee this is the case.
13
   At 80 days the absolute treatment effects of ‘Collective Omission to Commission’ and ‘Individual
Omission to Commission’ were 8.8% and 7.6% respectively.

an antidote from someone who has been poisoned than if they poison someone, even
though the consequences are the same (Cushman et al., 2006). This type of behavior,
and related examples such as the Trolley problem and the Vaccination problem, have
been categorized as an ‘omission bias.’
         To more deeply explore whether indeed our experimental results are a bias or
a result of strategic thinking, we complement our natural field experiment with an
online survey.       Using an online survey platform in April 2015, we presented a
national sample of 250 UK citizens, who were previously or currently in receipt of tax
credits, with two different scenarios. The ‘control’ scenario involved receiving the
control letter,14 while the ‘omission’ scenario featured the omission to commission
letter.15 The order in which participants saw these scenarios was randomised.
         Participants were then asked: “Of these two scenarios, which would lead to a
more severe punishment if you did not respond to the letter?” We find that 80%
choose the omission scenario.16 Our results are consonant with the notion that our
natural field experiment is revealing an omission strategy, rather than a bias: knowing

   This read as follows: “Imagine that you have been paid too much in Tax Credits by the government.
The tax authority sends you a letter asking for you to repay what you owe, but you do not respond. The
tax authority then sends you another letter, which contains the statement: “We told you recently that
you were paid too much through your tax credits. Our records show you have not been in touch about
this. Please call 0845 302 1421 now.”

   “Imagine that you have been paid too much in Tax Credits by the government. The tax authority
sends you a letter asking for you to repay what you owe, but you do not respond. The tax authority then
sends you another letter, which contains the statement: “We told you recently that you were paid too
much through your tax credits. Our records show you have not been in touch about this. Previously, we
treated your lack of response as an oversight. Now, if you do not call 0845 302 1421, we will treat this
as an active choice.”
16
   To be robust, we used two versions of this omission statement, in order to test a subordinate
hypothesis about perceived levels of punishment arising from the “we will treat” phrasing. The
message includes the phrase “we will treat this as an active choice” (emphasis added). Therefore, it
could be argued that these results simply show the effect of a signal that punishment is likely to occur;
in this analysis, there is no effect from the omission element as such. In order to address this point, we
included a “non-threat” variant of the omission scenario. This was identical to the one above, but with
the following wording: “We told you recently that you were paid too much through your tax credits.
Our records show you have not been in touch about this. Previously, your lack of response may have
been an oversight. Now, if you do not call 0845 302 1421, this will be an active choice.” This version
therefore lacked any signal of punishment, but retained the omission element. Participants were
randomly allocated to see either version of the omission statement. As well as being asked to choose
whether the control or (either) omission scenario would result in more punishment, they were also
asked: “How severe do you think the punishment would be? (Please give your answer out of 10, where
1 means no action and 10 the maximum penalty possible.)” The results showed that 78% of those
viewing the standard omission statement rated it as producing more severe punishment, compared to
81% of those viewing the “non-threat” version (not significant at the ten per cent level) The mean
severity of punishment scores were 6.47 for the standard omission version and 6.79 for the non-threat
omission version (not significant at the ten per cent level). These results suggest that the results from
the field experiment do not simply reflect a straightforward reaction to perceptions of increased
punishment.

that we blame individuals less if a bad outcome ensues because they act than if they
do not act, people are more likely to behave dishonestly when they can use omission.
When the omission is presented as commission, participants are significantly more
likely to act honestly and repay their debt to the government. In other words, if given
the chance, people will select an omission option because they think they will be
judged less harshly by others as a result of acting dishonestly. Therefore, in some
instances it may be more appropriate to refer to the effect as an omission strategy,
rather than an omission bias (see also Descioli et al., 2011). We believe that our
results are the first to show that messages explicitly aimed at countering this omission
strategy are effective at influencing behavior in naturally occurring markets.
       From a policy perspective, the omission strategy suggests that policymakers
should first examine whether they are creating services or policies that introduce the
opportunities for people to exploit omission options – and eliminate those
opportunities (Mazar & Hawkins, 2015). In addition, they should consider the broad
set of insights gained from lab experiments on the importance of framing. These
experiments revealed an important effect that might happen in markets; our field
experiment showed that this effect actually does occur in the field, and is important
enough to influence high stakes allocations.
