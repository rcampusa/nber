Effectiveness of Connected Legislators

                                         ABSTRACT

In this paper, we study the extent to which social connections influence the legislative
effectiveness of members of the U.S. Congress. We propose a new model of legislative
effectiveness that formalizes the role of social connections and generates simple testable
predictions. The model predicts that a legislator's equilibrium effectiveness is proportional to a
specific weighted Katz-Bonacich centrality in the network of social connections, where the
weights depend on the legislators' characteristics. We then propose a new empirical strategy to
test the theoretical predictions using the network of cosponsorship links in the 109th-113th
Congresses. The strategy addresses network endogeneity by implementing a two-step Heckman
correction based on an original instrument: the legislators' alumni connections. We find that, in
the absence of a correction, all measures of centrality in the cosponsorship network are
significant. When we control for network endogeneity, however, only the measure suggested by
the model remains significant, and the fit of the estimation is improved. We also study the
influence of legislators' characteristics on the size of network effects. In doing so, we provide
new insights into how social connectedness interacts with factors such as seniority, partisanship
and legislative leadership in determining legislators' effectiveness.

1       Introduction

Understanding what makes legislators eﬀective, both in absolute and relative terms, is clearly a
question of practical and theoretical importance. From a normative perspective, understanding
eﬀectiveness may help governments design more eﬃcient political institutions. From a positive
perspective, it may help explain the determinants of politicians’ success and therefore their career
paths.    It is therefore not surprising that there is a large literature devoted to measuring and
explaining legislative success (see, among others, Volden and Wiseman [2014]). This literature
has investigated the extent to which idiosyncratic talent, skill sets, seniority, demographics (sex
and race, in particular), institutional and party positions play a role in the process of passing
legislation both at the state and federal level.
    While most of this literature has focused solely on legislators’ individual characteristics, jour-
nalistic accounts and political commentators have traditionally privileged the importance of social
connections, portraying successful politicians as masterful “networkers.” As a result, recent work
in economics and political science has aimed to link social connectedness to legislative eﬀective-
ness.    In a seminal contribution, Fowler [2006a] has shown that measures of legislative success
correlate positively with politicians’ connectedness in the network of cosponsorships. In Fowler’s
definition, politicians’ connectedness depends on the number of cosponsorships their bills receive
and a measure of the bills’ quality. This line of research has been continued by Cho and Fowler
[2009] and Kirkland [2011], who both use cosponsorships as their source of information on network
connections.    Craig [2015], in contrast, has constructed network connections using cosigners of
congressional “Dear Colleague” letters, and has shown that “team players” are better at gathering
support in the form of cosponsorships, but they do not have greater success in advancing their
legislative agendas.
    A key issue with the current literature on social connectedness and legislative eﬀectiveness is
that it relies on measurements of social connection that are naturally endogenous. Legislators are
certainly strategic in choosing with whom to cosponsor and with whom to partner in sending “Dear
colleague” letters. This strategic self-selection may make it diﬃcult to interpret the correlation
between legislative eﬀectiveness and social connectedness, since omitted variables (such as social
skills) may drive both social connections and legislative success. A positive correlation between
centrality and eﬀectiveness found while ignoring these issues may be spurious; similarly, the lack



                                                   1
of a correlation may not rule out a causal relationship.
   In this paper, we build on this early literature suggesting a role of social connections in deter-
mining legislative eﬀectiveness, but we explicitly deal with the problem of the endogeneity of social
networks and study the causal connections between them and legislative eﬀectiveness.          Specifi-
cally, we make two contributions. First we propose a simple model of legislative eﬀectiveness in
Congress that formalizes the role of social connections and generates simple testable predictions.
Second, we propose a new empirical strategy to test these predictions.         The strategy to deal
with network endogeneity consists of implementing a Heckman correction based on an original
instrument: the legislators’ alumni connections. The advantange in using this technique is that it
allows to control for the presence of individual-level unobserved factors. A politician’s ability is a
prominent example. More able politicians who are more eﬀective may be more likely to attract
cosponsors, and also may have attended the more prestigious schools.
   In the model that we propose, legislative eﬀectiveness depends on three factors: the legislator’s
characteristics, the eﬀort directly exerted by the legislator, and the legislative eﬀectiveness of all
the legislators with whom the legislator has social connections. This last factor reflects the idea
that if legislator  has cultivated a social relationship with  (for example, by contributing to the
reelection campaign of legislator  through his own PAC or by playing golf with him/her), then 
may conscript  to his own cause. Therefore, existing social connections make  more productive.
Once equilibrium eﬀort levels are taken into account, we show that our model has a unique Nash
equilibrium in which the legislators’ eﬀectiveness levels are uniquely defined and are proportional
to a standard measure of centrality developed in the sociological literature: the weighted Katz-
Bonacich centrality (see for example, Bonacich [1987] and Zenou [2015]). More importantly, the
model’s equilibrium conditions can be expressed in the form of a simple spatial autoregressive
system of equations that allows us to structurally estimate the model.
   We then test the model predictions using data from five recent election cycles: the 109th
Congress (election cycle 2004) to the 113th Congress (election cycle 2012). We measure each con-
gressman’s legislative performance using the Legislative Eﬀectiveness Scores (LESs) for members
of the U.S. House of Representatives, developed by Volden and Wiseman [2014]. This is a general
metric of individual legislative eﬀectiveness in the U.S. Congress, which identifies diﬀerences across
legislators in formulating meaningful bills and moving them through the legislative process from
introduction to the ultimate signing into law. As mentioned above, we deal with the endogeneity


                                                  2
of available measures of social connections in Congress by implementing a two-step procedure.
In the first step, alumni connections and other relevant legislators’ characteristics (gender, party,
seniority, etc.) are used to explain the map of cosponsorship linkages. In the second step, the
residuals of the first stage (that incorporates unobservable variables explaining the existence of
legislative networks in Congress), are included in the regression used to estimate our model. In
our alumni network, two congressmen are connected if they graduated from the same institution
within a given time window. The idea behind our approach is that shared educational experiences
have long-lasting eﬀects on the propensity for socialization later in life (see Cohen et al. [2008],
Fracassi and Tate [2012], Cohen and Malloy [2014], Do et al. [2016], Battaglini and Patacchini
[2017] among others).
   Three main results emerge from our analysis. First, we find that, consistent with the theory,
congressmen’s Bonacich centralities have highly significant eﬀects on their Legislative Eﬀectiveness
Scores.   This result is robust to many natural controls suggested by the existing literature,
including seniority, measures of relative institutional power inside the House, electoral success,
and political ideology. Our estimate generalizes and, indeed, includes as a nested case, previous
empirical models that ignore social connections: it therefore allows us to formally show social
connections significantly improve the models’ fit. In their survey of the literature on legislative
eﬀectiveness, Volden and Wiseman [2009] list nine factors that have been identified as predictors
of legislators’ legislative eﬀectiveness: seniority, previous legislative experience, party influence,
legislative leadership, committee influence, ideology, race, gender and ethnicity considerations,
natural coalition partners and electoral connections. Our work provides a microfoundation and
evidence for a tenth factor: social connections.
   Second, we show that ignoring network endogeneity is problematic. We show that without the
Heckman correction, traditional measures of centrality are apparently significant: betweenness,
closeness and eigenvector. Once we control for omitted variables with our Heckman correction,
however, none of these measures of centrality remains significant.        The measure of centrality
suggested by our model, on the contrary, remains significant when we correct for the Heckman
correction.   It also remains significant when we run a “horse race” in which all measures of
centrality are included, suggesting that our theoretically founded measure of social connectedness
is a robust predictor of eﬀectiveness.
   Third, our analysis provides insight into the mechanisms through which variables previously


                                                   3
identified as important aﬀect legislative eﬀectiveness. We find that ethnic minorities appear to
benefit more than the average congressmen from social interactions, whereas congressmen with
higher seniority and committee chairs receive less benefits form interacting with others than other
members of the Congress.
   Our work is related to two strands of literature. First, there is the traditional literature on leg-
islative eﬀectiveness that focuses on the questions of how to measure eﬀectiveness, its determinants
and its eﬀects. This literature has highlighted factors such as seniority and leadership position
in Congress and the parties as unambiguous drivers of eﬀectiveness (see for example Frantzich
[1979], Anderson et al. [2003], Padro i Miguel and Snyder [2006], Cox and Terry [2008], Volden
and Wiseman [2009]). Other factors have been highlighted but proven more controversial, such as
electoral safety, ethnicity and gender (see for ex., Jeydel and Taylor [2003], Bratton [2005], Bratton
and Haynie [1999]). A variety of measures of legislative success have been adopted, ranging from
“batting averages” (i.e. the share of sponsored bills that are passed), to entrepreneurial measures
(i.e. the number of sponsored and cosponsored bills), to productivity measures that count how
a legislators help a bill move through stages in Congress, to direct surveys (for state congresses).
As mentioned, for our work we have chosen a measure proposed by Volden and Wiseman [2009]
that tracks the diﬀerent forms of success and weights success by the importance of the bill.1
   Second, our work contributes to the literature on social networks in Congress.                  As said,
a number of works have investigated the correlation of legislative success and measures of social
centrality using data from cosponsorships (Fowler [2006], Tam Cho and Fowler [2009] and Kirkland
[2011]) and “dear colleague” letters (Craig [2015]). This pioneering literature first highlighted the
importance of social links to legislative success, but has not investigated the problem arising with
the endogeneity of social networks and therefore has not studied the causal link between observed
measures of social connectedness and legislative success.
   A recent literature has employed a variety of strategies to control for the endogeneity of social
networks in Congress and other legislative assemblies. Masket [2008] and Harmon et al. [2017]
use seat assignments to study voting behavior in the California state assembly and the E.U,
Parliament, respectively. Cohen and Malloy [2014] and Battaglini and Patacchini (2017) use the
alumni networks to study voting behavior in the U.S. Senate and PAC electoral contributions in

subsequent steps in the legislative process (so productivity and “batting averages”).

the U.S. Congress, respectively.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our model of legislative
behavior, the equilibrium predictions and the estimation strategy. In Section 3, we describe the
data. In Section 4, we discuss the empirical results and a number of robustness checks. Section
5 concludes.


2     Theory and empirical strategy
2.1    Setup

Consider a congress comprised of  legislators, where N = {1  } is the set of legislators. Each
legislator has a pet legislative project that he cares to implement. The goal of each legislator is
to maximize his legislative eﬀectiveness, measured by the probability of implementing the project.
We assume that legislator ’s legislative eﬀectiveness  is a function of legislator ’s characteristics,
his eﬀort and the legislative eﬀectiveness of all the legislators that  has befriended. For example,
legislator  may have spent time playing golf with , or (perhaps more substantively) contributed
to the reelection campaign of legislator  through his own PAC. This may allow  to conscript 
to his own cause.
    Specifically, we assume:
                                                 qP
                                       =  +      ·                                      (1)

Equation (1) represents the “production function” for legislative eﬀectiveness.          The first term,
 , is a fixed eﬀect idiosyncratic to .   This term may include a variety of characteristics that
have been highlighted in the existing literature as important for eﬀectiveness: the legislator’s
seniority (Volden and Wiseman [2009], Padro i Miquel and Snyder (2006), for example), sex and
race (potentially in the presence of discrimination) and the legislator’s position in the committee
system and party hierarchy (Anderson et al. [2003], Cox and Terry [2008], for example).              The
second term, which is new in our model, captures the importance of social connections.              As in
Ballester, Calvo-Armengol and Zenou [2006], the social network is described by a  ×  matrix
 with the generic element  that measures the strength of the social influence of legislator
 on legislator .   In (1), we assume that there is a complementarity between ’s eﬀort  and
the eﬀectiveness of the legislators in ’s social circle, as measured by the weighted average of the
eﬀectiveness of the legislators with whom  has a social link. We normalize the social weights so



                                                    5
                                         P
that  ∈ [0 1] for any   and            = 1 for any . This normalization simply means that
legislator  has a total budget of resources to “help” connected colleagues: it is presumable that a
legislator with many connections will have less time per connection. Assuming that eﬀectiveness
                 £ ¤
takes a value in 0  for some   0, it is easy to see that a suﬃcient condition for  ∈ (0 1)
is that  +   1, an assumption that we will maintain throughout the analysis, where  is the
upper bound on  .
      A strategy for a legislator is described by a function  : T → [0 1], mapping ’s type  to
an eﬀort level.       When the floor opens for business, each legislator  chooses his own level of
eﬀort  simultaneously, taking as given the social network and his own expectations of the other
legislators’ eﬀectiveness. Given this, the levels of eﬀectiveness are endogenously determined by
(1).
      In the following pages, we consider very complex networks with hundreds of nodes. It is
therefore useful to define a simple statistic that describes the position of an agent in the network
(which will prove important to interpret the theoretical predictions): the Bonacich Centrality
(Bonacich [1987], Ballester, Calvo-Armengol and Zenou [2006], Zenou [2015]). For a given network
       b the vector of Bonacich centralities, if it exists, is defined as:
matrix ,
                                           ³    ´ ³       ´−1
                                               b =  − 
                                          b          b     ·1                                    (2)

where   1 is a positive parameter,  is the identity matrix and 1 is a column vector of ones. The
                                                                                  ³    ´
Bonacich centrality of legislator  with respect to b and  is the th entry of b  
                                                                                      b . Bonacich
                                                    b may fail to be invertible.
centralities may not exist because the matrix  −                                      Invertibility is
                   b if  is suﬃciently small. For the reminder of the paper, a condition that
guaranteed for any 
guarantees that the relevant Bonacich centralities exist in our environment is the following:

                                        2
Assumption 1. The matrix  −            2    is invertible and positive.

It can be shown that Assumption 1 is not satisfied only if social spillovers measured by  are very
large (so as to induce reinforcement eﬀects that lead to unbounded levels of eﬀectiveness).2       This
is implausible and indeed it is not true in our empirical analysis. It is therefore very natural to
assume that social spillovers, though significant, are suﬃciently small to allow for Assumption 1.

  2    See, for example, Theorem 1 in Ballester, Calvo-Armengol and Zenou [2006].

2.2      Equilibrium predictions

The optimal level of eﬀort  by a type  = 1   solves the problem:
                                      n       ³qP           ´               o
                                                                        2
                                   max  +     =1   ·  − ( ) 2 ,                                     (3)
                                    

Substituting the solution to this maximization in (1), we obtain that the equilibrium levels of
legislative eﬃciency for a type  = 1   are given by:
                                                         2 P
                                            =  +         =1                                            (4)
                                                         2
These equations can be expressed in matrix form as:
                                    ∙         ¸
                                          2
                                     −       ·E=A                                                                (5)
                                          2
                                               0
where E = ( 1 ( A)    ( A)) is the vector of legislative eﬀectiveness   ( A) solving (5),
                           0
and A = (1    ) is the vector of types’ characteristics.3                     It is easy to show that given
Assumption 1,  are uniquely defined with:

                                                            0 £   ¡     ¢   ¤−1
                               ( 1 ( A)    ( A)) =  − 2 2 ·     A;
                    2
The vector [− 2 ·]−1 A coincides with the vector of weighted Bonacich centralities b(2 2  A) =
                                                                                  0
(1 (2 2  A)   (2 2  A)) with weights A = (1    ) , a well know concept in sociol-
ogy and economics (see Ballester et al. [2006] for instance). We therefore have:

Proposition 1. There is a unique equilibrium in which legislator ’s legislative eﬀectiveness is
equal to  (2 2  A).

      From a theoretical point of view, a key novelty in the analysis presented above is the fact that
legislators choose the optimal legislative eﬀort  taking as given their rational expectations of
the other legislators’ levels of eﬀectiveness. This approach is similar to the approach in general
equilibrium theory in economics where consumers choose their optimal consumption taking prices
as given. As in general equilibrium theory, where prices are endogenous since they need to clear
markets, here the levels of eﬀectiveness are endogenous since they must satisfy the externality
equation (1) given the optimal eﬀort levels.

    When there are no social spillovers (i.e.,  = 0), Proposition 1 tells us that legislative eﬀec-
tiveness is determined exclusively by the individual characteristics of legislators:

                                        ( 1 ( A)    ( A))0 = A

In the presence of social spillovers among connected legislators (i.e.   0), however, the eﬀec-
tiveness of any legislator depends on the characteristics of all other legislators, with each legislator
                                                                                  £     ¡    ¢     ¤−1
weighted using their distance in the network (the weights given by the rows of  − 2 2 ·  ).
Since the standard model is nested as a special case of the more general model (with  = 0), we
will be able to test if social connections improve the fit of our estimates of E.

2.3     Empirical Model

Assume that we observe data from ̄ congresses  = {1  }, each comprised of  congressmen
and characterized by a network  = { }. Moreover, assume the vector of characteristics of
legislators in congress , A = (1    )0 , is a linear function of a vector of congressman ’s
characteristics in congress :
                                               A =  +  β + ε                                                  (6)

where ε = (1    )0 is a vector of i.i.d. shocks, β = (1    )0 is a vector of coeﬃcients
and  is a constant term. Given (6), our prediction (5) for congress  can be represented as:

                                       E =  + ∗ ·  E +  β + ε                                             (7)

where, for simplicity we denote ∗ = 2 2. System (7) is a spatial autoregressive system that can
be easily estimated given  and X . When bringing this model to the data, however, we face a
key challenge: the social network  is likely endogenous and determined by variables that also
aﬀect E . If these characteristics are omitted in  or are unobservable, then we have a biased
estimation.
    To address this concern, we implement a Heckman correction of (7) with a two stage estimation.
The idea is to estimate an extended version of our model in which we explicitly account for
a possible correlation between unobserved factors driving network formation and outcomes.4

   4 Qu and Lee (2015) implement a similar control function approach for the estimation of a spatial autoregressive

model with an endogenous spatial matrix in a geographic context. Their strategy is to model proximity between
areas as a function of observed characteristics at a first stage and then add a function of the first stage residuals to
the outcome equation.



                                                           8
Identification in Heckman selection models is notoriously diﬃcult, especially in environments like
ours in which networking in Congress is driven by the goals of the politicians. To address this
problem, we rely on an original instrument: the network of the legislators’ alumni connections.
These connections oﬀer an original instrument which rests on plausible assumptions: the network
is exogenous to the political process, but still relevant even many years after the congressmen
attend school (a fact that is well known in general and that we will documented for our specific
case below).5
    For the first step (i.e., the estimation of the network), we consider a standard dyadic model of
link formation, used previously in the literature (see, e.g., Fafchamps and Gubert [2007)], Mayer
and Puller [2008)], Lai and Reiter [2000], Apicella, Marlowe, Fowler and Christakis [2012] and
Attanasio, et al. [2012]). When used in our context, the link  between two congressmen 
and  in congress  is explained by distance between  and  in terms of characteristics according
to the model:
                                                        X
                             = 0 + 1  +             +1 | −  | +  ,                (8)
                                                              

where  for  = 1   are ’s characteristics and  denotes connections in the alumni
network. The link  is equal to the number of ’s bills cosponsored by  over the total number
of bills cosponsored by ; and the link  between two congressmen  and  in congress  is
equal to the number of educational institutions attended by both  and  whithin eight years from
each other over the total number of institutions attended by . For this definition, educational
institutions include high schools and other higher institutions attended for both undergraduate and
graduate degrees. We adopt an eight year time window to allow for post graduation interactions,
since most university make signicant eﬀorts to connect alumni graduating in nearby cohorts.6
    As standard in the literature on dyadic link formation we assume:

    5 Observe that the Heckman selection model would be identified even without exclusion restrictions. Identi-

fication, in this case, exploits non-linearities specific to the network structure of our model. The dyad-specific
repressors used in the first stage (the network formation stage) are expressed in absolute values of diﬀerences: these
diﬀerences in characteristics do not appear in the outcome equation.
    6 For example, graduates in the classes of 2008-2017 at Yale College are enlisted as members of BOLD (“Bulldogs

of the Last Decade,”), a groups for which the university organizes special events (see http://boldalumni.yale.edu/).
Similar organizations can be found, for example, at the Harvard Law School (see the GOLD association for
“Graduate Of the Last Decade,” http://hls.harvard.edu/dept/alumni/giving-to-hls/harvard-law-school-annual-
fund/graduates-of-the-last-decade/) and Stanford where, for instance, the Stanford National Black Alumni Associa-
tion organizes outreach events for young alumni (http://www.stanfordblackalumni.org/young-alumni-connectors/).
At the Princeton reunions, graduation years are organized as satellites around the classes that celebrate major re-
unions (5th, 10th, 15th, etc. reunions). Cornell University has a “Second Decade Program” for graduates 10 to 20
years past graduation (https://alumni.cornell.edu/connect/young-alumni/second-decade/).



                                                          9
Assumption 2. Assume that  = (1    )0 and  = (1    )0 are jointly normal
with (2 ) = 2 , (  ) =  for all  6= , (  ) = 2 ∀ = , and (  ) =
0 ∀ 6= .

    Assumption 2 implies that the selection eﬀect (i.e. the correlation between unobservable char-
acteristics determining link formation and unobservable characteristics driving the outcome as
measured by  ) is the same for all politicians.                  Under Assumption 2, it can be shown that
expected value of the error term conditional on the link formation is ( |1      −1 ) =
   P
 · 6=  , where  =  2 . It follows that our model can be written as:

                                  E = [ − ∗  ]−1 · [ · 1 +  β+ξ r + ε ]                                       (9)

                P                                           0
where  =       6=    with ξ r = (   ) . The term ξ r now captures the selection bias.
    An advantage of model (10) is that it allows to control for the presence of individual-level
unobserved factors. As said in the introduction, a politician’s intrinsic ability is a prominent
example. More able politicians who are more eﬀective may be more likely to attract cosponsors
and may also have attended a more prestigious school.                      Another example may be unobserved
features of the educational institutions attended by . The term  includes all unobserved
characteristics of legislator  that contribute explaining his connections in (8).
                                                                                                                 0        0
    For a sample of  agents at each congress , stack up the data by defining  = ( 1  · · ·   0̄ ) ,

                         ̄
matrix, and  = diag{ }=1 as a  ×  matrix. For the entire sample, the model is:

                                                       −1
                                     E = [ − ∗ ]         · [ · 1 + β+ξ + ε]                                     (10)

Given the social network , the covariates X and the correction ξ, we can estimate the parameters
of interest , , β, and  by Nonlinear Least squares (NLLS) using (10).7
    Inference is complicated because the selectivity term ξ is a generated regressor from a previous
estimation and no closed form solution is available for the NLLS standard errors estimates in
a network context. We use bootstrapped standard errors with 500 replications. Because of the
inherent structural dependency of network data, the design of the resampling scheme needs special
                                               h         i−1
consideration. The residuals in the vector  =  − b∗      ε in (10) are not i.i.d., and thus one

   7 An OLS estimation of this system would not be consistent because of the simultaneity which is endemic in

spatial autoregressive models (see, e.g., Anselin [1988]).


                                                                10
cannot sample with replacement from this vector. We thus use the residual bootstrap procedure in
spatial econometrics (e.g., Anselin, 1990) where resampling is performed on the structural errors
ε since they are assumed to be i.i.d. (see model (7)).8


3         Data

We measure each congressman’s legislative performance using the Legislative Eﬀectiveness Scores
(LESs) for members of the U.S. House of Representatives, developed by Volden and Wiseman
[2009]. Each member of Congress’s score is based on how many bills each legislator introduces,
as well as how many of those bills receive action in committee, pass out of committee and receive
action of the floor of the House, pass the House, and ultimately become law. Data are available on-
line by the Legislative Eﬀectiveness Project (http://www.thelawmakers.org). Volden et al. [2013]
have used it to explore the legislative eﬀectiveness of women for the 93th - 110th Congresses. A
similar index, Health ILESs, was proposed by Volden and Wiseman [2011] to examine which House
members has been most successful to advance health care bills for the 93th to 110th Congresses.
We use information from five recent election cycles: the 109th Congress (election cycle 2004) to
the 113th Congress (election cycle 2012).
        Consistent with existing theories of congressional politics, Volden and Wiseman [2009] argue
that legislative eﬀectiveness is a function of innate abilities, a cultivated set of skills, and in-
stitutional positions. The Legislative Eﬀectiveness Project thus provides data on the observed
legislators’ characteristics that are theoretically important for lawmaking eﬀectiveness. Nine fac-
tors are identified. The first one is the number of years served as a member of the Congress
(seniority). As legislators spend more time in Congress, they are expected to become better, and
more eﬀective, at lawmaking. In our data, freshmen members of Congress have an average LES
of 0.73 while it is 83% higher (1.33) for members in their fifth term. This pattern captures the
idea that congressmen cultivate the set of skills needed to achieve eﬀectiveness during their time
in the Congress. The open question, however, is which skills they develop and in which ways. Our
paper contributes to this debate by indicating that learning mechanisms are an important part of
the story.
        Consistent with the acquisition of skills over time, the second factor is previous legislative

experience. Legislators who have previously served in the state legislatures may be more eﬀective
than legislators without similar experiences.
   The subsequent three factors (party influence, committee influence, and legislative leadership)
capture the eﬀect of institutional positions on the legislative process. The bills that they endorse
are thus more likely to receive attention by their own (and other) parties and committees. By the
same reasoning, committee chairs and members of the most powerful committees (Appropriation,
Budget, Rules and Ways and Means) could also have greater legislative eﬀectiveness. Volden and
Wiseman [2009] find that the high level of eﬀort required by the members of these committees,
however, results in a number of endorsed bills which is lower that the average House member,
thus making the relationship with their LES scores negative. Party leadership is also an important
variable, with opposite eﬀects for leaders of the majority or minority party. Majority party leaders
are more likely to receive attention and have their bills pass the House. Minority Party leaders,
in contrast, find it more diﬃcult relative to other members of their party. Being Speaker of House
may also result in less eﬀectiveness, given then the LES score is based on how far legislators’ bills
advance in the legislative process and the Speaker of the House traditionally introduces few, if
any, bills.9
   The sixth factor captures ideological considerations. The Legislative Eﬀectiveness Project data
is merged with the http://voteview.com project data. It provides data on legislators’ preferences
for extreme or moderate policies. These preferences are captured by the absolute value of the
first dimension of the dw-nominate score created by McCarty et al. [1997], which measures a
legislator’s distance to the center in terms of ideology. A number of legislative politics studies
suggest a negative correlation between this variable and legislative success, reflecting idea that
moderate policies obtain a larger consensus among the members of the House (see, e.g. Krehbiel
[1992], Wiseman and Wright [2008]).
   The seventh factor captures the demographic characteristics of under-represented members in
Congress. The experiences of female and ethnic minority legislators in terms of eﬀective lawmaking
are diﬀerent from the average congressmen, though the existing literature has not reached a
consensus about the sign and the sources of these diﬀerences (Jeydel and Taylor [2003]; Volden
and Wiseman [2009]; Volden et al. [2013]).

   9 See Volden and Wiseman [2009] for further discussion about why Speakers of the House may be diﬀerent from

other legislators in terms of LES score.



                                                     12
   The eighth factor is the size of the congressional delegation, which counts the number of districts
in the state congressional delegation (and thus the number of congressmen in the House from
the same state). Legislators coming from larger congressional delegations may be more eﬀective
since they can find coalition partners among the members of their delegations. In contrast, the
presence of more legislators interested in the same issues (the interests of the state) may result
in a lower number of bills advanced in the legislative process for each legislator. The last factor
is built on the electoral competition. It is the margin of victory (i.e. the percentage of total
votes that separated the congressman from the second-place finisher in the previous election).
If voters value politicians’ legislative eﬀectiveness, then one would expect a positive relationship
between legislators’ levels of eﬀectiveness and their margins of victory. The existence and sign
of this relationship, however, is still a matter of debate. In fact, it is plausible to expect a
negative correlation if electorally vulnerable legislators expend more energy to foster their agenda
and increase support among voters. Alternatively, one may think that vulnerable legislators spend
their energy on campaigning, while legislators in safe districts commit more time to the lawmaking
process (see, e.g. Pedro I Miquel et al. [2006], Volden and Wiseman [2009]).
   Our analysis considers all the legislator characteristics indicated in the Legislative Eﬀectiveness
Project. The control set  in model (10) includes the number of years spent in Congress,
margin of victory, dw-ideology, the size of the state congressional delegation, party, chairmanship,
majority and minority party leadership, whether the congressman is the Speaker of the House,
gender and race. Because the information on previous legislative experience is missing for a large
share of politicians, we add this control in a robustness check in Section 5.4 for the subsample
of congressmen for whom the variable is available. The information on committee membership is
also exploited in Section 5.4. While Volden and Wiseman (2009) use a dummy variable capturing
membership in the most powerful committee, we include a full set of committee fixed eﬀects as a
robustness check. Members of the same committee who work on the same topic are likely to be
connected in our network since they likely cosponsor the same bills and also likely to have similar
LES scores. The committee fixed eﬀects control for these common shocks.
   We construct a legislative network using data on cosponsorship from the Library of Congress
data information system, THOMAS (http://thomas.loc.gov). We use information on the 109th-
113 Congresses. We collected all pieces of legislation proposed in these ten years and define two

members of Congress as linked if they have cosponsored the same bill.10 Each network includes
roughly 433 Representatives (including midterm replacements). As a result, we obtain a sample
of 2,176 connected congressmen. Figure 1 illustrates the cosponsorship network of the 113th U.S.
Congress in a figure in which each node corresponds to a congressman and the size of the node is
proportional to the LES of the associated congressman.11

  10 The same network definition has been used by Tam Cho and Fowler [2010] to investigate connections between

topological characteristics of these Congressional networks and the production of important pieces of legislation.
They use data for the 93th to the 108th Congresses. For the same Congresses, Fowler [2006a, 2006b] presents a
more detailed description of each legislator’s cosponsorship activities.
  11 The layout of the network was generated by the algorithm lgl (large graph layout) implemented in the R

package “igraph” (see Csardi and Nepusz [2006]). To make the Figure clearer, we are plotting a link only for
 that are in the top 5% in terms of size. The two agglomerations in Figure 1 correspond to Democrats and
Republicans. Eﬀectiveness levels are larger for Republicans because they constitute the majority in this congress.



                                                       14
    To find a measure of social connections that is extraneous to the political process, we ex-
tract information on the universities attended by the congressmen using the Biographical Direc-
tory of the United States Congress (available online at http://bioguide.Congress.gov/biosearch/
biosearch.asp) and construct a membership network based on educational experience.12 Specifi-
cally, we match politicians to their colleges and universities. A tie between two congressmen exists
if they graduated from the same institution within eight years of each other. By using alumni
connections, we are able to link about forty percent of congressmen. Table A1 in the Appendix
provides a detailed description of the variables used in this study, together with summary statistics
for our sample.


4     Estimation Results

We begin our empirical analysis by showing that the alumni networks are still relevant even
many years after the congressmen attended school. This exercise constitutes the first step of our
analysis. Table 1 collects the OLS estimation results of model (8), with an incresing set of control
variables. Table 1 shows that two politicians who attended the same educational institution are
more likely to cosponsor the same piece of legislation than two politicians who attended diﬀerent
universities or the same university at diﬀerent times, keeping constant similarities in terms of
observed characteristics. We consider similarities in terms of seniority, vote share, party, ideology,
chairmanship, party leadership, speaker, gender, race and Congress fixed eﬀects.13
    Table 2, Column (1) reports the OLS estimates of the traditional model in which campaign
contributions are explained using only legislators’ characteristics (ignoring the fact that congress-
men are connected). This is the specification used by Volden and Wiseman [2009]. Although we
use more recent data, most of the estimates remain in line with their findings. Table 2, Column
(2) presents the NLLS estimates of our model (equation (7)). The estimates reveal a positive and
statistically significant estimate of ∗ , which confirms the presence of externalities as predicted by
our theory. We formally test whether the model fit improves with the addition of network eﬀects

  12 We use academic institutions attended for both undergraduate and graduate degrees. In dealing with multiple

campuses, we matched each satellite campus as a separate university (e.g., University of California at Los Angeles,
San Diego, and Berkeley are treated as separate universities). We match specialized school to the university. We
drop observations where a specialized school name could match multiple universities (e.g., School of Management).
  13 Our findings are in line with Cohen and Malloy’s [2014] results showing that alumni networks help to explain

voting patterns of Senators from the 101st to the 110th Congress.

(relative to the traditional linear regression in which ∗ = 0) using a partial F-test.14 The F-test
rejects the hypothesis that the model with  6= 0 does not provide a significantly better fit than
the model with ∗ = 0 (  001). In Column (3), we show the estimation results when control-
ling for network endogeneity (model (9)). It appears that the estimate of the selection correction
term is statistically significant and negative. This is consistent with the presence of unobservable
characteristics that are positively correlated with, say, legislator ’s legislative eﬀectiveness, but
negatively with variables that aﬀect other legislators’ inclinations to cosponsor bills proposed by
 (or viceversa). For example,  may have very specialized knowledge, so s/he sponsor only few
bills, but very eﬀectively. The partial F-test comparing the fit of the model without correction
versus the fit of the model with correction shows that the fit of the model is further improved when
adding the correction. The important result here is that the estimate of our target parameter 
maintains its statistical significance and positive sign.
    The coeﬃcients on most of the control variables are significant across models [Column (1)-
Column (3)]. However, the interpretation and magnitude of these eﬀects diﬀers. Indeed, if ∗  0
(in model (9)), then the marginal eﬀect of the -th covariate is not   but ( − ∗ )−1 ( ),
which is an  ×  matrix with its ( )-th element representing the eﬀect of a change in 
on  . The important diﬀerence is that the marginal eﬀects are heterogeneous across individuals,
since they depend on the individual’s position in the network. In Table 3, Panel (b) we show
the magnitudes of the diagonal elements of this matrix [that is, the marginal eﬀect of a change
in  for  , based on the estimates in Column (3) of Table 2] We report the mean, standard
deviation, minimum and maximum values. Panel (a) shows the OLS marginal eﬀects, which can
be compared to the mean values in Panel (b). In comparing the OLS estimates with the average
eﬀects of the model with network eﬀects, we can see that the OLS estimates overestimate the eﬀects
of all of the legislators’ characteristics. The OLS estimates are even higher than the maximum
estimate from the model with network eﬀects. For example, the OLS estimates suggest that being
a committee chair is associated with an increase of 1.97 LES score points. This is higher than
what is estimated in the network model with the strongest externalities (18% lower in magnitude).
Thus this evidence suggests that the eﬀects of the politicians’ characteristics are capturing network

eﬀects. Traditional estimates of the eﬀects of these characteristics on legislative eﬀectiveness which
ignore those externalities risk overstating their importance by omitting a relevant variable, social
connectedness.
    Before turning to robustness checks and extensions, it is useful to compare the predictions of our
model with the predictions we would have obtained if we attempted to establish the importance of
network centrality using standard measures that are not backed by a theoretical analysis. There
are two issues to discuss. The first is the eﬀect of the traditional measures when endogeneity
issues are taken into account. The second is how our analysis would change if we included these
variables in our estimation.
    Table 4 presents OLS estimates of the relationship between politicians’ legislative eﬀectiveness
and Betweenness, Closeness and Eigenvalue centralities.15 All control variables have the expected
signs, consistent with Table 2, and it appears that a high connectedness score in the network of
cosponsorship has a positive and significant impact in advancing agenda items [Columns (1), (3),
and (5)]. This is consistent with Fowler [2006a], who studied the relation between centrality
measures in the network of cosponsorship, and the number of amendments passed by each legis-
lator in each Congress. However, when controlling for the unobserved factors related to agent’s
connectivity following our estimation strategy,16 centrality measures are no longer significantly
diﬀerent from zero [Columns (2), (4) and (6)]. More importantly, when those centrality measures
are included in a regression where network eﬀects are modeled as predicted by the theory [Col-
umn (8)], they lose statistical significance: only the measure of network externality supported by
Proposition 1, , seems to matter.


5     Discussions and extensions

In this section, we extend the basic model of Section 2 and the empirical analysis of Section 4 in
many dimensions to investigate the determinants of legislative success and explore the robustness

  15 Degree centrality counts the total number of direct connections. Closeness centrality measures the length of

the average shortest path passing between a node and each other node. Betweenness is equal to the number of
shortest paths from all nodes to each other that passes through that node . Eigenvalue centrality of agent  is the
th component of the eigenvector associated to the highest eigenvalue of . See Jackson [2008] for an introduction
and detailed description of these measures.
  16 For each centrality measure, in the first step, a politician’s centrality score in the cosponsorship network is

explained as a function of individual characteristics and the centrality measure in the alumni network. The residuals
of this regression are then used as a selection correction term in the second step regression when the LES score is
explained by the centrality score (and controls).

of the results.   In Section 5.1, we extend the model to allow for heterogeneous social spillovers
that may depend on the legislators’ characteristics. In Section 5.2, we explore the role of parties
as a factor enhancing or inhibiting productive social connections. In Section 5.3, we investigate
whether social connections matter more in early or late stages of the legislative process. In Section
5.4, we present a number of robustness checks of the baseline estimations.

5.1       Heterogeneity

In the previous analysis, we have assumed that the network externality is described by a single
parameter, , that is the same for all agents.      However, it is plausible to assume that network
externalities are heterogeneous. For example, the degree to which an agent is “useful” to others
may depend on whether or not the agent is a committee chair, has high seniority.           The ability
to “use” other legislators may also be heterogeneous. By extending the model to allow for these
eﬀects, we can study the determinants of these heterogeneous social externalities (which may be
an important component of power in Congress).
    To study this question let us generalize (1) to allow ’s usefulness to depend on his character-
istics:
                                             q P
                                  =  +       ( ·  ) ·                            (11)
                                                                                              
In (11) we allow for heterogeneity in social spillovers by splitting  in 2 variables, ( )=1 and
( )=1 . The variable  can be interpreted as measuring how legislator ’s eﬀectiveness is sus-
ceptible to the eﬀectiveness of his socially connected peers: a legislator with a higher  is able to
better “use ” all the other legislators whom he has befriended. The variable  , instead, describes
how legislator ’s eﬀectiveness is useful to his socially connected peers: a legislator  with a higher
 is more “useful” to all the legislators who have befriended him.
    Following essentially the same steps as in Section 2.2, we can derive the analog of (4) for this
more general model, obtaining:
                                           1 P
                                   =  +  =1  ·                                   (12)
                                           2
These equations can be expressed in matrix form as:

                                       [ − Φ ·  · Λ] · E = A                                    (13)
                                                                      √
where Λ is a diagonal matrix with th diagonal component equal to   2 and Φ is a diagonal
                                              √
matrix with th diagonal element equal to   2.

                                                  18
   To bring (13) to the data, we assume:

                                                √
                                            =  2(0 + 0 θ 1 )                                        (14)
                                                √
                                            =  2(0 + 0 γ 1 )

where  = (1     ) is a vector of characteristics of , 0 , θ1 = (1     ) and 0 , γ 1 =
( 1      ) are coeﬃcients. To interpret (14), imagine that the th component of θ1 and γ 1 is
seniority.   Then   0 (respectively,   0) means that the seniority of a legislator increases
(resp., reduces) the ability of the legislator “use ” the eﬀectiveness of his socially connected peers;
   0 (resp.,    0) means that seniority of a legislator increases (resp., reduces) the usefulness
of the eﬀectiveness a legislator to his socially connected peers.
   Once we insert (14) in (13), the parameters of the model can be again jointly estimated using
NLLS as in the estimation of (9).
   The estimation of (13), in which we include the legislators’ personal characteristics (the 
variables), are presented in Tables 5a and 5b. We find that ethnic minorities appear to benefit more
than the average congressmen from social interactions, whereas congressmen with higher seniority
and committee chairs receive less benefits form interacting with others than other members of the
Congress.

5.2    The influence of parties

An important political factor which deserves special attention is the role of parties in fostering or
hindering social connections among legislators. For example, is it more useful for a Republican to
befriend a fellow Republican or to befriend a Democrat? A natural conjecture is that intraparty
connections are more useful than interparty connections, especially in the polarized landscape
that has developed in Congress since the 1970s. However, having some support from the other
party may be essential to advance bills through the legislative process. Addressing this question
is paramount for understanding the role of social connections in Congress.
   To allow for party eﬀects, let us reorder the legislators in congress  so that the first  are
Republicans and the second  =  −  are Democrats.                 The matrix  can now be divided
into four submatrices.     The top left  ·  dimensional submatrix collects the interactions of
Republicans with fellow Republicans; the bottom right  ·  dimensional submatrix collects the
interactions of Democrats with fellow Democrats; the top right  ·  dimensional submatrix


                                                     19
shows the influence of Democrats on Republicans (i.e.  where  is Democrat and  Republican);
and finally the bottom left  ·  dimensional submatrix shows the influence of Republicans on
Democrats (i.e.  where  is Republican and  Democrat).
   We can now decompose  in two  ×  matrices ∗ and ∗∗           ∗    ∗∗         ∗
                                                           with  =  +  , where 

is a matrix that has the same top left and bottom right components as  and it is zero otherwise
and ∗∗
      is a matrix that has the same bottom left and top right components as  and it is zero

otherwise. Given this, we can extend the basic model by assuming:
                                      q P                      P ∗∗
                         =  +          ∗
                                       ∗   ·  + ∗∗   ·  ·                        (15)

In (15) we are distinguishing between the eﬀects of intraparty and interparty social connections,
allowing them to be diﬀerent: if the impact of ’s eﬀectiveness on a legislator of the same party is
greater (resp. smaller) than that of a legislator of a diﬀerent party, then we should see ∗  ∗∗
(resp., ∗  ∗∗ ). If we impose ∗ = ∗∗ , we are back at the baseline model (9).
   Starting from (15), we can easily derive:

                                      1 h ∗P ∗                 ∗∗ P ∗∗
                                                                                  i
                         =  +          ·  +       ·                         (16)
                                      2

that in matrix form becomes:
                             ∙                   ¸−1
                                 1 ∗ ∗     ∗∗ ∗∗
                         E =  − (  +   )     · [ · 1 +  β + ε ]                                (17)
                                 2

Given the social network  , from which we can easily construct ∗ and ∗∗
                                                                           , and the covariates

 , we can now estimate (17) as before by NLLS.
   Table 6 shows the estimation results. The results appear to favor the hypothesis that being
able to find support from outside one’s own party is very useful, a result that appears in line with
many informal accounts of how Congress works in practice.17               It is interesting to note that the
increasing polarization of politics in the U.S. Congress since the 1970s was paired by a drastic
reduction in its aggregate productivity (see, for example, Mann and Orstein [2016] on this). The
results of Table 6 may contribute to an understanding of why the increase in polarization has led
to a reduction in aggregate productivity.

   17 Formal accounts on the importance of bridging gaps between parties include the biographies of notable leg-

islators such as Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill (see O’Neil [1988] and Matthews [2013]), Senator Ted Kennedy
(see Canellos [2009]), and Representative (and then Senator and President) Lyndon Johnson (see Caro [2003]).

5.3     Timing of interactions

In this section, we investigate whether network eﬀects are more important in the early or late
stages of the legislative process. We follow the classification presented by Volden and Wiseman
[2009] who categorize bills as follows: bills proposed in the House of Representatives (BILL); bills
that received any action in committee (AIC); and bills that received some action beyond the
committee stage, distinguishing here between those that have passed (PASS) in the House, those
that have not passed in the House (ABC), and those that have become law (LAW). The Legislative
Eﬀectiveness score (LES) that we used in the previous analysis is calculated by averaging the five
indicators (BILL, AIC, ABC, PASS, LAW) and then normalizing so that the average LES takes
a value of 1 in each congress. (The fraction of bills in each category is weighted by the category’s
importance.)18 We now perform the same analysis considering each class separately.
    Table 7 collects the NLLS estimations of (9) when the LES score is decomposed in order to
isolate the congressmen’s eﬀectiveness at diﬀerent stages of the legislative process. In Columns (1)
and (2), the dependent variable measures the congressmen’s eﬀectiveness at the very early stages
of the legislative, i.e. when eﬀectiveness is calculated using only bills categorized as BILL. In
Columns (3) and (4), the dependent variable is eﬀectiveness computed using the bills in BILL and
the bills deemed as AIC, thus capturing eﬀectiveness at the next step in the legislative process.
Finally, in Columns (5) and (6), the dependent variable is eﬀectiveness of congressmen at the later
stages of the legislative process. In this case the dependent variable is calculated including all bills
that received any action beyond the committee stage on the floor of the House (ABC, PASS,
LAW). The three dependent variables (BILL, BILL+AIC, ABC+PASS+LAW) are normalized so
that their average take a value of 1 in each congress.
    The results in Table 7 show that network eﬀects are positive and significant for all stages
of the legislative process. Interestingly, looking at the control variables one can see that the
characteristics making legislators eﬀective change along the stages of the legislative process. More
senior congressman, committee chairs, and minority leaders acquire a sizable premium importance

  18 Volden and Wiseman [2009] categorize a bill’s relevance in three groups: i) commemorative (C), ii) substantive

and significant (SS), iii) substantive (S). A bill is deemed commemorative (C) when its subject is a provision for
a renaming, a commemoration, the private relief of an individual, and the like. A bill is deemed substantive and
significant (SS) if it had been the subject of an end-of-the-year write-up in the Congressional Quarterly Almanac.
Finally, all other bills, and any “commemorative” bills that were also the subject of a CQ Almanac write-up are
classified as substantive (S). Bills assigned to the substantive and significant category are counted 10 times more
than those in the commemorative category, and twice as much as those in the substantive category.




                                                        21
at a later stage of the legislative process. Legislators with more extreme ideologies are more active
in proposing bills, but their extremism does not help in advancing those bills through the legislative
process. Finally, we observe that females are more penalized in the early stages.

5.4     Other robustness checks

To control for unobserved factors that may aﬀect the parameter estimates in (9) and are not
captured by our Heckman correction, in Columns (1) and (2) of Table 8 we include in our model
(9) dummies for all the congressional committees (21 dummies). Committees are an important
institutional feature of the legislative process and have been shown to be an important determi-
nant of social connections (see, for example, Caldeira and Patterson [1987], Caldeira et al. [1993]
and Arnold et al. [2000]).19         As shown in the table, the estimates barely change, confirming
the robustness of the results. Interestingly, the importance of unobserved factors remains statisti-
cally diﬀerent from zero, signaling that unobserved factors that simultaneously aﬀect politicians’
legislative activity and patterns of cosponsorships are not the same for all members of a given
committee.
    We conclude this section by adding in the control set of the congressman’s previous legislative
experience. This is one of the nine factors indicated by Volden and Wiseman [2009] as drivers of
legislative eﬀectiveness. The Legislative Eﬀectiveness Project dataset, however, does not report
this information for about 20% of the politicians in our sample. Therefore we did not include it
in our previous analysis to preserve the sample size. In Columns (3) and (4) of Table 8 we report
the estimation results of model (9) when it is run on the subsample of congressmen for which this
information is available. Previous legislative eﬀectiveness is captured using a dummy taking value
one whether a legislator has previously served in the state legislature (and 0 otherwise) and its
interaction with the state’s level of professionalism (see, e.g. Squire [1992]). Table 8 shows that
our results hold true, and the point estimates are very close in magnitude to the ones in Table 2,
Columns (2) and (3). Columns (5) and (6) of Table 8 show the results with committee dummies.
Again, the estimates of the externality remain positive and statistically significant, indicating that

  19 Caldeira et al. [1993] find that representatives who share committee assignments are more likely to identify

one another as a “friend” or “respected legislator,” and that the probability of social bonds increases with the
number of shared assignments. As noted by Caldeira et al. [1993], “the business of the legislature largely happens
in its committees and subcommittees, where legislators become familiar with and take a measure of colleagues in a
task-oriented environment. Legislators on the same committees or subcommittees share substantive interests and
common workloads, so they have good reasons for establishing a relationship” (p. 12).

our evidence of network eﬀects is not driven by common shocks at the level of the committee.


6     Conclusions

This paper presents a simple theory of legislative eﬀectiveness in which a legislator’s performance
depends not only on his own characteristics and eﬀort, but also on the legislative eﬀectiveness of
the legislators with whom he has social connections. Using data from five recent Congresses, we
structurally estimate this model and test for the importance of social connections in determining
legislative eﬀectiveness.
    Consistent with the theory, we find that congressmen’s weighted Bonacich centralities have a
significant eﬀect on their levels of legislative eﬀectiveness. Moreover, we find that controlling for
the endogeneity of the network connections has important implications.           If we ignore network
endogeenity, then all measures of congressmen’s network centralities are significant predictors of
their levels of legislative eﬀectiveness, leading to spurious correlations. Most measures of centrality,
however, are not significant when we control for network endogeneity.         The centrality measure
suggested by our model remains significant not only when we control for endogeneity, but also
when we include committee fixed eﬀects and, importantly, when we include all other standard
measures of centrality as controls in a “horse race.”
    With our framework, we can also study the sources of social influence by allowing for hetero-
geneous network eﬀects. We find that ethnic minorities appear to benefit more than the average
congressmen from social interactions, whereas congressmen with higher seniority and committee
chairs receive less benefits form interacting with others than other members of the Congress. When
we focus on the role of parties, we find that connections with those outside one’s own party are
more important than connections within one’s own party, supporting the hypothesis that more
eﬀective legislators are those able to find support from outside their own party. Finally, we find
that network eﬀects are significant in all stages of the legislative process, but they appear to
become more important in the later stages.

Notes. NLLS estimated coefficients and bootstrapped standard errors with 500 replications are reported. *, **, *** indicate statistical
significance at the 10, 5 and 1 percent level. In columns (1) and (2), the dependent variable measures congressmen effectiveness at the
earlier stages of the legislative process as the fraction of bills that they have introduced in the House of Representatives (BILL). In columns
(3) and (4), the dependent variable also considers the fraction of bills that received any action in committee (AIC). In columns (5) and (6),
the dependent variable indicates the effectiveness of congressmen at the later stages of the legislative process. The variable includes the
fraction of bills that received any action beyond committee on the floor of the House (ABC), that have passed the House (PASS), and
became law (LAW). The three dependent variables (BILL, BILL+AIC, ABC+PASS+LAW) are normalized so that their average take a
value of 1 in each Congress. The Legislative Effectiveness Score (LES) is a weighted average of the five indicators (BILL, AIC, ABC,
PASS, LAW) which is in turn normalized so that the average LES takes a value of 1 in each Congress. The details of this method are in
