                                             ABSTRACT

We combine data on individual trade transactions from U.S. customs records with comprehensive
information on firms' employment from the Census Bureau's business register to examine wholesalers
and retailers in U.S. exports and imports. Exporters and importers with 100 percent employment in
wholesale and retail differ from pure "producer and consumer" trading firms along a number of dimensions:
they are smaller in terms of employment, trade value and domestic sales, operate fewer U.S. establishments
and are present in fewer U.S. states. "Mixed" firms, i.e., those with both production/consumption and
wholesale retail within the boundaries of the firm, on the other hand, are substantially larger. They
trade more products, trade with more countries, and are more likely to engage in related-party trade.

 Notes: Each cell reports the results of a different firm OLS regression of noted characteristic on a dummy
 variable for noted firm type versus PC firms. Top- (bottom-) panel regressions include major six-digit HS
 category (product-country) fixed effects. All regressions except those in first row control for firm size (see text).
 Robust standard errors clustered according to the fixed effects are reported below coefficients. ***, ** and *
 denote statistical significance at the 1, 5 and 10 percent levels. Data are for 2002.

     Notes: Table reports country-level OLS regressions for three dependent variables: log aggregate value per
     country (top panel), the log number of firm-product observations with positive trade per country (extensive margin;
     middle panel) and log average value per firm-product observation with positive trade per country (intensive
     margin, bottom panel). Robust standard errors reported below coefficients. Data are for 2002.
