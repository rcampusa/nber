        QUANTIFYING INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MOBILITY IN TIlE           1980s


                                    ABSTRACT




      The Feldstein-Horioka finding, that national saving and investment have been
highly correlated in the past, has not been primarily due to econometric problems
such as endogenous fiscal policy; it has held up equally well when instrumental
variables are used. But the inflow of capital to the United States has been so large
in recent years that an updating of the sample period to 1987 produces a coefficient
on national saving that is lower than in past studies. This decline in the degree of
crowding out of investment can be attributed to the increased degree of financial
market integration in the 1980s. Capital controls and other bathers to the
movement of capital across national borders remained for such countries as the
United Kingdom and Japan as recently as 1979, and France and Italy as recently as
1986. But a new data set of forward exchange rates for 25 countries shows that a
continuing worldwide trend of integration of financial markets in the 1980s had all
but eliminated short-term interest differentials for major industrialized countries by
1988.
           It is only the country premium that has been eliminated however, this
means that only covered interest differentials are small. Nominal and real exchange
rate variability remain, and indeed were larger in the 1980s than in the 1970s. The
result is that a currency premium remains, consisting of an exchange risk premium
plus expected real currency depreciation. The popular null hypothesis that expected
real depreciation is constant at zero is tested, and rejected, with a 119-year sample.
(Post-1973 data sets do not allow enough observations to provide a useful test of
this null hypothesis.) The existence of expected real depreciation means that, even
if interest rates are equalized internationally when expressed in a common currency,
large differentials in j interest rates remain. Investors have no incentive to
arbitrage away such differentials. Because there is no force tying the domestic real
interest rate to the world real interest rate, it follows that there is no reason to
expect any country's shortfalls of national saving to be completely financed by
borrowing from abroad.

This paper was written for the National Thireau of Economic
Research conference on Saving, Maui, January 6-7, 1989.

    Feldetein and Horioka upset conventional wisdom in 1980
when they concluded that changes in countries' rates of
national savirg bad very large effect on their rates of
investment, arid interpreted this finding as evidence of low
capital mobility. Although their regressions bave been subject
to a great variety, of criticisms, their basic flniin seems to
bold .p. But does it iirly imperfect capital mobility?
     Let us begin by king why we would ever expect a
shortfall in one country's national saving      to reduce the
overall availability of funds and thereby crad cut investment
projects that might otherwise be undertaken in that country.
The aggregation together of all forms of "capital" has caused
more than the usual annunt of confusion in the literature on
international capital mobility. Nobody ever claimed that
international flats of foreign direct investment were large

country would costless]-y be uzxiertaken directly by a foreign
company when there was a shortfall in dcttestic savirq)
Rather, the argument was that the typical Nterican corporation
could borrow at the goirg interest rate in order to finance its
investtant projects and, if the degree of capital biity were
sufficiently high, the goirg interest rate would be tied down
to the world interest rate by international flows of portfolio
capital. If portfolio capital were a perfect substitute for
thysical capital, then the differenoe nild be 3nnaterial; bit
the two types of capital probably are rrit in fact perfect
substitutes.
    This paper examines a nwter of alternative ways of
opantifyirg the degree of international capital ntility. One
conclusion is that the barriers to cross-border flows are
sufficiently low that, by 1989, financial markets can be said
to be virtually cailetely intejrat& anor the large
irdustria]. countries (and ancn sane Enaller countries as
well). Bat this is a different prqDosition fran sayir that
real interest rates are equalized across countries, which is
still different fran sayirg that investment projects in a
country are unaffected by a shortfall in national savin. We
will see that there are several crucial links that can, and
probably do, fail to hold.
     In many cases, notably the United Kixqlan and Japan (and
 perhaps now Italy and France as well) the firdirq of high
                               2
integration with world finarcial markets is a relatively na'
one, attribitable to liberalization prograns aver the last ten
years. Even in the case of financial markets lit the United
States, integration with the Eurcnarkets appears to have been
incxrplete as recently as 1982 • 2 An important orclusion of
this paper for the United States is that the current accc*int
deficits of the 198 Os have been large eroagh, aM by rn have
lasted lor ena4, to reduce significantly estimates of the
correlation between saving aM invesbrt. This is true even
for time series that go back as far as the 1870s.          The
increased degree of worldwide financial integration since 1979
is identified as one factor that has allowed such large capital
flows to take place over the past decaiD. at even if U.S.
interest rates are now viewed as tied to world interest rates3,
there are still other weak links in the chain. The implication
is that crowdirq out of domestic invesbient can still take
place.

 1. Four Alternative fthitions of International jta].
Mobility


     By the seooM half of the 1970s, international ecaticeists
 had cate to speak of the world financial systan as
 characterized by perfect capital mobility. In marty ways, this
 was "jtmping the gun." It is true that financial integration
 had been greatly enhanced after 1973 by the raicval of capital
                               3
controls on the part of the United States, Gern'ariy, Canada,
Switzerlard an the Netherlards: by the steady process of
technical aid institutional innovation, particularly in the
Euromarkets: arci by the recycling of OPEC surpluses to
developirq countries, ait a]2rst all developing countries
retained extensive restrictions on international capita]. flows,
as did a majority of irdustrialized countries. Even among the
five major countries without capital controls, capital was not
perfectly mobile by sane definitions.


    There are at least four distinct definitions of perfect
capital mobility that are in widespread use. (I) The
Feldstein-Horioka definition:   exogernis changes in national
saving (i.e., in either private savings or government budgets)
can be easily financed by borrowing fran abroad at the going
real interest rate, art thus need not cr1 out investment in
the originating country (except perhaps to the extent that the
country is large in world financial markets). (II)
interest parity: International capital flows ualize real
interest rates across countries. (III) Uncovered interest
parity: Capital flows ualize expected rates of return on
countries' bords, despite exposure to exchange risk. (IV)
Closed interest parity: Capital flows e4ualize interest rates
across countries when contracted in a oanrrn currency. These
four possible definitions are in ascerding order of
specificity. Only the last cordition is an unalloyed criterion
                                4
for capital irbility in the sense of the degree of financial
market integration across national bairdaries. 4
    As we will see each of the first three corditions, if it
is to hold, req.iires an auxiliary asstnrçtion in addition to the
cordition that follows it. Uncovered interest parity requires
not only closed (or covered) interest parity, bit also the
cordition that the exchange risk premium is zero. Real
interest parity requires not only uncovered interest parity,
but also the corxlition that eet&1 real depreciation is zero.
The Feldstein-Horioka cordition requires not only real interest
parity, bit also a certain cordition on the determinants of
investment.   Bat even though the relevance to the degree of
integration of financial markets decreases as auxiliary
corrlitions are added, the relevance to questions regaxdirg the
origin of intertational payments imbalances increases.        We

begin cur consideration of the various criteria of capital
ucbility with the Feldstein-Horioka definition.


2 Feldstein-Horioka Tests


    The Feldstein-Horio]ca definition requires that the
country's real interest rate is tied to the rld real interest
rate by criterion (II); it is, after all, the real interest
rate rather than the nominal on tcfl savin ard investment in
theory deperd.    Bat for criterion (I) to hold, it is also
necessary that any an all determinants of a country's rate of
                                5
invesbnex* other than its real interest rate be uricorrelated
with its rate of national saving. tat the investment rate be
given by
(1)        (I/Y)±=a-br+U,
where I is the level of capital formation, I is national
itput, r is the domestic real interest rate, ani u represents
all other factors, whether quantifiable or not, that detennine
the rate of investment. Feldstein aM Horioka (1980) regressed
the investhent rate against the national saving rate,
(1')           (I/Y)iA+B(NS/Y)i+vi,
where NB is private saving minus the bxlget deficit. To get
the zero coefficient B that they were looking for requires not
only real interest parity:
(2)
 (with the rld interest rate r* excqenous or in any other way
uncorrelatsi. with (NSf!) jj, but also a zero correlation between
uj aM (NS/Y)i.


2.1 The Saving-InvestlEnt literature

       Feldstein aM Horioka' s firding that the coefficient B is
in fact closer to 1 than to zero has been reproduced many
tires. Most authors have not been willing, ha',ever, to fol1i
them in drawing the inference that financial markets are not
 highly integrated. There have been many econometric critiques,
 falling into t general categories.
                                 6
    Itet anitnly made is the point that national saving is
eniogencus, or In our tens is correlated with uj. This will
be the case if national savin and invesart are both
procyc].ical, as they are in fact Joiam to be, or if they both
respond to the popilatiat or productivity growth rates • 5 it
will also be the case if governnents resrd erogernis1y to
incipient cirrerxt acort IithaJ.ances with policies to diange
piblic (or private) saving in such a way as to red'tre the
imbaj.ancss. This "policy reaction" argument has been made by
FieJ.eke (1982), 'Ithin (1983), Westjtal (1983), Capric aid
Howard (1984), Suimers (1988) and Rciubini. (1988).            Thxt

Feldstein   and Horioka made an effort to handle the econaiietric
erdcgeneity of national saving, nnre so than have sane of their
critics.  To handle the cyclical erdogeneity, they ccztp.ited
avenges over a long enough period of tine that business cycles
could be argued to wash out. To handle other sources of
erdogeneity, they used deicgratic variables as instnunental
variables for the saving rate.
     The other econcmetric critiqqe is that if       the dcmestic
country    is large in world finamial markets, r* will not be

exogercus with resp&t to (NS/Y) j,   and                  r=r*,
                                           therefore even if

r and in turn (1/1)i will  be correlated with (NS/Y)i. In other
words, a shortfall in danestic savirqs will drive up the world
interest rate, and thus craid out investment in the dcrestic
country as well as abroad. This "large—camtry" arg.nnent has
been made by Murçhy (1984)           and Tctin (1983).          An
                                 7
insufficiently-appreciated point is that the 1arge-irxtxy
argument does not create a prd1 in cross-section sbxlies,
because afl cntrrtries share the sane world interest rate fl.
since r* sfli1y goes into the constant term in a cross-section
regression, it cannot be the source of any correlation with the
rightbard-side variable. The large-countzy problat cannot
explain why the countries that are high-saving: relative to the
average taM to coincide with the camtries that are high-
investirg relative to the average. 6

   If the regressions of savirq aid investient rates were a
good test for barriers to finamial market integration, ore
would expect to see the coefficient fallirg over tine. Until
noc, the evidence has if anything: showed the coefficient rising
over ti rather than falling. This firdirg has eriergal both
fran cross-section studies, which typically report pre—ard
post—1973 results — Feldstein (1983), Penati aid Dooley
(1984), aid Dooley, FrarikeJ. aid Itthieson (1987) — aid fran

(.1986) for the United States. The ecornietric eidogeneity of
rational saving does not appear to be the explanation for this
fitting, because it holds &pally well when instrtmental
variables are used.8
     The easy explanation for the firdirg is that, enntric
probleis aside, real interest parity — criterion (II) above—
 has not held any better in recent years than it did in the
                               8

period. Canaazza et al (1986, ç. 43-47) also fast that sn
of the major industrialized caintries in the 1980s (1980.1—
1985.6) ixned farther frcr real interest parity than they had
been in the 1970s (l973.7—l979.12). In the early 1980s, the
real interest rate in the Unitel States, in particular, rcee
far above the real interest rate of its major tradinj partners,
by any of a variety of nEasures.1° If the domestic real
interest rate is not tied to the foreign real interest rate,
then there is no reason to expect a zero coefficient in the
savirq—investnent regression. We discuss in a later section
the factors urderlyin real interest differentials.

2.2 The U.S. savim-investnsnt regressicqj3ated

        Sirce 1980 the massive fiscal experlm't carried ait urder
the Reagan Mministration has been rapidly wderninlxg the
statistical firñirg of a high savirq—investnent correlation for
the case of the United States. The increase in the structural
budget deficit, which was neither accxntdatal by ncxnetary
policy nor finarted by an increase in private savirq, reduced
the national savin rate by 3 per cent of QIP, relative to the
1970s. The investment rate — which at first, like the savirq
                                 9
rate,     fell in the 1981—82 recession —               had    by 1988
approximately reattained ità 1980 level at best.              The saving
shortfall. was made up, necessarily, by a flood of borrcwirq
frt abroad equal to more than three per cent of Q1P. Hence
the current acxxirit deficit of $161 billion in 1987.                (By

contrast, the U.S. current aoccunt balance was on average equal
to zero in the 19705.)
        By rat, the divergence between U.S. national saving aid
investnent has been sufficiently large aM long-lasting to sbai
up in longer-ten regressions of the Feldstein-Horioka type.
If one seeks to isolate the degree of capital mobility or
cr'ing cut        for   the United States in particular, aid     bow it

has changed over tine, then tine       series   regression is necessary
(whereas if one     is   concerned with such neasuree worldwide, then
cross-section regressions of the sort perforn by Feldstein
aid Horio]ca are better).    Table 1 reports instrumental
variables regressions of invesbient against national saving for
the United States fran 1870 to 1987. 12 rc&3a averages are
used for each variable, which rwves sate of the cyclical
variation bat gives us only 12 observations. (Yearly data are
not     in any case available before 1930.)          That is   one more

observation than was available in Frankel (1986, Table 2 •2),

which went only thravjh the 1970's. Figure 1 plots the decMe

data.

We can alla for a tiixe trent in the coefficient; it drops

accomplished by first regressing it on the QIP gap, defined as
the percentage deviation fran the flireau of Economic Analysis's
"middle eansion treni" of QIP, ant taking the residuals.]
     In previais K)rk with a sample pericd of 1956—1984, the
coefficient in a regression of cyclically adjusted saving ant

sarple of artther three years of record current account
deficits, 1985-87, a period      also in which the cyclically

adjusted national savirq rate was historicafly low. When the

U.S. national saving ard the current annt in the 1980s.
       To verify that the 198Os experience is ireed the source
of   the precipitous fall in the savirg-investnent ooeffioient,13
the satple period    is split at 1980. For the period 1955-79,

 clearly the unprecedented deve1opints of the present decade

 that finarcia]. liberalization in Japan, the United Xirdan, aid
 other countries, aid continued innovation in the Eurcrarkets

 (aid perhaps the 1984 repeal of the U.S. withholdirg tax on

3. Differentials iii xpected Rates ofeturn. and Lcpeced Real



     If the goal is to sure the degree of integration of
capital markets, rather than the degree to which deases in
national saving have aaded azt investhient, then it is better
to look at differences in rates of retirn aacse countries
rather than lookixg at saving-investiant correlations?6 at
measuring zJ. interest differentials will not do the trick.
An international investor, when deciding what ortzy' s assets
to biy, will not rpare the interest rates in different
countries each expressed in tens of expected pirthasirg paier
over that country's goods. When he or she thinks to evaluate
assets in terms of purchasing pcser, all assets will be
evaluated in tens of the sam basket, the one consumd by that
particular investor. The expected inflation rate then drcçs
at of differentials in expected rates of return      assets.

     The differential in expected rates of return on two
countries • bards is the uncovered interest differential, the
mninal interest differential minus the expected charqe in the
                               13
extharqe rate:              i — i* — (e, depr). If asset denards
are hi'1y sensitive to eqsta rates of return, then the
differential will be zero, which gives us urcoverel interest
parity:
(3)      i—i*— (expdepr) =0.
To distirquish this parity ctnlition, which is Criterion (III)
above, fran the other definitions, it has often been designat
"perfect substitutability:" rct only is there little in the
narmer of transactions ooets or goverrmient-bpoeed trols to
separate national markets, hit also danestic-airrercy ard
foreign-airrency bords are perfect substitutes in investors'
portfolios.
        Just as Criterion (I) is considerably stronger than
Criterion (II), so is Criterion (II) considerably stronger than
Criterion (III). For real interest parity to bold, one mist
have riot only uzvered interest parity, hit an &ZJ.tional
coniition as well, which is sacet±ies cailsi ex ante relative
purchasing patier parity:
 (2')      exp depr — exp   intl - eç infl*.
Equation (2') ardeciyation (3) together imply equation (2). If
goods markets are perfectly interate5, meaning not only that
there is little in the manner of transportation costs or
govennent—i1Dosai barriers to separate national markets, tnt
also that danestic ard foreign goods are perfect substitutes in
consumers' utility furctions, then pirchasirig pa1'er parity
holds. Purchasing paier parity (PPP) in turn inplies (2').
                                  14
Sit as  is by rai we1l—)an, goods markets are itt 'In fact
perfectly integrated. Because of the possibility of expected
real   depreciation, real. interest parity can fail even if
criterion (3)      holds   perfectly. The reniain1er of   this section

considers   the question whether ex ante relative PPP, equation
(2'), holds.

       The ezrnns real awreciation of the dollar in the early
198 Os aid subseqient real depreciation have by na cawinced

exanple,    ocrpited for the floatirq rate period July 1973-
Decwber 1976 staniard deviations of the (logarithmic) real
exchange rate equal to 6.0 per cent for the paird/dollar rate
aM 8.4 per cent for the mark/dollar rate. He also ccrpited
serial correlation coefficients for PPP deviations of • 897 aid
.854, respectively, on a inthly basis, equal to .271 aM .150
on an annual basis. The serial correlation coefficient is of
interest because it is equal to ons minis the speed of
adjusbent to PPP. It may be best itt to rely exclusively on
the stardard deviation of the real exchange rate as a sunxy

statistic for the degree of Integration of goods markets,
because it in part reflects the magnitude of retary
disturbances durirg the period.17

exchange rate between the United States aid Great Britain.

Diring the floating rate period 1973—1987,   thaxh there is m
significant this trend, there is a large staniard error of 15 • 6
per cent. The serial correlation in the deviations frcn PPP is
estixnatel at .687,   with   a stardard error of .208.      (The

ecipation estimated is (ert+l - rt÷i) = R(ert - &t), where er
is the real exchange rate,          is the long-nm eopilibritmi
level, alternatively estiiiiatel as the sample maan or a tima
trend, and AR is the autoregressive coefficient.] This users
that the estimated speed of adjusisnt to PPP is .313 per year,
aid that one can easily reject the hypothesis of instarutarsaus
adjusbnent.
     ftan the ashes of absolute PPP, a r&enix has risen. In
response to tiMings sudt as those reported here, sais authors
have swwq frau a•a extre, the prcposition that the teniercy
of the real exdiarge rate to return to a constant is ccrplete

rate follais a reMan walk is just as good as the hypothesis of
absolute PPP for iwplyirg ex ante relative PPP. tit there is
even less of an a priori case why PPP shcnld hold in rate-of-

is an autoregressive coefficient of 1.0, one cannot

legitimatelyuse the stardar t-test derived fran a regression

p.69), Adler       aid Lehman (1983),     Deity (1981), Misbkin     (1984,

pp.1351—53),      aid Piott aid Sweeney (1985).          Most   of these
studies     used nc'nthly data.         on the one hard, the greater

aburdance of data reduces the staidard error of the estimate

AR)/12]     ) is different frau 1.0, so that it may not be nfl
easier    to reject. Another problem is that at does not )anz
                                    17
that the nature of  the true autoregressive ooess is truly
first-order on a rthly (or caxtinua.is-time) basis. In any
case, the rthly data in the studies citel were generally not

powerful eragh to reject the rardcin wal]c.18
       A nore prcanisirq alternative is to choose a longer tb
sample to get a nore powerful estimate. Table 4 also reports
statistics for the entire postwar period 1945-1987. PFP held
better for the Bretton Woods years than it did after 1973, as
nisasurel either by the mean absolute deviation aid stardard

deviation of the real exchange rate, or by the ability to
reject the hypothesis of zero autocorrelaticn. &zt, despite
the longer ti sanpie, one is only at the borderlire of being
able     to   reject the rarxiozn walk.       The 95—percent ctnfidenoe
interval for AR runs frr 0.64 to 1.02 [or 0.52 to 0.96, when
aflowirq for a trerd in the long-run equilibrium], ard the t-
 ratio    of 1.85 [or 2.56, when allowing for the treid] falls

 short of the Dickey-FUler 95-percent significai level of

 2.93.

       The stardard error of an estimate of AR is             approxinately
 the square root of (l-AR2)/N.                So if    the   true speed of

 adjusthent     is   on the ozr of 30 per cent a year (AR = .7), we
 'wild raipire at least 49        years   of data (2.932(l_.72)/(l_.7)2 s

 48.6) to be able to       reject   the null hypothesis of AR =        1.   It

 is   not     very surprisln that 43       years   of data is   not   ern4i,

 nath    less   the 15 years of   data used   in nost studies)9

         The last coBr of Table 4         presents   an entire 119    years of
                                     18
U.S. -U.K. data. With this lcn a ti saup].e, the stardard
error' is red'r&t considerably. The rejection of m serial
correlation in the real ecbame rate is even strorger than in
the shorter tine sazp].es. 1e inportantly, an is finally
able to detect a statistically significant terderry for the
real extharx?a rate to regress to PPP, at a rate of 16 per cent
a year. The rfidsnoe interval for R rw's fran 0.75 to 0.94,
safely less than wiity, aM the t-zutio of 3.12 e,ceeds the
Dickey-Fuller significance level of 2.8g. 20 The U.s.,'u.x.
real exsthane rate is plotted in Figure 3, for all 118 years.
    The last iw of the table reports regressions of the real
exoharge rate against the mama! extharge rate. The
coefficient is highly significant for all tine sauples. The
figures aqgest that tharqes in the ncnlnal rate (due, for
example, to devaluations urder fixed extharqe rates or retary
disturbances urder flcatirg eatarge rates) in the preserte of
sticky goods prices cause transitory thargee in the real
excharge rate.   Such results specifically rule cut the
possibility, which has been occasionally aqgested in the past,
that apparent deviations fran PPP might be attrlhited to
(rardcin) neasurennnt errors in the price data.21
     The ,tivation for lookirg at PPP in this section has been
to obtain insight into the expected rate of real depreciation,
because that is the variable that can give rise to real
interest differentials even in the presence of uzwvered
interest parity. In rejectirq the rardan walk desa'ipti*t of
                               19
the real. excbange rate, one has rejected the claim that the
raticriafly tçected rate of real depreciaticr is zero.22
take an ele, in .1983—84, whet the dollar had awreciated
sa 30 percent above its PPP value, survey data shai expected
f.xbare real depreciation of 4.3 percent per year. It is thus
wt difficult to lain the existence of the U.S. real
interest differential, even withait açealirq to any sort of
risk priint. There is little ecuse for authors such as
Itraczyk (1985, p.350) aid rarby (1986, p.420) rulirg out the
possibility of expected real depreciation a priori aid thereby
concludirq that real interest differentials id.1y
constitite risk preniins.

     If the failure of ex ante relative pirthasixq pr parity
nld, in itself, explain the failure of real interest parity,
then it oculd also, by itself, explain the failure of savirq
aid Investhient to be urcorrelatsi.      In the rert U.S.
context, a fall in national savirg caild cause an iiease in
the real interest differential aid therefore a fall in
investuent, even if . financial markets are perfectly integrated
aid even if the fail in savim is truly eogernas, provided the
real interest differential is associated with expected real
depreciation of the dollar.

4 A Decaicoeition of al Interest Di! fe&entjals for 25
Oanitries


     Because there are so many ocxupetirg definitiais of the
                              21
degree of international capital ncbility, it would be worth
?aciowin if the sort of countries that register high by ons
criterion are also the sort that register high by the others.
In this section we look at rates of return in the l9SOs across
a sample of 25 countries. We begin with the broadest iteasure
of barriers to international capital ntbility, the differential
in real interest rates, defined as:
(4)                 r—r*= (i-'expinfl) — (i*—expinfl*).
     Subsequently we will decoiqpose the real interest
differential into a cononent due to "political" or country
factors arid a caçonent due to currency factors:
(5)      r_r*=(i_i*_fd)+(fd_expinfl+expiflfl*),
when i is the domestic nominal interest rate, i* is the
foreign nominal interest rate,    and   fd is the forward discount
on the datestic currency. The first tenu (i - i* - fd) is the
covered interest differential. We call it the political or
cxtntry premium because it captures all barriers to integration
of financial markets across national bctniaries: transactions
costs, information costs, capital controls, tax laws that
discriminate by country of residence, default risk, and risk of
future capital controls. The second term could be described as
the real forward discount.    We call it the currency premium
because it captures differences in assets according to the
currency In which they are denominated, rather Uan In terms of
the political jurisdiction In which they are issued. As we
will see, the currency premium can in turn be deccriposed Into
                                 22
ttt factors, the extharqe risk premium ard ected real
depreciation.
     The deccuzpositicn of the real interest differential ild
not be possible withait the use of data at forward exthange
rates. Marty previous st4ies have usat forward rate data to
test covere interest parity, bit ai].y for a far countries.
The present stdy uses forward rate data for panel of 25

4 •1   Real. interest differentials

        Thble 5 reports statistics at tbree-un'tth real interest
differentials for the 25 countries, in each case expressed as
the local, interest rate reasurM relative to the Euzol1ar
interest rate. Pbr local interest rates we use the irrtetharik
market rate or, where no market rate exists, the ucst flexibly—
deterinirt interest rate available.25 We use, to begin with,
the realized inflatiat rates during the ex post three-ircmth
period.               OD11.nnn (1) reports the nean real interest
differential during the sample period, September 1,982 to
January 1988. (In this aid subsequent tables, because the ex
post data rm three naths behlsd the ex ante expectations,
                                  23
they         to. April 1988.)The nu±ers are naative for a
majority of rutries, averagirq —1.74 aoss all 25, tint
reflects the high level of real dollar interest rates durlzg
this period.
     The caintries are classified into five grace thosen at a
priori grc*nls. fl graip with real interest rates the
farthest belw the world rats is Babrain, Grsec*, Msxicx,
Portbgal aid Satth Africa. fle five (very diverse) azitries
bear the bnden of represettirq a wide class of LDC in air
sauple. Altogether there are eight cxxzrztrise classified as
IflS that hawen to have forward rate data available, aid
thereby appear in air sle; three of tIe are Bast Asian
cairxtries that are thoufl'it to have open financial markets in
the 198 Os (Horn Icorq, Sinjapore aid Malaysia) aid so are here
classified separately.
       C'm might cbj ect that the large neative real interest
differentials In the gra of five reflect aôninistered lnl
interest rates that are kt artificially 1w by "financial
repressiat" Bit ortries canixit naintain artificially 1w
interest rates witinit harriers to capital outf 1w. 'fls
statistia reflect a 1w degree of capital urtility precisely
as we iant thea to. In this respect air graip of five is
typical of ID(. A mrber of studies, frcltdirg iufli larger
Inc samples than available here, have shc*in the extremes to
which real interest rates can go, partiamlarly s very
negativ levels In the l970s.
                                24
    As with the atSr sures of Interest rate differentials
that we will be cxrisidering belw, the nean is itt aliays the
st useful statistic. A Riflhl mean aver a partiaa].ar saqls
periodmey hide flt.cbatia in both directions. Even if a
mean is statistically significant,26 it is useful to Janr in
addition the variability of the differential. The stardard
deviation is reporta in lini (2). We also report the root
mean sgiared error in coltmn (3).   (This taild be a superior
measure of how closely the rates are Ue together if, for
exanpie, we are nriat abcxzt the possibility of a large
differential that is fairly caristant aver time because of
govennt administration of Interest rates.] Finally we
report in oo].unn (4) 1n big a bard lrnild be rn1nd to
ercazçass 95 percent of the deviations fran real interest
parity.
     Cantry-graip ozçarisons of the measures of real interest
differential variability in sn respects aät a iriori
expectations: the five closal IDCs ocristitite the graip with
the highest variability, aM the five open Atlantic ca2ntries
the graip with the Latest.27 Sit there are sate results that
are amalas if the real Interest differential is taken as a
neasare of finaxr.ial market integration. Frai, for exanp].e,
had stringent capital oorxtro].s in place durln air sample
period (at least until the latter part] aM yet aars to have
a higher degree of capital ñdiity by the criteriai of real
interest differential variability than Japan, whith arnuirced
                              25
liberalization of its capital controls before air sample period
(1979-80).    Ce might concaivably argue that the Japanese
libe.ralization nist not have been genuine. Bit the Frendi. real
interest differentiaJ. is smaller art less variable even than
those of the Netherlards art Switzerlard, major cx*intries that
are ]acw.'n to be virtually free of capital controls.      Only
Canada shows a smaller art less variable real interest
differential than Fraire.
    Because the realized lMlaticn rates caild not have been
precisely krnin a priori, Table 5a projects than on three
contaxporaneais variables:    the forward disx*mt, rntiinal
interest differential, art lagged inflation differential. In a
majority of cases, a statistically significant airmt of the
variation in the real interest, differential is forecastable.28
The staniaxd deviation of the projected differential gives us
air finaJ. asure of variability. The results for the ex ante
real interest differential are itly sizilar to those for the
ex post. France, for example, still shows a lower degree of
variability than the Netherlards.


4.2 Cvere&jrrterest differentials: The ctuntrv nrsmitn


     We      use   Us Barclay's forward rate data to decerpose
the real interest differential into one part due to caintry
factors art another due to airrency factors, as in equation
(5). The first canponent, the covered interest differential,
                               26
emasses all factas related to the political jurisdictiat
in which the asset is issued. Its size ard variability
measure barriers to interrationa]. capital ncility ncst
narrowly ard prcçerly defined. Plots of the covered interest
differentials for each of the 25 countries in the 1980s are
shown in Figure   4.
       Column (1) of Table 6 reports   the   mean of the covered
interest differential for each of our 25 countries. A gocd
rule of thumb, when the absolute magnibde of the mean or the
variability of the differential irdicates the existence of
significant barriers, is as follows: a negative differential
via-a-via the Eurcairrerry   market irdicates that, to the extent

thatbarriers exist, they are capital controls or transactions
costs aintntly operatirg to discourage capital fran flowirq
out of the country.   Investors wwld not settle for a lower
return donastically if they were free to earn abroad the higher
return covered to eliminate excthane risk. This is the case
for all    the   LDCs in the sample, with the eception of Hag
Kong, ard for all of the traditionally "closed" Eircpean
cnnitries, with the ecepticms of Austria ard Belgium (which
should by r prthably be classified with the "cpen"
countries).      The negative differential that existed for the
united Kir*gdan before Margaret Thatcher rwved capital
controls in 1979 is zn' extrenely small.      Slatlarly, Canada's
differential is effectively zero (as shown, e.g., by Boothe, et
al,    1985, p.112].

      Ooltr (4), the size of the bard wide eru4 to ercaçass
95 per cent of deviations fran international coveral interest
parity, can be cxiparal with the approach of Fren]ceJ. aid Levith
(1977).           tested a larger bard ant to represent
               They

transactions costs between pourd ard dollar scities. They
fourd, for the case of the United                      that a smaller
percentage of deviations (87.6 - 89.7 percent, p.1217) fell
within the bard.   This confinis that capital nthiity has
increased   since the 19705.

       Germany ard several other neigltorlrg European countries
[Switzerlard, the Netherlands, Austria, ard lgiwn] show
higher interest rates locally than offshore, which su]gests
saie barriers disocxingfrq capital inflow: investors would rct
settle for a lower mark return in the Euranar]cet if they were
 free to get the higher return in Germany. ait the magnite is
 quite all, as it has been observed to be ever since Genany
 rezcn& itcst     of its controls on capital inflow In 1974        (Dooley
 aid Isard,    1980; aM Giavazzi aid Pagano, 1985,      p.27).
       Japan   has a covérs5. differential that by all neasures is

 snalle-r aM less variable than those of               Switzerlard aM
 Germany, let ala Frame aid izcst of            the    other cx,untries.

 This night           as a surprise to those accstc to thinkirq

 of   Japanese   financial markets in    tena of the   large barriers to

 capital inflow that were in             place in the     1970s.       The

 liberalization of     Japanese   markets, which has been doanented

 elsewhere, continued during our sample period.29                Australia

aM New Zealard, while lagfrq well behird Japan, shcw signs of
liberalization durixg the carse of air saEple period.30
    The covered interest differential for France is nnflt
larger aid tinre variable than that for the other major
irdustrializal countries knan to be free of capital controls.
This is the reverse of the finlin fran the criterion of real
interest differentials in Table 5. It supports the value of
the criterion of covered interest differentials as the prcper
test of financial market interatic.ti. The differential, with
its neqative sign signifying rtrols on French capital
aitflQs, has been previously studied, especially its terilercy
to shoot up shortly before devaluations of the franc.31
data indicate that the last major ocairrerce of this çberaint
was February 1986; since then the differential has been close
to zero.
     similarly, the sane phenomenon for Italy, which has also
been previously studied (e.g., Giavazzi aid Pagano, 1985),
appears to have enial after the February 1986 realigreent.
France aid Italy have apparently been dismantlirq their capital
contxols qpickly ein4i to neet a 1990 aaaill Ire for
liberalization recently set by the EEC Twelve.32       Of four
cairrtries that are expected to require a later dad1 iris, Spain
aid Porttqal have by our measures already been liberalizing
 [plots sln'z that the magnitude of the covered interest
differential fell shaiply in 1987 for these two countries], bit
Greece and IreJ.aM have not. Sweden is one ic-EEC European
                               29
cazttry that appears to have rial tauaid liberalization
durfrg air sarple period, while Norway does not. AU of these
European aazntries show up with reative maan differentials,
whith inplies that the rainixq controls act to discourage
capital aitflow rather than inflow. For the C cxxintries,
this firxlirg supports records of the European Canmission, which
report ncre fran for short—term inflows than short-term
outflows.
     Registerirq inipressively open finarcial markets are air
three East Asian IDCs [tdi, especially in the case of
Singapore, have rapidly cntgram the appellation "less
develqped"].   Hong Ilorq ard Singapore show analler cweral
differentials even than some open European countries like
Germany. Malaysia's differential has been considerably higher,
particularly in 1986, but still catpares favorably with sate
European countries.
     Not surprisingly, our reniainirg LDCS [Mexico, Gr,
Portugal, Bahrain arc! Saith Africa] show by far the largest arc!
itst variable covered interest differentials.34    Again, the
results are precisely what one n1ld expect if covered interest
differentials are the proper criterion for capital rbility,
hit the reverse of what the saving-investment criterion shows.

     Why does the covered differential criterion give such
different answers fran the savirg-thvesbnent criterion, which
shows a high degree of saving-retention ancrq irdustrialized
                               30
crintries?      Feldstein aM Horioka (1980, p.315) argus            that

financial markets        are less well integrated     at   longer-term
maturities, as ccnrtparal to the three-ixinth maturities used in
tests of covered interest parity such as those reported above:


    It is clear frau the yields at short-ten s&tirities in
    the Euroairrency market aid the forward prices of those
    curreities that liquid financial capital rves very
    rapidly to arbitrage such short-term
    differentials. . . .There are haQever reasons to be
    sceptical about the extent of such long-ten arbitrage.


     Studies of international Interest parity have been
restricted by a lack of forward exctharqe rates at horizons
going exit nuch further than one year.35 kit even without the
use of forward rate data, there are ways of getting araird the
problem of exchange risk. tata on cirrercy swap rates can be
used in place of forward exchange rates to test the long—term
version of Interest rate parity. Pcwer (1987) firds that the
swap-covered return differential on 5-year U.S. goverruient
bords versus Japanese bctds averaged only 1.7 basis points frau
October   3,   1985 to   JU].y 10, 1986, aid that the differential on
7-year   bords averaged only 5.3      basis   points. The maans mask

sane variation in the differential. Bit a bard of             46 basis
points is      large     enoisgh to encaupass 95   per   cent of     the
observations for the 5—year bonds. The bard is 34          basis   points
                                    31
for the 7—year bons. The neans an 5-year horde for sai other
major countries are as foUzs: Canada 15.9, Switzerland 18.7,
united Kirqdcn 51.1, aM Germany 28.4.
    The magnit4s of these laq-term differentials cntçare
favorably with the magnitude of the short-ten differentials.
The implication is that Feldstein and Horioka are wrrg in
their conjture that there is a ten-stricture weeqe
separatir national capital nkats.36 me nrist relevant
distirction appears to be, not lorg-term vs. short-term, hit
rather real vs. rntlnal.

4.3 "Peal forward discounts:" The anremv vraniuxn


     Even for those countries that ethibit no substantial
country premium, as reflect& in covered interest parity [fd-
(i - i*) = 0], there nay still be a substantial ourrercy
prEniuzn that drives real interest differentials [(i - exp inf 1)
- (i* - exp irtfl*)] away fran zero. If real interest
differentials axe not arbitraged to zero, then there is in turn
no reason to eçect savirq—investnent correlations to be zero.
     Table 7 reports the statistics for the airrercy prsthn,
as measured by the "real forward discount:"
         fd -   (exp   infl - exp infl*).
Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Austria and Japan, for
example, all have substantial real forward discounts (or—
ucre precisely — real forward premia), which constitute
                                 32
approximately the entirety of their real interest
differentials. These are ns*ries with currencies that have
exrietd a 1t of exchange rate variability, both 'uninal
az real, vis-a-vis the dollar slice 1973, alt especially since
1980.   As a consequence, sate canbination of exchange risk
premiuns ard expectal real depreciation — factors pertainir4
to the currency, not to the political jurisdiction — produces
the gap in real interest rates.    For these five financially
open iniustrializ&1. octmtries, ard for Borg Thn as well, the
currency factors produce a negative real interest
differential, while the covered interest differential (tha.4i
small) is pceitive: the ttal1 regulations or frictias that
renain in these caintries are, if anything, working to resist
capital inflow (at least at the short eM of the maturity
spectnmt), not aitflaz as one waild mistakenly carlude fran
the real interest differential criterion. The other countries
all have highly variable currency premiums as well • IMeed the
real_al forward discount (currency preniint) is iitre variable than
the covered interest differential (cc*mtxy premium) for all bit
three of air 25 cazitries (Greece, Mexico, aM Frame). The
last rows of Tables 6 aM 7 show that the average variability
across all caintries is higher for the currency premium than
for the octintry premium.
    Table 7a projects the real forward discount on the s
three variables as in Table Ba to get an ex ante measure. Its
stardarfi deviation iz shows six ca.intries for what the
                                33
crrezxy preini'tnt is less variable than the ccxwrtry pre3ni
(Greece, Mexico, Portual, Ftarca, Italy aid Spain). 3± the

4.4 Further decarositiOn into excbarcte risk preniin aid
e3cDectaI real deeciati

     our deccattpositiat so far has 1inip two tens, the
excharie risk premium aid expect& real depreciation, together
 into the currerty premium:
     fd -   exp   Intl. + exp infl* = (fd   -   exp   depr) + (e)q) depr-
 exp intl + exp infl*).
 In this section we attempt to ccxplete the decanpositict k&
 separatirg these two tens. TO do so requires a sure or
 ncdel of expected depreciation. The us'iial aporoach is to use
 the a post charges In the spot rate (depr) as a measure of ex
 ante expectations (eq depr), aid to argue that urder rational
 expectations the eçectational error (e depr - exp depr)
 shaild be rardan (urorrelated with intonation currently
 available at tl t).
     Column (1) of Table 8 reports the iiean value of (fd-
 depr) for each of am countries. )tst of the means are
 positive, showini that the weak-dollar period (1985-88)
 dominates over the strorg-dollar period (1982—1985). [The five
 exceptions, currercies that depreciat against the dollar at a
                                   34
rate ncre rapid than predict by the forward discount, v.re
the Hag Hag dollar, DJ.aysian rirwit, sirgapore dollar,
Saudi Arabian riyal, ard Saith African r&d.] Sit only three
currencies have n risk preniims, of either sign, that are
statisticafly significant [the Saixii Arabian riya.1., ard two
that awreciated strorqly against the dollar, relative to the
forward rate: the Japarse yen ard the Portuguese esct.do].
Furtherre, in a majority of cases [16/25], the sign of the
nean return differential is the rcsite of the sign of the
tan real interest differential during the sass period (Table
5, column 1).   So this uasure of the exchange risk premium
does not explain any positive part of the real interest
differential.
     The neasures of variability of (fd - depr) show up very
large in altmins (2), (3) aid (4). These are neasures of the
variability of ex post return differentials, not ex ante. They
tell us little abazt the variability of the exoharge risk
premium. Sit the high variability of the exztharge rate does
tell us two things. First, it provides an thvious explanation
— low power — why the first nntnts might not be

statistically significant. On the other hard, the existerce of
substantial wcertainty regardirg the futhre spot rate
suggests, via the theory of optimal portfolio diversification,
that a non-zero exchange risk premium nist exist, to reward
risk-averse investors for holding currencies that are perceivs
as risky or that are In oversupply.
                             35
    To estimate the ex ante excbarge risk preniwn, in Table   Ba


we project (fd - depr) onto air s three variables: the
forward discount, interest differentia]. axt inflation
di.fferent.ia1.. The rsressiai is statisticafly siüficant for
a majority of currencies, as many others have fccrd.37        The

stan3ard deviation shais the ntst variable eietharge risk
prEd.uns belorg to Mexico aid New Zealard, bit the United
Kflan,   Netherlards, Austria, Germany aid Switzerlard follow
close behird.

     In Table 9 we report the statistics for the other
ccrçonent of the currency premium, expected real depreciation.
 As natal earlier, given the widely-accepted failure of
 purthasirq power parity on levels, there is na theoretical
 reason to expect it necessarily to bold in tens of expected
 rates of thaxwe, the hypothesis scuietlsiss )an&n as ex ante
 relative purdhasirg power parity. Table 9 reports the
 statistics for ex post real depreciation. The neans in colnt
 (1) are negative, irdicatirq real açreciaticn of the currency
 against the dollar, for all European countries aid for ncst
 others as well. The only five eceptions, countries that
 experieit real depreciation against the dollar, were our
 three East Asian developing countries, Australia, aid Babrain.
 This last was the only one, of either sign, that was
  statistically significant.
       We already kxi, frau the results reported above for the
                               36
119 years of U.S.-U.K. data, that we canrct expect to reject a
ante relative PPP on just a fe', years of data:             ri
disturbances to the real exchange rate are so large, that ae
needs a nuich laqer tine saiiple to f lid evidezte of systanatic
nwenent. Sat the signs of the n real depreciations are
usually the sane as the signs of the nean real interest
differentials in Table 5 (20/25], suggestiN a high correlation
of the real interest differential aM expected real.
depreciation across countries. (Coliums (2)—(4) shcw very high
variability in real depreciation, but again this tells us
little about the variation of a ante expected depreciation,
beyord the &servation that the high level of variability
iiçl lee laz per in ar tests of a ante relative purcthasirq
pcMer parity.]

     To estimate a ante expected real depreciation, in Table
9a we project a post real depreciation, again, on the sane
three conten!poraneals variables. The staMard deviations for
the varicis currencies are qpite similar to those reported in
Table Sa for the projected exchange risk prnium. (It seaM
that in both cases an aarently predictable canponent of the
 spot rate charqes constitutes niost of the variation (as opposel
 to variation in the forward disccAint or inflation differential,
 respectively):   the significant coefficients on the forward
 disccunt,   interest differential aM a post inflation
 differential in Table 9a are always of opposite sign aM
                                37
sinilar maqnite as those in Table 8a]. In st cases [18/253
the projectel echange risk premittu is slicitly re variable
than projected real depreciation.




5. Conclusion


     We can ann up with four conclusions.
(1) Capital controls ard other barriers to the ncveisnt of
capita]. across national borders remained for such countries as
the United ICinjdnn aM Japan as recently as 1979, aM flai
aM Italy as recently as 1986. &± a contiraiing worldwide
trerd of intsration of financial itarkets in the 1980s had all
but eliminated interest differentials for major irdustrialized
coi.ntrjes by 1988.
(2) Only the country preuii.nn has been eliminated; this neaz
that only covered interest differentials are snail.
Real aid nominal exthane rate variability remain, aid irdeed
were larger in the 1980s than in the 197Os, The result is
that a crresv prenitin remains, consjstir of an exchange risk
premitnn plus expected real currency depreciation. This nEans
that, even with the alization of covered interest rates,
large differentials in     interest rates remain.
(3) The United States in the l980s began to borni on such a
                             38
massive sate internationally that the traditional "Feldstein-
Horioka" firxiin of a near-unit correlation between national
savirq aId invesbnent has broken dn. The process of
liberalization in Japan aid other major caintries was prcbably
one factor behird this massive flai of capital to the United
States.
(4) In    addition to the gape that distinguish covered interest
parity fran real interest parity, there is a further gap that
separates real interest parity fran the proposition that
changes in national saving do not crowd at Investment because
they are raa&13 y financed by borrowini fran abroad. Bads are
not perfect substitutes for &juities, aid euities are not
perfect substitutes for plant aid eguiprt. Thus at eadi
stage, there are good reasons to think that shortfalls in
national saving continue to be capable of cras'dln ait
investment, even if to a smaller extent than before 1980.

1. spite    the increased attention to Inward foreign direct
investiient in the United States in recent years, it continues
to be a atafler ccvponent of the capital infla than portfolio
investrsnt. As of the eM of 1987, foreign direct investment
acortal for only 17  per cent of the total stock of foreign-
held assets in the United States.

2. There were relatively large differentials separatln U.S.
interest rates fran the Eurodollar rates; at the long-term eM
of the spectra, well-]cnin U.S. corporations could borrw re
cheaply in the Euranarket than danesticafly.               These
differentials fell steadily taiiard zero between 1982 aid 1986,
probably as the outccs of innovation that ocairred in the
Eurrziar]cets — partly in response to these differentials—
making it easier for U.S. corporations to borrcw there. Much
of this innovation went urder the nane of seairitization. See
Frankel (1988) for documentation aid further references. [It
appears that the seoaritization treid suf feral a set-back in
1987 aid 1988, in part associated with the October 1987 stock—
market crash; it is in.' said to be slightly costly for
U.S. corporations to issue boSs in the Euranarket than
dcriestically. It remains to be seen whether this reversal of
the trerd toward perfect integration is serious or lasting. J
3. AM even if   this relationship doesn't break down in the
future ujijer pressure fran fears of international creditors
that U.S. Iniebtedness is beccrxnin excessive.

4.   There is a fifth possible — yet ncre narrowly defined—
criterion for the degree of integration of financial markets:
the size of transactions costs as neasured directly by the bid-
ask-spread in, for example, the foreign exchange market.
surprisingly, the covered interest differential does riot appear
to be statistically related to the bid-asic azt (!t&thr 1988).
5. Obstfeld (1986) aid Stmiiers (1988) argue that the saving-
 invesmtent correlation may be due to the camn influence of
grcvth rates.
 6. Obstfeld (1986) makes the large-cc*.intry point in a tine-
 series context, where it prer1y belongs. alt even in a tine-
series regression for a single country si.th as tie Tihitel States,
one can correct for the 1arge-mtry problen by expressing
savin aid investient rates as deviations fran the rest-of-c'Rrld
rates of savin art investment, respectively. USer the null
hypothesis, an excqenais fall in the U.S. saving rate may drive
up the world real interest rate art ac*d out investment, hit
there is no evident reason for the crcsdixq-axt to be reflected
                              50
in U.S. investment to any greater extent than in rest-cf-the-
world investhent. In Franks]. (1986, 44—45), i rand that the
close corresçcrdenoe between 13.5. saving aid lnvestnent for
1970—1985 remains, even with this adjustment.
7•   thstfeld (1986a) finds that the coefficient fell after 1973,
in time     series correlations for ucet of his caintries, bit
ctstfeld (198Gb) finds   that it has risen over time (1967-84 vs.
1956-66),     with the United states slnñng the highest
correlation of any.
8. In a U.S. time      series context, Frankel (1986)   used two
instrwnental variables: the fraction of the pcpilation over 65
years of age aid the ratio of military experditure to IP. The
former is considered a determinant of private saving ard the
latter of p.iblic      saving, aid both have se claim to
exogeneity.    In the context ofcross-sections of developing anl
irdustrializ&I ca]ntries, Dooley, Frankel aid Mathieson (1987)
usel the dependency ratio aid, again, the military expenditure
variable.
9 .Other studies that reject real interest parity for major
irdustrializel countries incline Mish1kin (l984a, 198th), Oaity
aid Ctstfeld (1984), Mark (1985), aid Cumby aid Mishkin (1986).
Glick (1987) examines real interest differentials for six
Pacific Basin countries vis—a-vis the United States.
10. The 10-year real Interest differential via-a-vie a weighted
average of 0—5 countries was abaxt 3 par cent in 1984, whether
expected inflation is measured by a distrihited lag, by 050
forecasts, or by IIU forecasts • In 1980, by rtrast, the
differential was about —2 per cent. Frankel (1986, pp. 35—36).
11. Gross investhient was 16.0 per cent of G1P in 1980, whith
was itself considered a low ntnter (dam 0 •5 % fran 1971—80].
12. The instnmental variables used are the dependency ratio
(the s.nu of those older than 64 aid those yauqer than 21,
divided by the workln-age population in between), tth is a
determinant of private saving, and military experditure as a
share of 2P, whith is a determinant of the federal bs3get
deficit. A data appendix is available, for details on t1 aid
the other variables.
13. There are two other potential sources of differences fran
the results in Frankel (l986) the Camrroe Department released
revised national ants data for the entire period in 1986,
aid we i use the dependency ratio as the deixqraçhic
inStrumental variable in place of the ratio the cver-65 to the
cve.r—20 pcpflation.   Sit the years 1985—87 are indeed the
source of the fall in the coefficient; when these three years
      ftt the coefficient is over 1 (as when the 1980's are
                                   51
anitted in Table 3].
14. If the 1956—1987 sample is split at 1974, when the United
States •:ait Germany rencved capital controls, rather than at
1979, there is still a precipitous decline in the cyclically-
adjustel savirg—invesnt coefficient aver tima: fran .87
(statistically, no differerce fran 1) to .31 (borderlire
differerce fran  0). [Table 3a.] (If the 1930—1987 sample is
split at 1958, when many Eurcpean countries restored aurrercy
convertibility, there is a stall inrease in the coefficient
over tfite: frau .83 (statistically different fran 1) to 1.14
(no differen fran 1). [Table 2a.] Bit this is no doubt
because the saving aid investment rates are not cyclically
adjusted for this period, (the  series is not available back
to 1930). Ctly when expressed on a cyclically-adjusted basis
is the U.S. national savirg rate of 1985-1987 cbvastatiiqly laz.]
15. Feldstein aid Bacohetta (1989) find a sflnilar drop in the
saving—investhent coefficient in the l980s, for a cross-section
of industrialized cxxintries (tha4 they do not use
instnmerrta]. variables, aid are thus liable to the eccnanet.ric
criticisns that others have raised concerning the endogeneity
of national saving).
16. Measuring barriers to integration by differences in rates
of return has the problem that a given degree of integration
can appear snaller or larger depexxlixq on the disturbances to
saving (or to other variables) airing the sample period in
question. For example, the greater degree of variability in
the U.S. real interest differential in the 19805, as canpared
to the 19705 or 1960s, could be attrtited to the greater
swings in variables such as the structural budget deficit,
rather than to a later degree of capital nrbility. [In any
case, the degree of variability in cctered interest
differentials is very low in the 1980s, as we will see belai.]
All we can say for sure is that if the barriers to integration
are essentially zerO (the degree of capital ixthiity is
essentially perfect), then differentials in rates of return
should be essentially zero.
17. For example, Knqnan fani that the staniard deviation for
the real mark/dollar exchange rate during the German
hyperinf].ation, February 192 0—December 1923, was mudi larger
(20.8 percent) than during the l970s, even tha4i the serial
correlation was hi'ier (.765).
18. Osnby aid Ctstfeld (1984, p. 146) used a Q-statistic to test
for higher order serial correlation in ztonthly real ediarge rate
changes aid found none. However they also faith that
expected inflation differentials were unrelated to expected
exchange rate changes, rejecting the random walk
characterization of the real exchange rate. Euizin (1986) was
also able to reject the rardcin walk in saie cases.

19. As already ittal, an AR coefficient of • 7   at a yearly basis
correspads   to an AR of     .97 on a rthly basis (.97 — .70).
Thus it nild take 564 naiths of data (2.932(1_.972)/(1_.97)2
563.7) to be able to reject the null hypothesis of AR — 1. This
is 47 years, very little gain in efficlscy a t test at yearly
data. Suners (1987) demonstrates the las paser of ranlan
walk tests.
20. As the sa3lple period covers a number of changes in
exctiange rate reglss, it wcnld be desirable to alias for shifts
in the coefficient (aid in the variarce of the disturbarce
term). Sit many of the proponents of a rardan walk in the real
exchange rate claim it as eviderce in favor of an "equilibrium"
hypothesis, wder which fluctuations in the real eathange rats
are causal only by real, as cçpceel to ntnetary, factors.
Urder this null hypothesis, changes in regiEs shaild not
matter for the real exchange rate. Thus aw statistical test
is a valid rejection of the null hypothis, even tbaxjh it
lumps tcqether all 118 years of cbservatiais.
21. sticky goods prices are only an of a n.nber of possible
sairces of dscriaticns fran ex ante relative PPP. Amther is
the exist.erce of the prices of nontradal goods in the relevant
price irdex. IX,rnbisch (1983) shas has ncvnt in the
relative price of rcin—traded goods affects the real interest
rate, savin, aid borrowing fran abroad, while Thigel art
lQetzer (1987) show specifically has such nc'venent can give
rise to   the Feldstein-Horioke finding.
22. The rationally expected rate of real depreciation estinted
fran a sific time series process is riot necessarily the s
as the actual expectation of real depreciation held by
investors.    Frankel (1986,    p. 58—59) used survey data at
expectations  of  exchange   rate   changes (collected by the
Ecatrist—affilliated Financial Bort) art forecasts of price
level changes (by ) to ocmpate a direct asure of expected
real   depreciation for the dollar against five   currencies. me
numbers sIned an expectation that the real exchange rate terds
to regress back tatiard PPP at a statistically significant rate
of 8 to 12 per cent a year.      [The expected speed of raninal
depreciation back tasazd PFP is estimated more sharply at 12-
16% a year in       Frankel art
                             Froot (1987).    For a thora4t
rejection of the vies that investors' expected exchange rate
charges are zero, see Etoct art Frankel (1989).)

 23. Sinulation models are also used by Qosh (1988), Gcnlder
 aid Eichergreen (1988), art Ctstfeld (1986a) to address the
 Feldstein-Horioka findings. Obstfeld stns, in a life-cycle
model of     saving   with actual OECD data on the furctional
 distributictt of     irne  aid on population growth, that the
                                  53
coefficient in an investhent reqression can be similar to tirise
estimated by Feldstein aid Horioka.   ftzt Feldstein aid
Baatetta (1989) argue that the growth rate is rct In fact
responsible for the thserved coefficient.
24. sa     of these data were also analyzed In Franksl &
MacArthur (1988).   Scze forward rate ctiservaticris for Italy,
Austria, aid Belgium In the Barclay's data looked suspicious.
In aattion, Barclay's es mt qte a rate for Portugal. For

35. Taylor (1988) is ore of the ncst recent of many stifles of
covered interest parity within the Iatt Enerket. Such
studies do rct get at      the degree of finarcial market
integration across natural banlaries. ten authors find
deviations fran covered Interest parity in auth data, it is
often due to low quality of the data, e.g., inexact timlzg.
With high-quality data, Taylor f lids that rered Interest
parity held extraly well in 1985, that it held less well in
the l970s, partiailarly during "thrbilent" periods, that the
differential bad ncstly vanished by 1979, aid that the
differentials that do exist are slightly larger at the lager-
term than shorter—term maturities.  a.it, like other sb.th.es,
Taylor has m data on maturities larger than as year.
36. It is still quite likely, however, that there is a wedge
in each country sspantirg the lag—term interest rate fran the
after-tax cost of capital facing fins. Such a 'wave could be
due either to the corporate inns tax systan or to Inperfect
substitutability between bards aid capital. Hatsopctilos,
Krugman aid Siniers (1988) argue that the cost of capital
facing U.S. corporation is higher than that facing Japanese
corporations, even then real interest rates are equal, because
U.S. cczupanies rely ncre heavily on equity financing, which is
uxnre expensive than debt finarcing.      See also papers in
Feldstein (1987).

                                        Data Sources




A. 1929 to 1987 Regressions

1. Savings and Investment
         Gross saving is from line ¶ of table 5.1 of the The National Income and
         Product Accounts of the United States. 1S29-1 982 (Njf) while gross
         private domestic investment is line 16 of the same table. For the years
         1983 to 1987 (preliminary), savings and investment are found in table 8-28
        of the 1988 edition of the Economic Report of the President Both series
        are divided by GNP, line 1 of table 1.1 in the NIPA and table B-i of the
         Economic Report of the President All three series are in nominal terms.

2. Instrument 1: The Dependency Ratio
         The dependency ratio is defined here as the sum of those older than 64 and
         younger than 21 divided by those in the range 21 to 64 years old. Between
          1929 and 1969. these data are taken from Series P29, A37, and A41 of
         Historical Statistics of the United States. Colonial Tinies to 1970 (herafter
         HSUS). For 1970 to 1987. the data are from various issues of the
         Statistical Abstract of the United States, in a table titled "Total Population,
         by Age and Sex."

3. Instrument 2: Defense Spending
          Defense spending is provided in Series V4FB, Y459, and Y460 of the HSUS
         for 1929-1970. Before 1954 defense spending is defined as the sum of
         spending by the Departments of the Army, Navy, and (after 1949) Air
          Force. After 1954 these departments are lumped as the Department of
         Defense. For 1971 to the estimated 1987 expenditures, the data come from
         the Statistical Abstract. In the regressions, defense spending is used as a
         percent of GNP, collected as above,

4. Cyclical Adjustments
         Savings and investment (as a percent of GNP) are cyclically adjusted by
         regressing each against the percent gap between actual GNP and trend GNP.
         The residuals from these regressions are the cyclically adjusted variables.
         Trend GNP is estimated for the period 1955 to 1980 by the Holloway in The
         Survey of Current Business, March, 1986, in "The Cyclically Adjusted
         Federal Budget and Federal Debt: Revised and Updated Estimates." 1981
         through 1987 data are from various issues of Iht$urvev of Current
         Business, in the "Reconciliation and Other Tables section.



B. 1869 to 1987 Regressions

1. All Variables, 1 929 to 1 987
          All the series for these more recent years is collected as described above in
         section A. The series are then averaged over ten year periods, beginning
         with 1929-1936. Since no data are available for 1988, the final observation
         is an average over nine years, 1979-1g87.

                                         57
        2. Savings and Investrnen'
                 Roger Ransom and Richard Sutch provide estimates of gross private saving
                 and productive capita! formation in table 4 of their paper t)omestlc Saving
                 as an Active Constraint on Capital formation In the American Economy,
                 1839-1928: A Provisional Theory? These data are given in terms of
                 percent of augmented GNP? Column 1. gross private domestic capital
                 formation, corresponds with the gross private domestic investment used for
                 later years. Column 5, gross private saving, is not directly comparable with
                 gross saving in the current National Income and Product Accounts because
                 consumer durables and public land sales are included. Thus, these two
                 items, In columns 2 and 3, are subtracted from gross private saving to yield
                 comparable gross saving as a percent of GNP.

         3. Gross National Product
                  Augmented GNP was not directly available in any of the tables I had from
                  Ransom and Sutch. However, many of the savings and investment
                  aggregates are given in dollar levels in table E-1 of Working Paper Number
                  2 of the same series. GNP is calculated here as gross private saving
                  (column 8 of table E-1) divided by gross private savings as a percent of
                  GNP (column 5 of table 4) and multiplying by 100. Since percentages are
                  given with 2 decimal points (xx.xx), errors introduced by this method should
                  be negligible.

         4. Instrument 1: Dependency Ratio
                   Between 1900 and 1928 the data are collected as detailed above in A.2.
                   Before 1900, the data are from Series A119-125 and A133 of the
                   There are two problems with these series. First, only the years 1870. 1880,
                   1890, and 1900 are available. For this work intervening years were
                   interpolated assuming a constant growth rate for population in each age
                   group. Age groups are 0-5, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, and over 65. 1869
                   numbers were constructed assuming the same growth rates implied by the
                   1870 and 1880 data. The second problem is that the group 20-24 does not
                   allow separation of those under and over 21, the dividing line between
                   dependency and working age in the dependency ratio. Here it is assumed
                   that 20 percent of the 20-24 age group is age 20.

          5. Instrument 2: Defense Spending
                    Defense spending is calculated as above in A.3. To produce defense
                    spending as a percent of GNP, the ten year average dollar value is divided
                    by the implied GNP from Ransom and Sutch.


          C. Comparison to 1985 Data

          1. Definition of National Savings and Investment
                    In the earlier study I erroneously included consumption of durable goods
                    and public land sales in national savings and investment. This is tine in
                    theory, but the 1929-87 data do not include either of these items. Thus,

        savings and investment as a percent of GNP were much higher during the
         early decades, as compared to the post depression levels. Using corrected
        data, it is still true that post-war levels of savings and investment are
        lower than pre-depression.

2. The Dependency Ratio
        The current definition of the demographic instrument for private saving is
        the dependency ratio (see A.2). In 1985 the ratio used was those over 65
        divided by those over 20. Since demographers are familiar with the new
        measure, and since it is more clearly consumers in the numerator and
        savers in the denominator (with life-cycle consumption theory), the new
        measure should be superior. In practice, the dependency ratio varies a
        good deal over the long sample, while the earlier measure is little more
        than a trend line.
