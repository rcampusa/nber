                                          ABSTRACT

We use issuance-level data to study how equity capital inflows that enter emerging market
economies affect equity issuance and corporate investment. We show that foreign inflows are
strongly correlated with country-level issuance. The relation reflects the behavior of large issuers
issuing in domestic equity markets and that of firms issuing in international markets. Those
larger, more liquid, and highly valued firms are the ones more likely to raise equity when their
country receives capital inflows. To identify supply-side shocks, we instrument capital inflows
into each country with exogenous changes in other countries’ attractiveness to foreign investors.
Shifts in the supply of foreign capital are important drivers of increased equity inflows.
Instrumented inflows lead a subset of firms (large domestic issuers and foreign issuers) to raise
new equity, which they use mainly to fund investment. Corporate investment increases between
one-tenth and four-tenths the amount of foreign equity capital entering the country.

I.      Introduction

Capital inflows are prevalent in emerging market countries. In 2014, foreign investors invested

more than one trillion U.S. dollars into emerging countries. Of those inflows, 90 billion U.S.

dollars came in the form of equity, i.e., foreign investors’ purchases of stocks of publicly traded

emerging market firms.

        In this paper, we study how those capital inflows affect the economies that receive

them by analyzing their connection to equity financing and corporate investment. In particular,

we investigate whether publicly traded firms in emerging countries issue more equity when

their country receives inflows of foreign capital. Ours is the first study, of which we are aware,

that examines the links between capital inflows and investment using issuance-level data. We

distinguish between issuances in international and domestic equity markets. We also examine

whether firms differ in the degree to which their issuance of new equity responds to increased

funding by foreign equity investors. Lastly, we analyze the extent to which firms that raise new

equity use the funds raised in the offerings to finance corporate investment. To implement

our analysis, we assemble a granular dataset containing information on equity issuances and

financial statements for 17,682 firms in 25 emerging market countries, in addition to capital

inflows during the 25-year period 1990-2014.

        Figure 1 presents the evolution of the aggregate amount of equity investing by foreign

investors into our sample countries alongside the value of equity raised by firms in those

countries, which provides a first pass at the aggregate evidence. The figure shows that periods

of large capital inflows coincide with periods of active equity issuance activity. This suggests

that inflows imply more than a simple transfer of equity ownership from domestic to foreign

investors, and that issuances are not financed solely by domestic investors. In terms of

causality, this correlation could reflect the role of foreign equity inflows (resulting, for example,

                                                 1
from greater global liquidity) that shift the supply of capital.1 A shift in the supply of foreign

participation implies a higher demand for equity, and lower required equity returns, which in

turn, encourages destination countries’ firms to issue shares. On the other hand, the positive

correlation between inflows and issuance could reflect shifts in the demand for capital by firms

(resulting, for example, from improvements in investment opportunities at the country or firm

level). According to that view, better firms’ prospects induce foreign investors to send more

funds to the country.

         In this paper, we use firm-level data together with a novel set of instrumental variables

to distinguish between supply-side and demand-side influences. Before proceeding to the

micro-level analysis, we first estimate the country-level relation between capital inflows and

equity issuance. We regress each country’s equity issuances on equity inflows, taking into

account country and year fixed effects. We find a strong association between the two. For

every million U.S. dollars foreign investors purchase of emerging market equity, the value of

issuance proceeds increases by at least 0.18 million U.S. dollars (our point estimate is 0.48

million dollars). The results are the same for issuances that take place in domestic and

international equity markets.

         We then move to the micro-level analysis to better understand the mechanisms that

drive these aggregate issuance patterns. We first regress firm-level issuance proceeds in both

domestic and international markets on equity capital inflows, controlling for firm and year

fixed effects. We find no significant correlation between capital inflows and the value of

issuance proceeds for the typical emerging market firm. When we focus on only domestic


1Chari et el. (2012) document significant effects of U.S. monetary policy surprises around FOMC meetings on
capital flows from the U.S. to a range of emerging markets as well as on the associated emerging market
valuations. They find that equity positions and valuations are more sensitive to monetary policy shocks than debt
positions and valuations.


                                                       2
issuances, again we find no influence of capital inflows on the typical firm’s issuance. When

we analyze issuances in international equity markets separately, we find a strong correlation

between inflows and foreign issuances.

        Because international equity issuances are, on average, 70% larger in value than

domestic issuances, the differential response of equity issuances in the international market

might reflect firm heterogeneity related to differences in issuance size. We thus explore that

possibility by dividing our sample of domestic-issuing firms into two groups: those that issue

a large amount of equity during our sample period and those issuing a small amount. We find

a strong association between capital inflows and domestic issuance proceeds for large domestic

issuers, indicating that only those firms respond to capital inflows. This result remains even

after controlling for country-year fixed effects, which allows us to control for all time-varying

country shocks. The large domestic and foreign issuers tend to be large firms, with liquid

stocks, and high market-to-book equity ratios.

        Next, we decompose the foreign and large domestic issuers’ response to capital inflows

into the extensive and intensive margins. We find that the response of issuances to capital

inflows primarily reflects the extensive margin. Large domestic and foreign issuers both

become more likely to issue positive amounts of equity upon the arrival of capital inflows, but

the size of issuance is not affected by equity capital inflows. Because those firms are more

likely to issue and capture a larger share of the total equity raised when more foreign capital

enters the country, the composition of issuers and issuance activity changes in response to

capital inflows. Issuance becomes more concentrated in larger firms.

        Although the increase in issuance activity could reflect an increase in foreign equity

supply by investors or greater domestic equity demand by firms, the fact that the response of

issuances to equity inflows is concentrated in some firms suggests a supply-side channel. If

                                               3
inflows were simply responding to improved economic conditions in the country, one might

expect all firms, not just large issuers, to issue more equity at times of large capital inflows (our

country-year fixed effects control for all shocks that affect all firms equally in a country). The

finding that inflows prompt issuances by firms that tend to be attractive to foreign equity

investors (e.g., large size and high turnover of shares) is therefore suggestive of a supply-side

influence that is difficult to dismiss. But demand-side shocks that are heterogeneous across

firms could also be present.

        To further investigate the source of the variation in our estimates, we identify supply

shocks with shifts in foreign investor interest unrelated to changes in domestic firms’

prospects. In particular, we instrument equity inflows using various measures of the

attractiveness of other countries’ equity markets to foreign investors, which we argue are

plausibly exogenous to demand-side shocks to the subject country. The idea is that for a given

amount of total capital inflows to emerging markets as a whole, positive shocks to other

countries’ attractiveness to foreign investors constitute negative shocks to the subject

country’s supply of funds.

        We provide three alternative instruments, which are strongly correlated with equity

capital inflows. As our first instrument, we use the lagged weight of a country in the MSCI

Emerging Markets stock index. The MSCI weight of a country is a function of the market

capitalization of that country’s stock market, relative to the global market capitalization of 25

emerging economies, in addition to sporadic decisions by MSCI on the index constitution.

When institutional investors receive funds from their underlying investors, they tend to invest

those funds into emerging economies’ equity markets according to the weights of those

economies in the MSCI index (Raddatz et al., 2017). The time variation of each country’s




                                                 4
MSCI weight should primarily reflect shocks to the market values of the other 24 countries’

stock markets.

           Because the MSCI weights are partially affected by domestic shocks that change a

country’s relative market value, we use as alternative instruments the sum of other countries’

total equity value and other countries’ volume of equity issuances. Those two instruments

depend exclusively on foreign shocks and are therefore plausibly exogenous to demand shocks

of the subject country. Still, to control for common shocks affecting all countries, we also

employ orthogonalized versions of those same instruments, where we orthogonalize the sum

of equity values (the sum of issuances) with respect to the market value (the issuances volume)

in the subject country. In all cases, we find that instrumented inflows lead large domestic

issuers and foreign issuers combined to raise significantly more equity.

           We complement the analysis of issuance activity by studying how large domestic

issuers and foreign issuers use the funds raised in their equity offerings. First, we estimate the

effect of capital inflows on a variety of potential uses of funds: capital expenditures (CAPEX),

corporate acquisitions, research and development expenses (R&D), inventory accumulation,

cash accumulation, and long-term debt reduction.2 We find that issuers that respond to capital

inflows tend to increase corporate investment (CAPEX, acquisitions, and R&D) significantly

when they raise equity capital. They also tend to accumulate cash and inventories, and reduce

their long-term debt. Second, we measure the increases in each use of funds over a variety of

time intervals, ranging from one year to four years. Our estimates indicate that the largest use

of funds is corporate investment, the sum of CAPEX, acquisitions, and R&D. For every

million U.S. dollar raised in an offering, large domestic issuers and foreign issuers combined




2   These are the six uses of funds analyzed by Kim and Weisbach (2008) and Erel et al. (2011).

                                                         5
spend on average at least 0.50 U.S. million dollars on investment four years after the issuance

(our point estimate is 0.90 million).

         Using a back-of-the-envelope calculation, our analysis indicates that every million U.S.

dollar of foreign equity capital is associated with an increase of at least 100,000 U.S. dollars of

corporate investment (one standard deviation below our point estimate of 400,000). That

lower bound (point) estimate is the result of 0.18 (0.48) million U.S. dollars of additional

issuance times 0.50 (0.90) million U.S. dollars of additional spending on investment. Capital

inflows appear to reduce the cost of equity finance, allowing emerging market firms to finance

new investments. In all, equity issuance seems to be an important channel through which

capital inflows affect real economic activity.

         Our paper is related to different strands of the literature. First, there is a literature on

how aggregate economic activity is affected by the liberalization of equity capital flows (Henry,

2000a; Henry, 2000b; Bekaert et al. 2005; Kose et al. 2010). These papers show that equity

inflows are associated with a boom in aggregate investment and higher economic growth of

the recipient countries. However, we know relatively little about the channels through which

equity inflows affect real economic activity.3 Our paper adds to this literature by studying for

the first time the effects of capital inflows using issuance-level data. We show that supply-side

changes in capital inflows allow some firms to raise new financing and expand investment,

which might be behind the patterns documented in this literature. Moreover, our paper shows

that the effects are not uniform across types of firms. Some firms issue new equity as capital

inflows reduce the cost of equity finance, but other firms do not.




3 Mitton (2006), Gupta and Yuan (2009), Levchenko et al. (2009), and Igan et al. (2016) use industry- and firm-
level data to study the effects of liberalizing equity markets on industry growth and firms’ operating performance.

                                                        6
         The literature has found it challenging to disentangle supply and demand influences

when gauging the effects of capital inflows on financial and real economic activity in a multi-

country setting. Examining the case of one country, using detailed firm-level data, Baskaya et

al. (2017a) and Baskaya et al. (2017b) isolate supply-side influences on capital inflows. In this

paper, we propose a novel set of instruments in a multi-country context to distinguish between

supply-side and demand-side effects on capital inflows, and we find that the supply side is

important.

         Our paper also contributes to another literature that asks why firms issue equity and

bonds geared toward foreign investors. Part of this literature has studied firms’ issuance

activity in international markets, characterizing which firms issue abroad and why. Foreign

markets can offer benefits compared to domestic ones in terms of access to better financing

conditions, greater visibility, and enhanced corporate governance, among others (Pagano et

al., 2002; Benos and Weisbach, 2004; Doidge, 2004; Karolyi, 2006; Schmukler and Vesperoni,

2006; Claessens and Schmukler, 2007; Forbes, 2007; Doidge et al., 2009).4

         Although this literature assumes that issuances abroad target foreign investors, it has

not shown that facilitating foreign investor participation actually influences issuances. 5 In

practice, it is hard to track the influence of foreign investors on firm behavior because there

are no data identifying the nationality of who buys each security. In fact, it is possible that

foreign issuances of equity might be purchased by domestic residents. Data are available,

however, on the change in net purchases by foreigners of each country’s publicly traded firms’

equity, which is our measure of equity capital inflows. Our approach to identification allows


4 Other papers argue that, as liquidity became more abundant in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of

2008-09, firms issued more foreign currency bonds to take advantage of carry-trade opportunities (Chui et al.,
2014; Powell, 2014; Caballero et al., 2016; Bruno and Shin, 2017).
5 Forbes (2007) studies the effects of the “encaje” controls on capital inflows in Chile from 1991 to 1998. She

finds evidence that imposing the encaje on equity inflows reduced aggregate equity issuances.

                                                      7
us to use those data to link foreign participation in equity markets with consequences for each

country’s equity issuances in domestic and foreign markets.

        A separate literature (Pagano et al., 1998; Kim and Weisbach, 2008; Brown et al., 2009;

Erel et al., 2011; Didier et al., 2015) analyzes how firms use new capital market financing from

various sources. We complement this strand of the literature by linking the use of funds with

inflows of foreign capital. In particular, we study how shifts in the supply of equity financing

affect the use of funds by the emerging market firms that tend to raise capital when their

country receives capital inflows. We also find that firms use the proceeds primarily to expand

investment, aside from any activity geared toward retiring debt and accumulating cash.

        The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses the data sources.

Sections III explains our empirical strategy. Section IV reports country- and firm-level results

linking capital inflows and issuance activity. Section V reports instrumented results for the

responses of issuances to supply-side factors. Section VI reports the use-of-funds analysis.

Section VII concludes.



II.     Data

We collect data on equity capital inflows using balance of payments information from the

International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF provides data on annual private gross capital

inflows and outflows by category: foreign direct investment, portfolio equity, portfolio debt,

bank credit, and others. We focus on portfolio equity inflows, defined as the difference

between foreign purchases of domestic shares and foreign sales of domestic shares. Equity

inflows are positive (negative) when foreign investors purchase more (less) domestic securities

than what they sell. Foreign retail investors and foreign institutional investors (such as mutual

funds, pension funds, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds) are often behind the foreign

                                               8
purchases and sales of domestic shares. Those investors purchase both existing and newly

issued shares.

         Our sample consists of the 25 emerging market countries included in the MSCI

Emerging Markets index (explained below) during the 25-year period 1990-2014. The

countries are: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Hungary,

India, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines,

Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey, and Venezuela.

         We focus mainly on positive equity inflows, which represent more than 75% of all

inflow observations. Our focus on positive inflows reflects our goal to analyze whether firms

issue more equity after foreign capital arrives to their country, and how those equity proceeds

are employed. Negative capital inflows, on the other hand, represent a departure of foreign

capital. Although it is conceivable that firms might repurchase equity when foreign capital

departs their country (a negative issuance), existing empirical evidence finds no connection

between outflows and investment behavior by publicly traded firms, which suggests that

negative issuance is not a common response to outflows.6 Our issuance data (explained below)

do not provide information on stock repurchases, so we focus on the positive issuance

implications of positive capital inflows. However, for robustness, we analyze the effects of

negative inflows on equity issuance. Our findings confirm the view that negative equity inflows

have no significant effects on equity issuance.7




6 Tong and Wei (2010) and Claessens et al. (2012) investigate stock price reactions and real investment changes
associated with the large capital outflows produced by the global financial crisis. They find a significant negative
effect on stock prices, but no effect on investment. That finding is consistent with firms not responding to capital
outflows and lower stock prices with significant repurchases of their shares.
7 Specifically, we find that negative inflows tend to produce an asymmetric response in equity issuance. Because

negative inflows reduce issuances only slightly, even large negative inflows are still associated with large positive
issuances.

                                                         9
        The data on equity issuance activity come from the Thomson Reuters Security Data

Corporation Platinum database (SDC Platinum). This database provides transaction-level

information on new issuances of common equity by publicly traded firms. The transactions

include seasoned equity offerings and initial public offerings. The data distinguish between

issuances in international and domestic equity markets. An issuance is classified as

international if the firm’s country of origin is different than the country where the equity is

raised. SDC classifies the majority of newly issued shares that are destined to become

depository receipts (including American Depositary Receipts and Global Depositary Receipts)

as international issuances. Equity issuances are sold to a combination of domestic and foreign

investors. We have data on a total of 17,682 issuing firms. We include both financial and non-

financial firms. Each group has a significant share of the issuance activity. The issuance activity

of financial firms is relevant for the financing of investment by non-financial corporations,

although financial firms do not directly engage in capital investment. Our results on issuance

activity are robust to excluding financial firms from our sample.

        Table 1 reports summary statistics of issuance activity by country. Column 1 reports

the number of firms included in the sample. Columns 2 and 3 show the average annual value

of equity issuance proceeds for all firms in a country and the value of proceeds per firm,

respectively. In a typical year, the average firm in the sample issues equity worth 9 million U.S.

dollars. Column 4 reports the annual frequency of equity issuance, defined as the average

fraction of firms that issue equity in a given year. On average, 16% of firms issue equity in a

typical year. Columns 5 to 8 report separate statistics for domestic and international issuances.

The average number of firms that issue in domestic markets is around 8 times larger than the

number of firms that issue in international markets. However, the average issuance size of




                                                10
firms that issue abroad is 70% larger than the average size of domestic issuances (12 vs. 7

million U.S. dollars).

         For the use-of-funds analysis, we merge the SDC data with Worldscope data, which

provide information on firms’ financial statements (balance sheets, income statements, and

cash flow statements). The Worldscope data are available for 54% of the firms contained in

the SDC database, resulting in a merged dataset of 9,472 firms.

         For the first of our three instrumental variables, we collect data from the MSCI

Emerging Markets Index for the period 1996-2014.8 The MSCI index is a stock market index

covering 25 emerging market countries representing 10% of global stock market capitalization.

The index covers approximately 85% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization in each

country. The index is maintained by MSCI Inc., formerly Morgan Stanley Capital International,

and is used as a common benchmark for international equity mutual funds. Appendix Figure

1 plots the average weights of the 25 countries in the MSCI Index.



III.     Empirical Strategy and Identification

Our presentation of empirical findings begins with ordinary least squares (OLS) results at the

country level. The results show a strong empirical relation between country-level equity

inflows and equity issuances. These results do not provide a causal interpretation of the links

between issuances and equity inflows, but they do document an important new fact: increases

in equity inflows are associated with increases in equity issuance, and that is true after

controlling for country and time fixed effects.


8 The instrumental variable analysis that uses the MSCI is restricted to the sample 1997-2014 because the MSCI
weights are available only from 1996 onwards and because we lag MSCI weights by one year. An advantage of
the other two instruments (other countries’ market value and issuance volume) is that they can be estimated over
the whole sample period, 1990-2014. The results using the second and third instruments are robust to restricting
the sample to 1997-2014.

                                                      11
        The country-level results do not provide a causal interpretation because they do not

distinguish between supply-side and demand-side influences. Supply-side factors include

increased global liquidity or global appetite for risk (depending on each country’s sensitivity to

those global shocks), or idiosyncratic changes in foreign appetite for investing in particular

countries, which could reflect changes in constraints on international investments,

improvements in a destination country’s property rights, or legal institutional improvements

(Stulz, 2005; Karolyi, 2015). Demand-side factors are any changes that affect investment

opportunities, such as changes in productivity, technology, or local economic conditions. For

example, improvements in firm productivity within the subject country might drive both

equity inflows and issuances. In that case, although foreign investors’ willingness to provide

equity inflows could facilitate adjustment to demand-side shocks (by reducing the cost of

issuances), changes in foreigners’ interest in investing might not be an important source of

change in either inflows or issuances.

        Forbes and Warnock (2012) and Fratzscher (2012) document that supply-side factors

have been more important than demand-side factors in explaining capital inflow episodes in

emerging economies. In this paper, we take two steps to disentangle demand-side from supply-

side effects. First, we take advantage of our firm-level data. In our firm-level OLS analysis,

which control for firm and year fixed effects, we establish another new fact: the strong

aggregate association between equity inflows and issuance reflects the behavior of a subset of

firms: large domestic and foreign issuers. By comparing the response of large and small issuers

to equity inflows, we can account for country-year fixed effects in our estimation, which allows

us to control for all time-varying country shocks. The fact that the response of issuance activity

to equity inflows is concentrated in a subset of firms suggests a supply-side channel: if inflows

were simply responding to improved economic conditions in the country, one would expect

                                               12
all firms to issue more equity at times of large capital inflows, which is not what we observe.

However, it is possible that economic conditions improve disproportionally for this subset of

firms, in which case we cannot establish a causal connection between equity inflows and

issuances.

       To obtain a cleaner identification, we proceed with an instrumental variable estimation.

We make use of the fact that, for a given amount of capital inflows to emerging markets as a

whole, positive shocks to other countries’ attractiveness to foreign investors constitute

negative shocks to the subject country’s supply of funds. Our instruments capture changes in

the attractiveness to foreign investors of other emerging market countries (for a given total

amount of inflows, which we capture by a time fixed effect). Valid instruments should be

strongly correlated with capital inflows and should also satisfy the exclusion restriction that

they are not correlated with demand-side influences within the subject country. We employ

three alternative measures as instruments.

       First, we instrument the equity inflows received by a country with the lagged weight

of that country in the MSCI Emerging Markets stock index. The MSCI weight of a country

depends primarily on the market capitalization of that country’s stock market, relative to the

global market capitalization of 25 emerging economies. The weight also depends, to a lesser

extent, on MSCI’s adjustments to country weights for factors that they regard as relevant to

foreign investors. Because all country weights sum to 100 percent, variation in a country’s

weight in the MSCI index should primarily reflect shocks to the market values of the other 24

countries’ stock markets (and to MSCI’s adjustments to country weights), which are plausibly

exogenous to subject country demand-side shocks. That should be especially true for small

countries.




                                              13
         Changes in MSCI weights should affect capital inflows not only as an indicator of

market value changes in other countries, but also because some foreign investors, such as

emerging market mutual funds, follow closely the MSCI index when setting their portfolio

holdings (Raddatz et al., 2017). When those investors receive funds from their ultimate fund

suppliers, they invest those funds into emerging economies’ equity markets according to the

proportion of those economies in the MSCI index. For illustrative purposes, Panel A of Figure

2 shows the relation between Mexico’s MSCI weight and its equity inflows (the correlation is

positive and statistically significant at the 1% level). In robustness tests, we run the same

instrumental variable regressions for a sample of emerging markets that excludes large

countries (which should have greater effects on their own MSCI weights by virtue of their

size).

         Although the primary source of variation in MSCI weights is external to each country,

MSCI weights are still partially affected by domestic shocks (including demand-side shocks to

firms’ productivity). For that reason, we also employ alternative instruments that do not suffer

from that problem. Our alternative measures of the attractiveness of other countries are the

aggregate value of equity in other emerging market countries, and the volume of equity

issuances in other emerging markets.

         Both of these instrumental variables will also affect the MSCI weights of a country,

but only as the result of variation coming from outside the country. Whereas the market value

of equity, or issuances, in other countries reflect a mix of supply- and demand-side influences

within those other countries, from the standpoint of the subject country, they are plausibly

exogenous influences on the supply of funding. If increases in the value or volume of issuances

in other countries are associated with capital inflows into those other countries (as our

aggregate results suggest), then from the standpoint of the subject country, the diversion of

                                              14
capital inflows into other countries is a supply shock. For illustrative purposes, Panel B of

Figure 2 plots Mexico’s equity inflows against the equity issuances of other countries (the

correlation is negative and statistically significant at the 1% level).

        Lastly, it is conceivable that market values of equity, or equity issuances, in other

countries could be correlated with local economic conditions in the subject country in the case

of common shocks. Such a correlation would violate the exclusion restriction. In our first-

stage regression, we account for year fixed effects, which control for common shocks. That

said, to be sure that we get rid of common-shock influences, we orthogonalize other countries’

equity value, or issuances, by removing any correlation between other countries’ equity value

or issuances with the equity value or issuances in the subject country.



IV.     Equity Inflows and Issuances

A. Capital Inflows and Issuance Activity in the Aggregate

As explained in the Introduction, Figure 1 displays the relation between global capital inflows

and global equity issuance values. These two worldwide time series are significantly positively

correlated: the correlation coefficient is 0.56 (statistically significant at the 1% level). In Figure

3, we alternatively plot the time series of global equity inflows scaled by GDP and global equity

issuances scaled by GDP. The correlation coefficient between both variables is 0.43, which is

significant at the 5% level.

        To control for country and year effects, we estimate the following country-level panel

regression:

                 log⁡(1 + 𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒)𝑐𝑡 = 𝛼𝑐 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛽 log(𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑠)𝑐𝑡 + 𝜀𝑐𝑡 ,                       (1)

where 𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑐𝑡 denotes the value of equity issuance proceeds (in million U.S. dollars) by

all firms of country c in year t and 𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑠𝑐𝑡 refers to equity capital inflows (in million U.S.

                                                   15
dollars) received by country c in year t. We use the log of issuance plus one (million U.S. dollars)

to account for country-year observations with zero issuances (13% of the total). 𝛼𝑐 and 𝛼𝑡

capture country and year fixed effects, respectively. We cluster standard errors of this

regression, and all other regressions reported below, by country and year.9

         Table 2 shows a highly significant positive relation between capital inflows and

country-level issuance proceeds in emerging markets. Column 1 shows that the elasticity of

issuances to inflows is 0.55. Thus, a 60% increase in equity inflows (the average growth rate

of inflows in our sample) is associated with a 33% increase in the value of equity issuance

proceeds. This indicates that inflows imply more than a simple transfer of equity ownership

from domestic to foreign investors. The result implies that for the typical country in a typical

year, every million U.S. dollar of equity capital received from foreign investors is associated

with an increase in the value of equity proceeds of at least 0.18 million U.S. dollars (using a

standard error below the coefficient estimate to measure the effect). The point estimate implies

an effect of 0.48 million U.S. dollars.10

         Table 2, columns 2 and 3 show estimations of Equation (1) separately for issuances in

domestic and foreign equity markets. The effect of capital inflows is statistically the same and

quantitatively similar for both types of issuances. That is, issuances increase in both domestic

and foreign markets when capital enters a country.

         To make sure that our results are not affected by the log specification, which excludes

negative inflows, we re-estimate Equation (1) scaling country issuances and all equity inflows



9 Our results remain unchanged if we cluster standard errors at the country level.
10 To calculate the dollar effects, we first calculate the predicted equity issued for each country-year pair by
replacing the corresponding equity inflows into Equation (1) and using the estimated coefficients from the
regression results. As fixed effects, we use the coefficients for each year and country for the corresponding
country-year pair. We then increase equity inflows by one million U.S. dollars and repeat the procedure, which
yields the new predicted issuance. Next, we compute the difference between the two predicted values. For each
country, we average the differences across all years and report the value for the median country.

                                                      16
(positive and negative) by GDP. Table 3 reports the results of this alternative specification.

Increases in capital inflows, relative to GDP, are strongly correlated with greater equity

issuances, relative to GDP. This holds for all equity issuances, as well as for domestic and

foreign issuances separately.

         We also report results separately for positive and negative equity inflows relative to

GDP in Table 3. Interestingly, the coefficient magnitude for negative inflows is much smaller

and statistically insignificant, suggesting only a small reduction in issuances, which remain

positive, even when capital inflows are highly negative. Given this asymmetry in the relation

between equity inflows and aggregate issuances, we focus on positive equity inflows in our

empirical analysis of the effects of equity inflows on issuance decisions at the firm level.11



B. Capital Inflows and Firms’ Issuance Activity

To analyze the impact of equity capital inflows on firms’ issuance activity, we estimate a firm-

level panel regression accounting for firm and year fixed effects:

                  log⁡(1 + 𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒)𝑖𝑐𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛽log⁡(𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑠)𝑐𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑐𝑡 ,                              (2)

where 𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑖𝑐𝑡 is the value of equity raised (in million U.S. dollars) by firm i in country c

in year t. Firms issue equity sporadically, so firm issuances exhibit lumpy behavior. As in the

previous section, we add a one (million U.S. dollars) to the log of issuances to account for




11 One can explain this finding from the perspective of corporate capital structure decisions: firms in emerging
markets have strong incentives to issue equity when the cost of doing so is low, but they do not have to reduce
outstanding equity when foreign withdrawals of equity cause prices to fall. Given the high costs of external
finance in emerging markets, firms in these economies tend to have highly productive unrealized investment
opportunities (from a Tobin’s q perspective), which explains why issuances tend to be positive even when inflows
are small or negative, and why repurchases of equity are rare.


                                                      17
firm-year observations with zero issuances.12⁡𝛼𝑖 and 𝛼𝑡 denote firm and year fixed effects,

respectively.

         Table 4 reports the results. Interestingly, column 1 shows that the effect of capital

inflows on firm-level issuance is not statistically different from zero on average for the whole

sample of firms. To explore this result further, we estimate Equation (2) separately for

issuances in domestic and foreign equity markets (columns 2 and 3, respectively). We find a

strong positive relation between capital inflows and foreign issuances, but no relation between

inflows and domestic issuances. As documented above, the size of international issuances is

70% larger, on average, than the size of domestic issuances, suggesting that that the response

to capital inflows might depend on issuance size. To analyze that possibility, we divide the

sample of domestic equity issuers into two groups: large domestic issuers and small domestic

issuers. We define a large domestic equity issuer dummy equal to one if the average domestic

equity proceeds of a firm during our sample period is larger than the median average equity

proceeds of all firms in the same country and sector, and zero otherwise.13

         Column 4 augments Equation (2) with an interaction term between capital inflows and

the large domestic issuer dummy.14 The interaction term is positive and highly significant. This

implies that large domestic issuers drive the positive relation between inflows and country

issuances documented in the previous section. The elasticity of 0.1 implies that a 60% increase

in equity inflows (average growth rate of inflows) is associated with a 6% increase in the value


12 We construct the firm-level panel dataset as follows. First, we define the starting year of a firm as the first year
in which the firm appears in either the SDC or Worldscope databases. Next, we define the ending year of the
firm as the last year in which the firm appears in SDC or Worldscope. Lastly, we construct the time series of
issuances for each firm by filling in 0s between the starting and ending year for all years in which the firm does
not issue equity.
13 We classify sectors into 10 broad SIC industries. The value of equity raised by large issuers in domestic equity

markets is 7 times larger than the value raised by small issuers (=1,946,896/290,657).
14 We estimate the regression: log⁡(1 + 𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒)
                                                     𝑖𝑐𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛽log⁡(𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑠)𝑐𝑡 + 𝛾log⁡(𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑠)𝑐𝑡 ×
𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑐 + 𝜀𝑖𝑐𝑡 .


                                                         18
of equity proceeds raised by large domestic issuers, relative to small issuers. The elasticity of

large domestic issuers to inflows is similar in size to the elasticity of foreign issuers (0.1 versus

0.09). That is not surprising given that foreign issuers also tend to issue similarly large amounts

of equity. In column 5, we add interacted country-year fixed effects to the specification for

large domestic equity issuers (𝛼𝑐𝑡 ).15 This specification allows us to control for all time-varying

country shocks. The coefficient of interest is identified purely from the within-country

variation between large domestic and small issuers. The interaction term remains highly

significant.

         Given the similarity in the magnitudes of the coefficients for large domestic issuers

and foreign issuers, we pool the two groups into a single class of issuers, which we label “large

equity issuers.” We report results for that group of issuers in columns 6 and 7, which are

analogous to the results reported in columns 4 and 5. The elasticities in the various

specifications, whether for large domestic issuers, foreign issuers, or the combined group of

large equity issuers, using alternative fixed effect specifications, are nearly identical and range

from 0.09 to 0.11.

         To understand the mechanism connecting equity inflows and issuances, we study

whether inflows operate on the “extensive” margin (more firms issuing equity), the “intensive”

margin (more equity issued by issuing firms), or both. In decomposing the value of individual

firm issuances into extensive and intensive margins, we use as the dependent variable for the

extensive margin an indicator variable equal to one if the firm issued equity in a given year,

and zero otherwise. For the intensive margin, we condition the sample to strictly positive

issuances. Table 5 reports the results. Panel A shows the results of issuances by large domestic


15The effect of capital inflows, which varies at the country-year level, is absorbed by the country-year fixed
effects. The equation for the new specification with interacted country-year fixed effects is: log⁡(1 +
𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒)𝑖𝑐𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛼𝑐𝑡 + 𝛾log⁡(𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑠)𝑐𝑡 × 𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑐 +⁡𝜀𝑖𝑐𝑡 .

                                                     19
issuers for our preferred specification with firm and country-year fixed effects. Panel B shows

the results for foreign issuers using only firm and year fixed effects. Panel C reports pooled

results for the pooled sample of all large equity issuers. For reference, we re-display the

previous results in column 1.

         According to column 2 of Panel A in Table 5, a 60% increase in inflows is associated

with a 1.1 percentage point increase in the probability that large domestic issuers will raise

equity in that year, relative to small issuers (=60x0.0175). This represents a 7% increase in the

likelihood of issuing equity, relative to the average issuance probability (=1.1%/16%). From

column 3, we observe that there is no statistically significant association between capital

inflows and the amount of issuances, conditional on issuing. Panel B shows the same results

for foreign issuers: the extensive margin drives the entire response of foreign issuers to capital

inflows. The fact that the size of issuance is not affected by changes in capital inflows supports

the assumption that the large issuer characteristic can be treated as a plausibly exogenous

characteristic of the firm.16 Panel C reports results for the combined sample of issuers. All

three sets of results display nearly identical coefficient values.

         Lastly, in Table 6 we explore the characteristics of large domestic and foreign issuers.

We collapse the sample into a single cross-section by taking the time average of all

observations and regress the large issuer dummy on a series of firm characteristics, including


16 We also studied trends over time in the size of issuances for large and small issuers. 28% percent of the firms
in our sample issued domestic equity more than once, accounting for roughly half of the observations. We
compare the average of the first issuance between large domestic and small domestic issuers and then make the
same comparison for subsequent issuances. We find that subsequent issuances are similarly larger than first
issuances for both large domestic and small domestic issuers. The average values of the first and subsequent
issuance of large domestic issuers are 163.04 and 210.18 million U.S. dollars, respectively. For the small domestic
issuers, the average values of the first issuance and subsequent issuance are 22.65 and 33 million U.S. dollars,
respectively. This evidence is consistent with the work of Didier et al. (2015), who find that firms grow faster
after issuing securities. The growth of issuance size is 130% for large and 150% for small issuers. The fact that
the size of issuance changes similarly over time for small and large domestic issuers further supports the
assumption that the large issuer characteristic can be treated as a plausibly exogenous characteristic of the firm.


                                                        20
country and sector fixed effects. 17 To perform this analysis, we need financial-statements

information, so we use the merged SDC-Worldscope data. We consider three central firm-

level attributes: size (measured by total assets), stock liquidity (measured by volume traded in

a given year), and investment opportunities (measured by the market-to-book equity ratio).

Column 1 estimates the extent to which large domestic issuers differ from small domestic

issuers along each of the three dimensions, column 2 analogously captures the extent to which

foreign issuers differ from small domestic issuers, and column 3 combines the two groups to

investigate how large equity issuers differ from small domestic issuers.

         We observe that large domestic and foreign issuers tend to be similarly large firms

(measured by total assets) with relatively liquid stocks. However, large domestic issuers display

higher investment opportunities than small domestic issuers, while foreign issuers do not.

With respect to stock liquidity, both large domestic issuers and foreign issuers display greater

volume traded than small domestic issuers. It is not surprising that firms with these

characteristics are the ones that are associated with greater measured responsiveness to foreign

investment, as reflected in the higher elasticities of issuances by these firms to capital inflows.

         The fact that the response of issuance activity to equity inflows is concentrated in large

issuing firms suggests a supply-side channel. If inflows were simply responding to improved

economic conditions of firms in the country, one would expect all firms to issue more equity

at times of large capital inflows. The heterogeneous results of capital inflows on large and

small issuers can be explained by foreign investors having a preference for large issuers, in the

domestic market or the international one. International institutional investors tend to be large

relative to domestic ones and favor allocating their investments in few large companies that


17In particular, we regress: 𝑌𝑖𝑐𝑠 = 𝛼𝑠 + 𝛼𝑐 + 𝛽𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑠 + 𝜀𝑖𝑐𝑠 , where Y is a dummy variable equal
to one if the firm is a large domestic issuer, or a foreign issuer, or (for the combined group) a large issuer, and
zero otherwise.

                                                        21
are well known and liquid, so that they have less impact on prices when trading shares.

Consequently, large issuances take place when those investors increase their appetite to invest

in the country, whereas small issuances are not sensitive to foreign investors’ behavior.



V.       Instrumental Variables Approach

As discussed in the Introduction and in Section III, an increase in issuance activity could reflect

an increase in foreign equity funding supply or domestic equity funding demand, or some

combination of the two. This section analyzes the importance of the supply-side channel and

whether it can explain the response, documented in the previous section, of the issuance

activity of a subset of firms (large equity issuers) to equity inflows. To do so, it presents our

instrumental variable (IV) regressions, which identify supply-side shocks affecting capital

inflows. We report our IV results for issuances in Tables 7-9. For convenience, we report

results pooling large domestic issuers and foreign issuers into large equity issuers. When the

two groups are treated separately in the regressions, their responses are indistinguishable

statistically. Standard errors are bootstrapped and clustered both by country and by year.18

         In our first IV regressions, we instrument equity inflows with the lagged MSCI

Emerging Market Index country weights. For the second-stage regressions, the relevant

regressor is the interaction between equity inflows and the large issuer dummy, which we

instrument with the interaction between the lagged MSCI weights and the large issuer dummy.


18 The structure of our model combines aggregate country-level data in the first-stage regression, and firm-level
data in the second-stage regression. This requires us to estimate the model in two stages and bootstrap the
standard errors to account for the fact that we use an estimated regressor in the second stage. We bootstrap both
the first stage and second stage, clustering separately at the country and year level and then computing standard
errors that take into account the two-way clustering. Our approach follows the methods outlined in Cameron et
al. (2006), Cameron and Trivedi (2009), and Cameron et al. (2015) and adapts them to our data structure. We
obtain similar results if we let Stata calculate the bootstrapped standard errors jointly for the entire model, based
on the sample draws obtained in the second stage. We report results with 1000 sample draws in each stage and
for each clustering level.


                                                        22
As explained in Section IV, the fact that large equity issuers respond to inflows through the

extensive margin indicates that the large issuer dummy is a plausibly exogenous characteristic

of the firm.

         Table 7 reports the results of the first-stage and second-stage regressions.19 Column 1

reports the first-stage regression. It shows that the instrument is positively and highly

correlated with equity capital inflows. The F-statistic is 19.8, indicating a powerful first-stage

influence of the instrument.20

         Column 2 of Table 7 shows the results of the second-stage regression.21 Consistent

with the OLS results reported in the previous section, we find that when a country receives a

supply-driven capital inflow, large issuers issue more equity (column 2). As a robustness test,

we exclude from the sample emerging market countries with the largest MSCI weights (Brazil,

China, and South Korea) because the variation in their weights could be large enough that

their own country’s demand-side changes could produce much of the variation in their own

country weights. The average MSCI weights for these three countries are 11.7%, 10.4%, and

13.6%, respectively. We find that the results, reported in Appendix Table 1, are similar to those

in Table 7.22



19 The first-stage regression is:⁡log⁡(𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑠)𝑐𝑡 = 𝛼𝑐 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛽 log(𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑐𝑡−1 ) + 𝜀𝑐𝑡 .
20 We also tried using two-year and three-year lagged weights of the MSCI, which should be even less related to
contemporary demand shocks. Although the effect remains significant, the power of the instrument decreases
with more lags, as one would expect. For this reason, we focus on the one-year-lag specification, which provides
the strongest first-stage relation.
21 We estimate: 𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦                            ̂                                              ̂
                                        𝑖𝑐𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛼𝑐𝑡 + 𝛾𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑠𝑐𝑡 × 𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑐 + 𝜀𝑖𝑐𝑡 , where 𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑠𝑐𝑡
denotes the fitted values of the first-stage regression.
22 We also considered specifications in which lagged MSCI weights substituted for current weights, or were added

to current weights as an additional instrument. Results were similar to specifications with only the current value
of the MSCI weight. In another robustness test, we substituted the log of the equity index value for the log of
the MSCI weight. In this alternative specification, the instrument captures only the role of market value changes
of other countries’ indexes as an indicator of the subject country’s attractiveness to foreign investors. Note that
this specification does not capture any causal effect from investors’ desires to track country weights. Results
remained unchanged. In a final robustness test of this approach, the log of the market value of other countries’
stock indexes was orthogonalized (regressed on the subject country’s index to remove covariance). The results
remained again unchanged.

                                                       23
         As discussed in Section III, the market value of other countries’ equity, and the equity

issuances of other countries, offer alternative measures of the attractiveness of the subject

country’s equity market to foreign investors. The advantage of those alternative instruments

is that both of them affect a country’s MSCI weight exclusively through external influences.

We report IV results using these measures in Table 8. The instruments both are powerful

negative predictors of equity capital inflows in the first-stage regression. The results of the

second-stage regressions are similar to but smaller than those reported in Table 7 (0.18 and

0.17 for other countries’ equity value and equity issuance volume, respectively, relative to 0.29

for the MSCI weight).23

         Our third and final reported IV regression results employ, as instruments,

orthogonalized market value of equity and orthogonalized equity issuances in other countries.

We derive the orthogonalization by removing the covariance, that is, by regressing other

countries’ market value of equity (equity issuances) on the subject country’s market value of

equity (equity issuances). We report the results in Table 9. The coefficients for the two second-

stage regressions in columns 3 and 4 are similar in value (0.21 and 0.22) and not statistically

significantly different from the comparable coefficients in Table 8 (0.18 and 0.17).24

         The IV coefficients in Tables 7-9 are greater than the OLS coefficient of 0.10 reported

in Table 4. Given that the country’s MSCI weight is not as clean an instrument, we conclude

that the better identified IV coefficient value likely lies somewhere between 0.17 and 0.22, as




23 In unreported regressions, we also tried using lagged market value or lagged equity issuances of other countries
as alternative instruments, either instead of contemporaneous values of those variables or in addition to
contemporaneous values. The coefficient estimates for the second-stage regressions remain unchanged.
24 Note that when using either the market value of other countries’ equity, or other countries’ issuances, as

instruments, there is no need to exclude large countries from the sample. That exclusion was a robustness test
when using the MSCI index as our instrument because large countries are likely to have a significant effect on
their own country weights.

                                                        24
reported in Tables 8 and 9. The differences between those IV estimates and the OLS estimate

are not highly statistically significant.

           In the absence of measurement error of capital inflows, the OLS coefficient should be

greater than or equal to the IV coefficient because OLS captures supply and demand effects

and those effects are additive. However, there is reason to believe that equity inflows are

measured with error, which biases the OLS coefficient downwards. As Lane and Milesi-

Ferretti (2017, p. 21) note in their discussion of the capital inflow data: “One concern … is

the increasing difficulty in properly assessing external exposures … particularly in light of the

size of cross-border asset trade intermediated by financial centers [which complicates the

measurement of inflows into a particular country] … This difficulty affects virtually all

categories of cross-border holdings …” As a result, under the assumption that our

identification is correct, the OLS coefficient in our setting could be larger or smaller than the

IV estimate.

           Overall, we find that whether one measures the attractiveness of other countries’

equity markets to foreign investors using the MSCI weights, other countries’ market value or

other countries’ equity issuance volume, the results are similar: supply-side effects of

instrumented equity inflows are large and statistically significant. Results are robust to using

lagged or contemporaneous values of instruments, or to using orthogonalized or non-

orthogonalized measures. We conclude that supply-side shocks are an important driver of

equity capital flows, and that plausibly exogenous changes in the supply of foreign equity

inflows have important consequences for equity issuances by large domestic and foreign

issuers.

VI.      Capital Inflows and Uses of Funds

Having established a connection between equity capital inflows and equity issuances, we now

study the ways firms use the funds raised in the equity offerings. We perform the analysis using

the merged SDC-Worldscope data. Following the approach of Kim and Weisbach (2008) and

Erel et al. (2011), we focus on six uses of funds: CAPEX, acquisitions, R&D, inventory

accumulation, cash accumulation, and long-term debt reduction.25 We report results for all

firms in Tables 10 and 11, but we obtain nearly identical results for a subsample that is

restricted to non-financial issuers (Appendix Tables 2 and 3). This reflects the fact that non-

financial issuers are the majority of our sample (representing more than four-fifths of our

observations).

         We report IV results, using other countries’ equity issuance volume as an instrument

for equity inflows, with each of the uses of funds treated as dependent variables. We obtain

similar results using the other two instruments (other countries’ market value and MSCI

weights). We report those alternative results in Appendix Tables 4 and 5. Table 10 reports the

results. Column 1 shows that a 60% increase in inflows (the average growth rate of inflows in

our sample) leads large equity issuers to increase their capital expenditures by 11%, relative to

small domestic issuers. Columns 2 and 3 of Table 10 show that, after the arrival of equity

inflows, large equity issuers also tend to undertake more corporate acquisitions and invest

more in R&D. The final three columns of Table 10 show that increased equity inflows lead to

inventory accumulation, cash accumulation, and a reduction in long-term debt.26




25 We obtain the variables CAPEX, acquisitions, R&D, and long-term debt reduction from the income and cash
flow statements and the variables inventory accumulation and cash accumulation from the balance sheets.
26 When large domestic issuers and foreign issuers are considered separately, the coefficients for all the variables

tend to be a bit larger for foreign issuers.

         The previous results reveal the connections between capital inflows and different uses

of funds, but those connections do not make use of the role played by equity issuances in

connecting capital inflows and uses of funds. To analyze the linkages among inflows, issuances

and uses of funds, we first adopt the methodology of Kim and Weisbach (2008) and Erel et

al. (2011). We focus on the six uses of funds described above, measuring the change in each

use of funds over a variety of time intervals, ranging from one year to four years. Following

those authors, we begin by calculating the use of funds after each firm’s equity offering

(whether caused by capital inflows or something else) by estimating the following regression

for the equity offerings of large equity issuers:

                                     𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒
        𝑌𝑖𝑐𝑡 = 𝛼𝑐 + 𝛼𝑡 + ⁡𝛽log [1 + (         ) ]
                                      𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠 𝑖𝑐𝑡
                                                                                            (5)

                       + 𝛾log [1 + (                ) ] + 𝛿log[𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑡 ] + 𝜀𝑖𝑐𝑡 ,
                                          𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠     𝑖𝑐𝑡


where 𝑌 = ⁡log[(∑𝑛𝑖=1 𝑉𝑖 /𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠) + 1] for the income- and cash flow-statement items (𝑉 =

CAPEX, acquisitions, R&D, long-term debt reduction), and 𝑌 = ⁡log[((𝑉𝑡 − 𝑉0 )/𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠) +

1] for the balance-sheet items (𝑉 = inventory, cash holdings). N=1,2,3,4 denotes the years

following the issuance. 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠 denotes total assets in the year just prior to the equity issuance

                                   ∑𝑛
                                    𝑖−1(𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙⁡𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑖 −𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒)
(n=0). 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟⁡𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑠 = ⁡log [(                 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠
                                                                ) + 1],⁡ where total sources of

funds represent the total funds generated by the firm internally and externally during a given

year.

         Table 11 reports the results of estimating Equation (5) separately for each use of fund,

for each time interval considered. We report the estimated elasticities and also the dollar




                                                27
effects, for the average firm of the typical country in a typical year.27 The table shows that for

every million U.S. dollar raised in an offering, large domestic and foreign issuers combined

increase CAPEX on average by 0.15 million U.S. dollars in the year after the offering. The

effect on CAPEX increases to 0.26 million U.S. dollars when the equation is estimated over a

four-year period. After four years, issuers spend 0.38 million U.S. dollars in acquisitions and

0.26 million U.S. dollars in R&D. Overall, the largest use of funds is corporate investment

(sum of CAPEX, acquisitions, and R&D): issuers invest between 0.50 and 0.90 million U.S.

dollars of every million U.S. dollar raised in an equity offering.

         Firms also spend important amounts of funds in accumulating cash and reducing long-

term debt. After four years of an offering, issuers save in cash 0.34 million U.S. dollars of each

million U.S. dollar raised and spend 0.34 million U.S. dollars to reduce or repay long-term

debt. The fact that firms use a considerable fraction of funds for financial motives is consistent

with a market timing channel. In particular, firms might take advantage of higher stock prices

to issue equity (Baker and Wurgler, 2000). In fact, global equity inflows are positively

correlated with global stock price returns in the time series.28 However, the fact that firms

spend a substantial amount of proceeds to fund corporate investment indicates that firms issue

equity for additional reasons besides market timing. In particular, the results suggest that




27 To calculate the dollar effects, we first calculate the predicted values of the dependent variables for each firm-
year observation by plugging the actual values of firm issuances, other sources of funds, and total assets into
Equation (5). For the fixed effects, we use the coefficients for each year and country of the corresponding
country-year pair. We then re-calculate the predicted values of the dependent variables after adding one million
U.S. dollars to the issuance value. Next, we calculate the difference of the two predicted values for each firm-
year observation. To aggregate the differences, we first take the time-average of the differences per firm, we then
take the median firm-average per country and subsequently the median country in our sample. We calculate a
lower bound for the dollar effect by replacing the estimated beta coefficient from Equation (5) with the estimated
beta coefficient minus its standard deviation.
28 We collect data on countrywide stock price indices for each of the 25 countries in the sample. For each country,

we calculate equity returns as the log ratio of stock price indices in two consecutive years. Then, for each year,
we average equity returns across all countries. The coefficient of correlation between global equity issuances and
global equity returns is 0.23, not statistically significant.

capital inflows reduce equity financing costs, which allows firms to raise equity to finance new

investments.

        Overall, our results indicate that equity issuance is an important channel through which

capital inflows can affect real economic activity. In the aggregate analysis, we document that

one million U.S. dollar of equity inflows is associated with an increase of at least 0.18 million

U.S. dollars of country-level equity issuances. On the other hand, we show that domestic large

issuers and foreign issuers combined invest at least 0.50 million U.S. dollars of each million

raised in an equity offering, respectively. Combining both results, a back-of-the-envelope

calculation indicates that for every million U.S. dollar of equity capital received from foreign

investors, emerging market firms increase corporate investment by at least 100,000 U.S. dollars

(=0.18x0.50). Our point estimate of the combined effect is 400,000 U.S. dollars (=0.48x0.90).



VII.    Conclusions

There is a growing literature documenting that greater capital inflows are associated with

important increases in aggregate investment and higher economic growth. A separate large

literature studies the issuance activity of firms. This paper is the first study to examine the link

between capital inflows and investment using issuance-level data. We seek to determine

whether increases in equity capital inflows into emerging market countries are associated with

increases in equity issuance and corporate investment by publicly traded firms, and whether

any observed association can be attributed to supply-side influences from exogenous changes

in international investors’ interest in investing in particular countries.

        We find that increases in equity inflows into emerging markets are associated with

higher values of country-level equity issuance proceeds. This indicates that inflows imply more

than a simple transfer of equity ownership from domestic to foreign investors. Using firm-

                                                29
level data, we show that large issuers in domestic equity markets and issuers in international

markets drive this relation. We find that those issuers, which tend to be large firms with liquid

stocks, are more likely to issue equity in domestic and international markets when equity capital

arrives from foreign investors wanting to acquire domestic shares. Instrumenting equity

inflows with various alternative measures that capture the exogenous variation in other

countries’ attractiveness to foreign investors, we show that our results are driven in large part

by variation in foreign equity capital supply.

        Lastly, we find that large domestic and foreign issuers invest a substantial fraction of

the funds raised in equity offerings. Using a back-of-the-envelope calculation, we find that

every million U.S. dollar of foreign equity capital is associated with an increase of at least

100,000 U.S. dollars in corporate investment. The capital structure of the firms also changes

significantly, as issuing firms reduce their debt and increase their cash. Our evidence is

consistent with capital inflows lowering equity financing costs, which allows firms to raise

funds to finance new investments. In all, our results indicate that equity issuance is an

important channel through which capital inflows affect real economic activity.

        Our work shows how micro data can provide unique insights into how subsets of

firms drive aggregate relations. Our findings suggest that the issuance and investment behavior

of some large firms in emerging markets is highly response to equity inflows. But apparently,

many other emerging market firms are not the target of global market investors’ share

purchases. For those smaller firms, large flows of funds connecting their countries to global

markets have little direct effect on their propensity to issue equity. This suggests that it can be

useful to divide firms in emerging economies into two categories: those for which equity

capital inflows have important direct effects on the cost of issuing capital, and those for which

they do not.

                                                 30
        To the extent that equity inflows lower the cost of finance for large issuers, that may

create a competitive advantage for those firms. At the same time, it is possible that large issuers

may share some of the benefits of their access to international investors with other firms.

Other firms could benefit indirectly from more abundant trade credit, or increased demand

for their products and services. Also, if equity issuances reduce issuers’ demands for local bank

debt, that could make it easier for non-issuers to borrow locally. Furthermore, financial firms

might use their new equity issuance proceeds in support of greater lending to local firms. These

two influences could be particularly beneficial for small and medium-sized firms (de la Torre

et al., 2010). More broadly, future work could examine the extent to which the selective

reductions in the cost of equity either promote greater efficiency in the economy (i.e., by

reducing financing constraints for relatively productive firms, and by providing indirect

benefits for other firms), or result in inefficiencies by increasing the market power of a small

number of large firms.

This table presents firm-level panel OLS regressions of the log of one plus equity issuance value on the log of portfolio equity inflows and their interactions with the large domestic
equity issuer or large equity issuer dummy variables. Large domestic equity issuer is a dummy variable equal to one if the time-average issuance value of a firm's domestic equity is
greater than or equal to the median of all firms' average issuances, within a country-sector, and zero otherwise. Large equity issuer is a dummy variable equal to one if the firm is a
large domestic equity issuer or a foreign equity issuer, and zero otherwise. Columns (1), (6), and (7) report the analysis for all equity issuances. Columns (2), (4), and (5) report the
analysis only for domestic equity issuances. Column (3) reports the analysis only for foreign equity issuances. All variables are winsorized at the 1% level. Regressions in columns (1)-
(4) and column (6) include firm and year fixed effects, while columns (5) and (7) include firm and country-year fixed effects. Standard errors are double clustered at the country and

  Capital Inflows and Firms' Equity Issuance Activity: Extensive and Intensive Margin
Panel A presents firm-level panel OLS regressions of firms' domestic equity issuance activity on the interaction of the log of
portfolio equity inflows with the large domestic equity issuer dummy. Large domestic equity issuer is a dummy variable equal to
one if the time-average issuance value of a firm's domestic equity is greater than or equal to the median of all firms' average
issuances, within a country-sector, and zero otherwise. Panel B presents firm-level panel OLS regressions of firms' foreign equity
issuance activity on the log of portfolio equity inflows. Panel C presents firm-level panel OLS regressions of firms' all equity
issuance activity on the interaction of the log of portfolio equity inflows with the large equity issuer dummy. Large equity issuer is
a dummy variable equal to one if the firm is a large domestic equity issuer or a foreign equity issuer, and zero otherwise. The
dependent variable in column (1) is the log of one plus equity issuance value. The dependent variable in column (2) is a dummy
variable equal to one if a firm issued equity in a given year, and zero otherwise. The dependent variable in column (3) is the log of
equity issuance value. All variables are winsorized at the 1% level. Regressions in panels A and C include firm and country-year
fixed effects, while panel B includes firm and year fixed effects. Standard errors are double clustered at the country and year
levels. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. The regressions include 25
emerging market countries over the period 1990-2014.

                 Characteristics of Large Domestic and Foreign Equity Issuers
This table presents firm-level cross-section OLS regressions of large equity issuers compared to small equity issuers. In
column (1), the dependent variable is the large domestic equity issuer dummy, which is equal to one if the time-average
issuance value of a firm's domestic equity is greater than or equal to the median of all firms' average issuances, within a
country-sector, and zero otherwise. In column (2), the dependent variable is the foreign equity issuer dummy, which is equal
to one if the firm is a foreign equity issuer, and zero if the firm is a small domestic equity issuer. A firm is classified as a
small domestic equity issuer if its time-average issuance value of domestic equity is less than the median of all firms' average
issuances, within a country-sector. In column (3), the dependent variable is the large equity issuer dummy, which is equal to
one if the firm is a large domestic equity issuer or a foreign equity issuer, and zero otherwise. All variables are winsorized at
the 1% level. All regressions include country and sector (broad SIC divisions) fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at
the country level. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. The regressions
include 25 emerging market countries over the period 1997-2012.

   Capital Inflows and Firms' Equity Issuance Activity, Instrumental Variable Approach
                           Instrument: Lagged MSCI Weight
This table presents the first- and second-stage regressions for the instrumental variable approach. Column (1) presents country-
level panel OLS regression of the log of portfolio equity inflows on the log of the one-year lag of MSCI emerging market weights.
Column (2) presents firm-level panel OLS regression of the log of one plus equity issuance value on the interaction of the log of
portfolio equity inflows (predicted from the first stage) with the large equity issuer dummy. Large equity issuer is a dummy variable
equal to one if the firm is a large domestic equity issuer or a foreign equity issuer, and zero otherwise. A firm is classified as a large
domestic equity issuer if its time-average issuance value of domestic equity is greater than or equal to the median of all firms'
average issuances, within a country-sector. All variables are winsorized at the 1% level. First-stage standard errors are double
clustered at the country and year levels. Second-stage standard errors are block bootstrapped with 1000 repetitions, double
clustering at the country and year levels. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.
The regressions include 25 emerging market countries over the period 1997-2014.

(equity issuances) of emerging markets on the log of one plus own-country market capitalization (equity issuances). Columns (2) and (4) present firm-
level panel OLS regressions of the log of one plus equity issuance value on the interaction of log of portfolio equity inflows (predicted from the first
stage) with the large equity issuer dummy. Large equity issuer is a dummy variable equal to one if the firm is a large domestic equity issuer or a foreign
equity issuer, and zero otherwise. A firm is classified as a large domestic equity issuer if its time-average issuance value of domestic equity is greater than
or equal to the median of all firms' average issuances, within a country-sector. All variables are winsorized at the 1% level. First-stage standard errors are
double clustered at the country and year levels. Second-stage standard errors are block bootstrapped with 1000 repetitions, double clustering at the
country and year levels. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. The regressions include 25 emerging
market countries over the period 1990-2014.

This table presents the second stage of firm-level panel instrumental variable regressions of the log of one plus firm characteristics on the interaction of log of portfolio equity inflows with the large equity
issuer dummy. Large equity issuer is a dummy variable equal to one if the firm is a large domestic equity issuer or a foreign equity issuer, and zero otherwise. A firm is classified as a large domestic equity issuer
if its time-average issuance value of domestic equity is greater than or equal to the median of all firms' average issuances, within a country-sector. We use the sum of other countries' equity issuance volumes as
the instrumental variable for portfolio equity inflows. The dependent variable firm characteristics are capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development expenditure, inventory, cash and short-term
investments, and reduction of long-term debt. All variables are winsorized at the 1% level. All Regressions include firm and country-year fixed effects. Standard errors are block bootstrapped with 1000
repetitions, double clustering at the country and year levels. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. The regressions include 25 emerging market countries over
the period 1990-2012.

                                          Equity Issuances and Subsequent Use of Funds
This table presents firm-level panel OLS regressions for the use-of-funds analysis for the pooled sample of issuances by large domestic and foreign equity
issuers. Large domestic equity issuers are firms whose time-average domestic equity issuance value is greater than or equal to the median of all firms'
average issuances, within a country-sector. The analysis follows the specification of Kim and Weisbach (2008). The dependent variable for balance-sheet
variables (inventory or cash and short-term investments) is Y = log[((Vi - V0)/Assets) + 1]. The dependent variable for cash-flow statement and income
statement variables (capital expenditure, acquisitions, research and development expenditure, or reduction of long-term debt) is Y = log[(∑iVi/Assets) +
1]. Independent variables are equity issuance value and other sources of funds, normalized by total assets, in addition to the log of total assets. Total
assets are taken at the value of the year just before the issuance. Dollar changes capture the change in the dependent variable resulting from a one-million-
dollar increase in a firm’s equity issuance. All variables are winsorized at the 1% level. All regressions include country and year fixed effects. Standard
errors are clustered at the industry (two-digit SIC) level. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. The
regressions include 25 emerging market countries over the period 1990-2012.

                           Instrument: Lagged MSCI Weight
This table presents the first- and second- stage regressions for the instrumental variable approach. Column (1) presents country-
level panel OLS regression of the log of portfolio equity inflows on the log of the one-year lag of MSCI emerging market weights.
Columns (2) presents firm-level panel OLS regression of the log of one plus equity issuance value on the interaction of the log of
portfolio equity inflows (predicted from the first stage) with the large equity issuer dummy. Large equity issuer is a dummy variable
equal to one if the firm is a large domestic equity issuer or a foreign equity issuer, and zero otherwise. A firm is classified as a large
domestic equity issuer if its time-average issuance value of domestic equity is greater than or equal to the median of all firms'
average issuances, within a country-sector. All variables are winsorized at the 1% level. First-stage standard errors are double
clustered at the country and year levels. Second-stage standard errors are block bootstrapped with 1000 repetitions, double
clustering at the country and year levels. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.
The regressions include 22 emerging market countries, excluding China, Brazil, and South Korea, over the period 1997-2014.

This table presents the second stage of firm-level panel instrumental variable regressions of the log of one plus firm characteristics on the interaction of log of portfolio equity inflows with the large equity
issuer dummy. Large equity issuer is a dummy variable equal to one if the firm is a large domestic equity issuer or a foreign equity issuer, and zero otherwise. A firm is classified as a large domestic equity issuer
if its time-average issuance value of domestic equity is greater than or equal to the median of all firms' average issuances, within a country-sector. We use the sum of other countries' equity issuance volumes as
the instrumental variable for portfolio equity inflows. The dependent variable firm characteristics are capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development expenditure, inventory, cash and short-term
investments, and reduction of long-term debt. All variables are winsorized at the 1% level. All Regressions include firm and country-year fixed effects. Standard errors are block bootstrapped with 1000
repetitions, double clustering at the country and year levels. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. The regressions include 25 emerging market countries over
the period 1990-2012. Only non-financial firms are considered in this analysis.

                                                   (Excluding Financial Firms)
This table presents firm-level panel OLS regressions for the use-of-funds analysis for the pooled sample of issuances by large domestic and foreign equity
issuers. Large domestic equity issuers are firms whose time-average domestic equity issuance value is greater than or equal to the median of all firms'
average issuances, within a country-sector. The analysis follows the specification of Kim and Weisbach (2008). The dependent variable for balance-sheet
variables (inventory or cash and short-term investments) is Y = log[((Vi - V0)/Assets) + 1]. The dependent variable for cash-flow statement and income
statement variables (capital expenditure, acquisitions, research and development expenditure, or reduction of long-term debt) is Y = log[(∑iVi/Assets) +
1]. Independent variables are equity issuance value and other sources of funds, normalized by total assets, in addition to the log of total assets. Total
assets are taken at the value of the year just before the issuance. Dollar changes capture the change in the dependent variable resulting from a one-million-
dollar increase in a firm’s equity issuance. All variables are winsorized at the 1% level. All regressions include country and year fixed effects. Standard
errors are clustered at the industry (two-digit SIC) level. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. The
regressions include 25 emerging market countries over the period 1990-2012. Only non-financial firms are considered in this analysis.

This table presents the second stage of firm-level panel instrumental variable regressions of the log of one plus firm characteristics on the interaction of log of portfolio equity inflows with the large equity
issuer dummy. Large equity issuer is a dummy variable equal to one if the firm is a large domestic equity issuer or a foreign equity issuer, and zero otherwise. A firm is classified as a large domestic equity issuer
if its time-average issuance value of domestic equity is greater than or equal to the median of all firms' average issuances, within a country-sector. We use the one-year lag of MSCI emerging market weights as
the instrumental variable for portfolio equity inflows. The dependent variable firm characteristics are capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development expenditure, inventory, cash and short-term
investments, and reduction of long-term debt. All variables are winsorized at the 1% level. All Regressions include firm and country-year fixed effects. Standard errors are block bootstrapped with 1000
repetitions, double clustering at the country and year levels. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. The regressions include 25 emerging market countries over
the period 1997-2012.
