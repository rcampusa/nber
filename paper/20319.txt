                                           ABSTRACT

We inject aggregate uncertainty – risk and ambiguity – into an otherwise standard business cycle model
and describe its consequences. We find that increases in uncertainty generally reduce consumption,
but they do not account, in this model, for either the magnitude or the persistence of the most recent
recession. We speculate about extensions that might do better along one or both dimensions.

1    Introduction

In the United States, the most recent recession was the most severe since the 1930s, and
it’s been followed by an unusually long recovery. We see how this played out in Figures 1
to 3, which are adapted from Bethune, Cooley, and Rupert (2014). The figures illustrate
the recession and recovery, relative to the previous peak, in output, consumption, and
investment over the last five recessions. Output, for example, hit a cyclical peak in the
fourth quarter of 2007, declined by about 4 percent over the next 6 quarters, and only
surpassed its previous peak 14 quarters later (Figure 1). The depth and duration are
greater than in any of the earlier recessions. The duration reflects both the depth of the
recession — it takes longer to dig your way out of a deeper hole — and a slower rate
of recovery. We see broadly similar behavior in consumption (Figure 2) and investment
(Figure 3). Consumption fell 3 percent and took 12 quarters to return to its previous level.
Nonresidential fixed investment fell almost 20 percent and took 24 quarters (6 years!) to
recover. Housing, of course, has yet to recover.

These patterns are familiar to all of us. The relative magnitudes are what we tell our
students: consumption falls less than output, and investment falls more. The same with
comovements: all three variables, and many more besides, declined together. The only
somewhat unusual feature here is the slow speed of recovery, particularly in investment.

Since the patterns are familiar, we might expect to account for them with some variant
of the Kydland-Prescott (1982) model, in which declines in productivity generate precisely
this collection of facts. The unusually large magnitude of the recession would reflect, in
this model, an unusually large drop in productivity. The problem with this account is that
measured productivity barely fell. We could document this in a number of ways, but the
simplest is to measure productivity by the ratio of output to hours worked. We see the
result in Figure 4 and in related work by Sprague (2014). Productivity was essentially flat
for six quarters until growth resumed, and at its lowest point was only one percent below
its peak.

But if productivity wasn’t the source of the last recession, what was? Yes, we know,
there was a financial crisis. But what shocks — or wedges — do we need to add to the
model to reproduce its effects? We have no shortage of candidates, but the leading one
right now is “uncertainty.” Among the many suggestions to this effect is a wonderful
comment from the European Commission (2013, page 7): “Economic theory suggests that
uncertainty has a detrimental effect on economic activity by giving agents the incentive to
postpone investment, consumption and employment decisions until uncertainty is resolved,
and by pushing up the cost of capital through increased risk premia.” Bloom (2013),
who has written extensively on uncertainty, adds: “The onset of the Great Recession was
accompanied by a massive surge in uncertainty. The size of this uncertainty shock was so
large it potentially accounted for around one third of the 9% drop in GDP versus trend
during 2008-2009.” At minimum, we observe strong countercyclical patterns in measures of
uncertainty that beg for explanation; see, for example, the evidence reported by Bachmann
and Bayer (2013) and Bloom, Floetotto, Jaimovich, Saporta, and Terry (2012).

With this motivation, we study uncertainty in a streamlined business cycle model and
ask: Can an increase in uncertainty account for the magnitude and persistence of the
last recession in this model? How does uncertainty affect the dynamics of consumption,
investment, and output? Does it interfere with traditional business cycle comovements,
in which all of these variables move up and down together? Can uncertainty account for
differences in the responses of consumption and investment during the latest recovery?

To answer these questions, we inject uncertainty into a streamlined version of the Kydland
and Prescott (1982) model with constant labor supply. We add three ingredients: recursive
preferences, a unit root in the aggregate productivity process, and several kinds of uncer-
tainty. Recursive preferences are a natural generalization of the additive preferences used
in most business cycle models. A large body of work suggests that their extra flexibility is
helpful in accounting for asset prices (Bansal and Yaron, 2004, for example) but has little
impact on the behavior of macroeconomic quantities (Tallarini, 2000). In this respect they
differ markedly from habit-based preferences, which affect both quantities and asset prices.
The unit root is essential to delivering realistic risk premiums. Without it, the asset with
the largest risk premium is a long-maturity bond (Alvarez and Jermann, 2005, Proposition
2), which is not what we see in the data.

The most important new ingredient is the third one: uncertainty. We specify stochastic pro-
cesses for the conditional mean and variance of aggregate productivity growth. Preferences
play a role here in the representative agent’s responses to these sources of uncertainty,
whether risk (where the probabilities are well understood) or ambiguity (where they’re
not). Typically greater aversion to uncertainty leads to stronger responses of consumption
to fluctuations in the conditional variance. We consider preferences toward risk, in which
the distribution of outcomes is understood by our representative agent, and ambiguity, in
which it is not.

We use these ingredients to assess the impact of uncertainty on the magnitude and persis-
tence of economic fluctuations. Consumption and investment decisions are functions of the
state, which here includes a state variable representing uncertainty. We find that consump-
tion typically falls when uncertainty rises, although there are parameter configurations in
which the reverse is true. The magnitude of the effect depends on both the IES and un-
certainty aversion. In this respect, recursive preferences are central to the transmission of


                                             2
uncertainty to the economy. The effects, however, are small: fluctuations in uncertainty
play a minor role in the model’s business cycle properties.

Does uncertainty interfere with business cycle comovements, the tendency for output, con-
sumption, and investment to move up and down together? Barro and King (1984) showed
that shocks to anything but productivity generate counterfactual comovements. Uncer-
tainty is one such shock. In our model, a change in uncertainty drives consumption and
investment in opposite directions. If the effect is strong enough, we lose the strong pro-
cyclicality of these variables that we see in the data. We find, however, that in models with
quasi-realistic parameter values, the productivity shocks dominate. In fact, the modest
decline in the correlations of consumption and investment with output brings the model
closer to the evidence.

Does uncertainty increase the persistence of economic fluctuations? The answer is no, but
it’s helpful to describe precisely how uncertainty affects decisions. We compute properties
of model economies with accurate numerical procedures, but we get sharper insights from
loglinear approximations analogous to Campbell’s (1994). We think the approximations
give us clarity about how uncertainty works that would be hard to come by otherwise.
And despite rumors to the contrary, such loglinear approximations are compatible with
uncertainty. These loglinear approximations have two striking properties:

• Tallarini property. Tallarini (2000) showed that in a model with an intertemporal elas-
  ticity of substitution (IES) of one, iid productivity growth, and constant uncertainty, the
  behavior of quantities is the same in models with recursive and additive preferences. We
  extend his result to a model with arbitrary IES and arbitrary linear dynamics in pro-
  ductivity growth: the behavior of quantities is affected by the IES but not uncertainty
  aversion. The result applies to loglinear approximations, but we find the approximations
  hard to distinguish from more accurate solutions.

• Separation property. The impact of uncertainty on dynamics is limited by what we call
  the separation property: the internal dynamics of the capital stock are independent of
  uncertainty and its properties. More precisely, the response of consumption and next
  period’s capital stock to today’s capital stock is independent of the shocks and their
  properties, including shocks to uncertainty. This is a standard feature of linear-quadratic
  models. It also applies to our loglinear approximations and, to a close approximation, to
  accurate numerical solutions of our models. One consequence is that uncertainty cannot
  account for an unusually slow recovery in this model except through persistence in the
  shock.

What’s the bottom line? The recursive business cycle model provides a mechanism through
which fluctuations in aggregate uncertainty affect the dynamics of aggregate quantities.


                                             3
This mechanism changes the magnitudes of, and correlations between, growth rates of
output, consumption, and investment. The effects, however, are small. We also find that
uncertainty has essentially no impact on the internal dynamics of the model: an increase in
uncertainty produces a more persistent decline in (say) consumption only if uncertainty is
itself persistent. We conclude not that uncertainty is irrelevant to business cycles, but that
any mechanism that produces a greater impact must operate through other channels.

A few words on notation: We use a number of conventions to keep it as simple as we
can. (i) For the most part, Greek letters are parameters and Latin letters are variables or
coefficients. (ii) We use t subscripts (xt , for example) to represent random variables and
the same letters without subscripts (x) to represent their means. Or, more commonly, log x
represents the mean of log xt rather than the log of the mean of xt . (iii) We also use t
subscripts to denote dependence of a function on the state. Thus f (xt ) might be denoted
ft . (iv) We use variable subscripts to denote derivatives; for example, fxt = ∂f (xt )/∂xt .
(v) The abbreviation iid means independent and identically distributed and NID(a, b) means
normally and independently distributed with mean a and variance b.


2     Risk

We approach uncertainty from the perspective of decision theory. We use the term risk
to describe random environments in which the distribution of outcomes is known. We use
ambiguity to describe environments in which some aspect of the distribution is unknown.
Uncertainty is an umbrella term that includes both risk and ambiguity. We consider risk
here and turn to ambiguity in Section 6.

2.1   Risk preference in static environments

Our treatment of risk is standard in macroeconomics and finance: the distribution over
outcomes is known (risk) and equal to the distribution that generates the data (rational
expectations).

To make this concrete, consider a static environment with a random state s and consumption
c(s) defined over it. Risk is a known nonconstant probability distribution over s, which
induces a distribution over c. We summarize attitude toward risk with a certainty equivalent
function, which transforms utility back into consumption units. More formally, the certainty
equivalent µ(c) is the level of constant consumption that delivers the same utility. If c is
constant, then µ(c) = c. If c is risky, then risk aversion is indicated by µ(c) < E(c). Some
common examples are described in Backus, Routledge, and Zin (2005, Section 3). We refer
to the log difference log E(c) − log µ(c) > 0 as a risk adjustment.


                                              4
We rely exclusively on the expected utility certainty equivalent,

                                    µ(c) = u−1 [Eu(c)] ,

for some increasing concave function u. The standard example in macroeconomics and
finance is power utility, u(c) = cα /α, which implies the certainty equivalent

                                     µ(c) = [E(cα )]1/α .                                   (1)

Here α < 1 and 1 − α > 0 is commonly referred to as the coefficient of relative risk aversion
(CRRA).

Most of our models are at least approximately loglinear with normal (Gaussian) uncertainty.
Neither is essential, but the combination gives us relatively simple certainty equivalents.
Suppose, for example, log c = s ∼ N (κ1 , κ2 ) (the log of consumption is normal with mean
κ1 and variance κ2 ). The log of the moment generating function for s is log E(eθs ) =
log E(cθ ) = θκ1 + θ2 κ2 /2. Therefore log E(c) = κ1 + κ2 /2, log E(cα ) = ακ1 + α2 κ2 /2, and
log µ(c) = κ1 + ακ2 /2. Risk aversion is implied by the risk adjustment log E(c) − log µ(c) =
(1 − α)κ2 /2 > 0.

2.2   Risk preference in dynamic environments

We follow standard practice and extend risk preference to dynamic environments with the
recursive technology developed by Kreps and Porteus (1978). Utility Ut from date t on has
the form

                                    Ut = V [ct , µt (Ut+1 )].                               (2)

Time preference is built into the time aggregator V and risk preference is built into the
certainty equivalent µt . The notation is intended to imply that ct and Ut are functions of st ,
the state at date t. The certainty equivalent is computed from the conditional distribution
of future states st+1 given current state st .

We assume throughout that the time aggregator V and certainty equivalent µt are homo-
geneous of degree one, which allows us to use them in environments that are stationary in
growth rates. We use the constant elasticity time aggregator suggested by Epstein and Zin
(1989),
                                                                           1/ρ
                      V [ct , µt (Ut+1 )] = [(1 − β)cρt + βµt (Ut+1 )ρ ]         ,          (3)

with 0 < β < 1 and ρ < 1. Here σ = 1/(1 − ρ) is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution
or IES: the elasticity of substitution between current consumption and the certainty equiv-
alent of future utility. If we use the power certainty equivalent function (1), the coefficient
of relative risk aversion is again 1 − α, but the risk in this case is to future utility.

                                                5
The time aggregator (3), like a certainty equivalent, expresses utility in consumption units.
Consider a constant consumption path ct+j = c for all j ≥ 0. Then Ut = Ut+1 = µt (Ut+1 ) =
c. Differences of Ut from current consumption ct reflect some combination of timing and
uncertainty in the path of future consumption.


3     A recursive business cycle model

We imbed these preferences in a business cycle model, a streamlined version of Kydland
and Prescott (1982). The model is conveniently summarized by a Bellman equation. We
describe the Bellman equation and show how it can be scaled to take into account growth
in productivity. Although risk premiums are not our focus, they provide a useful link to
related work in finance. We show how asset returns are related to a pricing kernel, which
in this model is the representative agent’s intertemporal marginal rate of substitution. We
also show how the maximum risk premium can be computed from the entropy of the pricing
kernel.

3.1   Model

Our benchmark model starts with recursive preferences: equation (2) with time aggregator
V and certainty equivalent function µt both homogeneous of degree one. Production uses
capital (kt ) and labor (nt ) inputs and leads to the law of motion

                                  kt+1 = f (kt , at nt ) − ct ,                              (4)

where f is also homogeneous of degree one and at is (labor) productivity. We fix labor
supply at one (nt = 1) and use a constant elasticity production function with constant
depreciation:

         f (kt , at nt ) = [ωktν + (1 − ω)(at nt )ν ]1/ν + (1 − δ)kt = yt + (1 − δ)kt ,      (5)

where ν < 1, 1/(1 − ν) is the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor, 0 < δ ≤ 1
is the depreciation rate, and yt is output. Investment is it = yt − ct .

The source of fluctuations in this model is a stochastic process for productivity growth. We
refer to its components as “news” and “risk.” Productivity growth gt = at /at−1 is tied to
a state vector xt by log gt = log g + e> xt , where e is an arbitrary vector of coefficients. The
vector xt has linear dynamics,
                                                      1/2
                                 xt+1 = Axt + Bvt w1t+1 ,                                    (6)

with {w1t } ∼ NID(0, I). If A = [0] then the conditional mean of log gt is constant. Otherwise
Axt adds a predictable component of future productivity: in a word, news.

                                               6
Risk is represented by stochastic volatility. The conditional variance vt (loosely speaking,
“volatility”) is a linear first-order autoregression,

                              vt+1 = (1 − ϕv )v + ϕv vt + τ w2t+1 ,                               (7)

with 0 < ϕv < 1 and {w2t } ∼ NID(0, 1) and independent of {w1t }. This gives positive
probability to negative conditional variances, but we choose parameter values that make
this probability tiny.

We find a competitive equilibrium as the solution to a planning problem: maximize utility
subject to the laws of motion for the state st = (kt , at , xt , vt ). The associated Bellman
equation is
                                             
                J(kt , at , xt , vt ) = max V c, µt [J(kt+1 , at+1 , xt+1 , vt+1 )]
                                               ct

subject to the laws of motion (4), at+1 = at gt+1 = at exp(log g + e> xt+1 ), (6), and (7).

Since V , µ, and f are all homogeneous of degree one, J is homogeneous of degree one in kt
and at . We can, therefore, divide the Bellman equation by at and express the problem in
terms of scaled variables, k̃t = kt /at and c̃t = ct /at . The scaled Bellman equation is
                                              
                 J(k̃t , 1, xt , vt ) = max V c̃, µt [gt+1 J(k̃t+1 , 1, xt+1 , vt+1 )]    (8)
                                             c̃t

subject to the laws of motion. Similar logic gives us a scaled law of motion for k̃t ,

                                       gt+1 k̃t+1 = f (k̃t , 1) − c̃t .                           (9)

From here on, we drop the 1 and write the value function as J(k̃t , xt , vt ).

We find it convenient to work with the log of J. With the constant elasticity time aggregator
(3), we can rewrite (8) as

       log J(k̃t , xt , vt ) = max ρ−1 log (1 − β)c̃ρ + βµt [gt+1 J(k̃t+1 , xt+1 , vt+1 )]ρ . (10)
                                          
                                 c̃t

In the limiting case of ρ = 0 — and intertemporal elasticity of substitution σ = 1/(1−ρ) = 1
— we have

          log J(k̃t , xt , vt ) = max (1 − β) log c̃ + β log µt [gt+1 J(k̃t+1 , xt+1 , vt+1 )].
                                       c̃t

Additive models generally work instead with J ρ /ρ,

          J(k̃t , xt , vt )ρ /ρ = max (1 − β)c̃ρ /ρ + βµt [gt+1 J(k̃t+1 , xt+1 , vt+1 )]ρ /ρ,
                                       c̃t

which also follows from (8). If we redefine the value function as Jbt = Jtρ /ρ and set α = ρ
                                                                        ρ
(the additive case), the second term becomes µt (gt+1 Jt+1 )ρ /ρ = Et (gt+1 Jbt ). We use this in
Appendix C.

                                                      7
3.2   Asset pricing fundamentals

The properties of asset returns in our model depend, in large part, on the marginal rate
of substitution of the agent. In general no-arbitrage environments, there exists a positive
pricing kernel mt+1 that satisfies the asset pricing relation
                                                 
                                    Et mt+1 rt+1 = 1

for gross returns rt+1 on all assets. In representative agent models such as ours, the pricing
kernel is the marginal rate of substitution and the equation is one of the agent’s first-order
conditions. With recursive preferences, the marginal rate of substitution is

                                          ct+1 ρ−1
                                                              α−ρ
                                                        Ut+1
                          mt+1 = β                                    .
                                           ct         µt (Ut+1 )
See Appendix A. The first term is familiar from additive power utility. The next one is
what we might term the Epstein-Zin term; it reflects the non-additivity of preferences over
time and across states. It disappears if we set ρ = α, which sends us back to the additive
case.

A solution of our model includes a stochastic process for consumption that we can use to
compute asset prices and, more commonly, risk premiums such as the equity premium. We
use the maximum risk premium as an indicator of how risk is priced. The maximum risk
premium is related to the entropy of the pricing kernel. The return on a one-period (riskfree)
           1
bond is rt+1   = 1/Et (mt+1 ). The return rt+1 with the highest log expectation Et (log rt+1 )
is rt+1 = 1/mt+1 . The (logarithmic) risk premium on an arbitrary asset with return rt+1
                       1 ). The maximum risk premium follows from the maximum expected
is Et (log rt+1 − log rt+1
return:
                                               1
                           Et (log rt+1 − log rt+1 ) ≤ Lt (mt+1 ),

where Lt (mt+1 ) = log Et (mt+1 ) − Et (log mt+1 ) is the conditional entropy of the pricing
kernel. See Alvarez and Jermann (2005, Proposition 2) and Backus, Chernov, and Zin
(2014, Section I). Taking expectations of both sides gives us the entropy bound:
                                            1
                          E(log rt+1 − log rt+1 ) ≤ E[Lt (mt+1 )].                       (11)

The object on the right is the largest risk premium that can be generated by this pricing
kernel.


4     Risk in the recursive Brock-Mirman example

Now that we have a handle on risk, we can explore its impact on the properties of business
cycle models. We start with a textbook standard, to which we add a number of bells and

                                              8
whistles. None of the bells and whistles affect the decision rule for consumption, so you
might ask why we bothered. We do it to illustrate some general properties in an example
we can solve with pen and paper.

4.1    Model and solution

What’s come to be known as the Brock-Mirman example shows up in most introductions to
dynamic programming for economists, including Ljunqvist and Sargent (2000, Chapter 4,
Appendix B). In the notation of the previous section, it consists of additive preferences (ρ =
α), log utility (ρ = 0, corresponding to IES σ = 1), Cobb-Douglas technology (f (a, k) =
k ω a1−ω with 0 ≤ ω < 1), and one hundred percent depreciation (δ = 1). With this structure,
the value function and decision rule are loglinear. See, for example, Appendix B. The same
is true of the recursive version, where we allow the risk aversion parameter α to take on
nonzero values in the certainty equivalent function (1).

The Bellman equation for this recursive Brock-Mirman example is

           log J(k̃t , xt , vt ) = max (1 − β) log c̃ + β log µt [gt+1 J(k̃t+1 , xt+1 , vt+1 )]
                                     c̃t

subject to (9), (6), and (7). Equation (9) in this case is gt+1 k̃t+1 = f (k̃t , 1) − c̃t = k̃tω − c̃t .
When ω = 0, we have the Bansal-Yaron (2004) asset pricing model with ρ = 0.

We find the solution by guess and verify. We guess the value function is loglinear:

                         log J(k̃t , xt , vt ) = p0 + pk log k̃t + p>
                                                                    x xt + p v vt

with coefficients (p0 , pk , px ) to be determined. Next we substitute the laws of motion into
next period’s value function and evaluate the certainty equivalent:

  log[gt+1 J(k̃t+1 , xt+1 , vt+1 )] = (1 − pk )(log g + e> xt+1 ) + p0 + pk log(k̃tω − c̃t ) + p>
                                                                                                x xt+1 + pv vt+1
                                    = p0 + (1 − pk ) log g + pv (1 − ϕv )v + pk log(k̃tω − c̃t )
                                                                            1/2
                                           + [(1 − pk )e + px ]> (Axt + Bvt w1t+1 ) + pv [ϕv vt + τ 1/2 w2t+1 ]
log µt [gt+1 J(k̃t+1 , xt+1 , vt+1 )] = p0 + (1 − pk ) log g + pv (1 − ϕv )v + pk log(k̃tω − c̃t )
                                           + [(1 − pk )e + px ]> Axt + [αVx /2 + pv ϕv ]vt + αp2v τ /2,

where Vx = [(1 − pk )e + px ]> BB > [(1 − pk )e + px ]. Note the risk adjustment αVx /2 in the
certainty equivalent, it’s central to how risk works in such models and shows how the risk
parameter α magnifies its effect.

If we substitute the certainty equivalent into the Bellman equation, the first order condition

                                   (1 − β)/c̃t = βpk /(k̃tω − c̃t )

                                                      9
gives us the decision rule

                               c̃t = {(1 − β)/[βpk + (1 − β)]}k̃tω .

Traditionally we would substitute this back into the Bellman equation and solve for pk .
Here there’s a simpler method. The envelope condition for k̃t gives us the decision rule

                                        c̃t = (1 − βω)k̃tω .

The controlled law of motion is therefore gt+1 k̃t+1 = k̃tω − c̃t = βω k̃tω .

If we substitute the decision rule into the Bellman equation and line up terms, we find

       pk = (1 − β)ω/(1 − βω)
       p>
        x = β(1 − pk )e> A(I − βA)−1
       pv = β(α/2)Vx /(1 − βϕv )
(1 − β)p0 = (1 − β) log(1 − βω) + β(1 − pk ) log g + βpv (1 − ϕv )v + βpk log(βω) + βα(pv )2 τ /2.

The coefficient pk is between zero and one, which makes J(k̃t , xt , vt ) increasing and concave
in k̃t . The coefficient px captures the predictability of log productivity growth: if A = 0,
so that productivity growth is unpredictable, then px = 0 as well. And if α < 0, as we’ll
typically assume, then pv < 0: an increase in vt lowers utility.

4.2    Qualitative properties

This model has a number of features of general interest. Among them:

• Loglinear solution. If we were searching for a loglinear decision rule, something like

                             log c̃t = hc0 + hck log k̃t + h>
                                                            cx xt + hcv vt ,               (12)

  then we’ve found it: hc0 = log(1 − βω) and hcv = ω. Note that hcx = hcv = 0: neither
  news xt nor risk vt affects scaled consumption. The controlled law of motion is similar:

                             log k̃t+1 = log(βω) + ω log k̃t − log gt+1 .                  (13)

  Loglinearity allows us to define the steady state in a simple and useful way. We use
  the term steady state to refer to the mean log of a variable. The steady state value of
  k̃, for example, is log k̃ = E(log k̃t ) = log(βω/g)/(1 − ω). That implies a steady state
  capital-output ratio of log k̃ − log ỹ = (1 − ω) log k̃ = log(βω/g). This last expression
  contains a result we use later: the discount factor β can be used to adjust the steady
  state capital-output ratio.


                                                 10
• Tallarini property. It’s evident from the decision rule and controlled law of motion that
  quantities don’t depend on risk aversion. This is an illustration of Tallarini’s (2000)
  result: to a loglinear approximation, the decision rules, and therefore the properties of
  quantities, are approximately the same with additive (α = ρ) and recursive (arbitrary
  α) preferences. Here the result is exact. The risk aversion parameter α affects the value
  function (see p0 ), but not the dynamics of consumption, capital (=investment), or output.
  In this respect the extension to recursive preferences is a waste of time.

• Separation property. The Brock-Mirman example, like most dynamic programs, includes
  both endogenous (k̃t ) and exogenous (xt , vt ) state variables. Anderson, Hansen, McGrat-
  tan, and Sargent (1996, Sections 2 and 3) show that in analogous linear-quadratic control
  problems, the components of the solution separate: the coefficients of the endogenous
  state variables in the value function and decision rules do not depend on the properties
  of the exogenous state variables and can be computed separately.
  This problem has a similar feature. The coefficients pk = (1 − β)ω/(1 − βω) in the value
  function and hck = ω in the decision rule do not depend on the parameters governing
  the dynamics of (xt , vt ). Similarly, the slope of the controlled law of motion (13) is
  independent of the shocks. If we plot log k̃t+1 against log k̃t for given values of (xt , vt , gt+1 ),
  the separation property tells us that slope is the same for all values of these other variables.
  That’s clearly the case here, where the slope is ω.
  Now think about this in the context of our problem. If we want to generate a slow
  recovery with risk, we have only two options: make risk more persistent or break the
  separation property.

• Asset prices. This is in Tallarini (2000), too: although quantities do not depend on α,
  asset prices and risk premiums do. In this case the pricing kernel has these components:

                          log(c̃t+1 /c̃t ) = ω log(βω) + ω(ω − 1) log k̃t − ω log gt+1
                          log(ct+1 /ct ) = log(c̃t+1 /c̃t ) + log gt+1
                                          = ω log(βω) + (1 − ω) log g + ω(ω − 1) log k̃t
                                                                                   1/2
                                              + (1 − ω)e> Axt + (1 − ω)e> Bvt w1t+1
                                                                     1/2
         log[gt+1 Jt+1 /µt (gt+1 Jt+1 )] = [(1 − pk )e + px ]> Bvt w1t+1 + pv τ 1/2 w2t+1
                                              − (α/2)Vx vt − (α/2)(pv )2 τ.

  The pricing kernel is therefore

        log mt+1 = log β − log(ct+1 /ct ) + α log[gt+1 Jt+1 /µt (gt+1 Jt+1 )]
                    = log β − ω log(βω) − (1 − ω) log g − α(α/2)(pv )2 τ
                         − ω(ω − 1) log k̃t − (1 − ω)e> Axt − α(α/2)Vx vt
                                                           >   1/2
                         + α[(1 − pk )e + px ] − (1 − ω)e Bvt w1t+1 + αpv τ 1/2 w2t+1 .
                           


                                                  11
    Conditional on the state at date t, most of this is constant. All the variation comes from
    the last two terms.
    The entropy bound (11) gives us the maximum risk premium:

                                Lt (mt,t+1 ) = (1/2)[Vm vt + (αpv )2 τ ],

    with
                                                        >
                                                            BB > α[(1 − pk )e + px ] − (1 − ω)e .
                                                               
           Vm =        α[(1 − pk )e + px ] + (1 − ω)e

    Both terms are affected by α. In a typical case, if we increase risk aversion (meaning larger
    negative values of α) risk premiums go up, even though the dynamics of consumption are
    the same. This mirrors Tallarini, where risk premiums are affected by risk aversion, but
    consumption is not.

Returning to the subject of the paper: introducing stochastic volatility to this economy has
no impact on the decision rules for consumption or (implicitly) investment or on the speed
at which the capital stock returns to its steady state value. It’s not all that helpful, then,
in giving us a mechanism through which risk can affect either the magnitude or persistence
of macroeconomic fluctuations.


5     Risk in the recursive business cycle model

The Brock-Mirman example is illustrative, but its simplicity is misleading. If we change
the technology or allow the IES to differ from one, the role of uncertainty changes and the
model isn’t nearly as tractable. It is, however, solvable by loglinear approximation methods
not much different from Campbell’s (1994). It can also be solved, of course, by any number
of numerical methods, but a loglinear approximation has the advantage of transparency:
we can see exactly how it works and which features determine its properties. We do both:
describe the properties of a loglinear approximation and quantify the model’s properties
with a more accurate numerical solution.

5.1     Model and solution

The recursive business cycle model consists of the Bellman equation (10), the certainty
equivalent (1), and the laws of motion (9), (6), and (7). The first-order and envelope
conditions are

                0 = Jt−ρ (1 − β)c̃ρ−1 − βµt (gt+1 Jt+1 )ρ−α Et [(gt+1 Jt+1 )α−1 Jkt+1 ]
                        
                                  t
           Jkt /Jt = Jt−ρ βµt (gt+1 Jt+1 )ρ−α Et [(gt+1 Jt+1 )α−1 Jkt+1 ]fkt .                      (14)


                                                   12
Together they imply
                                 (1 − β)c̃ρ−1
                                          t   = Jtρ−1 Jkt /fkt .                               (15)
This is similar to what we’d get in the additive model. The resemblance is closer if we
transform the value function, as we did at the end of Section 3.1. If we define the tranformed
value function by Jbt = Jtρ /ρ, its derivative is Jbkt = Jtρ−1 Jkt . We see, then, that the decision
rule — the solution of (15) — depends on the derivative of the (transformed) value function
but not on the value function itself. That’s a general feature of additive dynamic programs
with continuous control variables. It’s not true of the recursive model, where the first-order
and envelope conditions involve the value function as well as its derivative.

We gain some insight into the model from computing loglinear appproximations to the
solution. The idea is to take functions that are not loglinear and nevertheless approximate
them by loglinear functions. We’ll see that this works amazingly well for models of the kind
studied here. The approximations involve derivatives at a point, which in our case is the
steady state, defined earlier as the mean of the log.

As an illustration, consider an arbitrary positive function f of a positive random variable
xt . A linear approximation in logs around the point xt = x is
                         log f (xt ) = log f + (fx x/f )(log xt − log x).
Typically we ignore the intercept and write this as log f (xt ) = (fx x/f ) log xt . Similarly,
with two variables we have log f (xt , yt ) = (fx x/f ) log xt + (fy y/f ) log yt . An example we
use repeatedly is the marginal product of capital fkt = fk (k̃t , 1), which we approximate by
                           log fkt = (fkk k̃/fk ) log k̃t = λr log k̃t .                       (16)
This is the gross return at date t on one unit of capital invested at t − 1. Another is the
law of motion (4), which we approximate by
                      log k̃t+1 = (fk /g) log k̃t − (c̃/k̃g) log c̃t − e> xt+1
                                 = λk log k̃t − λc log c̃t − e> xt+1 .                         (17)
The notation and approach should be familiar from Campbell (1994).

We apply similar methods to our dynamic programming problem and derive a loglinear
approximation to the consumption decision rule and controlled law of motion for capital.
In the additive case, we reproduce Campbell’s approximation; see Appendix C. We derive
an analogous approximation for the recursive case in Appendix D. The result is a decision
rule of the form (12) for consumption and a similar approximation to the controlled law of
motion,
                   log k̃t+1 = hk0 + hkk log k̃t + h>
                                                    kx xt + hkv vt − log gt+1 .                (18)
The primary difference from (13) is the possibility of nonzero values for hkx and hkv .

                                                13
5.2   Qualitative properties

We leave the calculations to Appendix D, but summarize the features of the loglinear
approximation in a proposition:

Proposition. If we hold constant the steady state capital-output ratio, the loglinear ap-
proximation to the solution is block triangular:

(a) The coefficients (hck , hkk ) in (12,18) governing dependence of the decision rule and
    controlled law of motion on the current capital stock are independent of the risk aversion
    parameter α and of the properties of the shocks (xt , vt ) to news and risk.

(b) The analogous coefficients (hcx , hkx ) of the news shock xt are independent of the risk
    parameter α and of the properties of the shock vt to risk.

To see how the loglinear approximation works, consider the equations for capital. We make
the loglinear guess

                          log(Jtρ−1 Jk,t ) = qk log k̃t + qx> xt + qv vt

for coefficients (qk , qx , qv ) to be determined. Then (15) and (17) give us

                                  hck = −σ(qk − λr )
                                 hkk = λk + σλc (qk − λr ).

These equations and the combined first-order and envelope condition (15) imply the Riccati-
like equation for qk :

                             qk = qk [λk + σλc (qk − λr )] + λr .

As we note in the proposition, none of this depends on risk aversion or the properties of the
shocks.

Thus we have:

• Tallarini property. Without variation in risk — that is, with τ = 0 in equation (7) — the
  loglinear approximations of the decision rule and controlled law of motion are identical
  in the additive and recursive models. Recursive preferences are irrelevant here to the
  behavior of quantities. This generalizes Tallarini’s result to economies with arbitrary
  IES and arbitrary linear dynamics for log productivity growth. Similar examples run
  throughout Hansen and Sargent (2007).




                                               14
• Separation property. The internal dynamics of the capital stock — namely, the coefficient
  hkk in (18) — are independent of the shocks. Similarly, the dynamics induced by news
  — namely, hkx — are independent of risk vt and risk aversion α. The relevant equations
  here are

                       h>
                        x = −σqx>
                                                                 −1
                       qx> = −(σ −1 + qk )e> A (1 − σqk λc )I − A .
                                              


  Not only are recursive preferences irrelevant here, but there’s no impact of risk on the
  decision rule other than the direct one.

Risk does matter in this model, but only through its direct impact on consumption, sum-
marized by the coefficients hcv and hkv . We turn next to the magnitude of this impact.

5.3   Quantitative properties

We can get a sense of the magnitude of the impact of risk if we choose specific parameter
values. We compute numerical examples, rather than carefully calibrated models, but
most of the parameter values have a history in the literature. We report them in Table 1
without further comment. We then compute properties of the model using a piecewise linear
approximation to the value function over a fine grid for the capital stock. Experiments with
finer grids and higher-order splines suggest that our calculations are extremely accurate.

So what do we find? We find, first, that the loglinear approximation is very good. If we
plot log k̃t+1 against log k̃t over the range of values generated by the model, the solution
produced by our numerical procedure is indistinguishable from the loglinear approximation
(18). See Figure 5. The same is true of the Tallarini and separation properties: they’re not
exact, but they’re very good approximations.

Now consider the impact of risk. In Figure 6 we show the responses of (the logarithms of)
capital and consumption to a unit increase in the innovation w2t in the conditional variance
vt . The effect is small. A two standard deviation (of vt ) increase would be roughly six
times larger. We see that the unit increase reduces consumption by a small amount in the
benchmark case; roughly 0.02. If we increase risk aversion to 1 − α = 50, this rises to 0.1.
Multiplying by six, we would get a little more than a half percent decrease in consumption
from a two standard deviation increase in risk. This is a noticeable effect, but it’s not hard
to see that the model needs help to generate an impact as large as we saw in 2008, or even
a substantial fraction of it.

We report business cycle properties of various parameter choices in Table 2. The statistics
summarized in the table also suggest that the impact of uncertainty fluctuations is small in

                                             15
this model. The first column of the table includes a summary of the evidence taken from
Tallarini (2000, Table 6). The statistics are based on (continuously-compounded) growth
rates rather than some kind of filtered object, but the properties are familiar: the standard
deviation of consumption is smaller, and the standard deviation of investment larger, than
that of output. And both consumption and investment are positively correlated with output,
although the correlations are smaller than we would see with (say) Hodrick-Prescott filtered
variables.

The properties of models are broadly similar to the data, although the differences in standard
deviations are smaller in the models and the correlations are larger. More relevant to
us is the role of uncertainty shocks. Column (3) summarizes the model with benchmark
parameter values. Column (2) shows us that it’s not much different from the additive case.
Column (5) shows how it changes when we eliminate variation in risk: hardly at all. We
get a larger difference when we increase risk aversion to 1 − α = 50; column (4). As we have
seen, this increases the impact of fluctuations in uncertainty, but even in this case the effect
is modest. Changing the IES has a bigger effect on business cycle statistics, but uncertainty
shocks have little to do with this. When we increase the IES to 1.5, as we do in column
(6), the standard deviation of consumption growth falls. If this seems counterintuitive,
see Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer (2010, Figure 1B). The long-term effect of a shock on
consumption is the same for all values of the IES, but the short-term effect is not.

We also see the impact of risk aversion on risk premiums noted by Tallarini. Here the
maximum risk premium is the entropy bound (11), reported at the bottom of the table.
When we increase risk aversion from 1 − α = 2 in column (2) to 50 in column (4), the
maximum risk premium increases from 0.02 percent (per quarter) to 16 percent.

6     Ambiguity

We use the term ambiguity to describe situations in which the decision maker does not
know some aspect of the distribution of outcomes. Whether it’s a parameter or a state
variable is in large part a matter of language. The critical aspect of ambiguity is that
it’s treated differently in preferences than risk. Our treatment of ambiguity is built on
the smooth ambiguity foundation laid by Hayashi and Miao (2011), Jahan-Parvar and Liu
(2012), Ju and Miao (2012), and especially Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji (2005, 2009).
We find it more user-friendly than more popular approaches built on maxmin expected
utility, although others may feel that it leaves out something essential.

6.1   Smooth ambiguity in static environments

Consider ambiguity in a static setting with two sources of uncertainty, s = (s1 , s2 ). Con-
sumption outcomes are defined over them by c(s) = c(s1 , s2 ). The sources of uncertainty

                                              16
are, first, the distribution of s1 conditional on s2 and, second, the distribution over s2 .
There’s no difference between s1 and s2 at this level of generality, but in applications s2 is
often a parameter or a hidden state.

We denote the expectations based on these distributions by E1 and E2 , respectively, and the
overall expectation by E = E2 E1 . More explicitly, the various expectations of an arbitrary
function f (s1 , s2 ) might be expressed by

               E1 [f (s1 , s2 )] = E[f (s1 , s2 )|s2 ]
                                                                              
                E[f (s1 , s2 )] = E2 E[f (s1 , s2 )|s2 ] = E2 E1 [f (s1 , s2 )] .

The second line follows from the law of iterated expectations.

With smooth ambiguity, we allow different “smooth” preferences over these two sources of
uncertainty. The certainty equivalent has two parts,

                                       µ(c) = µ2 [µ1 (c)],

where

                                    µ1 (c) = u−1 E1 u(c)
                                                        

                                µ2 [µ1 (c)] = v −1 E2 v[µ1 (c)] .
                                                               


These functions exhibit risk aversion if u is concave and ambiguity aversion if v ◦ u−1 is
concave — roughly speaking, if v is more concave than u. The power utility versions are
                                        1/α                                   1/γ
                                E1 (cα )                          E2 [µ1 (c)γ ]
                               
                  µ1 (c) =                   ,    µ2 [µ1 (c)] =                          (19)

with parameters α < 1 and γ ≤ α. We refer to 1 − α as risk aversion and 1 − γ as
ambiguity aversion. The latter is slightly misleading, given that ambiguity aversion requires
1 − γ > 1 − α, but it’s clearer than the alternatives that cross our minds. If γ = α, (19)
reduces to expected utility:
                                                              1/α         1/α
                                                  E2 E1 (cα )      = E(cα )
                                                                    
                  µ(c) = µ2 [µ1 (c)] =                                          .

Alternatively, if we drive γ to minus infinity we get the popular maxmin expected utility.
For values of γ between minus infinity and α, the smooth ambiguity model captures the
idea of model uncertainty in a user-friendly way.

Example (continued). We illustrate the impact of ambiguity aversion in two variants of
our example from Section 2.1. (i) Ambiguous mean. We express ambiguity over the mean
with a two-part distribution. Part 1: Conditional on s2 , log c = s1 ∼ N (s2 , κ2 ). Part
2: s2 ∼ N (κ1 , ν). The first certainty equivalent is log µ1 (c) = s2 + ακ2 /2. The overall

                                                   17
certainty equivalent is log µ(c) = log µ2 [µ1 (c)] = κ1 + γν/2 + ακ2 /2. The mean satisfies
log E(c) = κ1 + κ2 + ν/2, so the adjustment for risk is (1 − α)κ2 /2 and the adjustment
for ambiguity is (1 − γ)ν/2. (ii) Ambiguous variance. Part 1: conditional on s2 , log c =
s1 ∼ N (κ1 , s2 ). Part 2: s2 ∼ N (ν1 , ν2 ). The variance is normal and therefore negative
with positive probability, which is impossible but analytically convenient. The certainty
equivalents are log µ1 (c) = κ1 + αs2 /2. and log µ2 [µ1 (c)] = κ1 + αν1 /2 + γ(α/2)2 ν2 /2.
Evidently there’s no clean separation here between the adjustments for risk and ambiguity.

6.2   Smooth ambiguity in dynamic environments

We follow Hayashi and Miao (2011) and imbed preference toward risk and ambiguity in the
traditional recursive utility setup summarized by equation (3).

The action is in the certainty equivalent function µt . The main issue in applications is how
we distinguish between risk and ambiguity. We associate risk with components of the state
we observe (s1t ) and ambiguity with components we do not observe (s2t ). Aversion to risk
and ambiguity are built into the certainty equivalent functions µ1t and µ2t , respectively:
                                 µt (Ut+1 ) = µ2t [µ1t (Ut+1 )].
Here the subscript t refers to the information set at date t, typically the complete history
of observable states s1t . The inner certainty equivalent µ1t is computed from the distribu-
tion over s1t+1 conditional on this history and on the unobserved state s2t+1 . The outer
certainty equivalent µ2t is the conditional distribution over s2t+1 given the same history.
By assumption, we have stronger aversion to the latter than the former. We use the same
power certainty equivalent functions we used in equation (19).

The marginal rate of substitution now includes an additional term:
                         ct+1 ρ−1
                                                    α−ρ                    γ−α
                                           Ut+1                 µ1t (Ut+1 )
          mt+1 = β                                                                   .   (20)
                           ct        µ2t [µ1t (Ut+1 )]        µ2t [µ1t (Ut+1 )]
If γ = α the last term drops out, and if α = ρ as well we’re back to additive utility.

7     Risk and ambiguity in a business cycle model
We construct three examples of business cycle models with both risk and ambiguity. The
models are like the one in Section 5 except for the stochastic process for productivity growth
and the certainty equivalent functions. All of them have ambiguity over the conditional
mean of log productivity growth, but they differ in whether the amount of ambiguity varies
over time. The structure and properties are similar to our model with risk. More specif-
ically, their loglinear approximations have the same structure block triangular structure
summarized in the proposition of Section 5.2. Nevertheless, we find ambiguity interesting
enough to make it worth working through the details.

                                               18
7.1    A model with constant volatility

The simplest example has ambiguity over the conditional mean. The process for (log)
productivity growth changes from (6,7) to

                             log gt+1 = log g + xt+1 + τ1 w1t+1
                                 xt+1 = ϕx xt + τ2 w2t+1 ,

with (w1t , w2t ) independent iid standard normal random variables. The state here is
(s1t , s2t ) = (log gt , xt ). The agent observes log gt but not xt , making τ1 w1t the forecast
error of log gt conditional on xt . Therefore, in the first equation the agent treats w1t+1 as
risky and xt+1 as ambiguous. Risk is constant. Ambiguity depends on what we can learn
about xt+1 from observations of log gt .

This is a standard filtering problem with “state” xt and “measurement” log gt . At each
date t, given the history of productivity growth to that date, the agent’s distribution over
xt is normal with (say) mean x bt and variance bt . Starting with arbitrary values (b
                                                                                    x0 , b0 ), we
compute them recursively:

                          θt = bt /(bt + τ12 )
                       bt+1 = τ22 + θt ϕ2x τ12
                       bt+1 = ϕx (1 − θt )b
                       x                  xt + ϕx θt (log gt+1 − log g).

At the same date t, the distribution of xt+1 conditional on the history to date is normal
with mean ϕx xbt and variance bt+1 . Note, too, that the conditional variance is deterministic.
It converges (rapidly in practice) to a constant, which is what we assume here. In short,
this example generates ambiguity, reflected in bt+1 , but once we’ve converged the amount
of ambiguity is constant.

Now that we’ve solved the filtering problem, we apply the two-part certainty equivalent.
Risk preference applies to τ12 , the variance of log gt+1 conditional on (the unobserved) xt+1 .
Ambiguity applies to bt+1 , the standard deviation of xt+1 conditional on the history of
productivity growth. Other than the initial dynamics of bt , risk and ambiguity are constant.

We can plug this into our business cycle model and solve as before. The full-information
state here is (k̃t , xt ), but the effective state is (k̃t , x
                                                             bt ). The scaled Bellman equation is
(8) with the appropriate modification of the state and certainty equivalent function. The
first-order and envelope conditions become

      (1 − β)c̃ρ−1
               t   = Jtρ−1 Jkt
         Jtρ−1 Jkt = βµ2t (µ1t )ρ−γ E2t µ1t (gt+1 Jt+1 )γ−α E1t (gt+1 Jt+1 )α−1 Jkt+1 fkt . (21)
                                                                                   


                                                 19
A loglinear approximation still satisfies the proposition of Section 5.2. And with risk and
ambiguity constant, neither affects the dynamics of quantities. See Appendix E.

This example is helpful is showing how we might distinguish between risk and ambiguity,
but since both are constant they contribute nothing to business cycles. The next step is to
introduce variation in the quantity of ambiguity.

7.2   Models with stochastic volatility

Our next two examples have stochastic variation in the quantity of ambiguity (its conditional
variance) and in this respect has a broadly similar flavor to Ilut and Schneider (2014).

In Model I, risk and ambiguity are stochastic. Productivity growth is
                                               1/2            1/2
                      log gt+1 = log g + τ1 vt w1t+1 + τ2 vt w2t+1
                          vt+1 = (1 − ϕv )v + ϕv vt + τv w3t+1 ,

where (w1t , w2t , w3t ) are independent standard normal. We also set τ12 + τ22 = 1, a normal-
ization that makes the unconditional variance of log gt equal to v. Relative to the previous
model, we have introduced stochastic volatility. We also eliminated dynamics in the con-
ditional mean (ϕx = 0), so that xt+1 = τ2 w2t+1 . The agent observes log gt and vt , but not
the components of productivity growth w1t and w2t , so that w1t represents risk and w2t
represents ambiguity. The parameters τ1 and τ2 control their magnitudes. Since both are
                 1/2
multiplied by vt , risk and ambiguity vary together.

The model is similar to the previous one with state (k̃t , vt ). The first-order and envelope
conditions don’t change. We compute numerical solutions by other methods, but a loglinear
approximation is again instructive. In particular, the solution still exhibits the separation
property: the parameters governing the shocks and uncertainty aversion affect only the
loading on volatility vt . See Appendix E.

In Model II, only ambiguity is stochastic. Productivity growth is
                                                              1/2
                      log gt+1 = log g + τ1 v 1/2 w1t+1 + τ2 vt w2t+1
                          vt+1 = (1 − ϕv )v + ϕv vt + τv w3t+1 ,

where (w1t , w2t , w3t ) are independent standard normal and τ12 + τ22 = 1 (a normalization).
The change is that risk is now constant Relative to the previous model, we have eliminated
dynamics in the conditional mean (ϕx = 0) and introduced stochastic volatility. Let us say
that the agent observes log gt and vt but not the components of productivity growth w1t
and w2t . The idea is that w1t represents risk and w2t represents ambiguity. Since the latter
is multiplied by vt , ambiguity is no longer constant.

                                             20
The loglinear approximation to the solution has the same form as the proposition. In
particular, the coefficient hkk is independent of risk and ambiguity aversion. The coefficient
of the conditional variance, for example, is

                     qv = qk hkv + qv ϕv + [(ρ − γ)γ + (γ − 1)2 ]τ22 /2.

We see here that we can make the response to variance shocks solely an artifact of ambiguity
aversion through the parameter γ. See Appendix E.

Both of these models generate ambiguity that varies randomly through time. In this respect
they’re similar to earlier work by Ilut and Schneider (2014) and Jahan-Parvar and Liu
(2012). Ilut and Schneider model ambiguity with a dynamic version of maxmin expected
utility. They posit exogenous variation in the worst-case probability distribution, just as
we posit exogenous variation in the conditional variance. Jahan-Parvar and Liu adopt an
environment closer to our first example. They have a world that alternates between two
“states” and solve a nonlinear filtering problem to determine the probabilities over the two
states for each history. This mechanism generates endogenous variation in the conditional
variance as the probabilities change.

We report quantitative properties of these two models in Table 3. Column (1) is again US
data. Columns (2) to (5) refer to Model I. We see that the impact of risk and ambiguity
on quantities is small regardless. We also see that while ambiguity has little impact on
quantities, it has a larger impact on asset prices. The impact on quantities is slightly larger
if we increase ambiguity aversion from 1 − γ = 30 to 50. Columns (6) and (7) refer to Model
II, in which ambiguity varies but risk is constant. The impact is larger when ambiguity
plays a greater role [Column (6)]. This reflects, in part, our choice of parameters, in which
ambiguity is limited by the amount of the observed variance of productivity growth.


8    Discussion

We have described how aggregate uncertainty affects the dynamics of quantities in a tra-
ditional business cycle model. The short answer: The impact is small. A longer answer:
Variations in uncertainty in this model have, for reasonable parameter values, a small effect
on consumption, investment, and output. They have no effect on the internal dynamics of
the capital stock: the speed at which the economy recovers from a temporary increase in
uncertainty. Prolonged uncertainty could generate a prolonged recession on its own, but
the evidence suggests that this hasn’t been the case in the US. As a result, the model can-
not account for either the magnitude or the persistence of the most recent recession with
uncertainty.



                                              21
If uncertainty does little in this model, could other mechanisms produce larger, more persis-
tent effects? We review related work and go on to explore alternatives that we think could
lead to a more central role of uncertainty in business cycle dynamics.

8.1   Related work

We are hardly the first to explore the role of aggregate uncertainty in business cycle dy-
namics and the methods used to compute solutions to such models. We summarize some
of the most prominent contributions below, organized by topic.

Computation. We’ve noted the connection to Campbell’s (1994) work; Kaltenbrunner and
Lochstoer (2010) is similar. Malkhozov (2014) extends loglinear approximation to models
with recursive preferences and linear (“affine”) conditional variance processes. Dew-Becker
(2012) is similar. Caldara, Fernandez-Villaverde, Rubio-Ramirez, and Wen (2012) epitomize
a large body of work based on “perturbation methods.” These methods, as they are com-
monly used in macroeconomics, start with first-order approximations in which uncertainty
has been turned off. Uncertainty enters when we move on to higher-order approximations.
It is possible, of course, to incorporate uncertainty in first-order approximations, as we
have done here. The same approach is widely used in finance. We suggest that loglinear
approximations can be a useful source of insight even if other methods are used to compute
quantitative properties.

Uncertainty and business cycles. A number of papers incorporate time-varying uncertainty
in similar models. Most of them use a normal autoregressive process for the log of the
conditional variance, which makes the conditional variance lognormal rather than normal.
Justiniano and Primiceri (2008) do this for all of their shocks, but decisions in their model
do not respond to these measures of uncertainty. Caldara, Fernandez-Villaverde, Rubio-
Ramirez, and Wen (2012) compare a number of methods of approximating the decision
rules for a business cycle model with stochastic uncertainty. They plot, for their benchmark
parameter values, decision rules for consumption and labor supply. They find that con-
sumption falls with uncertainty and labor supply rises (leisure falls). They do not examine
further the quantitative impact of uncertainty on business cycles. Bidder and Smith (2013)
consider a robust control interpretation of recursive preferences and explore the impact
of risk on the agent’s implicit (“distorted”) probabilities over future events. They do not
report the model’s business cycle properties.

Liu and Miao (2014), in a paper presented at this conference, consider a model with dis-
appointment aversion in which the conditional mean and variance of productivity growth
vary between high- and low-value states. The structure of uncertainty is different but its
effects are the same: an increase in the conditional variance leads consumption to rise and


                                             22
investment to fall. It also leads to a decline in the price and return on equity. Overall,
variation in uncertainty has only a small impact on the cyclical properties of the model.

Basu and Bundick (2012) add Keynesian features to an otherwise similar model: sticky
prices, countercyclical markups, and shocks to current consumption in the time aggregator.
They find, as we do, that the effects of uncertainty are small, but they’re larger with these
additional features. They also find that their model corrects some of the comovement
problems associated with fluctuations in uncertainty. We solve the same problem simply by
having productivity as the dominant driving process.

Ambiguity. The literature on ambiguity and business cycles includes notable contributions
by Hansen and Sargent (2007), Ilut and Schneider (2014), and Jahan-Parvar and Liu (2012).
Hansen and Sargent summarize an extensive line of research in which maxmin expected
utility is extended to dynamic environments. One issue they address at length is what
we’ve called the Tallarini property: the observational equivalence of additive and recursive
preferences for the behavior of quantities. Ilut and Schneider use another version of dynamic
maxmin expected utility. In their model, the conditional mean of productivity growth is
bounded by an interval [−at , at ] for some at > 0 that varies with time. The min in maxmin
has the effect of having the agent act as if the conditional mean is −at , a state variable that
shows up in decision rules. In their model, variations in at account for most of the variation
in output.

Jahan-Parvar and Liu use smooth ambiguity. Productivity growth is conditionally log-
normal with a conditional mean that follows a two-state Markov chain. The state is not
observed, but the agent computes a distribution over states from past realizations. The
agent is ambiguous over this uncertainty, leading to a role for ambiguity aversion. Varia-
tion in the distribution over states leads to time-varying ambiguity. Their focus is on asset
prices, but their reported business cycle properties suggest that quantities are not greatly
affected by uncertainty.

8.2   Extensions

Several extensions strike us as having potential for increasing the impact of uncertainty.
Among them:

Uncertainty in what? Many applications, including ours, place uncertainty in exogenous
variables: in productivity growth, in shocks to current utility, and so on. In the language of
traditional business cycle research, this gives us different impulses to the same propagation
mechanisms. The effects are likely to be much different if the uncertainty is in an endogenous
variable or a parameter. Suppose, for example, the share parameter in the production
function is uncertain. The effects would run throughout the model. The separation property

                                              23
disappears, giving us the potential to generate more interesting dynamics than we have
described above.

Learning. Several applications of ambiguity to asset pricing involve learning: the models
have hidden states whose probabilities are inferred from other variables. This additional
uncertainty about the state is a natural source of ambiguity. Several applications do exactly
this in models with discrete state spaces, notably Jahan-Parvar and Liu (2012), Ju and Miao
(2012), and Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji (2009). The same idea is easily applied to
models with continuous state spaces. For example, a model based on a law of motion like
(6) would serve this purpose if some or all of xt is not observed. If volatility vt is constant,
uncertainty is constant, too. Otherwise it varies through time as in our examples.

The advantage of learning in such models is that it gives us another source of dynamics.
If learning is slow enough, it can contribute in a significant way to the dynamics of the
model. Collard, Mukerji, Sheppard, and Tallon (2012) and Collin-Dufresne, Johannes, and
Lochstoer (2013) generate significant effects on asset prices. A logical next step is to study
its effects on business cycles.

8.3   Alternative mechanisms

Endogenous uncertainty. A related line of thought is to make uncertainty endogenous.
One version builds in feedback from economic activity to uncertainty. Since uncertainty
is no longer exogenous, the model loses the separation property, leaving more room for an
impact on aggregate dynamics. Striking examples of this include Fajgelbaum, Schaal, and
Taschereau-Dumouchel (2014), Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp (2006), and Veldkamp
(2005). In all of them, a decline in economic activity produced by other means reduces the
amount of information available and increases uncertainty. This reinforces the decline in
output, and can prolong deep recessions or even make them (in the words of the first paper)
“near permanent.”

Fostel and Geanakoplos (2012, 2014) build multi-agent models with incomplete markets in
which asset trades are limited by collateral. Several of their examples generate procyclical
leverage and endogenous increases in volatility during downturns.

Microeconomic uncertainty. A number of influential papers explore the impact on business
cycles of microeconomic uncertainty: of variation in the uncertainty faced by individual
firms or households. Bloom, Floetotto, Jaimovich, Saporta, and Terry (2012) imbed an
industry model in a business cycle framework. Firms face idiosyncratic shocks to their
productivities whose variance follows a two-state Markov chain. Fixed costs reduce firms’
willingness to adjust capital and labor inputs as firm-level productivities change. The
striking result, also evident in earlier work, is that an increase in microeconomic uncertainty

                                              24
reduces aggregate productivity. The effect can be substantial, perhaps (they argue) three
percent of GDP (Figure 6). Declines in labor and investment are larger still (Figure 7).
The model does not, however, explain why the recovery has been so slow.

Bachmann and Bayer (2013) argue that the impact is likely to be smaller. They estimate
a process for microeconomic uncertainty from German data and find that the variation in
firm-level uncertainty is smaller than estimates used elsewhere. They also find that the
overall impact of micro uncertainty on business cycle properties is small (Table 5).

Arellano, Bai, and Kehoe (2012) combine microeconomic uncertainty with financial frictions
for firms. They note, as we do in Figure 4, that labor productivity was flat during the
recession. They propose an explanation of the 2008 recession that operates through financial
frictions and employment. In their model, firms must finance their wage bills in advance
with noncontingent debt. If they are unable to repay the debt at the end of the period,
they default and forego future profits. When uncertainty rises, the probability of default
rises with it, and firms hire fewer workers and produce less output. In this way uncertainty
generates a negative “labor wedge” that reduces employment and output (Figure 1).


9    Where next?

Even a casual look at the evidence suggests a connection between uncertainty and business
cycles. Economic downturns are generally associated with increases in the uncertainty of
financial returns and of near-term macroeconomic performance. They are also associated
with increases in the dispersion of outcomes experienced by households and firms. The
question is what mechanisms connect uncertainty and the economy. Like others before us,
we looked at the impact of exogenous increases in uncertainty. Also like others, we’ve found
that the effects are small. Given the evidence, that can’t be the end of the story. Perhaps
future work will give us more effective ways in which uncertainty influences economic be-
havior, or even generate such uncertainty as part of a more complete explanation of business
cycles than we have now.

A      Marginal rates of substitution

We derive the marginal rates of substitution for recursive preferences with risk and ambi-
guity. Consider an event tree with histories or states st = (s0 , s1 , . . . , st ). We’re interested
in the marginal rate of substitution between consumption in state st and a succeeding state
st+1 = (st , s) . Since everything starts at st , we can ignore it in what follows. We use a
finite state-space to simplify the notation.

Preferences are characterized by the time aggregator (3) and the risk and ambiguity cer-
tainty equivalents (19). Denote current utility by U (st ) = Ut and future utility by U (st , s) =
Ut+1 (s) = Ut+1 . We divide s into (s1 , s2 ) and consider probabilities π(s1 , s2 ) = π1 (s1 |s2 )π2 (s2 ),
all conditional on the current state st . The overall certainty equivalent is µt (Ut+1 ) =
µ2t [µ1t (Ut+1 )]. The inner one,
                                             hX                                     i1/α
                            µ1t (Ut+1 ) =            π1 (s1 |s2 )Ut+1 (s1 , s2 )α           ,
                                                s1

might be expressed µ1t (s2 ), a function of s2 . The outer one is
                                                     hX                          i1/γ
                              µ2t [µ1t (s2 )] =             π2 (s2 )µ1t (s2 )γ          .
                                                       s2

Marginal utilities follow from repeated application of the chain rule. The relevant derivatives
are

                                  ∂Ut /∂ct = Ut1−ρ (1 − β)cρ−1
                                                           t
                        ∂Ut /∂µ2t [µ1t (s2 )] = Ut1−ρ βµ2t [µ1t (s2 )]ρ−1
                 ∂µ2t [µ1t (s2 )]/∂µ1t (s2 ) = µ2t [µ1t (s2 )]1−γ π2 (s2 )µ1t (s2 )γ−1
                 ∂µ1t (s2 )/∂Ut+1 (s1 , s2 ) = µ1t (s2 )1−α π(s1 |s2 )Ut+1 (s1 , s2 )α−1 .

The marginal rate of substitution is therefore
∂Ut /∂ct+1 (s1 , s2 )     [∂Ut /∂µ2t ][∂µ2t /∂µ1t ][∂µ1t /∂Ut+1 ][∂Ut+1 /∂ct+1 ]

B     The Brock-Mirman example

Ljungqvist and Sargent (2000, Chapter 4, Appendix B) give the traditional stripped-down
version of the Brock-Mirman example. Agents have log utility, which corresponds to our

                                                       26
recursive preferences with ρ = α = γ = 0. The laws of motion for capital and productivity
are kt+1 = yt − ct = at ktω − ct and log at+1 = ϕa log at + τ 1/2 wt+1 , where 0 ≤ ω < 1 and
{wt } is an iid sequence of standard normal random variables. The Bellman equation is

                 log J(kt , at ) = max (1 − β) log ct + βEt [log J(kt+1 , at+1 )]
                                          ct

subject to the laws of motion for kt and at .

We solve by guess and verify. We guess log J(kt , at ) = p0 + pk log kt + pa log at . Then next
period’s value function and its expectation are

           log J(kt+1 , at+1 ) = p0 + pk log(at ktω − ct ) + pa (ϕa log at + τ 1/2 wt+1 )
               Et log(Jt+1 ) = p0 + pk log(at ktω − ct ) + pa ϕa log at .

If we substitute into the Bellman equation, the envelope condition for kt is

                              pk /kt = βpk ωat ktω−1 /(at ktω − ct ).

That gives us the decision rule

                                          ct = (1 − βω)at ktω ,

which implies the controlled law of motion kt+1 = βωat ktω . The Bellman equation is then

    p0 + pk log kt + pa log at = (1 − β)[log(1 − βω) + log at + ω log kt ]
                                     
                                 + β p0 + pk [log(βω) + log at + ω log kt ] + pa ϕa log at .

Lining up terms gives us the solution:

             pk = (1 − β)ω/(1 − βω) ⇒ 1 − pk = (1 − ω)/(1 − βω)
             pa = [1 − β(1 − pk )]/(1 − βω) = (1 − β)/[(1 − βω)(1 − βϕa )]
             p0 = [(1 − β) log(1 − βω) + βpk log(βω)]/(1 − β).

Note that 0 ≤ pk < 1, which makes J(kt , at ) (weakly) increasing and concave in kt .


C     Approximating the additive business cycle model

We compute an approximate loglinear solution to a business cycle model with additive
preferences and constant volatility and compare it to Campbell’s (1994) solution of the
same model. The approaches are different, but they deliver the same decision rule.

We approach the problem as a dynamic program. With additive preferences (α = ρ) the
Bellman equation can be written

                  J(k̃t , xt ) = max (1 − β)c̃ρt /ρ + βEt [gt+1
                                                            ρ
                                                                J(k̃t+1 , xt+1 )].
                                    c̃t


                                                   27
subject to the laws of motion k̃t+1 = [f (k̃t , 1)−c̃t ]/gt+1 and xt+1 = Axt +Bwt+1 . Here we’ve
taken equation (8) to the power ρ, divided by ρ, and redefined Jtρ /ρ as Jt . The first-order
and envelope conditions are

                            (1 − β)c̃ρ−1                  ρ−1       
                                     t      = βEt gt+1        Jkt+1
                                                          ρ−1       
                                     Jkt = βEt gt+1           Jkt+1 fkt .

Together they imply

                                   (1 − β)c̃ρ−1
                                            t   = Jkt /fkt .

This illustrates a point we made earlier: in the additive case, we need the derivative of the
value function but not the value function itself. Evidently a loglinear decision rule requires
loglinear approximations of Jkt and fkt .

We guess the derivative of the value function has the form

                                  log Jkt = qk log k̃t + qx> xt

with coefficients (qk , qx ) to be determined. Putting this together with the loglinear approx-
imations (16,17) gives us

            log Jkt − log fkt = (qk − λr ) log k̃t + qx> xt
                       log c̃t = −σ(qk − λr ) log k̃t − σqx> xt
                    log k̃t+1 = λk + σλc (qk − λr ) log k̃t + σλc qx> xt − e> xt+1 .
                                                     

Ordinarily we would substitute the decision rule for consumption into the Bellman equation
and solve for qk . Here it’s sufficient to use the envelope condition, the derivative of the
Bellman equation. The right-hand side involves
                ρ−1
           log(gt+1 Jkt+1 ) = qk log k̃t+1 + [qx + (ρ − 1)e]> xt+1
                                                     
                            = qk λk + σλc (qk − λr ) log k̃t
                               + qk σλc qx> xt + [qx + (ρ − 1 − qk )e]> (Axt + Bwt+1 )
                 ρ−1                                 
        log Et (gt+1 Jkt+1 ) = qk λk + σλc (qk − λr ) log k̃t
                               + σλc qk qx + [qx + (ρ − 1 − qk )e]> A xt + Vx /2,
                                 

where Vx = [qx + (ρ − 1)e]> BB > [qx + (ρ − 1)e]. The variance term Vx only shows up in the
intercept, so we ignore it from here out. The envelope condition then gives us

            qk log k̃t + qx> xt = qk λk + σλc (qk − λr ) log k̃t
                                                       

                                  + qk λc σqx> + [qx + (ρ − 1)e]> A xt + λr log k̃t .
                                    

Equating similar terms, we have
                                                       
                             qk = qk λk + σλc (qk − λr ) + λr
                            qx> = σλc qk qx> + [qx + (ρ − 1)e]> A.

                                               28
The first equation is quadratic in qk and has two solutions, one positive and one negative.
We take the negative one, which corresponds to a concave value function and a stable
controlled law of motion. Given solutions for qk and qx , the decision rule for consumption
follows immediately.

Campbell derives the same decision rule by another route. He starts with the “Euler
equation,”

                           Et β(ct+1 /ct )ρ−1 fkt+1 = 1,
                                                  


a consequence of the first-order and envelope conditions. Ignoring risk (which is constant,
in any case), the loglinear version is

              Et (log ct+1 − log ct ) = −σEt (log fkt+1 ) = σλr Et (log k̃t+1 ).                (22)

Where we use a guess for Jkt , he uses a guess for the consumption decision rule,

                                  log c̃t = hck log k̃t + h>
                                                           cx xt ,

with coefficients (hck , hcx ) to be determined. Using (16,17), the (controlled) law of motion
for capital is

                    log k̃t+1 = (λk − λc hck ) log k̃t − λc h>        >
                                                             cx xt − e xt+1 .

The right side of the Euler equation (22) then becomes

            σλr Et (log k̃t+1 ) = σλr (λk − λc hck ) log k̃t − σλr λc h>     >
                                                                               
                                                                       cx + e A xt .

The left side becomes

Et (log ct+1 − log ct ) = hck (log k̃t+1 − log k̃t ) + h>                  >
                                                        cx (xt+1 − xt ) + e xt+1
                        = [hck (λk − λc hck ) − hck ] log k̃t + [h>             >            >
                                                                  cx (A − I) + e A + hck λc hcx ]xt .

Equating the two gives us

                            hck (λk − λc hck ) − hck = σλr (λk − λc hck )
                  h>       − I) + e> A + hck λc h>             >     >
                                                                       
                   cx (A                         cx = −σλr λc hcx + e A .

The first equation is Campbell’s equation (24) in slightly different notation. Kaltenbrunner
and Lochstoer (2010) do the same. It’s tedious but direct to show that the two solutions
are identical: use the relation hck = −σ(qk − λr ) to convert the quadratic in hck into one
for qk .




                                                 29
D     Approximating the risky business cycle model

We take two approaches to loglinear approximation of the model in Section 5. The first is
based on a loglinear approximation to the Bellman equation suggested by Hansen, Heaton,
and Li (2008, Section III). The second is based on a loglinear approximation of the envelope
condition, the derivative of the Bellman equation. We find the second more helpful, but in
principle the two should give similar answers.

Value function approximation. Relative to the additive case of Appendix C, we need log-
linear approximations of both the value function and its derivative. Consider a loglinear
approximation to Jkt :

                   log Jkt = p1 + log pk + (pk − 1) log k̃t + p>
                                                               x xt + p v vt
                   ⇒ Jkt = pk k̃tpk −1 exp(p1 + p>
                                                 x xt + pv vt ).

If we integrate with respect to k̃t , we get the value function

                           Jt = p0 + k̃tpk exp(p1 + p>
                                                     x xt + pv vt )

It’s unfortunate that Jt isn’t loglinear unless p0 = 0, but we use a loglinear approximation,

                            log Jt = d(pk log k̃t + p>
                                                     x xt + p v vt )

with d = (J − p0 )/J. The combined term

       log(Jtρ−1 Jkt ) = {[1 + (ρ − 1)d]pk − 1} log k̃t + [1 + (ρ − 1)d](p>
                                                                          x xt + pv vt ).

Hansen-Heaton-Li approximation. The idea is to approximate (10), the log of the Bellman
equation:

                log Jt = ρ−1 log (1 − β)eρ log c̃t + βeρ log µt (gt+1 Jt+1 )
                                                                            

                        ∼
                        = b0 + (1 − b1 ) log c̃t + b1 log µt (gt+1 Jt+1 ).          (23)

This is exact if ρ = 0, in which case b0 = 0 and b1 = β.

We need three things to put this to work: the value function Jt , consumption c̃t , and the
certainty equivalent of future utility µt (gt+1 Jt+1 ). The first one we’ve done. Condition (15)
then gives us the decision rule

              log c̃t = [(d − σ)pk + σ(1 + λr )] log k̃t + (d − σ)(p>
                                                                    x xt + pv vt ),

the second component of the approximate Bellman equation. The final component is the
certainty equivalent of future utility. For that, we need the controlled law of motion (17),

 log k̃t+1 = λk log k̃t − λc log c̃t − e> xt+1
           = λk − λc [(d − σ)pk + σ(1 + λr )] log k̃t − λc (d − σ)(p>                 >
             
                                                                    x xt + pv vt ) − e xt+1 .


                                               30
Future utility and its certainty equivalent are then

              log(gt+1 Jt+1 ) = log gt+1 + d(pk log k̃t+1 + p>
                                                             x xt+1 + pv vt+1 )

                                  + dpv [ϕv − λc dpk (d − σ)] + (α/2)Vx vt ,

where Vx = [dpx + (1 − dpk )e]> BB > [dpx + (1 − dpk )e] is the contribution of xt+1 to the
conditional variance of log(gt+1 Jt+1 ).

Now we plug this into the approximate Bellman equation and line up coefficients:
                                                 
     pk = (1 − b1 ) σ + (d − σ)pk + σλr + b1 dpk λk − λc [σ + (d − σ)pk + σλr ]
     p>  = (1 − b1 )(d − σ)p>                    >    >                     >
                                    
      x                       x + b1 [(1 − dpk )e + dpx ]A − λc dpk (d − σ)px
                                    
     pv = (1 − b1 )(d − σ)pv + b1 dpv [ϕv − λc dpk (d − σ)] + (α/2)Vx .

The first equation is quadratic in pk . Given a solution for pk , the equations for px and pv
are linear.

Envelope condition approximation. Our second method is based on the envelope condition
and mirrors the approach we took to the additive model in Appendix C. The envelope
condition for the recursive model is

                  Jtρ−1 Jkt = βµt (gt+1 Jt+1 )ρ−α Et [(gt+1 Jt+1 )α−1 Jkt+1 ]fkt .               (24)

For the left side we reconstitute our earlier expression,

       log(Jtρ−1 Jkt ) = [1 + (ρ − 1)d]pk − 1 log k̃t + [1 + (ρ − 1)d](p>
                           
                                                                        x xt + pv vt )
                        = qk log k̃t + qx> xt + qv vt .

The substitution of coefficients (qk , qx , qv ) for (pk , px , pv ) is helpful because the same terms
reappear elsewhere.

We need to evaluate gt+1 Jt+1 , which requires the decision rule and controlled law of motion.
The decision rule in this notation is

                        log c̃t = −σ(qk − λr ) log k̃t − σ(qx> xt + qv vt ).

That gives us the controlled law of motion

           log k̃t+1 = λk + σλc (qk − λr ) log k̃t + σλc (qx> xt + qv vt ) − e> xt+1 .
                                          


                                                 31
Now back to the envelope condition (24). The critical components are

log(gt+1 Jt+1 ) = dpk log k̃t+1 + (e + dpx )> xt+1 + dpv vt+1
                = dpk λk + σλc (qk − λr ) log k̃t + dpk λc σqx> xt + dpk λc σqv vt
                                         

                                                      1/2
                    + [(1 − dpk )e + dpx ]> (Axt + vt Bw1t+1 ) + dpv [(1 − ϕv )v + ϕv vt + τ w2t+1 ]
    log Jkt+1 = (pk − 1) log k̃t+1 + p>
                                      x xt+1 + pv vt+1
              = (pk − 1) λk + σλc (qk − λr ) log k̃t + (pk − 1)λc σqx> xt + (pk − 1)λc σqv vt
                                            

                                                    1/2
                    + [(1 − pk )e + px ]> (Axt + vt Bw1t+1 ) + pv [(1 − ϕv )v + ϕv vt + τ w2t+1 ],

which show up in µt (gt+1 Jt+1 ) and Et [(gt+1 Jt+1 )α−1 Jkt+1 ]. We collect similar terms and
find:

• Capital. These terms show up only in the mean. If we work through the right side of the
  envelope condition, we see that the mean terms are multiplied by (ρ−α)+(α−1) = ρ−1.
  The log k̃t terms are therefore

           qk = (ρ − 1)dpk [λk + σλc (qk − λr )] + (pk − 1)[λk + σλc (qk − λr )] + λr
               = qk [λk + σλc (qk − λr )] + λr .

  In the first line, the first term on the right comes from log(gt+1 Jt+1 ) and the second from
  log Jkt+1 . Through some piece of luck, they combine nicely. We are left with a quadratic
  in the coefficient qk , in fact the same one we derived in Appendix C for the additive case.
  As a result, the coefficients hck of the approximate decision rule (12) and hkk of the
  controlled law of motion (18) are the same in the additive and recursive cases. As in
  Tallarini (2000), the risk aversion parameter plays no role in what we call the “internal
  dynamics” of the capital stock. Note, too, that the behavior of the exogenous state
  variables xt and vt have no impact on the solution. This is what we call the separation
  property: the capital coefficients (qk , hck , hkk ) are independent of the rest of the model.

• News. Again, xt shows up only in the mean terms, so we find the coefficient qx in much
  the same way. The relevant terms are

                             qx> = qk λc σqx> + [(ρ − 1)e + qx ]> A.

  This is, again, the same as the additive case we solved earlier. It’s also independent of
  risk (vt ) and risk aversion (α): capital dynamics enter through qk , but the properties of
  risk don’t affect the response to news. When A = 0, there’s no persistence in xt and
  qx = 0.

• Risk. This one’s more involved, it incorporates risk and recursive preferences in a funda-
  mental way. The coefficients of vt might be collected in two groups:

                             qv = mean terms + variance terms.



                                               32
    The former are similar to what we’ve done:

                                     mean terms = (qk λc σ)qv .
                                                                   1/2
    The latter involve the variances of terms containing vt in the envelope condition (24)
    in both the certainty equivalent µt (gt+1 Jt+1 ) and the expectation Et [(gt+1 Jt+1 )α−1 Jkt+1 ].
    Adding them in order, we have

                              variance terms = (ρ − α)αV1 /2 + V2 /2

    where

                   V1 = [(1 − dpk )e + dpx ]> BB > [(1 − dpk )e + dpx ]
                                                                           >
                   V2 = (α − 1)[(1 − dpk )e + dpx ] + [(1 − pk )e + px ] BB >
                        
                        
                          (α − 1)[(1 − dpk )e + dpx ] + [(1 − pk )e + px ] .

    We need a value for d to implement this, but we can get a sense of where the sign comes
    from. Both V1 and V2 are positive, so the sign depends on their relative magnitudes and
    the sign of ρ − α.


E      Approximating the ambiguous business cycle model

Constant volatility. The ambiguous business cycle model has the same structure and prop-
erties as the model with risk. In the notation of Appendix D, let

              log(Jtρ−1 Jkt ) = [((ρ − 1)d + 1)pk − 1] log k̃t + [((ρ − 1)d + 1)px ]x̂t
                              = qk log k̃t + qx x̂t .

As before, the calculation the right-hand side of (21) follows from loglinear approximations of
the relevant functions and the certainty equivalent formula for lognormal random variables.
Consider first the term inside the square brackets. We will need the expected value of the
log (the constant variances will ultimately enter the intercept terms which we ignore):

        E1t [(α − 1)(log gt+1 + log Jt+1 ) + log Jkt+1 ]
    = E1t [(ρ − 1) log Jt+1 + log Jkt+1 ] + (ρ − 1)E1t log gt+1 + (α − ρ)E1t [log gt+1 + log Jt+1 ]
                             bt+1 ] + (ρ − 1)E1t log gt+1 + (α − ρ)E1t [log gt+1 + log Jt+1 ].
    = E1t [qk log k̃t+1 + qx x

The last expected value in this expression, E1t [log gt+1 +log Jt+1 ], is precisely the expectation
in µ1t , which affords some convenient cancellation of terms, such that the expectation inside
the square brackets on the right-hand side of (21) is simply
            h                              i
log E2t log µγ−α
              1t E1t (gt+1 Jt+1 )
                                  α−1
                                      Jkt+1 = E2t E1t [qk log k̃t+1 + qx x  bt+1 + (ρ − 1) log gt+1 ]
                                                        +(γ − ρ)E2t E1t [log gt+1 + log Jt+1 ].


                                                   33
Once again, the last expected value in this expression is precisely the expectation that
appears in the term µ2t (µ1t )ρ−γ , but with the opposite sign, which once again affords some
convenient cancellation of terms resulting in greatly simplified version of equation (21):

         (qk − λr ) log k̃t + qx x                               bt+1 + (ρ − 1) log gt+1 ]
                                 bt = E2t E1t [qk log k̃t+1 + qx x
                                   = qk hkk log k̃t + [qk hkx + qx ϕx (1 − θ)]b
                                                                              xt
                                       +[ρ − 1 − qk + qx ϕx θ]E2t E1t log gt+1
                                   = qk hkk log k̃t + [qk (hkx − 1) + qx ϕx + ρ − 1]b
                                                                                    xt .

(Recall: hkk = λk +σλc (qk −λr ) and hkx = σλc qx .) This equation gives us identical loglinear
solutions as the earlier models. Neither the ambiguity aversion parameter γ nor the risk
aversion parameter α affects the dynamics of the model. (Both parameters appear only in
the intercept terms.)
