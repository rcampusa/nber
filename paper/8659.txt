                                              ABSTRACT

        This paper considers the financing of investment in the presence of asymmetric information
between the “insiders” and the “outsiders” of the firms in a small open economy. It establishes a well-
defined capital structure for the economy as a whole with the following features: low-productivity firms
rely on the equity market to finance investment at a relatively low level; medium-productivity firms do
not invest at all; and high-productivity firms rely on the debt market to finance investment at a relatively
high level. It is shown that the debt market is efficient, with respect to both its scope and the amount of
investment that each firm makes. However, the equity market fails: its scope is too narrow and the
investment each firm makes is too little. A corrective policy requires just one instrument which is rather
unconventional: lump-sum subsidies to those firms that choose to equity-finance their investment (i.e.,
equity-market-contingent grants).

I.       Introduction

         Learned observations about less developed countries indicate that their capital markets

are immature and commonly plagued by informational and other problems such as absence of

international disclosure standards and regulatory forbearance in recognizing the extent of bad

loans. As the economies develop over time, these problems can be mitigated in one way or

another but they are still very much in presence to drive noticeable differences among the various

means of investment financing. Indeed, Figure 1 reveals that although the major three types of

net private capital flows into developing countries))viz., foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio

equity flows, and debt flows))co-move and are trending upward, their magnitudes differ

substantially: FDI and debt flows occupy a more prominent position than equity flows. While

debt and equity flows are mainly a source of finance for investment in the capital-importing

countries, FDI has other distinguishable attributes: as a means of bypassing trade barriers and of

technology transfer, a way for multinationals to be close to local consumer markets, etc. In this

paper, we shall abstract from the analysis of FDI and focus only on the differences between the

two types of portfolio capital flows.1

                                       [insert Figure 1 about here]

         In a perfect capital market, all forms of capital financing are indistinguishable and there

is no unique debt-equity structure within a firm or in the economy as a whole. Similarly, there is

no meaningful economic difference between international debt and equity flows. In the presence

of information asymmetry between the firm’s “insiders” and “outsiders”, however, we can derive

a well-defined debt-equity capital structure for the whole economy.                         Under asymmetric

information, the equity market may be plagued by a “lemons” problem while the debt market by

which facilitates acquisition of insider information about the productivity of the firms))see Razin, Sadka, and Yuen
(1998a).

possibilities of default. In such context, we can endogenously determine the co-existence of three

groups of firms: firms which equity-finance new investment, firms which debt-finance new

investment, and firms which make no new investment. This economy-wide debt-equity structure

also induces a similar pattern for the two major channels of international finance, i.e., debt and

equity flows.

       Under this equilibrium capital structure of the economy, two kinds of efficiency issues

arise. One can ask (1) if the firm’s decision of whether to make new investment or not to invest

at all is efficient; and (2) if those firms that choose to make new investment will invest

inadequately or excessively. In order to address these issues, we develop a concept of constrained

Pareto-efficiency that takes into account the limitations imposed on the manager in carrying out

the investment plans of the firm in the asymmetric information environment. Given the

uncommon nature of this efficiency problem, the corrective policy may also assume an

unconventional structure.

       Similar to the aforementioned order of capital flows, there is a pecking order in corporate

finance. In financing new investment projects, the manager, who is better informed than the

suppliers of funds, would prefer to rely on retained earnings (the counterpart of FDI). If these

funds are insufficient, debt is preferred to equity since the choice of equity finance sends the

potential signal that the manager thinks the firm’s shares are overvalued (see Myers and Majluf,

1984). However, our analysis of debt and equity finance differs from that in the corporate finance

literature. While the latter is based on analysis of a single firm’s investment and financing

decisions focusing on issues of corporate governance, we abstract from the governance issues in

order to focus on the macro-economic and international finance issues. We thus consider both

the demand for funds (i.e., the investment and financing decisions of the firms) and the supply of

funds (i.e., the saving decisions of the consumers) in a general equilibrium framework. In
                                                            -3-

particular, we are interested in the efficiency implications of the various means of finance and the

scope for corrective policy.

          The organization of the paper is as follows.                       Section II describes the analytical

framework))classifying firms into three categories (i.e., those with equity-financed investment,

debt-financed investment, and no new investment), deriving the firm’s optimal investment rule,

and laying out the equilibrium conditions in the economy. Section III introduces a concept of

constrained efficiency for evaluation of the market equilibrium. Section IV compares the market

conditions with the efficiency conditions, explains the nature of market failure in this context, and

proposes an optimal corrective policy. Concluding remarks are provided in Section V.



II.       Analytical Framework

          Suppose there is a very large number (N) of ex ante identical domestic firms. Each firm

employs capital input (K) in the first period in order to produce a single composite good in the

second period. We assume that capital depreciates at the rate ä (< 1). Output in the second

period is equal to F(K)(1+g), where F(.) is a production function exhibiting diminishing marginal

productivity of capital and g is a random productivity factor. The latter has zero mean and is

independent across all firms. (g is bounded between !1 and 1, so that output is always

nonnegative.) We assume that g is purely idiosyncratic, so that there is no aggregate uncertainty.2,
3
    Consumer-investors will thus behave in a risk-neutral way.

      2
     This assumption may differ from what is assumed in some strands of the corporate finance literature whereby return
volatilities may vary across firms. If firms are different by their ex ante risk characteristics, then higher-volatility firms
would face higher ex ante default risk if they issue debt. As a result, their gearing (i.e., debt-equity) ratio will be lower
than the low-volatility firms. Since a high-risk firm must offer its shareholders higher expected return, there must be a
negative cross-sectional correlation between mean return and the gearing ratio. We abstract, however, from this variable
volatility assumption, and assume instead identical ex ante risk characteristics, in order to focus on an alternative
mechanism that links firm productivities with their debt-equity ratios.

      3
    In our small open economy context, there may exist another kind of risk due to the difference in the currency
denominations of debt and equity: while dividend payments on equity are normally denominated in terms of
                                                       -4-

         In the first period, firms determine their investment rules in the planning stage while the

actual investment and its funding are delayed to the implementation stage. These investment rules

are approved by the owners of the firms before realization of their productivity shocks. The

management then implements these rules by seeking funds, either at home or abroad, to finance

the investment after g is known. For simplicity, we assume that the original owners of the

investment sites do not have any retained earnings to finance their capital outlays, and will have

to appeal to the equity or debt market instead. At the implementation and financing stage, the

managers of the firms are better informed than the outside fund-suppliers (both foreign and

domestic). There are many ways to specify the degree of this asymmetry in information. In order

to facilitate the analysis, however, we simply assume that the managers, being “close to the

action”, observe g before they implement the investment rules and make their financing decisions;

but the fund-providers, being “far away from the action”, do not.4

         A possible rationale behind this sequence of firm decisions whereby the investment choice

is made ex ante while the financing of the pre-committed investment is decided ex post has to do

with a potential agency problem between the board of directors (representing the owners) and the

managers (who are responsible for making these decisions). Loosely speaking, the latter are less

interested in the net worth of the firm than the former. In the absence of full information about

the firm’s productivity, the owners will have to set investment guidelines for the managers so as



domestic currency, interest payments on debt may be denominated in terms of foreign currency. So the existence
of exchange rate risk may introduce a non-trivial difference between equity and debt in the international context.
But this kind of risk is symmetric to both insiders and outsiders of firms. We shall abstract from modelling it in
our asymmetric information framework.

   4
    The information about g here is asymmetric between the firms (domestic investors) on the one hand and the
suppliers of funds (domestic and foreign savers) on the other, in contrast to the asymmetric information structure
between domestic savers on the one hand and foreign savers on the other as developed by Gordon and Bovenberg
(1996) and extended by Razin, Sadka, and Yuen (1998b). The latter type of information asymmetry gives rise to
home-biased portfolio investment as documented by Tesar and Werner (1995). Many of the structural features of
the Gordon-Bovenberg model are retained in this paper.
                                                  -5-

to protect their own interests. This agency problem is not modelled explicitly here because we

want to focus instead on the asymmetric information between the firm’s “insiders” and

“outsiders”. What we do capture in our model is the spirit of these investment guidelines in terms

of the sequencing of information and the firm’s investment and financing decisions.

           The investment rules are, however, quite rigid in the degrees of freedom they allow the

management. Depending on the realized value of the productivity factor (g), it may be strikingly

more advantageous to debt-finance or equity-finance new investment or not to invest at all. For

instance, a higher-than-average value of g which is observed by the manager but not by the fund-

suppliers will be insufficiently priced by the equity market. In such a case, it will not be optimal

for the manager to resort to the equity market. Similarly, a low realization of g observed by the

manager but not by potential creditors will make it unprofitable for the manager to issue debt even

though she is able to do so (as the creditors do not observe g) because of the detrimental effects

of default. In the case of default, the original owner loses part or all of the existing capital;

whereas if the firm takes no loans and makes no new investment, she can retain all of the existing

capital.

           Specifically, the investment rule dictates the manager to take either one of three possible

courses of actions once g is made known to her:

(i)        equity-finance new capital investment, so as to augment the stock of capital of the firm

           to a pre-determined level of K!;

(ii)       debt-finance new capital investment, so as to augment the stock of capital of the firm to

           a pre-determined level of K+; and

(iii)      not to invest at all.

Since all firms face the same probability distribution of g when designing their investment rules,

they all choose the same rule (i.e., the same K! and K+).
                                                   -6-

II.A    Which firms will equity-finance investment?

        As mentioned above, the managers observe g while the new potential shareholders of the

firm do not. The market will be trapped in the “lemons” situation a la Akerlof (1970). At the

price offered by the new (uninformed) potential equity buyers, which reflects the average

productivity of all firms (i.e., the average level of g) in the market, the manager of a firm

experiencing a higher-than-average value of g would prefer to employ just the existing capital (i.e.,

K0) rather than to raise equity from a market that will not pay a premium for a high value of g.

Thus, there exists a cutoff level of g, denoted by g0, such that all firms which experience a value

of g above g0 will not make any new investment while all other firms (i.e., the low-g firms) will

equity-finance their new investment at a price reflecting the average value of the “lemons”. Define

e! as the mean value of g realized by the low productivity firms:

                                                    g0
                                                   m&1
                           e & / E(g / g # g0) '         g[Ö)(g)/Ö(g0)]dg ,                      (1)




where Ö(.) is the cumulative probability distribution of g. That is, e! is the conditional expectation

of g, given that g # g0.

        The cutoff level of g is then defined by

                      ![K!!(1!ä)K0] + {F(K!)[1+e!(g0)]+(1!ä)K!} / (1+r*)

                              = {F[(1!ä)K0](1+g0)+(1!ä)2K0} / (1+r*) ,                            (2)

where K! is the stock of capital of the low-g firms that do make new investment, (1!ä)K0 the

undepreciated initial stock of capital for the firms that do not make any new investment, and r*

the world rate of interest.

        We assume a small open economy so that the domestic rate of interest is determined

exogenously by the world rate (r*). The left-hand side of equation (2) represents the market value
                                                          -7-

of the firm net of the new capital investment. Note that, to the potential new shareholders, all

firms on the market are indistinguishable so that their productivity is evaluated at e!, i.e., the

average productivity of the group of firms that choose to equity-finance their new investment.

The right-hand side of (2) represents the value of the marginal firm to the manager who observes

g and acts on behalf of the original firm owner. By the marginal firm, we mean the firm with the

lowest productivity factor (g0) among the firms that do not make equity-financed new investment.



II.B       Which firms will debt-finance investment?

           Besides equity finance, an alternative source of finance is to have domestic firms borrow

from banks or float bonds.5 As in Stiglitz and Weiss (1981), we allow for the possibility of

default. However, since the manager observes the realized value of g before proceeding with the

actual implementation of the pre-determined level of investment (denoted by K+!(1!ä)K0) and

the borrowing needed for its finance, it will never pay her to borrow if she knows that the firm

will not be able to repay its loans at the end (i.e., it does not pay to default). This is because in

the latter case, all its post-investment assets (i.e., F(K+)(1+g)+(1!ä)K+) will be seized, leaving the

firm pennyless; while if it decides not to borrow to finance new investment, then it will still be left

with F[(1!ä)K0]+(1!ä)2K0.6

           Therefore, there will be a cutoff level of g, denoted by g0, such that all firms that realize

a value of g below g0 will not make any new investment and all other firms will borrow

K+!(1!ä)K0 in order to increase their capital stock to K+. This cutoff level of g is given by

                             ![K+!(1!ä)K0] + [F(K+)(1+g0)+(1!ä)K+]/(1+r*)



   5
    A related issue of sovereign debt in the context of asymmetric information is discussed in Eaton and Gersovitz (1989).

       6
     With moral hazard, the possibility of default becomes more real. See, e.g., Gertler and Rogoff (1990) and Lane
(1998).
                                                -8-

                             = {F[(1!ä)K0](1+g0)+(1!ä)2K0}/(1+r*) ,                              (3)

The left-hand side of (3) represents the market value, net of the new investment, of the marginal

firm that debt-finances new investment; while the right-hand side represents the alternative market

value for that firm if it chooses not to invest. By the marginal firm, we mean here the firm with

the lowest realized productivity value among the group of firms that make debt-financed

investment.

        For later use, we denote the mean value of the productivity factor for the firms that debt-

finance their investment by e+, i.e.,



                                             mg
                                               1
                      e % / E(g/ g$ g0) '       0 g{Ö)(g)/[1&Ö(g0)]}dg .                        (4)




In other words, e+ is the conditional expectation of g, given g $ g0.



II.C    Which firms do not make new investment?

        All the firms that realize a value of g above g0 and below g0 will neither equity-finance nor

debt-finance such investment, i.e., they will not invest at all. This set of firms is not empty when

g0 < g0. By comparing conditions (2) and (3), one can see that g0 is indeed below g0. Suppose

not, then the right-hand side of (2) will either equal or exceed the right-hand side of (3). It

follows that the left-hand side of (2) will also equal or exceed the left-hand side of (3). But this

is impossible because the left-hand side of (2) represents the mean market value of the low-g firms

while the left-hand side of (3) represents the market value of the marginal high-g firm.

        For later use, we define by e0 the mean value of g for the firms that make no new

investment, i.e.,
                                               -9-

                                            0
                 e 0 / E(g/ g0 # g# g0) ' g {gÖ)(g)/[Ö(g0)&Ö(g0)]}dg .
                                         mg0
                                                                                             (5)




In other words, e0 is the conditional expectation of g, given g0 # g # g0.



II.D   The capital structure of the economy

       In this economy, the set of firms is divided into three groups:

(1)    There are NÖ(g0) low-g firms (i.e., firms with realized values of g below g0) which equity-

       finance their new investment that augments the capital stock of each one of them to K!.

(2)    There are N[Ö(g0)!Ö(g0)] medium-g firms (i.e., firms with realized values of g between

       g0 and g0) that make no new investment and operate with the undepreciated initial stock

       of capital (1!ä)K0.

(3)    There are N[1!Ö(g0)] high-g firms (i.e., firms with realized values of g above g0) which

       debt-finance new investment that augments the capital stock of each one of them to K+.



II.E   The investment rule

       The initial owner-managers determine K! and K+ in the first stage before the realization

of g. They nonetheless take into account the second-stage implementation procedure that gives

the managers the option of not investing at all once the managers observe g.

       The objective of the owner-managers is to maximize the expected market value of the

firm, which is given by
                                                -10-

                                      1%r (


The first curly-bracketed term on the right-hand side of (6) represents the expected value of the

firm conditional on its being equity-financed, which will occur with probability Ö(g0). Similarly,

the second curly-bracketed term represents the expected value of the firm conditional on its

making no new investment, which will occur with probability Ö(g0)!Ö(g0). The third curly-

bracketed term represents the expected value of the firm conditional on its being debt-financed,

which will occur with probability 1!Ö(g0).

        Maximization of (6) with respect to K! and K+ yields the marginal capital productivity

conditions:

                                     F’(K!)(1+e!) = r* + ä ,                                     (7)

                                     F’(K+)(1+e+) = r* + ä .                                     (8)

The expected marginal product of capital, either under equity finance or debt finance, must equal

the cost of capital (r*+ä). Note that since the mean productivity factor for the high-g firms (i.e.,

e+) is higher than the mean productivity factor for the low-g firms (i.e., e!), K+ is bigger than K!.

In other words, the high-productivity firms invest more than the low-productivity firms while the

medium-productivity firms do not invest at all. This is depicted in Figure 2 as the market solution

(in contrast to the efficient solution to be discussed in section IV below).

II.F   The rest of the model

       We denote the utility function of the representative household by

                                            U(C1, C2) ,                                       (9)

where Ct is her consumption in period t = 1, 2. The consumer chooses her first and second period

consumption (along with the residual saving) by maximizing her utility subject to her lifetime

budget constraint. This maximization delivers the standard intertemporal condition:

                                          U1/U2 = 1 + r* .                                   (10)

       Domestic investment is financed by domestic savings and capital imports.               The

intertemporal resource constraint is given by:

              C1 + C2/(1+r*) + NÖ(g0)[K!!(1!ä)K0] + N[1!Ö(g0)][K+!(1!ä)K0]

                       = NF(K0) + NÖ(g0)[F(K!)(1+e!)+(1!ä)K!]/(1+r*)

                    + N[Ö(g0)!Ö(g0)]{F[(1!ä)K0](1+e0)+(1!ä)2K0}/(1+r*)

                         + N[1!Ö(g0)][F(K+)(1+e+)+(1!ä)K+]/(1+r*) .                          (11)

It states that the present value of consumption and investment (i.e., the uses of funds) cannot

exceed the present value of output and the undepreciated stocks of capital at the end of the

production process (i.e., the sources of funds). Note also that, in period one, there is an amount

of output NF(K0) whose production began one period earlier. The capital inflows, denoted FI (for

foreign investment) simply equal the excess of domestic investment over domestic saving, i.e.,

         FI = { NÖ(g0)[K!!(1!ä)K0] + N[1!Ö(g0)][K+!(1!ä)K0] } ! [NF(K0)!C1].                 (12)

On the right hand side of this equation, the first term relative to the second term indicates the

magnitude of international equity flows relative to international debt flows. If the “lemons”

problem are severe in the domestic equity market, we can expect that the relative magnitude of

international equity flows to be small.

III.    Constrained Efficiency

        An intrinsic feature of this economy is that the investment rule cannot be fine-tuned to be

completely state-contingent. The desired stocks of capital must be determined ex ante before g

is revealed and, once it is revealed, the managers can only choose whether to carry out the pre-

determined debt-financed level of investment, or equity-financed level of investment, or not to

invest at all. In other words, a refined and continuous state-dependent function K(g) for the

desired stock of capital is ruled out. For a sensible evaluation of this market solution, we therfore

look for a benchmark efficiency concept that respects this quasi-institutional constraint.

        This constraint boils down to dividing the firms into at most three categories: low-

productivity investing firms, medium-productivity non-investing firms, and high-productivity

investing firms. We first ask whether the market distribution of the firms into these three

categories is efficient. In particular, one may ask whether the middle category should vanish, so

that all firms should invest. We then ask whether the investment levels for the firms in the two

investing categories are efficient. Specifically, we ask whether g0, g0, K!, K+ are efficient.

        Formally, the efficient allocation is determined by choosing {C1, C2, g0, g0, K!, K+} to

maximize the utility function of the representative household (9) subject to the economy-wide

resource constraint (11). The first order conditions (see the Appendix) are given by:

                                         U1/U2 = 1 + r* ,                                        (10a)

                                     F’(K!)(1+e!) = r* + ä ,                                      (7a)

                                     F’(K+)(1+e+) = r* + ä ,                                      (8a)

                        ![K!!(1!ä)K0] + [F(K!)(1+g0)+(1!ä)K!]/(1+r*)

                            = {F[(1!ä)K0](1+g0)+(1!ä)2K0}/(1+r*) ,                                (2a)

                        ![K+!(1!ä)K0] + [F(K+)(1+g0)+(1!ä)K+]/(1+r*)

                            = {F[(1!ä)K0](1+g0)+(1!ä)2K0}/(1+r*) ,                                (3a)
                                                -13-

        Since e+ > e!, (7a) and (8a) imply that K! is smaller than K+, i.e., the low-g firms should

invest less than the high-g firms. We can also show that the set of non-investing firms is not

empty, i.e. g0 < g0. To see this, suppose to the contrary that g0 = g0. (Note that the possibility

of g0 > g0 is redundant because of the symmetry between (K!, g0) and (K+, g0).) It then follows

from (2a) and (3a) that K! must equal K+, which contradicts (7a) and (7b), given e+ > e!.



IV.     Market Failure and Corrective Policy

        Is the market allocation constrained efficient the way we have defined it above? Recall

that the market allocation is characterized by conditions (2), (3), (7), (8), and (10) and the

constrained efficient allocation by (2a), (3a), (7a), (8a), and (10a). Of course, the two allocations

satisfy also the intertemporal resource constraint (11).

        Observe that conditions (3a), (7a), (8a), and (10a) are identical to (3), (7), (8), and (10)

respectively. The intertemporal market allocation of consumption follows the constrained

efficiency rule. Somewhat strikingly, the debt market is efficient, both in its width (as indicated

by g0) and in the level of investment (K+!(1!ä)K0) carried out by each debt-financed firm.

        The equity market fails, however, both in its width (as indicated by g0) and the level of

investment (K!!(1!ä)K0) carried out by each equity-financed firm. We can show that the equity

market is too narrow, and the capital investment it finances too low; see Figure 2. Thus, the

aggregate stock of capital under the market allocation is less than efficient. To prove this,

suppose that the cutoff level of g in the equity market (g0) is at the efficient level. Then (7) and

(7a) imply that the capital investment (K!) is also efficient. Now, consider the marginal firm

which realizes a value of g equal to g0. Its market value is given by the left-hand side of (2a) with

g0 replaced by e!. Since e! < g0, its market value (computed in terms of the average productivity

of the firms in the equity market) must fall short of its alternative no-investment value as known
                                                            -14-

to this marginal firm, which actually observes that its g is equal to g0. This firm will thus drop out

of the market, and the equity market will shrink in size. As a result, the equity market g0 will fall

short of the efficient g0. Furthermore, the equity market K! will be below the efficient K! because

the equity market e! is below the efficient e! (cf. (7) and (7a)). The reason for this market failure

lies in the fact that the marginal firm is unable to extract its true market value as known to her and

has to settle for the average market value of all firms in the market. That is, the decision of the

marginal firm whether to equity-finance its investment is dictated by the comparison between the

average value of investment (based on the average g, which is e!) and the marginal value of not

investing (based on g0). On the other hand, the metaphorical planner, who determines the

constrained efficient allocation, weighs the marginal value of equity-financed investment (at g0)

against the marginal value of no investment (also at g0).

          The prescription for corrective policy is straightforward. What is needed is simply to

correct the equity market cutoff level of g (i.e., g0). As can be seen from (7) and (7a), once the

cutoff g0 and hence e! are set at their efficient levels, the stock of capital (K!) will adjust to the

efficient level as well. Comparing (2) and (2a), we can also see that the market g0 will coincide

with the efficient g0 if a lump-sum subsidy is granted to the equity-financed firms so as to equate

for the marginal firm its market value (inclusive of the subsidy) to its true value as observed by

its manager. That is, the subsidy (S) is set such that S + F(K!)(1+e!) = F(K!)(1+g0), which yields

                                              S = F(K!)(g0!e!) > 0 .                                                    (13)

          Note that this subsidy must be a lump sum, affecting only the decision whether to invest

through equity finance or not to invest (i.e., to be in the equity market or to drop out of it)

without interfering with the marginal productivity condition (7a) of how much to invest.7 This

    7
      Observe, for instance, from equations (2) and (2a) that while a marginal subsidy of s = (g0!e!)/(1+e!) to each firm
that equity-finances its investment will correct the distortions at the g0-margin, it will introduce an unnecessary distortion
at the K!-margin, with (7) rewritten as (1+s)F’(K!)(1+e!) = r*+ä.
                                                -15-

somewhat unconventional policy of a lump-sum subsidy that is conditional on joining the equity

market suffices to restore constrained efficiency for the entire economy.



V.      Conclusion

        This paper considers the financing of investment in the presence of asymmetric information

between the “insiders” and the “outsiders” of the firms in a small open economy. It establishes

a well-defined capital structure for the economy as a whole with the following features: low-

productivity firms rely on the equity market to finance investment at a relatively low level;

medium-productivity firms do not invest at all; and high-productivity firms rely on the debt market

to finance investment at a relatively high level. It is shown that the debt market is efficient, with

respect to both its scope and the amount of investment that each firm makes. However, the equity

market fails: its scope is too narrow and the investment each firm makes is too little. A

corrective policy requires just one policy instrument which is rather unconventional: lump-sum

subsidies to those firms that choose to equity-finance their investment (i.e., equity-market-

contingent grants).

        Our theoretical framework and the associated results suggest two empirical implications.

First, if there exist systematic changes in the distribution of high- and low-productivity firms

during the business cycle, then the debt-equity structure in the economy will vary over the cycles

in a systematic manner. In particular, if the distribution of firms tilts towards relatively high

productivity firms because of their cleansing effect during recessions, then the debt-equity ratio

will rise. Similarly, the debt-equity ratio will fall during economic booms because a group of new

(low-productivity) firms will enter. Second, during the process of capital market development,

as rules of disclosure and prudential regulations get increasingly incorporated into the workings

of these markets, one can conjecture that the “lemons” problem in the equity market will become
                                              -16-

less serious. As a result, the debt-equity ratio is likely to fall. Indeed, the comparison in the

composition of capital flows between low- and middle-income countries reveal a relatively larger

inflow of equity (see Figure 3).

Appendix

        In this appendix, we derive the first order conditions for constrained efficiency (i.e.,
equations (2a), (3a), (7a), (8a), and (10a) in the text). For this purpose, we first express the
derivatives of e!(g0) from equation (1), e+(g0) from equation (4), and e0(g0, g0) from equation (5),
with respect to their corresponding arguments as follows:

                           de &(g0)           Ö)(g0)
                                         '              (g0 & e &) > 0.                     (A.1)
                             dg0              Ö(g0)



                           de %(g0)           Ö)(g0)
                                    '                (e % & g0) > 0.                        (A.2)
                             dg 0             Ö(g0)



                      Me 0(g0, g0)             Ö)(g0)
                                     '                      (e 0 & g0) > 0.                 (A.3)
                          Mg0                Ö(g0)&Ö(g0)



                      Me 0(g0, g0)             Ö)(g0)
                                     '                      (g0 & e 0) > 0.                 (A.4)
                          Mg0                Ö(g0)&Ö(g0)


        The metaphorical planner’s constrained efficiency problem is to maximize the utility of the
representative household (9) subject to the economy-wide intertemporal resource constraint (11)
by choice of {C1, C2, g0, g0, K!, K+}. The first order conditions for C1 and C2 yield (10a), while
those for K! and K+ yield (7a) and (8a) respectively, in the text. The first order conditions for g0
and g0 are given by the following two equations:

            Ö)(g0)[F(K &)(1%e &) % (1&ä)K &] % Ö(g0)F(K &)(de &/dg0)
 & Ö)(g0) {F[(1&ä)K0)](1%e 0) % (1&ä)2K0} % [Ö(g0) & Ö(g0)] F[(1&ä)K0] (Me 0/Mg0) (A.5)
                        ' Ö)(g0)[K & &(1&ä)K0](1%r () .



          Ö)(g0)[F(K %)(1%e %) % (1&ä)K %] & [1&Ö(g0)]F(K %)(de %/dg0)
 & Ö)(g0) {F[(1&ä)K0)](1%e 0) % (1&ä)2K0} & [Ö(g0) & Ö(g0)] F[(1&ä)K0](Me 0/Mg0) (A.6)
                        ' Ö)(g0)[K % &(1&ä)K0](1%r () .


Substituting (A.1))(A.4) into (A.5) and (A.6) yields (2a) and (3a) respectively.
