                                         ABSTRACT

The notion that business cycles are driven by demand shocks is subtle. I first review some of the
conceptual and empirical challenges faced when trying to accommodate this notion in micro-
founded, general-equilibrium models. I next review my own research, which sheds new light on
the observed business cycles by accommodating frictional coordination in the form of higher-
order uncertainty. This makes room for forces akin to animal spirits even when the equilibrium is
unique. It allows demand shocks to generate realistic business cycles even when nominal rigidity
is absent or undone by appropriate monetary policy. It modifies the general-equilibrium
predictions of workhorse macroeconomic models in manners that seem both conceptually
appealing and empirically relevant. And it offers new guidance to policy.

1        Introduction

What causes business cycles? Is it “supply shocks” such as those associated with changes in the
general level of know-how or with mis-allocation in production (e.g., Chodorow-Reich, 2014)? Or is
it “demand shocks” such as those triggered by a drop in consumer sentiment (e.g., Lorenzoni 2009;
Angeletos and La’O 2013) or by a collapse in housing wealth and debt deleveraging (e.g., Mian and
Suﬁ 2014; Guerrieri and Lorenzoni 2017)?
        The Keynesian narrative attributes the bulk of business cycles to shifts in aggregate demand. Low
aggregate demand is also considered to be an important force behind the Great Recession and the
slow recovery from it.1 In this article, I start by reviewing why this hypothesis ﬁnds little place in
the Neoclassical, or RBC, framework and how exactly it is accommodated in the New Keynesian
framework. This allows me to highlight, not only the subtlety of the Keynesian narrative, but also
some of the challenges that the macroeconomist faces when trying to make sense of the observed
business cycles. I next review how my own research has sought to shed new light on the Keynesian
narrative, on the mechanisms that drive business cycles, and on related policy questions.
        But let me ﬁrst clarify the philosophy behind this article. As Robert E. Lucas, Jr. once said,2

          “Theoretical economists ... do not ask for words that ‘explain’ what equations mean. We
          ask for equations that explain what words mean.”

In this article, I take for granted the usefulness and the empirical validity of the Keynesian narrative,3
but ask for the equations that explain the words.
        In Subsection 2.1, I start by pointing out two elementary points, which are a recurring theme
of this article. The ﬁrst is that, while the idea that low demand can trigger a drop in employment
and outcome seems obvious from a partial-equilibrium (PE) perspective, it can be vacuous when
considering the general-equilibrium (GE) response to economy-wide shocks.4 The second is that the
notion of aggregate demand in modern macroeconomic theory is best understood as a particular type
of relative demand in the Arrow-Debreu framework, namely, the demand for goods today relative to
the demand for goods tomorrow.
        These points are well understood within the ﬁeld of macroeconomics but less so outside it. They
help distinguish the modern macroeconomic paradigm, which builds on microeconomic foundations
and spells out how behavior is shaped by incentives, constraints, and expectations, from the old IS-LM

      In an early contribution, Blanchard and Quah (1989) used Structural VARs to provide evidence in support for the idea
that business cycles are driven by shifts in aggregate demand. The same idea is corroborated by recent work that exploits the
regional variation in business cycles, such as Mian and Suﬁ (2014) and Beraja et al. (2016), as well as by work that exploits
survey evidence, such as Bachmann and Zorn (2018). Note that this evidence is separate from the one regarding either
price rigidity or the real effects of monetary policy. The latter kind of evidence is not in dispute, but are also not necessarily
related to the points I wish to make here.

                                                                1
framework, which made more ad hoc assumptions on behavior, downplayed the role of expectations,
and was severely vulnerable to the Lucas critique (Lucas, 1976). They help deﬁne the “natural” rate
of interest and the “output gap,” central elements of the modern theory of monetary policy. And
they help explain the theoretical constructs that macroeconomists often use as proxies for shifts in
consumer spending and aggregate demand, such as shocks to the discount factor of the consumers.
       Such shocks should not be taken literally. They help mimic within simple models the effects of, say,
a credit crunch on the consumers (Eggertsson and Krugman, 2012; Guerrieri and Lorenzoni, 2017),
an increase in precautionary savings (Challe et al., 2017), or pessimistic beliefs about future income
(Lorenzoni, 2009). According to the Keynesian narrative, any of these forces translates into a drop in
aggregate demand, which in turn triggers a recession, that is, a joint reduction in employment, output,
consumption and investment.
       Building on these points, Subsection 2.2 reviews why this narrative is at odds with the neoclassical,
or Real Business Cycle (RBC), framework. By reducing the demand for goods today relative to goods
tomorrow, a negative discount-rate shock triggers a drop in consumer spending. But it also depresses
the price of goods today relative to goods tomorrow, which in turn encourages the ﬁrms to invest
more. Furthermore, insofar as the households have an urge for consuming less of all goods today (as
when they face tighter credit constraints), they also have an incentive to work more. As a result, the
drop in consumer spending is accompanied by a boom in employment, output, and investment.
       Although it may be tempting to discard this prediction as empirically implausible, there is an im-
portant lesson to take home. The main limitation of the baseline RBC model is also its main strength:
it assumes no departure from the Arrow-Debreu framework, no market failure, and seemingly noth-
ing more than the elementary assumptions that underlie the most familiar picture from microeco-
nomics, namely that of a downward-sloping demand curve intersecting with an upward-slopping
supply curve.5 It follows that the inconsistency of the Keynesian narrative with the baseline RBC
model is proof of how subtle this narrative is. It may appear self-evident from a PE perspective, but it
falls apart in a basic, micro-founded GE context.
       To salvage the Keynesian narrative, and to make sense of the related evidence, additional assump-
tions are needed.6 In the New Keynesian model, the key assumptions are the following. First, there is
   5
      By saying “seemingly,” I anticipate the following point. The easily recognizable assumptions of the RBC framework,
which are familiar from microeconomics, are price-taking behavior, individual optimization, rational expectations, and
market clearing. A more delicate assumption, which my work relaxes, is common knowledge of the current state of the
economy and common belief of its future prospects.
    6
      Early attempts to reconcile the Keynesian narrative with micro-founded, rational-expectations settings included the
literature on multiple equilibria and sunspot ﬂuctuations, which I discuss in the sequel, and the works of Lucas (1972,
1973) and Barro (1976, 1978) on nominal confusion and unexpected monetary shocks. These works, which built on the
Friedman’s notion of the “natural rate” (Friedman, 1968), sough to explain why an apparent trade off between unemployment
and inﬂation—a Philips curve—could be present in the data and, yet, could not be exploited by monetary policy in a
systematic way. By contrast, the New Keynesian framework, which eventually dominated over the alternatives and which I
am concerned with in this article, assumes that there is an exploitable structural relation between inﬂation and real economic
activity, in the form of the New Keynesian Philips curve. I discuss the central position that this relation plays in the theory
and some discomforting evidence about it in Subsection 2.5.



                                                              2
a constraint in how fast nominal prices (or nominal wages) can adjust to aggregate shocks; in macro
jargon, “prices are sticky” or there is “nominal rigidity”. Second, the policy maker is unable to render
this constraint non-binding; in macro jargon, “monetary policy does not replicate ﬂexible prices”. I
ﬁll in the equations that explain the words in Subsection 2.4.
       These assumptions are realistic. But they are not part of the demand-and-supply picture that is
familiar from microeconomics, underscoring the subtlety of the Keynesian narrative. They also lead
to three empirical challenges. First, the model is able to generate realistic business cycles out of shocks
to consumer or ﬁrm spending only with the help of additional, more dubious, “bells and whistles”
(more on this later). Second, the microeconomic data on prices do not necessarily justify the macro-
level rigidity that the quantitative versions of the model require in order make sense of the observed
business cycles. Third, the model depends on a Philips curve, but the evidence about old and new
Philips curves is discomforting, to say the least.
       In addition to these empirical challenges, the New Keynesian framework suffers, at least in my
view, from an inherent conceptual defect: the only way one is allowed to make sense of demand-
driven ﬂuctuations within that framework is, in effect, by equating a drop in aggregate demand with a
monetary contraction. By this I mean a contraction relative to the benchmark of replicating ﬂexible-
price allocations.
       This is at odds with a long tradition that sought to understand recessions as the product of coordi-
nation failures and of disruptive GE feedback loops, which can be active even when prices are ﬂexible.
See the seminal contributions of Diamond (1982) and Cass and Shell (1983) and the large subsequent
literature that captured these ideas in models featuring multiple equilibria and sunspot ﬂuctuations.7
In my view, this literature was after something real and important, which the New Keynesian model
assumes away mostly because of the inconvenience of working with multiple-equilibrium models.
       This background explains both the empirical motivation behind my work on business cycles and
its position in the literature. When I look at the available evidence, I feel compelled to accommodate
the concept of demand-driven business cycles while abstracting from nominal rigidity and/or con-
straints on monetary policy.8 And when I think of the workings of large, decentralized, market-based
economies, I gravitate towards theories that give a central position to coordination.
       In a series of co-authored papers, I have thus expounded a new theoretical approach, one that
shifts the focus from nominal rigidity to frictional coordination. By this, however, I do not mean a
coordination failure in the sense of multiple equilibria. Instead, I mean the accommodation of the
idea that the agents may have an imperfect, and idiosyncratic, understanding of one another’s behavior,
of the current state of the economy, and of its future prospects.
   7
    E..g., Woodford (1991), Guesnerie and Woodford (1993) and Benhabib and Farmer (1994, 1999).
   8
    As already mentioned, the older literature on coordination failures and sunspot ﬂuctuations also tried to rationalize
demand-driven ﬂuctuations without nominal rigidities. Recent works aimed at the same goal include Beaudry and Portier
(2013), Benhabib et al. (2015) and Bai et al. (2017). Related is also the theory of demand shocks developed in Lorenzoni
(2009), although that one hinges on nominal rigidity.



                                                           3
       From a game-theoretic perspective, this imperfection amounts to removing common knowledge
of the state of the economy9 and introducing higher-order uncertainty, that is, uncertainty about the
beliefs and actions of others. Such uncertainty can be the by-product of either the decentralization
of market interactions, along the lines of Lucas (1972), Townsend (1983), and Prescott and Rios-Rull
(1992), or of rational inattention and costly contemplation, along the lines of Sims (2003, 2010) and
Tirole (2015).10 One way or another, the key for my purposes is to accommodate the possibility that
economic agents are unable to coordinate their expectations and their behavior with the same level
of ﬁnesse as that presumed in workhorse macroeconomic models.
       The considered friction has the ﬂavor of a coordination failure. But whereas the traditional formal-
ization of this notion provided in Diamond (1982), Cass and Shell (1983) and the related literature
relies on selecting one among many equilibria, the formalization adopted in my work does not. It can
therefore be embedded in models featuring a unique equilibrium, including the textbook versions of
the RBC and New Keynesian frameworks. And it can be thought of as an endemic feature of any
realistic, decentralized, market-based economy.
       In Section 3, I review how this friction helps make sense of the Keynesian narrative within the RBC
framework. This is accomplished in two distinct but complementary ways. In the one, I introduce
a new kind of shocks, which cause extrinsic shifts in higher-order beliefs and ultimately rationalize
waves of pessimism and optimism about the short-term economic outlook (Angeletos and La’O, 2013;
Angeletos et al., 2015). In the other, I refrain from the introduction of such shocks and, instead, show
how the considered friction modiﬁes the propagation of familiar forms of demand shocks (Angeletos
and Lian, 2017b).
       Either way, the Keynesian narrative is disconnected from nominal rigidity. By the same token, the
focus is shifted from constraints on monetary policy, such as the zero lower bound, to the difﬁculty
agents face in digesting what’s going on in the economy and in coordinating their beliefs and actions.
A new perspective therefore emerges about the Great Recession. Perhaps the kind of demand shocks
documented in Mian and Suﬁ (2014) contributed to a recession for different reasons than those pre-
sumed in the standard model (namely, sticky prices and the zero lower bound on monetary policy).
And perhaps this also explains why the Great Recession was not the Great Deﬂation.11
       In these regards, my approach can be viewed as a substitute for the New Keynesian framework. But
   9
      Note that common knowledge of an event or a property X means, not only that everybody knows X (ﬁrst-order knowl-
edge), but also that everybody knows that everybody knows X (second-order knowledge), that everybody knows that ev-
erybody knows that everybody knows X (third-order knowledge), and so on.
   10
      Such “micro-foundations” of higher-order uncertainty are interchangeable for my purposes. I adopt the ﬁrst approach
in Angeletos and La’O (2013) and Angeletos and Lian (2017a), the second in Angeletos and La’O (2011) and Angeletos and
Sastry (2017), and a mixture in Angeletos and Lian (2016a). See also Angeletos et al. (2015) and Angeletos and Lian (2017a)
for how similar goals can be achieved by relaxing the rational-expectations and common-prior assumptions.
   11
      Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015b) seek to reconcile the facts with the New Keynesian model by documenting that
expectations of inﬂation, as measured in surveys, did not turn negative during the Great Recession. But this leaves unan-
swered the question of why expectations did not move as the model predicts. For an attempt to offer a complete explanation
within the New Keynesian framework, see Christiano et al. (2015).

it can also serve as a powerful complement to it. This is true, not only because the formalizations of
demand-driven ﬂuctuations described above are consistent with—albeit not dependent on—nominal
rigidity, but also because of the following two reasons. First, the considered friction can modify the
propagation mechanisms and the policy predictions of the New Keynesian framework in empirically
appealing ways. Second, the same friction can offer a micro-foundation for some of the more dubious
bells and whistles of that framework. These points deﬁne the theme of Section 4.
    To be concrete, consider the response of the economy to news about future monetary policy
(“forward guidance”) during a liquidity trap. In the New Keynesian framework, such news have large
effects on current outcomes because they trigger large shifts in the expectations that consumers and
ﬁrms form about the behavior of others and, thereby, about aggregate spending and inﬂation.
    These predictions are at odds with the available empirical evidence, a challenge known in the
literature as the “forward guidance puzzle” (Del Negro et al., 2012; McKay et al., 2016). But a variant
of this puzzle appears to apply more generally: the macroeconomic times series indicate small and
sluggish responses of both inﬂation and the real quantities to a variety of identiﬁed shocks.12 What
is more, the sluggishness in the response of the actual outcomes appears to be accompanied by an
even larger sluggishness in the response of expectations (e.g., Coibion and Gorodnichenko, 2012,
2015a) and the adjustment friction appears to be larger at the macro level than at the micro level (e.g.,
Havranek et al., 2017).
    My approach offers a parsimonious explanation to these salient features of the data. The prevailing
paradigm assumes that the underlying shocks, or news, and their likely effects on economic outcomes
such as inﬂation and income are common knowledge. Once this assumption is relaxed, expectations
of future outcomes become anchored to past outcomes. This is because the agents lack conﬁdence
that the other agents will adjust their beliefs and behavior in response to the available news. As a
result, the economy behaves as if the agents were myopic in the sense of discounting the inﬂuence
of the underlying shocks on future economic outcomes (Angeletos and Lian, 2016a). This lessens the
forward guidance puzzle, offers a rationale for the front loading of ﬁscal stimuli, and slows down the
recovery of the economy from a recession once “good news” start arriving.
    In addition, the considered friction causes the economy to behave as if the agents were backward-
looking and were pegging their current choices on past outcomes. This property is the manifestation
of the gradual adjustment in higher-order beliefs over time. As a result, my approach provides a micro-
foundation of some of the more dubious bells and whistles that the New Keynesian framework has
relied on in order to generate realistic business cycles and to match the macroeconomic data, such
as certain forms of habit in consumption and adjustment costs in investment, or the so-called hybrid
version of the New Keynesian Philips curve (Angeletos and Huo, 2018).
   12
      For instance, Gali (1999) documents a sluggish response of real quantities to identiﬁed technology shocks, while Chris-
tiano et al. (2005) document a sluggish response of both the real quantities and inﬂation to identiﬁed monetary shocks. See
also the complementary discussion in Sims (2003).




                                                             5
      Last but not least, because expectations of future outcomes work through GE mechanisms, an-
choring the former is akin to dulling the latter (Angeletos and Lian, 2016a, 2017a). This helps reduce
the distance between the predictions of fully-ﬂedged macroeconomic models and the underlying PE
intuitions—perhaps the simplistic, PE logic about demand and supply is not as misleading after all.
      Remark 1. Informational frictions have interesting effects even in a single-agent decision context.
This article, however, is focused on the additional, and distinct, effects that arise in multiple-agent
contexts from the interaction of information frictions with GE mechanisms, or with strategic com-
plementarity. This interaction is at the core of the literatures on global games and beauty contests,
which followed the contributions of Morris and Shin (1998, 2001, 2002, 2003) and Woodford (2003).
For a synthesis of these literatures and additional references, I refer the reader to my chapter in the
Handbook of Macroeconomics (Angeletos and Lian, 2016b). Complementary is also the literature on
rational inattention (Sims, 2003, 2010).
      Remark 2. Informational frictions can rationalize monetary non-neutrality even in the absence
of sticky prices and menu costs. This an important point, which goes back to Lucas (1972, 1973)
and Barro (1976, 1978) and has been revisited by Mankiw and Reis (2002), Woodford (2003), and
Mackowiak and Wiederholt (2009). This, however, is not the theme of this article.


2      Aggregate Demand and the Business Cycle: It’s Complicated

In this section, I review a few elementary lessons from modern (post-IS-LM) macroeconomics that are
relevant for my purposes. I ﬁrst explain the difﬁculty in extrapolating from familiar, PE intuitions about
demand and supply to their GE counterparts. I next show that the Keynesian narrative ﬁnds no place
within an elementary, two-period, GE model, which is essentially a stripped down version of the RBC
framework. I ﬁnally review how this notion is formalized within the New Keynesian framework and
discuss some of the challenges with this formalization.


2.1     Back to the Basics

The most familiar ﬁgure in economics is probably the one that illustrates the demand for, and the
supply of, an arbitrary good. Letting q denote the quantity of that good and p its price, we can express
its demand and its supply as, respectively,

                                 q = D(p, Xd )     and      q = S(p, Xs ),

where X = (Xd , Xs ) are all the other factors that affect demand and supply, such as the prices of
all other goods, the consumers’ tastes and income, and the ﬁrms’ technologies. Partial equilibrium is
deﬁned by equating demand and supply, holding X constant. This is represented by the intersection
of the two solid lines in Figure 1.


                                                    6

                                                                              S



                                                                           D

                                                                                   q

                                Figure 1: Demand Shocks in Partial Equilibrium


       In this PE context, a negative demand shock means a leftward shift in the demand curve, D,
induced by a change in some of the factors in X, holding the supply curve, S , constant. Assuming
that the former is downward sloping and the latter is upward sloping, both the equilibrium quantity
and the equilibrium price fall.
       This is, of course, trivial. But how can one extrapolate from this picture to what macroeconomists
mean when they say that business cycles are driven by aggregate demand shocks? It might be tempting
to do this by changing notation from lower-case variables, q and p, to upper-case variables, Q and P.
But one has to be careful what the latter mean.
       When we talk about demand and supply at the micro level, there are always some other goods
and some other markets in the background: the little p in Figure 1 is the price of one good relative
to that of all other goods in the economy. If the big Q were an index of all the goods in a Arrow-
Debreu economy, then the big P would have to be the price of that index relative to itself, which is
tautologically one. To have a meaningful extrapolation from Figure 1 to a macroeconomic context, it
therefore has to be that Q captures only some of the goods in an Arrow-Debreu economy and that P
is their price relative to the rest of the goods.
       In the light of this elementary point, a standard practice in modern macroeconomics is to consider
multi-period settings, to emphasize forward-looking behavior, and to interpret Q as an index of the
goods produced and consumed today and P as their price relative to the goods produced and con-
sumed tomorrow; that is, the relevant P from a GE perspective is the real interest rate. By the same
token, a shock to aggregate demand means a shock in the demand for goods today relative to the
demand for goods.13
       How should we think about a “drop in aggregate demand” from this GE perspective? To be con-
  13
     This GE perspective differs from that of the IS-LM framework, which represents aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate
supply (AS) as functions of the nominal price level. Friedman (1968), Lucas (1972, 1973) and Barro (1976, 1978) sought to
make sense of a AD-AS picture in terms of an expectations-augmented Philips curve, in effect by interpreting the variable
in the vertical axis as the gap between the actual and the perceived, or expected, nominal price level. The New Keynesian
framework blends the IS-LM and the GE perspectives by emphasizing the role of forward-looking behavior and the impor-
tance of the real interest rate on the demand side, while representing aggregate supply in terms of the New Keynesian Philips
Curve. In this article, I prefer to stick with the “pure” GE perspective that looks at aggregate demand and aggregate supply
in terms of the real interest rate, rather than the price level or inﬂation, even when I allow for nominal rigidity.

crete, consider the drop in consumer spending during the Great Recession. The evidence in Mian
et al. (2013) and Mian and Suﬁ (2014) suggests that this drop was triggered by a sharp tightening in
consumer credit and by deleveraging. For the present purposes, however, it sufﬁces to abstract from
the precise trigger of a drop in consumer spending and, instead, proxy it with an exogenous discount-
rate shock, that is, a shock to inter-temporal preferences. By causing a sudden “urge” to consume less
today relative to tomorrow, a negative discount-rate shock can mimic, at least qualitatively, the effect
of tighter consumer credit on consumer spending.14
      Let us take such a shock for granted and let us ask how it propagates in the economy, how it
affects all the macroeconomic quantities of interest. To answer this question, it is useful to consider
the minimal GE model for the job. This model has a representative household, which means that I
abstract from heterogeneity. It has two periods, “today” and “tomorrow,” and three goods, leisure
today, consumption today, and consumption tomorrow. A minimalistic GE model of this kind can be
found in Barro (1997), Angeletos and Lian (2017b), and elsewhere.
      The employed model is deliberately simple. Having two periods is of essence so that we can
talk meaningfully about shifts in aggregate demand, that is, in the demand for goods today relative to
tomorrow. Having both a consumption-leisure and a consumption-saving choice in the ﬁrst period
allows the model to shed light on whether demand and supply shocks can trigger comovement in
employment, consumption, and investment. Abstracting from such choices in the second period is
only for simplicity.
      In the sequel, I study two versions of this simple model. In the ﬁrst, prices are ﬂexible and monetary
policy is neutral; this can be thought of as a stripped-down version of the RBC framework. In the
second, nominal prices are rigid and monetary policy is non-neutral; this represents a stripped-down
version of the New Keynesian framework.


2.2     Demand Shocks in the RBC Framework

I now set up the neoclassical, or RBC, version of my minimalist model. There is a representative
household, living two periods, t ∈ {1, 2}. Her preferences are given by

                                              θU (c1 , ℓ1 ) + U (c2 , ℓ2 ),                                         (1)

where U and u are strictly increasing and strictly concave, ct and ℓt denote, respectively, consumption
and leisure in period t, for t ∈ {1, 2}, and θ is an exogenous preference parameter that determines
how much the household values goods today vs goods tomorrow. Without serious loss of generality,
I assume that U (c, ℓ) = u(c) + v(ℓ), where u and v are strictly increasing and strictly concave. I also
  14
     The use of discount-rate shocks as proxies for changes to consumer-credit conditions is quite common in the macroe-
conomics literature. See, for example, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), Werning (2012) and Christiano et al. (2015). For
more realistic treatments, see Eggertsson and Krugman (2012), Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2017), and Challe et al. (2017).



                                                           8
impose ℓ2 = ℓ̄2 , for some exogenous ℓ̄2 , so that can I concentrate on labor supply and employment
ﬂuctuations in the ﬁrst period.
       Consider next the production side of the economy. In each period, a representative ﬁrm uses
capital and labor to produce the ﬁnal good according to a Cobb-Douglas technology. Output in
periods 1 and 2 is therefore given by, respectively,

                                  y1 = AF (k1 , n1 )         and       y2 = F (k2 , n2 ) ,                                (2)

where kt and nt are the amounts of capital and labor in period t, F (k, n) = k α n1−α , α ∈ (0, 1), and
A is an exogenous parameter that measures the total factor productivity (TFP) in the ﬁrst period.
       To close the model, note that, in the ﬁrst period, the household can either consume her income
or save it into capital to be used in the second period.15 But since the second period is the last period
of the household’s life, the household will consume all its income and all accumulated capital in that
period. Assuming that depreciation is zero, we can thus write the resource constraint of the economy
in, respectively, periods 1 and 2 as follows:

                                   c1 + k2 = y1 + k1           and       c2 = y2 + k2 ,                                   (3)

These conditions represent also market clearing in the product markets. The labor markets, on the
other hand, clear if and only if

                                       n1 = 1 − ℓ1          and       n2 = 1 − ℓ̄2 ,                                      (4)

where the total endowment of time has been normalized to 1. Finally, let i1 ≡ k2 − k1 denote the
investment in the ﬁrst period.
       The model described above allows one to generate variation in the equilibrium outcomes by in-
troducing variation in θ and A. If θ falls, the representative household wants to consume less today
relative to tomorrow. In this sense, a lower θ represents a negative demand shock. By contrast, a
lowerA can be interpreted as a negative supply shock. The question addressed in the rest of this
section is how the ﬁrst-period equilibrium outcomes respond to each of these shocks.16
       As long as the First Welfare Theorem applies (which is the case here, we can understand the com-
petitive equilibrium and address the aforementioned question by solving a simple planning problem:
that of maximizing (1) subject to (2)-(4). The optimality conditions of this problem, and the prices that
  15
      As standard in macro, I assume household owns the capital and rents it to the ﬁrm; with complete markets, it does not
matter whether the capital is owned by the household or the ﬁrm.
   16
      I am abstracting from news and noise shocks, that is, shocks to beliefs of tomorrow’s productivity (Beaudry and Portier,
2006). Such shocks, too, are unable to generate realistic business cycles in either the fully-ﬂedged RBC model or the two-
period variant studied here. This explains why the literature has combined such shocks with exotic features in preferences
(Jaimovich and Rebelo, 2009) or a departure from ﬂexible prices (Lorenzoni, 2009; Barsky and Sims, 2011).

support the planner’s solution as part of a competitive equilibrium, are given by the following:

                                                v ′ (ℓ1 )
                                                          = w = Fn (k1 , n1 )                                             (5)
                                                u′ (c1 )

                                          θu′ (c1 )
                                                    = 1 + r = 1 + Fk (k2 , n2 )                                           (6)
                                           u′ (c2 )
where w denotes the real wage in the ﬁrst period and r denotes the real interest rate between the two
periods (this is the big P in our earlier discussion).17
       These conditions have a familiar interpretation from microeconomics. The planner equates the
marginal rates of substitution (MRS) of any pair of commodities, be it the consumption-leisure bundle
in the ﬁrst period or the consumption levels in the two periods, with the corresponding marginal rates
of transformation (MRT). The competitive equilibrium replicates the solution to the planning problem
by having the household equate the MRS of any two commodities with their relative price and the
ﬁrms equate the latter with the corresponding MRTs.
       The solution to the system of equations (3)-(6) pins down the planner’s optimum or, equivalently,
the equilibrium. By investigating how this solution varies as we vary θ and A, we can then shed light
on the macroeconomic effects of, respectively, demand and supply shocks.18
       Consider ﬁrst a negative supply shock, that is, a drop in A. This triggers a temporary drop in
output and income. Because of the desire to smooth consumption, this is absorbed partly by a drop in
consumption and partly by a drop in saving and hence in investment. Provided the substitution effect
on labor supply dominates the wealth effect, which is the empirically relevant case and the case that I
assume here, employment also falls. This effectively reviews the RBC model, in which recessions are
explained by adverse supply shocks.
       What about a negative demand shock, that is, a drop in θ? When θ falls, consumers have an “urge
for saving,” so consumption today goes down. But employment, output, and investment go up!
       Why is this happening? From the perspective of the planner, the drop in the desire to consume
today frees up resources for investment, even if we hold employment and output ﬁxed. Moreover, the
reduction in θ means a drop in the relative demand for all the goods consumed today, including leisure.
This stimulates employment and output. All in all, a drop in consumer spending is accompanied by
a boom in employment, output, and investment, not by a recession.19
  17
      The second condition does not contain an expectation operator because I have abstracted from uncertainty.
  18
      Strictly speaking, I am only conducting comparative statics with respect to the parameters θ and A. But the insights
developed here directly extend to the impulse responses of the fully-ﬂedged RBC model.
   19
      Note that the argument rests on modeling the demand shock as a shift in inter-temporal preferences, holding constant the
intra-temporal preferences between consumption and leisure. A shock to the latter kind of preferences represents, instead, a
shock to the supply of labor. Such a shock can generate positive co-movement between employment, output, consumption
and investment, but it does not offer a compelling explanation of the observed business cycles. (The Great Recession was
not the Great Vacation.) Note, however, that such a shock is formally equivalent to a shock in the labor wedge and that this
wedge appears to be highly cyclical in the data. This underscores why any theory that aspires to improve upon the RBC
model must ultimately explain the observed cyclicality of the labor wedge (Chari et al., 2007).



                                                             10
     The “magic” that translates this property from the planner’s solution to the competitive equilibrium
lies in the adjustment of two relative prices, the real interest rate and the real wage. As consumers try
to spend less on goods today, the real interest rate—which is the relative price of these goods—falls.
This stimulates the demand for investment. The shock therefore causes a drop in one component of
the demand for goods today and an increase in another. Finally, as the household tries to consume
less leisure today, the real wage—which is the relative price of leisure—falls. This encourages the
ﬁrms to employ more workers and produce more goods today, which means that the supply of goods
actually increases.
     The equilibrium adjustment is illustrated in Figure 2. This ﬁgure is the GE analogue of Figure 1.
On the horizontal axis, we have the aggregate quantity of goods today. On the vertical, we have their
relative price, namely the real interest rate. The two AS curves represent the aggregate supply of goods
before and after the shock; the two AD curves represent the corresponding aggregate demands.

                           Figure 2: Demand Shocks in General Equilibrium

     For given θ, the AS curve is obtained as follows. First, combine the optimal labor-supply condition
of the household and the Euler condition to get labor supply as a function of the real wage and the real
interest rate. Next, note that labor supply increases with the real interest rate because of intertemporal
substitution. Finally, use the optimal labor-demand condition of the ﬁrm to solve out for the real
wage. This gives the quantity of labor that clears the labor market and the resulting supply of goods
as increasing functions of the real interest rate.
     The AD curve, on the other hand, is given by the sum of the ﬁrm’s demand for investment and the
household’s demand for consumption. The former is decreasing in r due to the diminishing marginal
product of capital. The latter obtains from the household’s Euler condition and is decreasing in r
because of intertemporal substitution.
     What happens as θ falls from θ1 to θ2 ? Holding r constant, the demand for investment remains
unaffected, but the demand for consumption falls. This leads the AD curve to shift left. At the same
time, because the urge for saving (or the tighter consumer credit) stimulates labor supply, the AS curve
shifts right. All in all, the equilibrium r falls, from r1∗ to r2∗ , and the equilibrium y increases, from y1∗
to y2∗ .

                                                      11
       This further clariﬁes why the PE logic is misleading: in GE, the negative demand shock is, in effect,
also a positive supply shock, due to the aforementioned labor-supply response. One can devise a vari-
ant in which the stimulating effect of the θ shock on labor supply is shut down while its contractionary
effect on the demand for consumption is preserved.20 Even in that variant, however, investment would
move in the opposite direction than consumption, implying that the model cannot generate a realistic
recession in response to the shock.21
       To sum up, making sense of the Keynesian narrative requires one to move beyond the most basic
principles of microeconomics: one must allow for something additional, something more subtle.
In the New Keynesian framework, which I review next, this extra ingredient is the combination of
nominal rigidity with certain “mistakes,” or constraints, in the conduct of monetary policy. In the
alternative that I favor, it is a certain imperfection in how well the agents understand what’s going on
in the economy, modeled as lack of common knowledge and higher-order uncertainty.


2.3      Parenthesis: Demand Shocks, TFP, and the Labor Wedge

Before ﬁlling in the details, let me clarify the following point. It is possible to generate, within the
RBC model, positive co-movement out of demand shocks if one transforms the latter to movements
in either TFP or the labor wedge.
       To understand what I mean by the ﬁrst scenario, consider the model described above and suppose
that A happens to be an increasing function of θ. Then, provided that a drop in θ comes together
with a sufﬁciently large drop in A, it is clearly possible that a drop in θ triggers a recession. This
is essentially route taken by Bai et al. (2017): that paper develops an extension of the RBC model
that adds search frictions in commodity markets and lets preference shocks generate endogenous
movements in measured TFP.
       To understand what I mean by the second scenario, note ﬁrst the labor wedge is deﬁned as the gap
between the marginal product of labor and the MRS between consumption and leisure. In the model
described above, this gap is zero. To accommodate a non-zero labor wedge, we must thus replace
the planner’s intra-temporal condition with the following variant:

                                           v ′ (ℓ1 )
                                                     = (1 − τ1 ) AFn (k1 , n1 ),                                       (7)
                                           u′ (c1 )

where τ1 ̸= 0. Taken literally, τ1 can be interpreted as a tax on labor demand or labor supply. More
broadly, it captures any distortion that drives the relevant MRS and MRT apart. Note then that, holding
  20
     For instance, suppose there are two groups of households, called 1 and 2, and suppose that the only group 1 supplies
labor in the ﬁrst period. Suppose next that that the θ shock affects only group 2. Then, the shock affects aggregate demand
by affecting the consumption of group 2, but does not affect aggregate supply.
  21
     Unless, of course, the model is augmented with some other mechanism—such as pessimistic beliefs about the future
or aggravated ﬁnancial frictions on the side of the ﬁrms—that causes the demand for investment to fall in tandem with the
demand consumption.



                                                           12
both θ and A constant, an increase in τ1 generates a joint drop in employment, output, consumption
and investment.22 It follows that any modiﬁcation of the considered model that lets a demand shock
to act, in effect, as an increase in τ1 will do the job.
       Both the New Keynesian framework and my proposed alternative can be understood under these
lenses: they let a drop in θ, or a drop in “consumer conﬁdence” (properly deﬁned), trigger an increase
in the realized labor wedge.23 But is there a good reason to prefer this kind of approach to the one that
lets the demand shock become a technology shock? Yes. The bulk of the employment ﬂuctuations in
the data is orthogonal to the ﬂuctuations in TFP and labor productivity. It follows that an empirically
successful theory of demand-driven ﬂuctuations is, not one that transforms the demand shock to a
technology shock, but rather one that transforms the demand shock to a labor-wedge shock.
       This is also a key challenge of a recent line of work that generates business cycles out of “un-
certainty shocks” (shocks to second moments) in extensions of the RBC model that allow for ﬁrm
heterogeneity and adjustment costs (Bloom, 2009; Bloom et al., 2012). These models hinge on gen-
erating strong co-movement between aggregate employment and aggregate TFP, a property that is at
odds with the data.


2.4      Demand Shocks in the New Keynesian Framework

The New Keynesian framework departs from the baseline RBC framework by adding monopoly power
and, most importantly, nominal rigidity. Firms are price-setters, rather than prices takers, and adjust
their nominal prices only periodically. This makes monetary policy non-neutral. As a result, we can
no longer answer the question of how the economy responds to an aggregate demand shock without
specifying how monetary policy itself responds to that shock.
       There is, however, an important policy benchmark that sheds light on how the model works more
generally. This corresponds to a monetary policy that “replicates ﬂexible prices,” that is, one that
implements the same real outcomes as those that would have obtained in the absence of nominal
rigidity. Insofar as monetary policy does not have to substitute for missing tax instruments, such a
policy is actually optimal (Correia et al., 2008). But even when such a policy is sub-optimal, or just
infeasible, the benchmark deﬁned by it is instrumental for understanding whether and how the New
Keynesian model can accommodate the desired narrative.
       Before proceeding, let me reiterate that my discussion of the New Keynesian model in this subsec-
tion, just as my review of the RBC model in the previous subsection, is centered around the questions
of “what are the equations that explain the words” or “how the model works.” This may sound less
exciting than the question of “how the real world works.” But the latter question is ill deﬁned, for it
  22
      In a PE context, a tax on labor can have offsetting substitution and income effects. In the GE context under consideration,
however, τ1 has only a substitution effect: it drives a wedge between MRS and MRT without affecting the resource constraint
of the economy. This explains why an increase in τ1 unambiguously reduces n1 , y1 , c1 and i1 (= k2 ).
   23
      Note that the labor wedge, as deﬁned above, combines the wedge between the real wage and the marginal product of
labor (what is the markup in the New Keynesian framework) and the wedge between the real wage and the MRS.


                                                              13
is only through the endless back-and-forth between models and data that we develop a meaningful
understanding of how the real world works. This explains my obsession with the precise manner in
which the New Keynesian model accommodates demand-driven business cycles.
       When monetary policy replicates ﬂexible prices, the New Keynesian model reduces, in effect, to
the RBC model. It follows that the New Keynesian framework is unable to make sense of the desired
narrative unless monetary policy deviates from that benchmark.
       How can such deviation help the model accommodate the desired narrative? By letting the exoge-
nous drop in consumer spending transform, in effect, to a negative monetary shock. By this I mean
that monetary policy has to contract relative to the aforementioned benchmark.
       Let me elaborate. Because of the monopoly power and the nominal rigidity, the equilibrium of
the economy no more coincides with the planner’s solution studied in Subsection 2.2. Accordingly,
conditions (5) and (6) no more hold. Instead, the following variants hold:

                                            v ′ (ℓ1 )     1
                                              ′
                                                      =w=    AFn (k1 , n1 )                                             (8)
                                            u (c1 )       µ1

                                        θu′ (c1 )              1
                                          ′
                                                  = 1 + r = 1 + Fk (k2 , n2 )                                           (9)
                                         u (c2 )               µ2
where µt denotes (one plus) the realized monopoly markup in period t.
       Comparing conditions (8) and (9) to conditions (5) and (6), we see that the only difference is
the emergence of the markup µt as a wedge between the relevant MRSs and MRTs. In particular,
µ1 plays the same role as the labor wedge in Subsection 2.3, while µ2 shows up as a wedge in the
Euler condition. The intuition is familiar from microeconomics: monopoly distortions are akin to tax
distortions. What is important for our purposes, however, is that the New Keynesian framework lets
the realized monopoly distortion, µt , and the associated labor and Euler wedges be under the control
of monetary policy. This is where macroeconomics departs from microeconomics.24
       When prices are ﬂexible, µt can be higher than one, reﬂecting the monopoly distortion, but is
exogenous to monetary policy. Let µ∗t denote the equilibrium value of the markup that obtains under
ﬂexible prices (the “ideal” markup). A natural starting point is to assume that µ∗t is time- and state-
invariant. I adopt this assumption here in order to simplify the exposition: µ∗1 = µ∗2 = µ∗ , for some
ﬁxed µ∗ > 1. It then follows that, although the equilibrium may feature a lower level of employment
and output than the planner’s solution due to the monopoly distortion, it shares essentially the same
comparative statics with respect to either A or θ.
       When, instead, prices are sticky, the realized markup hinges on whether monetary policy adheres
  24
    I have suppressed two equilibrium conditions, which are not central for the arguments made in this subsection but
explain how monetary policy controls the realized markups. The one is the Euler condition for the nominal bond or,
equivalently, the Fischer equation: the real interest rate is equated to the nominal one net of the inﬂation rate. The other
condition is the New Keynesian Philips Curve, a structural equation that relates inﬂation to real output. By combining these
two conditions with conditions (8) and (9), one then sees how monetary policy can control jointly the realized markups,
the associated allocation, and the inﬂation rate by varying its policy instrument, the nominal interest rate.


                                                            14
to or deviates from the aforementioned policy benchmark. If monetary policy replicates ﬂexible prices,
the ﬁrms produce their ideal amount of output, the realized marginal cost equals the realized marginal
revenue, and the realized markup is just right (i.e, µt = µ∗ ). If, instead, monetary policy is expan-
sionary relative to that benchmark, the ﬁrms end up producing too much, the realized marginal cost
exceeds marginal revenue, and the realized markup is too low (i.e., µt < µ∗ ). And if monetary policy
is contractionary relative to that benchmark, the ﬁrms end up producing too little and the realized
markup is too high (i.e., µt > µ∗ ).
       Of course, the monetary authority controls µt only indirectly: by varying the nominal interest rate.
To illustrate, let me momentarily shut down investment, so that ct = yt and condition (9) is dropped.
Suppose further that production is linear in labor, so that F (k, n) = n = 1 − ℓ. Suppose further that
prices are completely rigid in the ﬁrst period but ﬂexible in the second. This means that the second-
period allocation is invariant to monetary policy, that µ2 = µ∗ , and that the second-period levels of
consumption and output are given by c∗2 = y2∗ = 1 − ℓ̄2 , where ℓ̄2 is the exogenously speciﬁed amount
of leisure. Then, conditions (8) and (9) can be written as follows:

                                 v ′ (1 − A1 c1 )   1                      θu′ (c1 )
                                                  =    A        and                   =1+r
                                        ′
                                      u (c1 )       µ1                      u′ (c∗2 )

where I used the facts that c1 = y1 = An1 and n1 = 1 − ℓ1 to replace v ′ (ℓ1 ) in the ﬁrst condition
with v ′ (1 − c1 /A). Finally, suppose that the monetary authority guarantees that the inﬂation rate in the
second period is zero, which means that r, the real interest rate between the two periods, moves one-
to-one the nominal interest rate. It is then evident that, by varying the latter, the monetary authority
can vary r and, thereby, also vary c1 and µ1 .25 , 26
       While this example is special, the logic applies more generally. Within the New Keynesian model,
the nominal rigidity plays a dual role. On the one hand, it shapes how real allocations respond to
shocks for a given monetary policy rule. On the other hand, it allows monetary policy to manipulate
real allocations and to serve as a substitute for taxation or market regulation: it is as if the realized
markup is a policy instrument under the control of the monetary authority.
       Let me now explain how this feature of the New Keynesian model helps accommodate the Key-
nesian narrative. Switch on investment and consider, once again, a drop in θ. As already noted, such
a negative demand shock triggers a boom in employment (n1 ), output (y1 ), and investment (i1 ) when
  25
      I am abstracting here from the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate, which translates to a lower bound on
the value of µ1 . Also note that, for expositional reasons, I have swept under the carpet the delicate issue of how exactly
the monetary authority guarantees that the inﬂation rate between the two periods is zero. This is easier to address in the
full-blown version of the New Keynesian model.
   26
      Clearly, there is a speciﬁc value for r, denoted here by r∗ , that induces µ1 to coincide with µ∗1 . This is the so-called
“natural rate of interest”: it is the one that replicates the underlying ﬂexible-price allocation. If r is lower than r∗ , the
induced µ1 is lower than µ∗ and, equivalently, c1 is higher than its ﬂexible-price counterpart. The converse is true if r is
higher than r∗ . A monetary policy that induces the real interest rate to be below (respectively, above) the “natural rate”
therefore induces an expansion (respectively, a contraction) relative to the ﬂexible-price benchmark. The magnitude of this
expansion (respectively, contraction) is a monotone transformation of the gap between µ1 and µ∗ .



                                                              15
the nominal rigidity is absent (as in the RBC setting of Subsection 2.2) or, equivalently, when monetary
policy replicates ﬂexible prices. As illustrated in Figure 2, this boom is associated with a drop in r∗ ,
the natural rate: as the demand for goods today falls, their relative price also falls.
       Suppose, now, that monetary policy fails to replicate ﬂexible prices and, instead, lets µ1 increase
as θ falls. This happens when the monetary authority does not allow the actual interest rate, r, to fall
as much as its ﬂexible-price counterpart, r∗ . For instance, consider Figure 2 and suppose that, as θ
falls from θ1 to θ2 , the monetary authority keeps the real interest rate constant at the pre-shock natural
level, r1∗ . Then clearly investment does not change and output, which is now demand-determined,
falls by exactly the same amount as the demand for consumption.
       In preventing the real interest rate from adjusting to r2∗ , the monetary authority triggers a contraction
relative to the underlying ﬂexible-price outcomes. It is therefore as if the monopoly distortion has been
intensiﬁed or a tax has been imposed on of ﬁrm sales. Other things equal, such a policy causes n1 and
y1 to fall. It follows that the increase in µ1 has exactly the opposite effect on employment and output
than the drop in θ has when prices are ﬂexible. To the extent that the increase in µ1 is sufﬁciently
large, the overall effect on employment, output, and even investment can be negative.27


2.5      Summary and Challenges

Let me review the lessons learned so far. In the RBC model, which is arguably the most elemen-
tary GE model one can think of, a negative demand shock, formalized as a surge in the desire to
save, generates a boom rather than a recession. The New Keynesian model shares this “pathological”
prediction if monetary policy replicates ﬂexible-price allocations (which, under certain conditions,
is actually the optimal thing to do). To accommodate the more plausible scenario that a negative
demand shock triggers a recession, the New Keynesian model has to assume that monetary policy
causes a contraction relative to the aforementioned benchmark. In this sense, the New Keynesian
model generates the desirable prediction only by transforming the underlying demand shock into a
contractionary monetary-policy shock.
       Is this mechanism empirically plausible? The answer to this question depends on whether one
focuses on the prediction that negative demand shocks trigger recessions or on the assumptions that
lead to this prediction. Throughout this article, I take for granted that the aforementioned prediction
is the “right” one (i.e., consistent with the facts). What I want to quibble about is the assumptions
that allow this prediction to obtain within the New Keynesian model and an additional prediction that
follows from these assumptions and is hard to reconcile with the data.
       Let me ﬁrst focus on the assumptions. The assumption that prices are sticky or, more broadly,
that there is some kind of nominal rigidity is supported by the available micro-economic evidence
  27
     For investment to fall with the drop in θ, it has to be that the associated increase in µ1 is even larger than the one required
for employment and output to fall, or that it is accompanied by an increase in µ2 . That is, either the current contraction in
monetary policy has to be sufﬁciently severe, or the contraction has to be sufﬁciently persistent.



                                                                16
(Klenow and Malin, 2010; Nakamura and Steinsson, 2008). Yet, even if there is signiﬁcant nominal
rigidity at the micro level, its bite at the macro level can be small because of the reason highlighted in
Caplin and Spulber (1987). When ﬁrms must pay a ﬁxed cost (a “menu cost”) in order to adjust their
prices, they will opt to adjust only infrequently; but they will also move their prices by a relatively
large amount whenever they adjust. As a result, the average adjustment in the price level following an
aggregate shock can be comparable to the one that would have obtained in the absence of nominal
rigidity, even if most of the ﬁrms don’t adjust prices most of the time. In a nutshell, monetary policy
could be neutral at the aggregate level even if there is signiﬁcant rigidity at the micro level.28
       More recently, Golosov and Lucas (2007) corroborated the empirical relevance of the above lesson
by quantifying the monetary non-neutrality implied by a basic menu-cost model calibrated to the
available microeconomic evidence and by showing this was signiﬁcantly smaller than the one typically
assumed in the New Keynesian framework. Subsequent work by Gertler and Leahy (2008), Nakamura
and Steinsson (2010), Midrigan (2011), Alvarez and Lippi (2014) and others has sought to qualify
or overturn Golosov and Lucas’s conclusions, highlighting how the implied level of monetary non-
neutrality depends on “details” such as the precise stochastic properties of the idiosyncratic shocks
to production costs or the number of products sold by each ﬁrm. All in all, however, it seems fair to
say that the debate on the quantitative importance of nominal price rigidity has not been settled. The
quantitative importance of nominal wage rigidity is another contentious issue in the literature.
       But even if one takes for granted that large nominal rigidity exists at the macro level, this is not
sufﬁcient for validating the New Keynesian formalization of demand-driven ﬂuctuations. This formal-
ization requires, not only monetary non-neutrality, but also sufﬁciently large countercyclical move-
ments in the gap between the realized markup, µt , and its ﬂexible-price counterpart, or, equivalently,
in the gaps of output, employment, and the real interest rate from their natural-rate counterparts.
       Unfortunately, these gaps are not directly observable. Any test of the empirical validity of the New
Keynesian formalization of demand-driven ﬂuctuations must therefore rely on strong assumptions
about how these gaps can be proxied in the data. This is essentially the same difﬁculty as the one
faced when trying to test the New Keynesian Philips Curve (NKPC). Let me elaborate.
       Deﬁne xt ≡ log µ∗t − log µt as the (negative of the) gap between the realized markup and its
ﬂexible-price counterpart. In the literature, this is often referred to as the real marginal cost. In the
inﬁnite-horizon New Keynesian model, the NKPC takes the following form:

                                                  πt = κxt + βEt [πt+1 ],                             (10)

or, by iterating,                                           [∞            ]
                                                             ∑
                                                                    k
                                                 πt = κEt          β xt+k ,                           (11)
                                                             k=0
  28

where πt denotes the inﬂation rate between period t − 1 and period t, Et [·] is the rational expectation
operator, κ > 0 is a ﬁxed scalar that parameterizes how responsive inﬂation is to innovations in the
aforementioned gap, or the real marginal cost, and β > 0 is the discount factor. In the simpliﬁed,
two-period version of the New Keynesian model used in this section, I have refrained from spelling
out the price-setting behavior of the ﬁrms. I can nevertheless proxy for the NKPC by letting monetary
policy replicate ﬂexible prices in the second period, so that µ2 = µ∗2 and x2 = 0, and by imposing
that the ﬁrst-period inﬂation rate is given by π1 = κx1 = κ (log µ∗1 − log µ1 ) .
       One way or another, the key observation is that, although the gap, xt , is not directly observable,
this gap oughts to manifest in inﬂation. This has a simple interpretation. Fix a period and consider a
ﬁrm that has the option to reset its price. The ﬁrm understands that it will likely be unable to adjust
its price for a while. The ﬁrm also understand that, for any given price, a higher level of demand
translates into a lower realized markup. To avoid such erosion in its realized markup, the ﬁrm sets a
higher price when it expects a higher level of demand. As this logic applies to all the ﬁrms that have
the option to reset, the price level today—and, equivalently, the inﬂation rate between yesterday and
today—is an increasing function of the expected gaps over the relevant horizon.
       This prediction is at the core of the New Keynesian model. If the bulk of the observed business
cycles are driven by ﬂuctuations in the gaps between sticky- and ﬂexible-price allocations, it has to be
that booms are periods of high inﬂation and recessions are periods of low inﬂation. What is more, the
converse is also true: according to the model, positive [respectively, negative] innovations in inﬂation
indicate positive [respectively, negative] innovations in the aforementioned gap.29
       Is this prediction borne by the data? As anticipated, answering this question is essentially the same
as testing the validity of the NKPC—or of the older Philips curve, which abstracted from expectations,
or of a number of variants that have appeared over the years in the literature. And the key challenge
is that the gap xt is not directly unobservable.
       Proxying xt with measures of the output gap published by the Fed reveals a major challenge: in-
ﬂation appears to be negatively related with the gap, which is the exact opposite of what the theory
requires. Gali and Gertler (1999) review this fact, argue that it is due to the poor quality of the consid-
ered empirical proxy, and proceed to offer alternative evidence in support of the NKCP. That evidence
relies on proxying xt with the labor share, an approach that rests on the untestable assumption that
the equilibrium labor share would been constant if prices had been ﬂexible.30 But even if one takes
for granted this assumption, the empirical relation between the labor share and inﬂation is weak.31
  29
      To be precise, these statements are valid as long as the gaps are positively correlated over time: if positive gaps today
are systematically followed by negative gaps tomorrow, inﬂation does not have to move with the current gap. I am ruling
out this theoretical possibility because I can see no empirical justiﬁcation for it. I am also ignoring variation in expectations
of the central bank’s long-term inﬂation target, because I doubt that this is plausible at the business-cycle frequency.
   30
      A closely related approach is taken in Sbordone (2002).
   31
      For instance, Angeletos et al. (2017) use a Structural VAR approach to document that, although more than 90% of the
variation of the labor share at business-cycle frequencies can be accounted by a single shock, this shock explains less than
5% of the corresponding variation in inﬂation. See also the complementary critique in King and Watson (2012).



                                                              18
       One can try to salvage the NKPC by arguing that most of the variation in inﬂation is driven, not by
variation in aggregate demand, but by the so-called cost-push shocks. To see what this means, rewrite
the NKPC as follows:
                                              πt = κx̂t + βEt πt+1 + ut ,

where x̂t is an empirical proxy for −µt and where ut is the cost-push shock, deﬁned in the baseline
model as κµ∗t . In more ﬂexible interpretations of the NKPC, ut could also capture measurement error,
variation in expectations of the central bank’s long-run inﬂation target, irrational mistakes in predicting
future inﬂation, and any other deviation from the theory. The data can then be described as follows:
the slope, κ, is almost zero and the residual, ut , accounts for almost all of the variation in πt . In line
with this observation, the extant DSGE literature (e.g., Smets and Wouters, 2007) attributes almost the
entirety of the inﬂation ﬂuctuations to implausible markup shocks.
       It is hard to view the above as empirical validation of the New Keynesian formalization of demand-
driven ﬂuctuations. One may counter-argue that I am taking the NKPC and its descendants too seri-
ously: perhaps the empirical failures of old and new Philips curves represent only an indication that
we lack a good theory of inﬂation, not an indication that we lack a good theory of the business cycle.
I am quite sympathetic to this view. Part of the work that I describe in Section 4 indeed seeks to ﬁx
some of the empirical failures of the New Keynesian model and especially of the NKPC. However,
because the New Keynesian model equates demand-driven business cycles to gaps, which in turn
are tied to inﬂation, it is quite delicate, if not incoherent, to claim that the model offers a satisfactory
theory of demand-driven business cycles when the NKPC fails rather spectacularly.32
       To sum up, when I digest the lessons of the literature, look at the aggregate time series, or try to
understand why the Great Recession was not the Great Deﬂation, I feel compelled to move beyond
the New Keynesian framework. And while I recognize the evidence about monetary non-neutrality,
as documented in the literature or apparent in episodes such as the Volker disinﬂation, I am not con-
vinced that nominal rigidity is the most essential reason for why demand shocks can trigger business
cycles. Instead, like Beaudry and Portier (2013) and the older tradition that emphasized the role
of coordination failures, I believe that the data demand a theory of non-inﬂationary demand-driven
ﬂuctuations. I review how my research offers such a theory in the next section.33
  32
      See also the review of the empirical literature on the NKPC in Mavroeidis et al. (2014) and the topical discussion in
Blanchard et al. (2015). Blanchard (2017) tries to salvage the natural-rate hypothesis as a gauge for monetary policy from
the failures of Philips curves, but I ﬁnd it hard to understand the one without the other.
   33
      Throughout this subsection, I have quibbled with the New Keynesian framework, and especially the NKPC, in order
to motivate the alternative theory reviewed in the next section. However, the friction I am concerned with also offers two
modiﬁcations of the NKPC that help improve its empirical performance. The one boils down to reducing the responsiveness
of inﬂation to news about real marginal costs and output gaps (Angeletos and Lian, 2016a; Angeletos and Huo, 2018;
Nimark, 2008). The other develops a micro-foundation of cost-push shocks in terms of correlated mistakes in expectations
(Angeletos and La’O, 2009). See also the discussion in Section 4 for additional ways in which frictions in information and
coordination can help improve the overall empirical performance of the New Keynesian framework.

3         Shifting the Focus from Nominal Rigidity to Frictional Coordination

The theory that I discuss in this section has two distinctive features. First, it reconciles the Keynesian
narrative with ﬂexible prices and, as result, allows it to be disconnected from the observed movements
in inﬂation. Second, it gives a central position to the idea that the coordination of beliefs and behavior
attained in the real world may be far less perfect than the one assumed in workhorse models of either
the RBC model or the New Keynesian type.
         I will elaborate on what I mean by the latter statement in a moment. But let me ﬁrst highlight
the connection to, and the difference from, an earlier literature that sought to capture the role of
coordination in models featuring multiple equilibria and sunspot ﬂuctuations.34 In this literature,
a coordination failure was said to obtain when one equilibrium was played rather than a “better”
one; and demand-driven business cycles were triggered by sunspots that caused shifts in equilibrium
outcomes without any shift in the underlying fundamentals such as preferences and technologies.
         This literature was quite live in the 80’s and early 90’s, as part of early attempts to salvage the
Keynesian narrative in the aftermath of the rational-expectations/RBC revolution. It nevertheless went
out of fashion over time, because of a number of reasons, including: the sensitivity of policy predic-
tions on seemingly arbitrary equilibrium selections; the delicate question of how one could conduct
quantitative analysis without knowing how to choose among the many equilibria; the lack of solid em-
pirical foundations; and the emergence and eventual dominance of the New Keynesian framework.
The latter shifted the focus away from coordination failure to nominal rigidity.
         My research during the last few years is devoted on shifting the focus back to coordination failure.
However, instead of equating coordination failure to equilibrium multiplicity, I equate it to lack of
common knowledge and higher-order uncertainty within unique-equilibrium models.
         Both the RBC framework and the New Keynesian framework—whether in the simpliﬁed forms I
described earlier on or the various richer forms found in the literature—impose that all agents in the
economy share the same information at all points of time. Together with rational expectations, this
implies that all agents can reach a “perfect consensus”, not only about the exogenous shocks hitting
the economy, but also about the endogenous state of the economy in the present and its likely path
in the future. In this sense, both the RBC and the New Keynesian framework impose that the agents
can perfectly coordinate their beliefs and actions along the equilibrium.
         By contrast, my research prevents such a perfect consensus by introducing heterogeneous infor-
mation and allowing the agents to face non-trivial higher-order uncertainty. This approach, which
builds heavily on Morris and Shin (1998, 2002, 2003) and Woodford (2003), helps accommodate the
notion of coordination failure in models that admit a unique equilibrium. It can be viewed as more
robust than the older approach that rested on multiple equilibria, because appropriate perturbations
    34
   See, inter alia, Diamond (1982); Cass and Shell (1983); Cooper and John (1988); Guesnerie and Woodford (1993);
Woodford (1991); Benhabib and Farmer (1994, 1999).



                                                       20
of the information structure, of the type considered in the global-games literature, can transform any
model to a model with a unique equilibrium (Weinstein and Yildiz, 2007).35 It helps reveal how cru-
cially the predictions of standard workhorse macroeconomic models depend on the conventional but
unrealistic assumption that all the agents have a homogenous understanding of the current state and
the future prospects of the economy. And it leads to a parsimonious explanation of multiple empirical
regularities as well as to new policy insights.


3.1      Beauty Contests and Sentiments

I now discuss how my approach opens the door to forces that resemble animal spirits and that help
reconcile the Keynesian narrative with the RBC framework. This discussion is based on a stripped
down version of my work with Jennifer La’O on “sentiments” (Angeletos and La’O, 2013).
       The economy has a large number of agents, who can be thought of as both consumers and produc-
ers; let’s call them “ farmers.” Each farmer produces a single good, using his own labor, but wishes to
consume also the good of another, randomly selected, farmer. The farmers therefore engage in barter
trade through random pairwise matching. The terms of trade within each match are determined in a
competitive fashion.
       These assumptions are deliberately unrealistic: they seek to keep the analysis as close as possible to
those found in textbook treatments of the Edgeworth box and of demand and supply. The key novelty is
that any two farmers are allowed to have differential information about the underlying state of Nature
and, as result, can face higher-order uncertainty about their likely terms of trade—or, equivalently,
about demand and supply.
       Suppose, in particular, that each period can be split into two sub-periods, the “morning” and
the “afternoon.” Production takes place in the morning; trade and consumption take place in the
afternoon. Importantly, each farmer decides how much effort to exert and how much to produce
prior to observing his exact match and the terms of trade; in this sense, supply is determined under
incomplete information about demand.
       Because of space constraints, I skip the details of the underlying micro-foundations. For the present
purposes, it sufﬁces to note that the equilibrium of the considered model boils down to the solution
of the following ﬁxed-point problem:

                                             yit = φAit + α Eit [yjt ] ,                                              (12)

where yit is the output of farmer i in period t, Ait is her productivity in that period, Eit is her rational
  35
    Nevertheless, the essence of multiple-equilibrium models is preserved even when global-games techniques are used to
select a unique equilibrium, because the unique equilibrium can vary with shocks that resemble animal spirits. This follows
from essentially the same argument as the one reviewed in the next subsection. See also the complementary discussions in
Morris and Shin (2002) and Angeletos and Werning (2006) about the sunspot-like function of public signals in environments
in which coordination is important.



                                                           21
expectation in the morning of that period, j stands for the identity of her random trading partner, yjt
is the latter’s output, and φ > 0 and α ∈ (0, 1) are scalars that depend on deeper preferences and
technology parameters and that can be treated as exogenous parameters in the present discussion.
   Condition (12) states that the equilibrium output of a farmer is an increasing function of her produc-
tivity and of her expectation of the output of her trading partner. Why? Because higher productivity
means a lower cost of producing and because a higher level of production by her trading partner
translates to higher demand for her own product (or, equivalently, better terms of trade).
   This condition can be thought as the best response condition in a two-player game: the players are
the farmers within a match and their actions are the level of production. This game features strategic
complementarity and linear best responses. It is therefore closely related to the class of “beauty con-
tests” studied in Morris and Shin (2002), Angeletos and Pavan (2007, 2009), and Bergemann and Mor-
ris (2013). Here, strategic complementarity emerges simply because higher supply from one farmer
translates to higher demand for another farmer.
   Because α ∈ (0, 1), condition (12) deﬁnes a contraction mapping. The equilibrium outcome is
unique, it coincides with the unique rationalizable outcome, and it is pinned down by the hierar-
chy of beliefs about the underlying fundamentals (the farmer-speciﬁc productivities and the realized
matches). To see this more clearly, suppose that any two farmers i and j that have been matched
together have common knowledge of their identities but not necessarily of their productivities. Then,
by iterating (12), we readily see that i’s output is given by

                           yit = φAit + φα Eit [Ajt ] + φα2 Eit [Ejt [Ait ]]
                                  + φα3 Eit [Ejt [Eit [Ajt ]]] + ...                                (13)

In short, i’s output depends, not only on her own productivity and on her belief of the beliefs of her
partner.
   The above is true regardless of the information structure. The information structure, however, de-
termines whether coordination is “perfect” or “imperfect” in the following sense. When information
is complete (i.e., all farmers share the same information about their matches, about one another’s
productivities, and the entire state of Nature), all the higher-order beliefs collapse to the true fun-
damentals. As a result, the farmers face no uncertainty about one another’s choices and aggregate
output is pinned by fundamentals (TFP), as in the standard RBC model. By contrast, when information
is incomplete, the farmers face uncertainty about one another’s beliefs and choices. This uncertainty
formalizes the precise sense in which coordination is imperfect. It also rationalizes correlated “mis-
takes” in the forecasts that farmers make when trying to predict one another’s choices. These mistakes
in turn manifest as a type of ﬂuctuations
   To see this more clearly, let the realized productivities (Ait , Ajt ) be common knowledge within




                                                    22
each match (i, j). Then, condition (13) holds with

                   Eit [Ajt ] = Ajt ,     Eit [Ejt [Ait ]] = Ait ,           Eit [Ejt [Eit [Ajt ]]] = Ajt ,

and so on. But then we have
                          {     ∞                 ∞
                                                                         }
                                ∑                 ∑                                φ
                      yit = φ            2h

                                h=0               h=0


and similarly for yjt . And since this is true for every matched pair (i.j), aggregate output is given by

                                                             φ
                                                   yt =         At ,

where At denotes aggregate TFP. In short, the complete-information version of the model under con-
sideration is a close cousin for the RBC model: it attributes the business cycle to supply shocks (in the
form of aggregate TFP shocks).
    When, instead, the farmers lack common knowledge of each other’s productivities, higher-order
beliefs can differ from ﬁrst-order beliefs. What is more, the variation in higher-order beliefs need not be
spanned by the variation in either the underlying fundamentals or the ﬁrst-order beliefs: higher-order
beliefs can vary for seemingly extrinsic reasons. To illustrate, suppose that every farmer i observes
two noisy signals about its likely partner j = m(i, t). The ﬁrst signal is given by

                                                  x1it = Ajt + ϵit ,

and can be thought of as a signal of the trading partner’s productivity. The second signal is given by

                                                   x2it = ϵjt + ξit ,

and can be thought of as a signal of the error in trading partner’s signal (or, equivalently, of the asso-
ciated “mistake” in her choices). Suppose further that ξit , the error in the second signal, is correlated
across all the farmer in the economy. For instance, suppose that ξit = ξt , where ξt is an aggregate
shock. Suppose further that the latter shock is uncorrelated with aggregate productivity. It follows that
ξt represents a independent shock to higher-order beliefs: when the realized ξt is higher, the ﬁrst-order
beliefs Eit [Ajt ] and Ejt [Ait ] do not move, but the second-order beliefs Eit [Ejt [Ait ]] and Ejt [Eit [Ajt ]]
go up, and so do the belief of third and higher orders.
    Angeletos and La’O (2013) refer to ξt as a “sentiment shock” because, in equilibrium, ξt captures
the sentiment (belief) that a farmer has about her terms of trade and the returns to labor. In particular,
a positive ξt realization captures states of Nature in which the average farmer overproduces relative
to the frictionless RBC benchmark because, and only because, she is optimistic the other farmers


                                                             23
also overproduce. And symmetrically, a negative ξt realization captures states of Nature in which the
average farmer cuts down her production because, and only because, she is pessimistic that the other
farmers will act similarly. In this sense, it is as if the economy ﬂuctuates in response to “animal spirits.”
      Furthermore, because these ﬂuctuations are associated with variation in the expected and the
realized demand faced by the average farmer for given technology and given marginal costs, these
ﬂuctuations can be said to have a Keynesian ﬂavor: they feel and look like demand-driven ﬂuctuations.
Keep in mind, though, that the separation between demand and supply is always fussy in GE settings
with ﬂexible prices. As a negative sentiment shock causes each farmer to produce less of his own
good and to demand less of the goods of others, supply and demand move together and indeed feed
one another. In terms of Figure 2, it is therefore as if there is a joint, and self-reinforcing, leftward shift
in both the AS and the AD curve.


3.2     Sentiments and the Business Cycle

A few recent paper expand on the ideas described above, or push forward closely related theories
of the business cycle. Angeletos et al. (2015) and Huo and Takayama (2015) develop more realistic
versions of Angeletos and La’O (2013) and confront them with the data. Wu and Young (2017) study an
extension that introduces an asset market and argue that this kind of model can help explain jointly the
business cycle and the volatility in asset markets. Sockin and Xiong (2015) consider an application
to commodity markets and use it to explain certain empirical puzzles. Benhabib et al. (2015) and
Acharya et al. (2017) show that the signal-extraction problem that the ﬁrms face between idiosyncratic
and aggregate shocks can open the door to a similar type of sentiment-driven ﬂuctuations as that
described above, even in the absence of exogenous shocks to higher-order beliefs. Chahrour and
Gaballo (2017) offer a complementary formalization that allows the belief waves to obtain from small
shocks to technology or other fundamentals and ties them to expectations of wealth. Ilut and Saijo
(2016) and Pei (2018) engineer similar kinds of belief waves from the combination of idiosyncratic
uncertainty, ambiguity, and learning.
      Evaluating the quantitive potential of this class of models can run quickly to computational chal-
lenges. A joint project with Fabrice Collard and Harris Dellas bypasses these challenges and develops
a method for augmenting a large class of linear DSGE models with rich dynamics in higher-order be-
liefs. The method leverages on a certain departure from the common prior and rational-expectations
assumptions in order to maximize tractability and ease the simulation and the structural estimation of
both small and large models.
      In “Quantifying Conﬁdence” (Angeletos et al., 2015), which I review next, we use this method to
shed light on the observable implications and the quantitative potential of extrinsic shocks to higher-
order beliefs, of the kind described above. The method, however, is more general and can be used for
other purposes, too. For instance, it can readily capture the sluggish response of higher-order beliefs to



                                                      24

shocks in monetary policy, TFP, and other fundamentals, as in the works of Woodford (2003), Nimark
(2008, 2017), Mackowiak and Wiederholt (2009, 2015), and Angeletos and La’O (2010).36
       Consider the baseline RBC model, which attributes the entirety of the business cycle to aggregate
TFP shocks. Modify this model by removing common knowledge of the realized TFP shock and by
allowing for an aggregate shock to higher-order beliefs. By the latter I mean a shock that is orthogonal
to the TFP shock, does not affect the (ﬁrst-order) beliefs that the agents form about TFP, and nevertheless
triggers transitory variation in the beliefs that the agents form about the beliefs of others. This shock
is therefore analogous to the sentiment shock formalized in Angeletos and La’O (2013) and reviewed
in the previous subsection.37
       What are the observable implications of this kind of shock? Figure 3 addresses this question
by reporting the impulse response functions of the model’s key endogenous outcomes to a negative
sentiment shock. Output, consumption, investment, and employment go down, while TFP remains
stable and labor productivity slightly increases. This co-movement in key macroeconomic quantities
without commensurate co-movement in TFP or labor productivity matches our “intuitive” notion of
an adverse demand shock, as well as the empirical regularities that are associated with that notion
(e.g., Blanchard and Quah, 1989).
       The mechanism is the following. By construction, the shock causes higher-order beliefs of TFP to
fall. In equilibrium, this triggers a wave of pessimism about the short-run economic outlook, without
changing the long-term prospects. Because ﬁrms expect the demand for their products to be relatively
weak over the next few quarters, they ﬁnd it optimal to lower their own demand for labor and capital.
As a consequence, households expect to experience a transitory fall in wages, capital returns, and
overall income. Because this entails relatively weak wealth effects and relatively strong substitution
  36
      The developed method can also capture the kind of myopia, and extra discounting of the future, that Angeletos and
Lian (2016a) rationalize with a relaxation of the common-knowledge properties of the New Keynesian model and which
Gabaix (2016) and Farhi and Werning (2017) replicate with appropriate departures from rational expectations.
   37
      The baseline model considered in Angeletos et al. (2015) differs from the one considered in Angeletos and La’O (2013)
and reviewed before in three respects. First, there is capital accumulation so that the model can speak to the co-movement
of employment, consumption, and investment. Second, instead of pairwise matches among farmers, there is the standard
interaction of multiple households and ﬁrms in labor and capital markets. Third, the relevant belief waves are engineered
with the help of heterogeneous priors. The essence, however, is the same.



                                                           25
effects, households react by working less and by reducing both consumption and saving.
       The belief waves described above are therefore able to generate the following key regularities
of the US macroeconomic times series: strong positive co-movement between employment, output,
consumption, and investment at the business-cycle frequency, without commensurate movements in
labor productivity, TFP, and inﬂation at any frequency.
       So far, I have shown how to accommodate a Keynesian type of ﬂuctuations within the RBC model,
while abstracting from nominal rigidities. It is straightforward to add Calvo-like sticky prices; this gives
the baseline New Keynesian model augmented with sentiment shocks. When monetary policy repli-
cates ﬂexible prices, one gets (trivially) the same response in the real quantities along with no response
in inﬂation. This explains how sentiment shocks can serve as non-inﬂationary demand shocks within
the New Keynesian model and can therefore help address some of its empirical shortcomings.
       What is more, one can show that the real effects of a sentiment shock under ﬂexible prices are sim-
ilar to those of a monetary shock under sticky prices. This underscores how the mechanism described
above is a close cousin to the one at the core of the New Keynesian framework—except for the fact
that it does not rest on nominal rigidity, policy constraints, and commensurate inﬂation movements.
       To connect this point to the discussion of Section 2, consider the baseline model in Angeletos et al.
(2015). This is essentially the multiple-period version of the RBC model introduced in Subsection
2.2, except for the replacement of inter-temporal preference shocks with sentiments shocks. The
equilibrium quantities can be shown to satisfy the following conditions, for all t:

                                          v ′ (ℓt )
                                                    = (1 − τtℓ )At Fn (kt , nt ),
                                          u′ (ct )
                                       {          [                                    ]}
                         u′ (ct ) = βEt u′ (ct+1 ) 1 + (1 − τtk )At+1 Fk (kt+1 , nt+1 ) ,

where the τ ’s capture the endogenous wedges induced by the sentiment shock. In particular, a negative
sentiment shock manifests as a joint increase in τtℓ and τtk : pessimistic beliefs about the choices of
others are akin to a joint tax on labor and capital.38
       These belief-induced wedges play a similar as the realized monopoly markup in the New Keyne-
sian model: they encapsulate the output gaps that obtain relative to the predictions of the baseline
RBC model. But whereas in the New Keynesian model the wedges and the gaps are the symptom of
nominal rigidity, in our model they are the symptom of a friction in the coordination of the beliefs
and the economic decisions of a diverse population. And whereas in the New Keynesian model the
wedges and the gaps ought to manifest in inﬂation (through the NKPC), in our model they do not.
       To elaborate on the quantitative content of all these observations, Angeletos et al. (2015) consider
a horserace between the version of the RBC model that contains the sentiment shock with versions
  38
     This follows from Subsection 5.4 of Angeletos et al. (2015), which discusses how sentiment shocks manifest as wedges
in terms of business-cycle accounting (Chari et al., 2007). Related theories of belief-induced wedges appear in Ilut and
Saijo (2016) and Bhandari et al. (2016).



                                                           26
of the New Keynesian model that rule out the sentiment shock and, instead, feature more standard
formalizations of “demand shocks,” such as the kind of discount-factor shock discussed earlier on.
For comparable calibrations, the RBC model with the sentiment shock outperforms its New Keynesian
competitors in terms of matching the key business-cycle moments in the data. This is, not only because
the former model does not have to rely on counterfactually large movements in inﬂation, but also
because the sentiment shock is better able to generate the co-movement patterns among the real
quantities seen in the data. For essentially the same reason, the sentiment shock emerges as the main
driver of the business cycle in estimated, medium-scale models that allow for a multitude of other
shocks and for some of the familiar bells and whistles of the DSGE literature.
      Complementing these ﬁndings, Angeletos et al. (2017) and Levchenko and Pandalai-Nayar (2017)
provide empirical evidence, based on Structural VARs, that the bulk of the observed business cycles
is consistent with a type of ﬂuctuations like the one captured in my work and in the literature cited in
the beginning of this subsection—and unlike the one captured in competing models that emphasize
technology, monetary, news, or uncertainty shocks.39 Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the variation
in conﬁdence does not have to be extrinsic. Angeletos and Lian (2017b) and Ilut and Saijo (2016)
consider models that feature similar kinds of belief waves, and of belief-driven wedges, as the ones
discussed above, except that the beliefs and the associated wedges are allowed to covary with more
conventional structural shocks, such as ﬁnancial or discount-factor shocks. This helps explain why a
drop in conﬁdence may be triggered by an adverse ﬁnancial shock, while a boost in conﬁdence may
be accomplished by a ﬁscal stimulus.


3.3     From Shocks to Propagation

So far I have tried to make sense of demand-driven business cycles using an extrinsic sentiment shock.
As already noted, a shock in a model is proxy for a force, or propagation mechanism, whose deeper
micro-foundations the theorist abstracts from in order to make progress in understanding its conse-
quences. In the context of interest, the sentiment shock maybe a crude proxy for waves of optimism
and pessimism caused by more familiar triggers, such as a shock to consumer credit.
      Chen Lian and I have been exploring this idea in ongoing research (Angeletos and Lian, 2017b).
We argue that removing common knowledge of the kind of consumer-spending or discount-rate
shocks described earlier, and allowing such shocks to be confounded with idiosyncratic shocks in
ﬁrm proﬁtability and household income, permits these shocks to generate realistic business cycles
within the RBC framework. We further show how the same ingredients give rise to a feedback mech-
   39
      Even if one does not embrace the formalization of sentiment- or conﬁdence-driven ﬂuctuations that my work and the
related literature has put forward, there seems to be a broader take-home lesson. The quantitative explorations of Angeletos
et al. (2015) and Huo and Takayama (2015), the VAR-based empirical evidence in Angeletos et al. (2017) and Levchenko
and Pandalai-Nayar (2017), and the complementary evidence in Beaudry and Portier (2013) and Beaudry et al. (2015) all
point in the same direction. There are important regularities in the aggregate time series for which the more conventional
business-cycle literature has failed to provide a convincing parsimonious explanation.



                                                            27
anism that resembles the Keynesian multiplier and that helps rationalize large ﬁscal multipliers in the
short run, despite the absence of any kind of nominal rigidity. We ﬁnally discuss how this provides
a possible micro-foundation and an appealing re-interpretation of the kind of belief waves described
earlier.
    Distinct but complementary theories that allow the level of “conﬁdence” to vary endogenously in
response to conventional forms of demand or supply shocks are developed in Chahrour and Gaballo
(2017), Ilut and Saijo (2016), and Schaal and Taschereau-Dumouchel (2015). The ﬁrst focuses on
the feedback between prices and wealth; the second on the interaction of ambiguity and learning; the
third on non-convexities in production. In the rest of this section, I focus on the mechanism formalized
in Angeletos and Lian (2017b), not only because this is part of my own work, but also because of its
tight connection to the Keynesian narrative, which is the unifying theme of this lecture.
    The baseline model in Angeletos and Lian (2017b) has the same neoclassical backbone as the
model studied in Subsection 2.2, except that there are now a large number of consumers and pro-
ducers that interact in decentralized markets (“islands”). Each household’s preferences take the same
form as in condition (1) and are subject to a discount-rate shock. The latter has both an aggregate
component (proxying for aggregate shocks to consumer credit and aggregate demand) and an id-
iosyncratic component (proxying for, say, borrowing heterogeneity). Each household also contains
a single worker-farmer, who produces only one of the many varieties that are consumed by every
household. Finally, there are good-speciﬁc demand and supply shocks, in the form of, respectively,
an economy-wide but good-speciﬁc taste shock and a farmer-speciﬁc productivity shock.
    Since the aggregate discount-rate shock is the only aggregate shock in the economy, the entire
variation in aggregate quantities has to be driven by it. But whether a given realization of it causes a
boom or a recession depends critically on the whether the shock is common knowledge or not.
    When information is complete and the shock is common knowledge, the model reduces, in ef-
fect, to the one studied in Subsection 2.2. This leaves no room for the Keynesian narrative: for the
reasons already explained, the drop in consumer spending comes together with a boom in aggregate
employment, investment, and output.
    This changes once there is incomplete information and lack of common knowledge. The discount-
rate shock triggers a drop in the demand faced by each farmer (or ﬁrm). Because information is incom-
plete, some farmers may not be able to tell whether the drop in their demand is due to idiosyncratic or
aggregate reasons. As a result, these farmers may work less and may instruct their sibling-consumers
to spend less. But as these latter spend less, other farmers experience a further drop in their demand.
These farmers may now ﬁnd it optimal to work less and to instruct their own siblings to spend less,
even if they themselves are fully aware that the initial trigger was an aggregate discount-rate shock.
An extra round of reduction in output, labor, and consumption therefore takes place. And so on.
    A more realistic version of the theory replaces the farmers with collections of ﬁrms and workers
(and adds labor markets). In response to the aggregate discount-rate shock, some ﬁrms see a decrease


                                                  28
in the demand for their products and start hiring less. Some workers see wages go down, or unem-
ployment go up, and start spending less. Additional ﬁrms then see their demand go down and respond
by contributing to even less hiring. And so on.
    The mechanism described above has a sharp Keynesian ﬂavor. One may even argue that our model
offers a more “faithful” formalization of the considered narrative than the New Keynesian model: the
mechanism draws directly from the elementary demand-and-supply reasoning that is familiar from
microeconomics. But how exactly is such PE reasoning reconciled with the GE response of the econ-
omy? In other words, why is this response different from the one characterized in Subsection 2.2?
    Part of the answer rests on the assumed inability of the ﬁrms (or the farmers) to tell apart the
sources of variation in their demand and the similar inability of the consumers to tell apart the sources
of variation in their income. This ingredient of our theory is similar to Lucas (1972), except that
the agents in our model are confusing different kinds of real terms as opposed to confusing nominal
terms for real terms. What is more, this confusion does not have to the product of segmented market
interactions and missing public signals; it can be the product of rational inattention or, even more
erratically, the product of bounded rationality.
    But this is not the whole story; it is only the starting point. The most novel and, in our view, the
most intriguing part of the theory has to do with the feedback loops described above. Because these
feedback loops are akin to strategic complementarity in “beauty contests,” the confusion of some
agents rationalize a similar behavior by other agents regardless of whether the latter are also confused
or not. It is this part of our theory that formalizes the Keynesian multiplier.
    As a matter of fact, the mechanism is valid even if no agent is actually confused, provided that this
fact is not common knowledge. In this sense, the key is not the Lucas-like confusion per se, but rather
the inability of the agents to coordinate on the kind of GE response predicted by the standard RBC
framework. In short, it is as if the GE forces of that framework have been attenuated and, instead, the
PE logic of the Keynesian narrative has prevailed.


4    Expectations and GE Adjustment

I now elaborate on the broader idea that lack of common knowledge attenuates, or slows down, GE
effects by arresting the adjustment of the expectations of the actions of others to aggregate shocks. I
ﬁrst articulate the basic idea within an abstract framework. I then discuss how this idea sheds new light
on the question of how monetary and ﬁscal policy inﬂuence aggregate demand. I ﬁnally discuss how
the same idea offers an empirically plausible micro-foundation of some of the “bells and whistles” of
the New Keynesian model.




                                                    29
4.1     Dampening General Equilibrium

The basic idea that lack of common knowledge attenuates GE effects was articulated in Angeletos
and Lian (2017a) within the context of an elementary, and decentralized, Walrasian economy. There
are two periods, “today” and “tomorrow.” There are three goods. One of the goods serves as the
numeraire and can be consumed in both periods; think of it as leisure. The other two goods are
speciﬁc to the two periods; think of them as “today’s goods” and “tomorrow’s goods.” Finally, there is
a large number of “marketplaces,” and every agent can trade in a single marketplace in each period
but may randomly move from one marketplace to another as time passes.
      These assumptions are deliberately stark. They nevertheless help capture two basic facts: that most
trading is decentralized; and that agents care, but are uncertain, about the behavior of agents they do
not currently trade with. They also help us draw a clear line between partial and general equilibrium:
the former refers to the adjustment of a single marketplace in isolation of the rest of the economy, the
latter to the joint adjustment of all the marketplaces.
      How does the considered economy respond to an aggregate demand shock, namely, a shock
that shifts the local demand for today’s goods in all (or many) marketplaces? We ﬁrst address this
question in a “frictionless” benchmark that exempliﬁes the modeling practice in the majority of applied
work. This benchmark is deﬁned by imposing Rational Expectation Equilibrium together with common
knowledge of the aggregate shock. Its predictions are illustrated in Figure 4.

                                         Figure 4: PE and GE effects

      Consider an arbitrary marketplace m during the ﬁrst period. We denote the local price of today’s
goods by pm and the local quantity by qm . The pre-shock demand and supply curves are illustrated by
the solid lines in the ﬁgure. Had the shock being idiosyncratic (speciﬁc to marketplace m), it would
have shifted only the local demand curve and it have have only a PE effect. This effect is represented
by the movement of the market-clearing pair (pm , qm ) from point X to point Y in either panel of the
ﬁgure. Because we are considering an aggregate shock, however, there is an additional GE effect,
which has to do with the concurrent adjustment in aggregate economic outcomes and in the prices
that agents expect to face tomorrow. This effect triggers a shift in the supply curve, as well as a further
shift in the demand curve; it is represented by the movement from point Y to point Z. In the left panel,

                                                     30
this kind of GE adjustment ampliﬁes the PE effect; in the right panel, it mitigates it.
      The points made so far should be familiar: GE mechanisms can either amplify or offset PE effects. A
novel lesson emerges once we relax the assumption that the shock is common knowledge. This lesson
can be summarized as follows. The rational-expectations hypothesis alone does not nail down the
relevant GE effect. It only restricts its (absolute) magnitude within an interval. This interval corresponds
to the interval between points Y and Z in Figure 4. By imposing rational expectations together with
common knowledge of the shock, standard modeling practices pick, perhaps inadvertently, the upper
bound of this interval, namely point Z . We instead show how one can span the entire interval by
removing common knowledge of the shock. In terms of the ﬁgure, this means that the GE adjustment
of the modiﬁed economy can lie anywhere along the interval between Y and Z.
      The logic is the following. Regardless of the information structure, the rational-expectations hy-
pothesis imposes a ﬁxed-point relation between subjective beliefs and actual outcomes. But once
agents lack common knowledge of the underlying shock, this ﬁxed point is pinned down, not only
by what the agents know about these innovations, but also by what they think that others know, and
so on. As one varies the degree of such higher-order knowledge, one also varies the potency of the
relevant GE effect.
      This explains the sense in which the practice of combining rational expectations with common
knowledge of the underlying shocks “overstates” the importance of GE mechanisms. Regardless of
whether one considers a setting in which the GE effects of a shock amplify its PE effects (left panel in
the ﬁgure) or a setting in which the opposite is true (right panel), removing common knowledge of the
shock is akin to dulling the GE mechanism.


4.2     Application: Forward Guidance and Fiscal Stimuli

I now discuss how the aforementioned ideas shed new light on the question of how policy inﬂuences
aggregate economic activity. In particular, consider the New Keynesian framework and ask how
monetary policy inﬂuences aggregate demand within that framework. By changing the interest rate(s)
faced by the typical borrower or saver, monetary policy has a direct effect on the budget, the incentives,
and the behavior of that agent, even when the behavior of all other agents remains unchanged. This
kind of PE (or, more precisely, decision-theoretic) effect is relatively modest. The largest part has to
do with GE mechanisms, which stem from the response of all other agents in the economy and which
act as multipliers of the underlying PE effect.
      The most crucial among these GE mechanisms is the feedback loop between aggregate spending
and inﬂation: reducing interest rates stimulates spending, which in turn raises inﬂation, which in turn
reduces real rate further and stimulates spending even more, and so on. In the baseline New Keynesian
model, this mechanism is captured by the interaction of the representative household’s Euler condition
(the modern analogue of the IS curve) with the NKPC (the modern analogue of the Philips curve).



                                                    31
       But there are two additional GE mechanisms, buried underneath these equations. The one has
to do with the feedback from future inﬂation to current inﬂation: for given real marginal costs, the
individual ﬁrm is more willing to raise its nominal price today if she expects other ﬁrms to do the same
in the future. The other has to do with the feedback from aggregate spending to individual spending:
when the individual consumer expects other consumers to spend more, she is encouraged to spend
more herself, because her own income increases with aggregate consumption.
       Building on the more abstract ideas described in the previous subsection, my work on “Forward
Guidance without Common Knowledge” (Angeletos and Lian, 2016a) shows how removing common
knowledge of the monetary policy and of its consequences is akin to attenuating all the aforementioned
GE effects. As a result, the response of the economy to forward guidance and to any other news about
the future is reduced.
       What is more, this attenuation increases with the horizon that the agents have to forecast. This
is because policies, or shocks, that work over long horizons map to beliefs of high order and are
therefore more sensitive to any given imperfection in information and coordination. It is therefore as
if the economy is populated by a representative agent who is myopic and discounts the future more
heavily than what it is rational.40
       These insights help resolve the so-called forward guidance puzzle (Del Negro et al., 2012; McKay
et al., 2016). The latter refers to the New Keynesian model’s prediction that, when the economy is
at the Zero Lower Bound, a promise to keep interest rates low in the far future can have humongous
effects on current economic activity. This prediction is driven by the GE effects described above and,
in particular, by the property that these GE effects pile up as the horizon increases. By dulling these
effects, my work brings the predictions of the model closer both to the available evidence and to the
appealing PE logic that interest rates at long horizons ought to have small effects due discounting.
       These insights also offer a rationale for the front-loading of ﬁscal policy. The baseline New Key-
nesian model predicts that ﬁscal stimuli should be back-loaded in order to pile up the feedback loops
between inﬂation and spending. By contrast, my work indicates that ﬁscal stimuli should be front-
loaded in order to minimize the bite of frictional coordination. Angeletos and Lian (2016a) illustrate
this point within the ZLB context. In ongoing work, we extend the analysis away from the ZLB and
examine how the proposed mechanism interacts with the one based on “hand-to-mouth consumers”
(Galí et al., 2007, Kaplan and Violante, 2014) and short horizons (Del Negro et al., 2012).


4.3       Myopia and Anchoring, with application to the NKPC

The preceding discussion illustrates how relaxing common knowledge, and accommodating imperfect
coordination, can modify the predictions of the New Keynesian framework in manners that appear
to be both conceptually appealing and empirically plausible. Reinforcing this point, ongoing work
  40
       Gabaix (2016) and Farhi and Werning (2017) accommodate similar forms of myopia by dropping rational expectations.



                                                           32
with Zhen Huo (Angeletos and Huo, 2018) shows how incomplete information can offer a micro-
foundation for some of the more dubious “bells and whistles” that the New Keynesian framework
requires in order to generate realistic business cycles, such as the so-called hybrid version of the
NKPC or speciﬁc kinds of adjustment costs in investment and habit formation in consumption.
   To illustrate, consider the NKPC. Its standard version is given by

                                         πt = κxt + βEt [πt+1 ] ,                                    (14)

where πt denotes inﬂation, xt denotes the output gap (or the real marginal cost), κ > 0 parameterizes
the responsiveness of inﬂation to innovations in the gap, and β ∈ (0, 1) is the subjective discount
factor. This condition follows from aggregating the optimal price-setting decisions of the ﬁrms and
hinges on the forward-looking nature of these decisions. In particular, because the ﬁrms that have the
option to reset their prices today understand that they are likely to be stuck with the same price for
a while, they set their prices in proportion to their expectation of the discounted present value of the
real marginal costs that they are likely to face in the future. It then follows that πt depends, not only
on the current value of xt , but also on the ﬁrms’ expectations of its future path, which in turn explains
why the forward-looking nature of the NKPC.
   These points are well understood. What is not well understood, however, is how the version of the
NKPC given in condition (14) depends on the assumption that the ﬁrms have common knowledge of
the current value xt and a common belief about its future path. Without this assumption, the optimal
price-setting behavior of each ﬁrm is still driven by her expectations of the discounted present value
of her real marginal costs, which in turn implies that inﬂation is still driven by the average of these
expectations in the cross section of ﬁrms, but this average expectation no more coincides with the
expectation of a representative agent. As a result, condition (14) has to be modiﬁed.
   Suppose, in particular, that xt follows an AR(1) process, or a random walk, and that the information
of every ﬁrm can be represented by a series of Gaussian private signals about xt . My work with Zhen
Huo establishes that, under this scenario, the appropriate modiﬁcation of the NKPC is as follows:

                                    πt = κxt + βδEt [πt+1 ] + γπt−1 ,

where the scalars (δ, γ) are pinned down by the underlying parameters (κ, β) and the information
structure. These scalars satisfy δ < 1 and γ > 0. It is therefore as if the ﬁrms discount the future more
heavily and, in addition, anchor their optimal reset prices to the past price level.
   The ﬁrst feature is for the reasons explained earlier: by arresting the adjustment of the expectations
that the ﬁrms form about the behavior of other ﬁrms and the resulting inﬂation (a GE mechanism), the
informational friction causes the economy to behave as if the ﬁrms were myopic. The second feature is
due to learning: as time passes and ﬁrms accumulate more information about the state of the economy
and about one another’s responses, beliefs adjust only slowly towards their frictionless counterpart. It

                                                   33
is therefore as if current beliefs and outcomes are anchored to past outcomes.41
    These features—discounting of the future and anchoring to the past—induce the kind of empirical
patterns that the DSGE literature have sought to capture with a variety of bells and whistles, such
as the hybrid NKPC and the speciﬁc forms of habit in consumption and adjustment costs in invest-
ment popularized by Christiano et al. (2015) and Smets and Wouters (2007). Of course, incomplete
information can itself be viewed as yet another kind of bells and whistles. But whereas the DSGE
literature requires multiple sets of bells and whistles, essentially a different one for each equation of
the model, my work suggests that the same objectives can be accomplished with one friction. What is
more, while the existing approach requires the relevant adjustment friction—say, habit formation—to
be equally present at the micro and the macro level, my approach explains why the friction appears to
be much larger when looking at the macroeconomic data than when looking at the microeconomic
data (Havranek et al., 2017). Last but not least, the proposed approach is consistent with the available
evidence on the inertia of expectations, such as that documented in Coibion and Gorodnichenko
(2012, 2015a) and Vellekoop and Wiederholt (2017).
    Let me close this section with the following remark. Throughout, I have focused on the implications
of adding informational frictions in the New Keynesian framework while maintaining the usual for-
malization of nominal rigidity. The works of Woodford (2003), Mankiw and Reis (2002), Mackowiak
and Wiederholt (2009) and Chung et al. (2015) make complementary but different contributions by
showing how informational frictions may substitute for Calvo-like sticky prices as sources of nominal
rigidity. Finally, for additional work on the usefulness of introducing higher-order uncertainty in the
New Keynesian framework, see Nimark (2008) and Wiederholt (2016).


5    Conclusion

In this article I surveyed, and advertised, my current research agenda. But I also tried to illustrate
the value of a growing literature, of which my work is a small part. This is the recent literature on
incomplete information and higher-order uncertainty that was spurred by the inﬂuential contributions
of Morris and Shin (1998, 2001, 2002, 2003) and Woodford (2003) and that is surveyed in Angeletos
and Lian (2016b). All in all, I hope to have conveyed the following three broader lessons.
    First, the familiar narrative that a drop in aggregate demand can cause a recession is much subtler
than what the related partial-equilibrium logic suggests. By addressing this narrative in both old and
new ways, I hope to have raised the reader’s appreciation of its subtlety and to invite further research
into its precise meaning.
    Second, higher-order uncertainty is a useful modeling device for reconciling coordination failure
  41
     Woodford (2003) also emphasizes the inertia in the adjustment of beliefs, but does not identify the aforementioned
discounting because he abstracts from forward-looking behavior. Conversely, Gabaix (2016) and Farhi and Werning (2017)
consider two kinds of departure from rational expectations, both of which boil down to discounting future outcomes but,
unlike the approach described here, do not generate the backward-looking element that the data call for.


                                                         34
with equilibrium uniqueness and for accommodating seemingly irrational or self-reinforcing waves of
optimism and pessimism. This accommodation can help explain salient features of the data and shed
new light on the sources and the propagation of business cycles.
    Finally, augmenting rational-expectations models with higher-order uncertainty helps reveal their
“robust” or “true” predictions. By this I mean that the accommodation of higher-order uncertainty
allows the analyst to disentangle the rational-expectations hypothesis, with its well-known method-
ological advantages, from the far less palatable assumption that the agents have common knowledge
of the current state of the economy, can reach a perfect consensus about its future prospects, and
can effortlessly and instantaneously coordinate their responses to policy shifts or other impulses. This
disentangling can help resolve certain empirical puzzles and offer new guidance to policy.
