Should the U.S. Government Issue Floating Rate Notes?

                                         ABSTRACT

Since January 2014 the U.S. Treasury has been issuing floating rate notes (FRNs). We estimate
that the U.S. FRNs have been paying excess interest between 5 and 39 basis points above the
implied cost for other Treasury securities. We find a strong positive relation between our
estimated excess spreads on FRNs and the subsequent realized excess returns of FRNs over
related T-bill investment strategies. With more than 300 billion dollars of FRNs outstanding, the
yearly excess borrowing costs are estimated to be several hundreds of millions of dollars. To
rationalize this finding, we examine the role of FRNs from the perspective of optimal government
debt management to smooth taxes. In the model, bills can be cheaper to issue than FRNs, and the
payoffs for FRNs are perfectly correlated with future short rates. FRNs can be used to manage the
refinancing risk from rolling over short-term debt. We derive conditions under which the issuance
of FRNs can optimally be positive.

to reduce Treasury bill issuance amid concerns with rollover risk (in 2008, Treasury bills
represented nearly 30% of public debt outstanding compared to 14.5% as of the end of
2019). Another stated objective was "saving taxpayer dollars by ...nancing the government'  s
borrowing needs at the lowest cost over time" (U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2014). In
this paper we estimate the borrowing costs from the FRNs that have been issued relative to
other ...nancing sources. Our ...ndings are rationalized within a model of optimal government
debt management to smooth taxes.
    After an initial ramp up of Treasury FRN issuance, since 2016, the amount of FRN
debt outstanding has been increasing slowly to exceed $400 billion in 2019 (Figure 1). This
represents 2.6% of the total U.S. Treasury outstanding marketable debt as of December
2019 (Figure 2). By comparison, TIPS represent 9% of total marketable debt, Treasury bills
14.5%, notes 59.5%, and bonds 14.3%.
    U.S. FRNs are issued at monthly auctions with a maturity of two years. They promise
quarterly coupon payments indexed to the three-month T-bill rates determined at weekly
auctions. Unlike generic FRNs or typical        oating rate bank loans, the Treasury' s FRNs
pay a coupon that is an average of the constant maturity three-month rates. Therefore,
even assuming that they are valued with a no-arbitrage approach through a risk-free interest
curve, these FRNs would typically not be priced at par without a spread. Based on Treasury
yield curves on auctions dates, we determine this spread.

                                                          2
Figure 2: Data on Bills, Notes, Bonds, TIPS, and FRNs is from the U.S. Treasury;
https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/mspd.htm

    Over the period 2014 to 2019, we estimate spreads of between 10 and 3 basis points
in annualized terms for new auctions, and for reopenings between 23 and 7 basis points.
Before 2019, estimated spreads for new auctions were negative. This is consistent with
the fact that forward curves for maturities of two years and less have been upward sloping
until 2019. In this case, averaging interest rates over a quarterly coupon period makes the
FRN more valuable and the spread required for a par value negative. However, the spreads
determined at Treasury auctions have been positive throughout. The spreads paid in excess
of the estimated no-arbitrage spreads range between 5 and 39 basis points. Excess spreads
were particularly high in early 2016. In 2019 they have increased again from their low levels
of early 2018. With more than 300 billion dollars of FRNs outstanding, the excess borrowing
cost for 2017 is estimated to be about 700 million dollars. This is the highest annual excess
borrowing cost so far.
    Conceptually, pricing Treasury FRNs requires a convexity adjustment to deal with the
constant maturity index. We derive the exact pricing formula, and based on a version of the
Black, Derman and Toy (1990) model, we demonstrate that due to the recent low interest
rate volatility the convexity adjustment is very small quantitatively.
    We explore investment strategies with rolled-over T-bills, and we ...nd the returns to
be consistent with the idea that FRNs have o¤ered attractive terms to investors. We also
document a strong positive relation between our estimated excess spreads on FRNs and the
subsequent realized excess returns of FRNs over the T-bill strategies.


                                             3
    To rationalize these ...ndings we study the role of FRNs in a stylized model of optimal
government debt management to smooth taxes. In the frictionless framework without default
typically used to study optimal debt management, generic FRNs are redundant as they can be
replicated by short-term debt. When short-term debt provides monetary services not found
in other debt this redundancy disappears. Short-term debt can be cheaper to issue than
FRNs, and the government might be willing to tolerate some re...nancing risk from rolling
over short-term debt. Because the payo¤ for FRNs is perfectly correlated with future short
rates, FRNs can be used to manage the re...nancing risk. In a stylized model for optimal
debt management, we show that depending on the amounts of short-term debt issued to
optimally balance the utility of monetary services with seigniorage revenues, FRNs are used
as complements or substitutes to hedge the interest exposure and to smooth taxes. Issuance
of FRNs can optimally be positive, and this requires that the amount of short-term debt
issued is relatively small. In the model this happens when a type of La¤er curve that traces
seigniorage as a function of short-term debt slopes downwards at relatively low levels.
    Finally, we extend the simple model with money-in-utility to an in...nite horizon pricing
model. We characterize the excess spreads in FRNs that we have estimated, and based
on guidance from this model, we empirically evaluate the role of potential drivers of these
excess spreads. We ...nd a signi...cant role for implied interst rate volatility. We also ...nd
some impact from the bid-to-cover ratios in the ...rst two years.
    We contribute to studying the market conditions for the nascent U.S. FRNs. Greenwood,
Hanson and Stein (2016) note that initial yields on FRNs have been higher than three-month
T-bill rates. They do not price FRNs. Bhanot and Guo (2017) ...nd substantial excess
returns using secondary market data through 2016 for 2-Year U.S. Treasury FRNs. To our
knowledge, our paper is the ...rst study to price U.S. FRNs and estimate the Treasury's excess
borrowing costs due to FRNs. We are also not aware of other studies containing our pricing
equations with explicit convexity adjustments needed due to the constant maturity index in
the U.S. FRNs.1
    Our paper also contributes to the literature on optimal government debt management,
which includes Barro (1979), Bohn (1990), Cochrane (2015), Angeletos (2002), Nosbusch
(2008) and Debortoli, Nunes, and Yared (2017). Our model builds on the setting by Green-
wood, Hanson and Stein (2015) who consider optimal debt management when short-term

     Pricing anomalies have been studied in many areas of the market for U.S. Treasury securities, namely
in the market for o¤-the-run vs. on-the-run Treasury bonds (Krisnamurthy 2002), TIPS (Flackenstein,
Longsta¤, and Lustig 2014), longer maturity Treasury bonds (Bradford and Shapiro 1989), callable Treasury
bonds (Carayannopoulos 1995), and from an international perspective (Du, Im and Schreger,2017). Price
impacts due to recent policy or regulatory measures have been documented by Vissing-Jorgensen and Kr-
ishnamurthy (2012), D' Amico and King (2013), and Du, Tepper and Verdelhan (2017), Hartley (2017), and
Cochrane (2017).

FRNs.
   In the rest of the paper, Section 2 estimates the Treasury's borrowing costs for FRNs.
Section 3 derives and estimates convexity adjustments, as well as documenting T-bill in-
vestment strategies related to FRNs. Section 4 analyzes FRNs within a stylized model for
optimal government debt management. Section 5 presents an in...nite-horizon pricing model
and documents empirical drivers of the estimated spreads.


2    Treasury FRN pricing at auctions
In this section we value Treasury FRNs at auction dates and compare the valuations to the
actual pricing of these FRNs. The Treasury started issuing FRNs with a maturity of two
years in January 2014. These notes promise quarterly coupons indexed to the 13-week T-bill
rates. New FRNs are issued towards the end of January, April, July, and October. There are
reopening auctions in the two months following a new issuance where additional amounts of
the previously issued FRNs are sold.
    Newly issued FRNs have typically been sold at par with the auction determining a spread
that is added to the index of three-month T-bill rates. Unlike generic FRNs or typical oating
rate bank loans, Treasury FRNs pay a coupon that is an average of the constant maturity
three-months rates. Therefore, even assuming that they are valued with a no-arbitrage
approach through a risk-free interest curve, these FRNs would typically not be priced at par
without a spread.
    We value a new FRN as

the next section we derive the no-arbitrage value of a FRN in a more rigorous way and
demonstrate that equation (1) represents a very accurate pricing formula. This formula
can be evaluated based on the current term structure alone due to the no-arbitrage relation
between forward rate and spot rates

    The starting dates of each forward rate period corresponds to a weekly auction date
of 13-week T-Bills whose rates determine the coupon payments of the FRN. The discount
                13I +13
factors 1= 1 + r0       correspond to the quarterly (13-week) coupon payment dates. We
assume a constant spread 0 (in annualized terms) which will be determined so that the
value of the FRN is at par, V0 = 1.
    Compare this to a more standard FRN where the coupon payment is based on the interest
rate corresponding to the same period. The price of a standard FRN, V  ~0 ; with the same
maturity and coupon payment dates would be

Substituting the de...nition of the forward rates, 2, this becomes

A FRN sold at par, V    ~0 = 1, does not require a spread, ~0 = 0. Therefore, the spread we
estimate in a Treasury FRN captures the e¤ect of using a constant maturity index.
    Equation 1 is evaluated, and solved for 0 , based on the term structure on an auction date.
We use the Treasury-implied zero-coupon yields from Reuters with maturities 1; 3; 6; 9; 12; 24
and 36 months.2 Yields are interpolated by cubic splines. For reopening auctions, equation
(1) is modi...ed to take into account the reduced maturity, accrued interest, and the fact that,
with the spread predetermined at the initial auction, prices are typically no longer at par.


2.1     Results
Over the period 2014 to 2019, we estimate spreads to be between 3 and 10 basis points
in annualized terms for new auctions, and for reopenings between 7 and 23 basis points.
Before 2019, spreads for new auctions have been negative. This is consistent with the fact
that forward curves for maturities of two years and less have been upward sloping until 2019.
In this case, averaging interest rates over a quarterly coupon period makes the FRN more
valuable and the spread required for a par value has to be negative.
    To get a better sense of the typical no-arbitrage spread , consider, for instance, the term
  2
    We have also considered term structure data from the close of the day before the auction and of the
auction date, and then averaged the prices. Di¤erences between the two dates are very small. The auction
deadline is at 11:30am. Using yield curve data based on Gurkaynak, Sack, and Wright (2007) produces very
similar estimates.

structure on 4/29/2015, date of a new auction. As shown in Figure 3, forward rates are
almost linear in maturity up to two years. A generic FRN promises quarterly coupons with
risk-neutral expected values equal to the forward rates (here annualized) at the beginning
of the period, that is forward rates determined at 0; 0:25 etc. until 1:75 in the ...gure. This
FRN would be valued at par. At the end of each quarter, the forward rate is on average
about 16 basis points higher than at the beginning, so that averaging over a period increases
the coupon value by about 8 basis points. To have FRNs priced at par, should be set to
approximately 8 basis points. The exact based equation on (1) is close, namely at 7:3.
     The pricing spreads determined by Treasury auctions have been positive throughout. We
de...ne the excess spread as the auction-determined spread minus the no-arbitrage spread, .
The excess spread represents the annualized interest cost the Treasury is paying for FRNs in
excess of the interest cost implied by the term structure of other Treasury securities. Figure
4 shows the time series of these spreads for 2014-2019. Excess spreads range between 5
and 39 basis points. Excess spreads were particularly high in early 2016. In 2019 they have
increased again from their low levels of early 2018. As shown in Figure 4, a substantial
part of the variation in the excess spread is captured by the High Discount Margin, HDM,
which is used by the Treasury to auction FRNs. In particular, for new auctions, the HDM
becomes the spread that is applied to a FRN which is sold at par. For reopenings, the
HDM determines the price of a FRN according to the Treasury'         s formula (Department of
the Treasury (2013)). As is clear in the ...gure, even in this case, the HDM can be seen as
the key driver of the excess spread.
     At a given point in time, there are FRNs from up to 24 issue dates outstanding. For
each of these issues, we compute the excess spread. Multiplying these by the corresponding
amounts issued gives us the total excess cost associated with all outstanding FRNs. Figure
5 reports excess borrowing cost for each calendar year. With more than 300 billion dollars
of FRNs outstanding, the excess borrowing cost for 2017 is estimated to be about 700
million dollars.3 The outstanding amount of FRNs in 2017 was about 328 billion dollars
on average. The excess spread over the lagging two years was about 21:2 basis points
on average, see Figure 4. As a back-of-the-envelop approximation, this amounts to about
0:00212 328; 000 = 695 million dollars. Given that the most generous FRNs issued have
been retired by the ...rst part of 2018, this cost was lower in 2018.

    Based on the Treasury direct website (https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm),
total interest expense for 2017, $700 million represents 0:15% of this total.

3    No-arbitrage pricing of FRN with a constant matu-
     rity index
In this section we derive the no-arbitrage value of a Treasury FRN and demonstrate that
equation 1 is very accurate in a low volatility environment as in 2014-2019. We also show
under what conditions a more involved pricing approach for FRN would be needed. Finally,
we document T-bill investment strategies and show that the excess returns from FRNs over
these strategies are closely related to our estimated excess spreads.
   Ruling out arbitrage, there exists a state-price valuation process t . The value of a
Treasury FRN is given by

for I 2 13 [0 : 7] and k 2 [0 : 12]. The period length is one week. At week I + k rate rI  +k
with a 13 week maturity is determined to be included in the coupon paid at I + 13. Coupons
are paid every 13 weeks. Pricing the FRN involves pricing 104 strips with payouts based on
the rate set by the weekly auction of the 13-week T-Bill. Rates are in e¤ective terms so that
 13
rI +k is a 13 week rate and coupon payments represent the average, thus the factor 1=13.

    Consider ...rst the case of a coupon strip with k = 0; the maturity date of the stochastic
discount, I +13 = 0 , and the payment date is the same as the maturity date of the interest
index, namely I + 13. In this case, starting for convenience with the strip including the
principal,

Clearly, the strip can be priced easily from current spot interest rates with the appropriate
maturities.
   This can be rewritten as

                                                     1+r0I . This is the rate between I and
I + 13 that can be locked in as of now by buying a zero coupon bond with a maturity of
I + 13 and borrowing the purchase price until period I . Intuitively, the forward rate, is the
certainty equivalent or the expected future interest rate under the risk-neutral distribution.
It is discounted with the spot interest rate corresponding to the coupon payment date.
    For the general case k > 0, the pricing process can longer be eliminated. As shown in
the Appendix A, the no-arbitrage value of a strip can be written as

side is non-zero for all k > 0 and zero for k = 0.
    For strips with k > 0 a "convexity adjustment" is needed. To compute it requires a
fully speci...ed pricing process or term structure model. A similar adjustment is required for
pricing the popular Eurodollar futures contracts which settle at the beginning of an interest
period (Veronesi, 2010, Section 21.7.). As we show below, the adjustment for pricing Treasury
FRNs has been small, in the order of signi...cantly less than 1 basis point in annualized coupon
equivalent terms. Therefore, Treasury FRNs can be e¤ectively priced based on the current
zero-coupon term structure alone ­at least in the low interest rate volatility environment of
2014-2019.
    To provide more intuition about the convexity adjustment, we can transform the value of
a strip so that it does not explicitly depend on the pricing process . De...ne the risk-neutral

    The equation shows the convexity adjustment depending on conditional variances and
covariances of short rates with at most 13-week maturity. Speci...cally, the adjustment
corresponds to the conditional variance of the 13-week rate I + k weeks plus a covariance
that is typically negative between the 13-week rate and the inverse of the rates of maturities
1 to 13.

3.1    Measuring the convexity adjustment
We represent the state-price valuation process t implicitly through a binomial tree of the
short rate. The short rate tree is speci...ed along the lines of a simple version of the Black,
Derman and Toy (BDT, 1990) model with constant interest rate volatility. The BDT model
is widely used by practitioners for pricing interest rate derivative contracts. See Veronesi
(2010) for a modern treatment. Speci...cally, the weekly short rate is speci...ed as

                                 rt+1 = rt exp(        t+1   + h1=2 "t+1 )

with "t+1 equal to 1 or +1, each with a risk-neutral probability of 0:5, and h = 1=52. The
time-dependent (known) factors t+1 are set so that spot rates for maturities ranging from
1 to 116 weeks exactly match the term structure. Reuters reports implied BDT volatilities
for caps and for swaptions for various maturities and the corresponding zero-coupon yields.
We set the volatility parameter based on the average of the reported volatilities across
maturities ranging from 3 months to 2 years, and across caps and swaptions.
    To illustrate the connection between the pricing process and the BDT interest rate
model, consider the price of a 2-period zero coupon bond

As shown in the ...gure, the convexity adjustment does not exceed 0:11 basis points for any
of the auction dates. Clearly, from the perspective of this paper, an adjustment of this
magnitude is irrelevant. As suggested by equation 4, the recent low-volatility environment
for interest rates is responsible for this conclusion.

Figure 6: The convexity adjustment is computed based on a version of the BDT model
calibrated to the term structure and the interest rate volatility on auction dates.

    Table 1 explores the convexity adjustment as a function of the level of the interest rate
and the volatility parameter. The ...rst two lines use a volatility parameter of 0:5 with
the term structure of the spot rates at a   at 1% or 1:5% in annualized terms. This case is
representative of the conditions between 2014 and 2019. The convexity adjustment is below
0:1 of a basis point. As represents the standard deviation of the natural logarithm of the
short rate, we report as a more intuitive measure of interest rate volatility the conditional
                                                                         13w
standard deviation of the 13-week rate one year in the future, Std0 (r1   Y ). For the ...rst two
cases, this standard deviation equals 0:53 or 0:79 percent, in annualized terms. This low
number is representative of the stability of short rates in the recent past. The lower two
lines contain examples with higher volatility parameters. The last line shows a case that is
representative of the peak volatility during the ...nancial crises as represented by the BDT
parameters for 10=10=2008. The convexity adjustment is 1:14 basis points. The implied
conditional standard deviation of the 13-week rate at a one-year horizon is 3%. Overall, the
table shows that while the current stable interest environment does not require a convexity
adjustment for reasonably accurate pricing of Treasury FRNs, such an adjustment has the
potential to become relevant with signi...cantly higher interest rate volatility.

3.2    T-bill investment strategies
Based on the term structures at auction dates, we have concluded that FRNs have o¤ered
excessive interest, or equivalently, that they have been cheap to buy for investors. In this
section, we document the ex-post realized returns from investing in FRNs, and compare
these to two T-bill investment strategies that approximately replicate the cash      ows of the
FRNs. The T-bill strategies can be considered as near arbitrage positions, as they can allow
investors to exploit excess spreads in FRNs by going long a FRN and short a T-bill strategy.
We ...nd that FRNs investments have mostly outperformed a buy-and-hold strategy with
three-month T-bills. Investing in on-the-run 3-month T-bills rolled over every week has had
a slightly higher return on average than FRN investments. For both T-bill strategies, we ...nd
a strong positive relation between our estimated excess spreads on FRNs and the subsequent
realized excess returns of FRNs over the T-bill strategies.
    A generic FRN can be perfectly replicated by rolled-over short-term investments. Because
the Treasury'  s FRNs pay a coupon based on an average of the three-month T-bill rate, such
perfect replication is not feasible. Replication with widely available derivative contracts also
does not seem possible. For instance, to replicate the coupon payments of a FRN over its two-
year life one would need forward contracts on the three-month T-bill rate for every week over
that period. That is, one would need forward contracts with 103 di¤erent maturity dates, one
for each week. Such contracts are not widely available. Given these constraints, we consider
here the possibility of establishing near-arbitrage positions that replicate approximately the
FRNs with investments in three-month T-bills.
    The ...rst strategy we consider is to invest in three-month (13-week) T-bills by holding a
bill until maturity, and by aligning its maturity as close as possible with a coupon payment
date for a FRN. If the Treasury'   s FRN were of the generic type, this buy-and-hold strategy
would perfectly replicate its cash   ows, except for some minor mismatch in the maturity dates
of the T-bill and the FRN. In a frictionless arbitrage-free environment, daily returns on a


                                              15
generic FRN and this short-term strategy would be equalized. Due to the interest averaging
feature of the Treasury' s FRNs, the replication is no longer perfect. Within quarter changes
in the current T-bill rates are re ected in the FRNs'coupon but not in the cash      ow of the
approximate replication strategy.
    The second strategy always invests in the most recently issued three-month T-bill. This
can capture within quarter changes in three-month rates. However, this introduces additional
interest rate risk. For instance, one day before maturity, the FRN is not subject to direct
interest rate risk, but the three-month T-bill is subject to interest rate risk when it is sold.
We label this the "on-the-run" strategy.
    We compute daily returns for FRNs and T-bills based on secondary market prices and
accrued interest on FRNs. Secondary market close prices are obtained from Reuters Eikon,
accrued FRN interest data is obtained from Treasury Direct, daily T-bill returns for the on-
the-run strategy are from CRSP. For the buy-and-hold T-bill strategy, we identify 13-week
T-bills that best match the coupon periods of the FRNs. These bills mature at the end of
January, April, July and October, ranging from January 2014 to December 2019.
    Table 2 summarizes properties of these strategies. Average daily realized returns on the
FRNs have exceeded the returns of the buy-and-hold T-bill investments for 21 out of the
24 FRN issues, while FRN returns exceeded the on-the-run T-bill strategy on in 8 out of
24 case. Average excess returns of FRN over the entire sample period were 16 basis points
and -2 basis points relative to the buy-and-hold and the on-the-run strategies, respectively.
One possible explanation for the higher returns of the on-the-run strategy compared to the
buy-and-hold strategy is that it has relatively more duration risk.
    As shown in Figure 7 there is a clear positive relationship between our estimated excess
spreads at auction dates and the subsequent realized excess returns of a FRN issue. In
particular, the buy-and-hold strategy excess spreads translate almost one for one into FRN
excess returns. The two outliers in Figure 7 with a realized excess returns of over 60 basis
points correspond to the October 2019 issue, whose reported average return is based on only
40 observations; issues before 2018 (that have matured before the end of the sample) have
approximately 500 observations, as shown in Table 2.




                                              16
   Table 2: Returns are computed daily, in percentage points. Means are scaled by 250,
standard deviations by 250^.5. Excess returns are FRN returns minus T-bill returns. Mo-
ments computed for the whole sample use each available return.


    While the two T-bill strategies can naturally be thought of as approximately replicating
the returns of the FRNs, our analysis shows that at a daily frequency the replication is not
very tight. Indeed, in the table, the standard deviation of the returns of the FRNs in excess
of the T-bill investments over the whole sample is only moderately lower than the standard
deviation of the FRNs themselves. To the extent that excess returns can be thought of as a
long-short investment, the short T-bill investments did hedge the daily returns of the FRNs
only very partially. This suggests that daily returns to FRNs were driven by other factors
than just concurrent T-bill prices.
    Bhanot and Guo (2017) document daily excess returns for FRNs up to October 2016
relative to a set of overnight rates, in particular, FF rates, GCR rates, and Overnight LIBOR.
They also document excess returns for FRN issues relative to the T-bill index for the FRNs.
Our excess returns of FRNs are with respect to the returns of T-bill investment strategies
and are therefore not equivalent to the excess returns they compute.

                    Figure 8: T-bill - LIBOR basis swaps bid-ask quotes.

    Fleckenstein and Longsta¤ (2018) attempt to use T-bill/LIBOR basis-swaps with plain
vanilla LIBOR interest rate swaps to replicate Treasury FRNs and identify an arbitrage
opportunity given the di¤erence in the returns of their resulting replicating portfolio and the
U.S. Treasury FRNs. While T-bill/LIBOR basis swaps combined with interest rate swaps
would theoretically o¤er a nearly perfectly replicating portfolio (Treasury FRN weekly reset
dates make for some small basis), T-bill/LIBOR basis swaps have become extremely illiquid
since the global ...nancial crisis of 2008 as bid-ask spreads have widened to 50 bps (Figure 8).
The bid-ask prices are primarily broker quotes (provided by brokers like Tullett Prebon) and
remain very thinly traded. One could argue that the lack of a liquid arbitrage opportunity
may be in part responsible for the Treasury FRN mispricing we have previously identi...ed.


4    Optimal government debt management with FRNs
This section starts by reviewing conditions under which FRNs are redundant in typical
models for optimal government debt management. We then study the optimal provision of
FRNs in a model where short-term debt provides additional liquidity services not available
in FRNs. The main conclusion of the analysis is that optimally managed government debt
can be consistent with a positive amount of FRNs issued that pay interest that can appear
excessive.

4.1       FRNs without frictions
A generic FRN pays the one-period interest rate every period and the principal at maturity.
Consider a default-free FRN with a         oating rate indexed to the default-free one-period
interest rate between t and t + 1, rt;t+1 . For instance, with three periods, with t = 0; 1 and
2, the FRN pays

                                             r0;1 at t = 1; and
                                        1 + r1;2 at t = 2:

                                                 F          F
The prices of this bond at time 1 and time 0, P1  ;2 and P0;2 , can be derived sequentially by
no-arbitrage as
                                                         F
                        F     1 + r1;2           F
                                                       P1 ;2 + r0;1
                      P1 ;2 =          = 1 and P 0;2 =              = 1:
                              1 + r1;2                  1 + r0;1
There is no price risk for FRNs. The bond is valued at par each period. The same property
holds with any number of periods.
   For standard model speci...cations, a FRN is indistinguishable from rolled-over short-term
debt, and thus FRNs do not add anything. To see this, assume a time t budget constraint
                                                1          F
with Wt the beginning of period wealth and Bt    +1 and Bt+1 the amounts of one-period debt
and FRNs,
                                              1        F
                                  Wt = ::: + Bt +1 + Bt+1 :::

and for time t + 1

                                              1                     F
                          :: + (1 + rt;t+1 ) Bt +1 + (1 + rt;t+1 ) Bt+1 :: + ::: = ::


                                                                1      F
where the FRN is always valued at par. Then, for any plan Bt     +1 ; Bt+1 of the two holdings,
                                      1      F
there is a budget-equivalent plan Bt   +1 + Bt+1 ; 0 . FRNs do not add anything to short-term
debt whether markets are complete or incomplete. This follows from the absence of arbitrage
and the absence of frictions.
    The FRNs issued by the U.S. Treasury di¤er from the generic version in that their coupon
is the average three-month rate over the quarter as opposed to the rate determined at the

extent. However, averaging interest rates within a quarter does not signi...cantly a¤ect the
correlation structure of the coupons over longer horizons, and this feature is unlikely to
matter signi...cantly for the role FRNs play for government debt policy. Our model will not
explicitly incorporate this feature.4

4.2     FRNs when short-term debt is special
When short-term debt has some money-like utility, rolled-over short-term debt is no longer
equivalent to a FRN. We are studying here a simple framework with this property by adding
FRNs to the model of Greenwood, Hanson and Stein (2015). The speci...cation of the utility
for short-term debt and the optimization of seigniorage is slightly more general than in their
case. This setting is attractive because it can account for the idea that short-term debt is
"cheaper" to issue than long-term debt in a way where this does not just re       ect a premium
for market risk. This framework is also very tractable. In particular, due to linear utility of
consumption, consumption does not a¤ect bond prices, and the optimal debt policy can be
characterized analytically. On the negative side, this is essentially a one-shot model and as
such implies some shortcuts relative to a fully dynamic in...nite horizon setting.
    There are three periods: 0; 1 and 2. There is a single source of uncertainty, a discount
rate shock realized at time 1 that a¤ects the interest rate at t = 1, with E0 ( ) = 1.
For simplicity, like in Greenwood, Hanson and Stein (2015), we abstract from in             ation
uncertainty and other shocks. At time 0 and 1 the government can issue one-period discount
bonds in amounts B0;1 and B1;2 . Two-period discount bonds, B0;2 , pay one unit of the
                                 F
numeraire at time 2. A FRN, B0    ;2 , is assumed to pay (1 + r1;2 ) at time 2. The interest, r1;2 ,
is not known at time 0. First period interest for the FRN and the (two-period bond) are
not included for tractability. The FRN can be viewed as a zero-coupon security, de...ned as
paying
                                         (1 + r0;1 ) (1 + r1;2 )

at time 2. First period interest, r0;1 , is equivalent to re-scaling the notional amount.
    Short-term debt in the initial period provides money-like utility through an increasing
function v (B0;1 ). It would be reasonable to assume that government debt other than short-
term bills o¤er monetary services. For the argument presented here it is essential that bills
have some advantage over longer maturity debt including FRNs. The evidence of an excess
spread in U.S. FRNs presented in Section (2) supports this assumption. More generally,
Greenwood, Hanson and Stein (2015 and 2016) present evidence supporting the idea of a
money-like premium for short-term T-bills.
    Household utility from consumption and short-term debt is

                               U = v (B0;1 ) + C0 + E0 [C1 + C2 ] :

   As is standard in the literature, we abstract from political distortions and assume a
benevolent government. The government maximizes the utility of the households taking
equilibrium pricing as given. Substituting the government budget constraints into household

debt. There is potential for re...nancing risk due to the stochastic short rate at time 1.

4.3        Optimal debt structure
Our characterization of the solution proceeds in two steps. First, it is shown that the optimal
policy implies perfect tax smoothing across the three periods. Second, the optimal issuance
of FRN is derived.

4.3.1        Tax smoothing

This sub-section shows that the optimal debt issuance allows the government to perfectly
smooth taxes across time and states of nature. The solution is determined recursively. As
such, it is time-consistent. At time 1 the government'
                                                     s problem is

From the government' s budget constraint, this implies that there is perfect tax smoothing
between time 1 and 2

That is, the interest rate risk coming from          is perfectly hedged away and there is no
uncertainty about future taxes. In other words, taxes at time 2 are matched by long-term
debt, and taxes at time 1 are matched by a combination of short term debt and FRNs.
   Inserting this result in one of the ...rst-order conditions (9) or (10) gives

                      0   = G   B0;1 f1 + v 0 (B0;1 )g                B0;2          F

                                                 3
To summarize, taxes are perfectly smoothed across the three periods to pay for government
spending not ...nanced by seigniorage, that is G B0;1 v 0 (B0;1 ). Interest rate uncertainty is
hedged away by the combination of short term debt and FRNs. Without FRNs, taxes would
typically be subject to interest rate risk; FRNs help eliminate this exposure.




                                                                24
4.3.2   Optimal issuance of FRNs

The position of FRNs depends on the optimal level of short-term debt. If short-term debt is
relatively abundant, that is B0;1 > B0;2 , then the government would want to save with FRNs
to hedge the interest rate risk (as implied by equation 11). If the short-term debt position
is relatively small, that is B0;1 < B0;2 , the government would issue FRNs.
    The negative relation between B0;1 =B0;2 and FRN issuance is a consequence of tax
smoothing and the perfect correlation of the interest cost on short-term debt and FRNs.
This correlation makes a FRN a closer substitute to short-term debt than to long-term debt
for managing tax risk. Figure 2 shows that the share of short-term Treasuries, T-bills, has
come down in the years before 2014. One could interpret the relatively lower share of T-bills
in 2014 when FRN have started to be issued as consistent with the implications of the model.
    We solve the problem fully by taking the properties of the solution conditional on B0;1
                                                         F
as given. In particular, we substitute out B0;2 and B0    ;2 and use the perfect tax-smoothing
property so that the optimal B0;1 solves

                                                                 3   2
                                         max v (B0;1 )                   :
                                         B0;1                    2

By substituting the budget constraint and rearranging we get

                                                   1                            2
                           max v (B0;1 )             (G     B0;1 v 0 (B0;1 ))       :             (12)

equalizing the (negative of the) marginal utility from money to the marginal cost of the tax
distortion e¤ect from seigniorage. Focusing on a speci...cation where v 0 (B0;1 ) > 0, an interior
maximum either requires that the amount to be debt-...nanced (G B0;1 v 0 (B0;1 )) becomes
negative or that the derivative of seigniorage with respect to B0;1 becomes negative. This
derivative can be viewed as the slope of a type of La¤er curve. So in the later case, the
government issues short-term debt beyond the peak of this curve.
    As an example, assume a negative exponential function v (B0;1 ) = e B0;1 with parame-
ter > 0. In this case, the top of the seigniorage curve B0;1 v 0 (B0;1 ) is at B0;1 = 1= with a
peak value of seigniorage of e 1 = 0:368. Interestingly, this does not depend on the value of

5     Drivers of excess spreads
In this section we present a dynamic pricing model that builds on the ideas of our theoretical
analysis, and we examine the relation between the documented excess spreads and potential
explanatory factors.


5.1    In...nite-horizon money-in-utility model
In this subsection we present a dynamic model for pricing FRNs that extends the framework
of the previous section and that allows us to more explicitly characterize the deviations from
the standard no-arbitrage setting we have documented in section 2.
    Assume investors have a preference for cash over securities due to its immediacy, the
absence of risk, and the absence of a need to participate in securities markets. We consider
as cash or money equivalently dollar bills, central bank reserves, maturing T-bills, and current
interest payments on long-term bonds. In each period, investors get utility from consumption


                                                                   26
and from cash holdings
                                          u (Ct ) + vt (Mt ) :

    Investors value consumption Ct through a concave period utility u (:), and they value
cash or money-like assets Mt they enter the period with. For instance, T-bills purchased at
time t 1 that mature in t give this utility at t, but also other cash payments such as coupon
payments on bonds received at t. The money utility vt (Mt ) can depend on other factors
or shocks, and this is expressed by the time subscript. This is a version of a money-in-the-
utility-function speci...cation; for early examples see Sidrauski (1967) or Feenstra (1986).
    Investors have access to various bonds, free of default risk, in an otherwise frictionless
way. The ...rst-order condition for a T-bill, a one-period risk-free asset, is

                                            u0 (Ct+1 ) + vt
                                                          0
                                                            +1 (Mt+1 )
                                 pt = E t              0
                                                                       :
                                                      u (Ct )
                                             0
The marginal money value next period, vt       +1 (Mt+1 ), a¤ects the price positively.
    We study multiperiod bonds with geometric amortization. A bullet bond has a large
utility value in the last period for the principal. This would slightly complicate the algebra,
but without any substantive impact on our arguments. For an amortizing FRNs, there is no
last period, but coupon and amortization payments are counted as money next period. A
newly issued FRN is priced as

                    u0 (Ct+1 ) + vt0
                                     +1 (Mt+1 )                        u0 (Ct+1 )
         qt = E t                               [ i t +1 + s + ] + E t            (1   ) qt+1 :
                              u0 (Ct )                                  u0 (Ct )

The cash payments ­the interest including the spread (it+1 + s) as well as the amortization
  ­ are valued more highly than the outstanding bond. The coupon index is given by the
T-bill rate,
                                     it+1 = 1=pt 1:

Just to be clear, in this section we abstract from the complication due to the constant
maturity index. This should mostly a¤ect very high frequency properties.
    The spread of a newly issued FRN, st , is determined by setting qt = 1, and after some
algebra, see Appendix B, this equals

                                                        t(f t g)

As shown in equation 15, t+k measures the money spread, the expected value of the di¤er-
ence between one-period rates without the money utility

                                      1 + rt+k        u (Ct+k )

and the one-period T-bill rate it+k .
    Clearly, in a standard no-arbitrage setting without special utility for money-like assets,
st equals 0. If the money spread is constant t+k = , then the FRNs'spread equals

                                          s = (1           ) (r   i) :

Intuitively, investors in a multi-period FRN need to be compensated for the non-amortized
component (1       ) which lacks the money utility. In general, there is variation in the money
spread and therefore the forecasts of the money spreads over the maturity of the FRN are
important.


5.2    Factors correlated with excess spreads
Based on equation (14) and (15), we empirically examine some factors that potentially cap-
ture the mechanisms highlighted by this model. In particular, we consider the spread between
T-bill rates and non-governement short rates such as OIS and LIBOR rates. Presumably,
the immediacy of cash is particularly valued in periods of high uncertainty, which leads us
to consider a measure of implied volatility of interest rates. As an alternative to the factors
directly suggested by our model, we also consider a basic demand indicator for FRNs as
given by the bid-to-cover ratios for FRNs auctions.

Table 3: Regression of Excess Spreads in FRNs 1/2014 - 12/2019. All variables are measured
at FRN auction dates. The regression is estimated by OLS with Newey-West standard errors.

starting months 0; 3; 6; and 9; OIS forward rates of longer horizons are very noisy. The
LIBOR minus T-bill spread is the average based on the 3-month forward rates starting in
0; 3; 6; and 9 months. This corresponds to the (spot) TED spread averaged with forward
TED spreads. The interest rate volatility is the forward volatility of 3-month swap implied
forward rates averaged across 6; 12 and 18 months maturities, based on swaptions and caps.
    The regression results in Table 3 show signi...cant OIS and LIBOR spreads, but the OIS
spread has the wrong sign. Interest rate volatility is strongly signi...cant with the expected
sign. The bid-to-cover ratio is not signi...cant at the 10% level. In univariate regressions, the
interest volatility has by far the highest adjusted R2 .
    Figure 10 shows excess spreads together with our measure of interest volatility, visually
con...rming the strong comovement between these two variables. For comparison with a more
standard measure of implied interest rate volatility, the MOVE index for 6-month options on
Treasury securities is included in the ...gure. This is a popular measure of implied volatility
for OTC Treasury options. Clearly, our measure of interest rate volatility which is based on
the maturities suggested by our dynamic model is closely related to the MOVE index despite
the di¤erences in maturity and underlying instruments.
    Figure 11 compares excess spreads and bid-to-cover ratios. Consistent with the regression
results reported in table 3, there is no obvious visual connection between the two if one
considers the entire sample period. However, for the ...rst 21 months FRNs were issued
(emphasized in the ...gure) there clearly is a strong connection. Over this particular period,
the R2 in the regression is 0.71. The bid-to-cover ratio displayed is transformed by the
(negative) slope and the intercept from that regression. Based on this, it appears that at
least initially the bid-to-cover ratio could have been an important driver of the excess spread.

6    Conclusion
The new FRNs issued by the U.S. Treasury pay interest based on a constant maturity
index of T-bill rates. This feature requires an explicit pricing model. We have derived
a no-arbitrage pricing model for this purpose and shown that an accurate approximation
for pricing FRNs can be based on implied forward rates alone. Convexity adjustments are
quantitively unimportant given the low volatility of short-term rates between 2014 and 2019.
    Our main ...nding is that U.S. FRNs when priced through a no-arbitrage approach have
been paying excessively high interest. Nevertheless, as we have shown in the paper, optimally
managed government debt can include FRNs. Our argument is based on the idea that short-
term government debt can provide liquidity services, and that the optimal amount of short-
term debt might be such as to generate re...nancing risk. In this case, FRNs with payo¤s
positively correlated with future short-term rates can be used to manage this risk.

    Appendix A: Pricing FRNs
    The main pricing equation is derived for a four period environment with periods t =
0; 1; 2; 3: This reduces notational complexity.
    At t = 0 we price a claim that pays a single coupon at time t = 2. This coupon is de...ned
as
                                           1
                                      C2 = (r0;2 + r1;3 ) ;
                                           2
that is, the average of the two-period rates determined at time t = 0 and t = 1. Clearly, as
of time t = 0, r1;3 is not known. Like the Treasury FRNs, this note pays a coupon that is
an average of constant-maturity rates.
    Ruling out arbitrage, there exists a state-price valuation process t that determines the
price of this claim

Pricing the second strip is nontrivial in that is not just a function of the current (time 0)
term structure. Speci...cally, because there is a timing mismatch between the payment date,
2, and the maturity date implied by the rate used, 3, current forward rates and the current
term structure are in general not enough for pricing the second strip. This applies to all
the strips of the Treasury FRNs with rates determined between 1 and 12 weeks after the
beginning of a quarter.
