                                             ABSTRACT

We study how economic incentives affect labor force exit through different income security programs,
old-age pensions as well as income taxes in Sweden. We use the option value for staying in the labor
force as a measure of economic incentives and estimate an econometric model for the choice of leaving
the labor market. Besides old-age pension, we focus on the Disability Insurance (DI), which is the
most important exit path before age 65. By simulating the effect of different probabilities to be admitted
DI we show how changes in the stringency of DI admittance affects labor supply among older workers
through economic incentives.

1. Introduction
In absence of a state early retirement scheme, the Disability Insurance (DI) program in
Sweden is by far the most common pathway for labor market exit for those who exit before
age 65. In the early 1990s the share of the age group 60-64 receiving DI was around 35
percent for both men and women. Although this share has decreased considerably following a
series of reforms of eligibility rules, still about 17 percent of men and 25 percent of women in
this age group receive DI. This is a larger share than in most other comparable countries (see
e.g. Wise, 2012).


In Jönsson et al. (2012) it was shown that historical changes in eligibility rules affected
utilization of the DI program. However, an outstanding question is to what extent general
changes in DI stringency will lead to increased labor force participation. This depends on the
economic incentives induced by the old age pension scheme and the DI program as well as on
how people react on economic incentives in their retirement decision. If the generosity in
benefits is very similar in the old-age and DI programs or if people are not very sensitive to
economic incentives in their retirement decisions, the effect of changes in the stringency of DI
acceptance will lead to only very small changes in labor force participation rates. Conversely,
if differences in economic incentives between the two schemes are very large and if people
are very sensitive to these differences there will be comparatively large effects on labor force
participation rates.


In this paper we use an option value model (see Stock and Wise, 1990) to estimate the effect
of economic incentives on retirement behavior of older workers in Sweden. We consider two
different pathways to retirement: the old-age pension path and the social insurance path. The
latter includes the Unemployment Insurance (UI), the Sickness Insurance (SI) and DI, but we
focus on the incentives provided by the DI program. We use data including the entire Swedish
population aged between age 50 and 69 and estimate the model on the observed retirement
behavior between 2001 and 2008. We use the estimated model to simulate the employment
effect of different policy regimes for DI acceptance.


We find that there is a significant effect of economic incentives on DI utilization. Our results
also suggest that there are important between group heterogeneity: the quintile group with the
most inferior health status as well as low educated respond more strongly on economic


                                                2
incentives. The simulation exercises, however, show that the effects of economic incentives,
through changes in the stringency of DI admittance, overall are quite small.


The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a brief overview of Sweden’s income
security systems, describes recent developments in DI rates and employment among older
workers and, finally, describes different pathways for exit from the Swedish labor market.
Section 3 presents our data and the empirical approach. Section 4 presents the estimation
results from the econometric models. Section 5 discusses the outcomes from the policy
simulations. Section 6 concludes.


2. Background


2.1 Sweden’s social security and income security systems
In this section we describe the institutional details of Sweden’s income security systems that
we account for in this paper. We consider both the public system as well as the centrally
bargained plans. We also describe the simplifications we made in the calculations of the
incentive measure. The empirical analysis includes individuals aged between 50 and 69
during the period 2001 to 2008, i.e., born between 1932 and 1958. We only describe the rules
that applied to these cohorts.


2.1.1 The old-age pension system
Sweden recently went through a major reform of its public old-age pension system. The old
system was a pay-as-you-go defined benefit pension system, whereas the new system is a
mixture of a notional defined contribution pay-as-you-go pension system and a fully funded
pension scheme with individual accounts. The new pension system was implemented in 1999
and the first payments were made in 2001. The new system is phased in by cohort. Cohorts
born before 1938 are completely in the old pension system. The 1938 cohort receives their
pension to 4/20 from the new system and to 16/20 from the old system. Each successive
cohort until the 1953 cohort receives an additional 1/20 from the new system and 1/20 less
from the old system. The 1954 cohort receives their pension completely from the new pension
system. Since we include individuals born between 1932 and 1958, we include those who are
completely in the old system, different mixtures of the systems as well as those who are
completely in the new system.

                                               3
The pre-reform old-age pension system consists of two main parts: a basic pension and an
income-related supplementary pension. All Swedish citizens permanently living in Sweden
are entitled to a basic pension, which is 96 percent of one Basic Amount (BA)1 for singles and
78.5 percent for married. The BA is an indexation unit that price adjusts the Swedish income
security system. It is politically determined, but has followed the CPI very closely. There is
also a supplementary pension (ATP), which is determined by the average of the 15 best years
in the individual’s income history up to 7.5 BA.2,3,4 It is linearly reduced if the person
contributed less than 30 years to the scheme. The normal retirement age for both the basic and
the supplementary pension is 65, but both could be claimed in advance with a 0.5 percent
actuarial reduction per month of early withdrawal from age 61 and delayed with an actuarial
addition of 0.7 percent for each month of delay until age 70. Individuals with no, or low, ATP
are entitled to a special supplement of 56.9 percent of a BA, reduced on a one-to-one basis
against the supplementary pension.


In the new public pension system contributions amount to 18.5 percent of pensionable
income, of which 16 percent is credited to a notional defined contribution scheme and 2.5
percent is credited to a financial defined contribution scheme. In the calculations, we
disregard the financial defined contribution scheme and attribute the full 18.5 percent to the
notional defined contribution scheme. Therefore, we also do not describe the financial scheme
but refer to Hagen (2013) for a detailed description.




1
  One BA was SEK 45,900/USD 6,600 in 2010.
2
  From 1996 the ceiling was 7.5 increased price base amounts and from 2001 the ceiling is 7.5 income base
amounts. The increased price base amount follows the prices in the economy, and the income base amount
follows incomes. This means than the income price base amount is higher than the price base amount and
accordingly the increased price base amount.
3
  The pensionable income is the annual income from labor earnings and public transfer systems below the social
security ceiling of 7.5 price base amounts. To simplify calculations, we only account for the pensionable income
that comes from labor earnings and the collection of disability benefits, but no other public transfer systems.
4
  The benefit level from the ATP is determined in several steps. First, the pension points for each year are
calculated as the pensionable income above one price base amount divided by the current year price base
amount. Since the social security ceiling is 7.5 price base amounts, the maximum number of pension points that
can be collected each year is 6.5. Thereafter, the average pension points is calculated as the average of the
individual’s 15 best years in terms of pension points collected. Finally, the individual’s ATP pension income is
calculated by applying the formula
                                                            (      )
where      is the average pension points,   is the price base amount, and    is the number of years with
pension-rights income greater than zero.

                                                       4
In the notional defined contribution scheme individuals collect notional pension rights based
on their annual pensionable income and the annual contributions are used to finance current
pension benefits in a pay-as-you-go system. The pensionable income is the total wage and
public transfer income minus a 7 percent general pension contribution paid by all employees. 5
The maximum pensionable income is 7.5 income base amounts. Annual pensionable income
must exceed a threshold of 42.3 percent of the price base amount to yield pension rights. The
new pension system is based on the life-income principle and pension rights are accumulated
from age 16 or from year 1960. Accumulated pension rights are adjusted annually according
to an income index reflecting the average wage growth. In this paper, we assume an average
wage growth of 1.6 percent throughout the period.


There is no normal pension age in the new public pension system but the minimum age of
withdrawal is 61. Pension benefits at the age of retirement are calculated as the accumulated
pension rights divided by an annuity divisor that is determined by average life expectancy for
the given cohort at the given retirement age and an imputed real return of 1.6 percent. If the
current year contributions are too small to cover the pension payments an automatic balance
mechanism is activated. In this paper, we assume that funds are enough to finance the pension
payments and disregard the automatic balance mechanism but for further details, see Hagen
(2013).


For individuals with no or low earnings, the new pension system also contains a means-tested
pension supplement that replaced the universal basic pension and the special supplement in
the old pension system from 1 January 2003. For cohorts born from 1938 onwards, the so
called guaranteed pension amounts to 2.13 income base amounts minus public pension
benefits if public pension benefits are smaller than 1.26 income base amounts. If public
pension benefits are larger than 1.26 income base amounts, the guaranteed pension is 0.87
income base amounts minus 48 percent of the public pension benefits that exceed 1.26 income
base amounts. This implies that the guaranteed pension is phased out for individuals with
public pension benefits above 3.07 income base amounts.


For those born before 1938, the rules for guaranteed pension are slightly different. For these
cohorts, both public pension benefits and occupational pension benefits are taken into

from 2000 onwards.

account. Given the sum of public and occupational pension (P), the formulas for the
guaranteed pension benefits are:
                                                       if                     income BA
                                                       if                      income BA
                          (          )                 if                     income BA.


2.1.2 The disability insurance system
Before 2003, the disability insurance was part of the old public pension system. Benefits were
calculated in the same way as old-age pension, consisting of the basic pension and an income-
related ATP supplement. As for old-age pension, the basic pension amounted to 96 percent of
the basic amount for a single and 78.5 percent for a married disability pensioner. The special
supplement for disability benefits was substantially larger than for old-age pension, however,
at 112.9 percent of a basic amount, reduced on a one-to-one basis against the supplementary
pension.


The supplementary pension in the old disability insurance system was based on an “assumed”
income. The assumed income was calculated as the most favorable outcome from two
different calculations. The first one was the average income of the two best out of the last four
years before retirement. The second was the average income of half of the years during which
the individual had positive pension points. The assumed income was used in the same formula
as for old-age pension, but was not subject to the actuarial reduction for withdrawal in
advance. The number of contribution years was calculated as the sum of the actual number of
contribution years and the number of years between retirement and age 64. If this sum was
lower than 30, benefits were reduced in the same way as for the old-age pension.


Since 2003, the disability insurance system is part of the social insurance system. Benefits are
based on the assumed income, which is calculated as the average of the three highest annual
earnings up to 7.5 income base amounts during the frame time immediately preceding labor
force exit. The frame time is 8 years for individuals below age 47, 7 years for individuals
between age 47 and age 50, 6 years for individuals between age 50 and 53, and 5 years for
individuals above age 53. Disability benefits amount to 64 percent of the assumed income.
Individuals with low assumed income receive a guaranteed level of disability benefits
(amounting to 2.4 income BAs). Individuals collect pension points and pension rights also


                                               6
during periods with disability benefits. The collection is based on the total assumed income,
not only on the benefit payments, during the years until age 65. At age 65, individuals are
transferred from the disability insurance system to the public pension system, with no
reduction in public pension benefits due to early withdrawal.


The eligibility rules for the DI have been changed on several occasions since the early 1970s.6
Since the early 1990s there have been a series of reforms leading to more stringent rules for
DI admittance. In 1991 the right to receive DI for long-term unemployed workers older than
age 60 was abolished and the right to DI for labor market reasons combined with health
reasons was abolished in 1997. In 2003 the eligibility rules were further strengthened. The
rules changed so that the ability to work should be tested against the entire labor market, not
just the job that the insured worker was on when applying for DI. Finally, in 2008 a number
of changes affecting eligibility were implemented. Most importantly, eligibility now required
permanent disability.


2.1.3 Occupational pension plans, taxation and means-tested benefits
In addition to the public pension system, the most important pension schemes on the Swedish
labor market are the occupational pension plans. Sweden has a highly unionized labor market.
More than 90 percent of the labor market is covered by central agreements. These agreements
contain, among other things, pension benefits and supplementary disability insurance. There
are four main programs: one for white collar workers in the private sector, one for blue collar
workers in the private sector, one for central government employees and, finally, one for local
government employees. A main motivation for all these programs is to insure earnings above
the social security ceiling at 7.5 BA. Palme and Svensson (1999 and 2004) give a detailed
description of these programs. We also provide a detailed description of the rules that applied
during our period of study in the Appendix.


The option value of delaying retirement also depends on taxes. During the period under study
there has been a tax bracket creep in the state income tax system, but also an introduction of
an earned income tax credit in 2007. The details of the tax system during this period are
described in the Appendix. We further account for means-tested benefits which are also
described in the Appendix.

 The institutional changes are described and their employment effects are analyzed in Karlström et al. (2008)
and Jönsson et al. (2012).

2.2. The development of disability rates and employment
The DI program is one of the most important programs in Sweden’s income security system.
Figure 1 shows the participation in the DI program since the early 1960s by different age
groups for males and females, respectively. Figure 1 shows that there are huge variations in
the participation rates, in particular for the age group 60-64. This partially reflects the fact
that, as described in Section 2.1.2, the DI program has served somewhat different purposes
over the period under study. In the 1970s and 1980s it was for example possible to get DI for
labor market reasons. Older long-term unemployed workers were eligible for DI first for
health reasons in combination with labor market reasons and then for labor market reasons
alone. The decline in the DI participation rate reflects several changes in eligibility rules.

Figure 1. DI participation rates by age and gender, 1962–2012

A key question in the study of how the DI affects the labor market is of course to what extent
the DI participation rate affects employment and labor supply. Figure 2 presents the
development of employment along with share receiving DI for each age and gender group.
The development for females is affected by a strong trend towards higher female labor force
participation in all age groups during the period under study. For males in all age groups,
however, it is apparent that there is a relationship between employment and DI participation:
when the DI participation rate increased from the early 1960s until the mid 1990s there is a
trend towards a lower employment rate in this group. Likewise, when DI participation
declined in the 1990s there is an increase in the employment rate in this age group.

2.3 The social insurance pathway to retirement
Although the disability insurance program is by far the most common pathway for labor force
exit for those who do not use old-age pensions it is common that the insured worker starts his
or her exit route in another program, such as the Unemployment Insurance (UI) or the



                                                                                       9
Sickness Insurance (SI).7 Since there is substitutability between these programs we will lump
them together in the empirical analysis as a simplification. We label this pathway the “social
insurance pathway”. In the empirical analysis we study retirement behavior between 2001 and
2008. Section 3 describes the data we use, the definition of retirement and the pathways we
consider in more detail. However, we will already in this Section give a brief overview of
how the prevalence of the social insurance pathway has changed over time and how this
prevalence differs within different population groups.


Figure 3 shows the share of individuals in the age groups 50–54, 55–59 and 60–64 who have
retired through the social insurance pathway between 2001 and 2008 among men and women,
respectively. The social insurance pathway has been more commonly used among women
than men in all age groups throughout the studied period. For both men and women, however,
the share of the population who has retired through the social insurance pathway has
decreased substantially over the studied period. The share has decreased from over 30 percent
to about 20 percent among men in the age group 60–64 and from about 40 percent to less than
30 percent among women in the same age group between 2001 and 2008.

Figure 4. Share retired through the social insurance pathway in age 50–64 by education and
gender, 2001–2008

Figure 5 reveals that the higher disability rates among the low educated are also reflected in
lower employment rates in the age group 50-69 for males and females, respectively. The
figure also shows that there is a much larger difference in employment by education group
among women than men. Employment is almost twice as high – around 40 percent compared
to almost 80 percent – for college educated women compared to those with only compulsory
schooling. The corresponding figures for men are 80 versus 60 percent, i.e., the difference is
in that low educated women work substantially less than the corresponding group among

Figure 6 shows the share of individuals aged 50–64 in different health quintiles who have
retired through the social insurance pathway between 2001 and 2008 among men and women,
respectively. The construction of the health measure is explained in section 3.3. The first
quintile is the group with the most inferior health status. It is not surprising that the figure
shows that the individuals in this group are most likely to retire through the social insurance
pathway and that this likelihood decreases as health improves across the quintiles.8 It is
interesting to note that the difference between the first quintile group and the other groups
increases over time as the stringency in DI admittance increases. The likelihood to receive DI
in the lowest health quintile is almost unchanged over time.

 As we explain in Section 3.3, the health measure is improving over time due to more data. From 2005 we also
have the drug prescription register, which improves the health index primarily for the highest quintiles.

                                                                                         12
Figure 7 shows that the pattern from Figure 6 on the probability of retiring through the social
insurance pathway is repeated for labor force participation rates by health quintile in the age
group 50–69 for both men and women. The figure also shows that the increased labor force
participation rate is primarily attributed to the groups with a good health status both among
men and women.


Finally, Figure 8 shows the share of individuals who retired through the social insurance
pathway in the age group 50–64 by health quintile and education group, combined over the
entire period 2001–2008. The figure shows that that the pattern across health quintiles seen in
Figure 6 is stable within education groups. It also shows that the pattern across education
groups is stable within health quintiles, i.e., the fact that low educated are more likely to retire
through the social insurance pathway is not only attributed to inferior health.

3. Data and Empirical approach


3.1 Data and Definition of Retirement
We use data collected from different administrative registers including the entire Swedish
population aged between 50 and 69. The registers were matched using the unique personal
identification number (personnummer). Data on earnings by source of income along with
different demographic characteristics are collected from the National tax register. We use the
tax authority definition of spouse as either cohabiting or formally married (samtaxerad). This
allows us to identify and match information on spousal income and demographic

                                                                                             13
characteristics. Information on educational attainments is collected from the National
education register. In Section 3.3 below we provide information about the registers used for
obtaining individual measures of health status.


We use information on income from labor to define the year of labor force exit. In each year,
a worker is defined as employed if labor earnings from employment or self-employment
exceed one basic amount (BA), which corresponds to SEK 45,900 or USD 6,600 in 2010. A
worker is defined as retired if not being employed for two consecutive years. If such periods
occur several times, the last occurrence is used to define retirement. For a worker who is not
observed in the data during the second year after the last year with income from labor or self-
employment, which may occur due to death or the individual moving abroad, we use the last
year with sufficient labor income as year of retirement. The retirement age is the age in the
last year of employment before retirement. An individual who is employed in the last year of
observation has retirement age. We have data of the Swedish population until 2010. Because
of the way we define retirement, we are able to study retirement behavior until year 2008.
About 11.5 million person-year observations are included in the empirical analysis.


3.2 Pathways to retirement
We consider two main pathways to retirement: the social insurance pathway and the old-age
pension pathway. The pathway to retirement is defined on the basis of main income source
during the years after the exit from the labor force and before age 64. For each of these years
we define the pathway from the largest income source. We then assign the pathway with most
years to the individual. The social insurance pathway includes the total income from the
sickness, disability and unemployment insurances. The pension pathway includes the total
income from occupational pension and public pension. A worker that retires at age 65 or later
is assigned to the pension pathway, since eligibility for most social insurance benefits ceases
at age 65.


Figure 9 shows the pathways to retirement for men and women, respectively, during 2001–
2008. The figure includes all individuals who retire between age 50 and 69 during the period.
The figure shows that the importance of the pension pathway has steadily increased for both
men and women over the studied period. Although the pension pathway was less common
among women than men in the beginning of the period, the importance of the pension


                                               14
pathway has increased more rapidly among women. By 2008, the pension pathway accounts
for about 80 percent of all labor force exits in the age group 50–69 among both men and
women.

3.3 The measurement of health
We construct four different variables measuring health. The first one is the number of days
the individual receives inpatient care during the year, i.e., hospital care that requires the
patient to stay overnight at the hospital. This information is available for the years 1986–2010
from the National Swedish Patient Register (see Socialstyrelsen, 2009b). The second variable
consists of the number of days receiving outpatient care during the year. This includes
hospital care that does not require the patient to stay overnight at the hospital. The
information for this variable comes from the National Swedish Patient Register and is
available for the period 2001–2010.9 The third variable consists of the total value of drug
prescriptions to the individual during the year obtained from the National Prescription
Register available for the period 2005–2010. Finally, the fourth variable is subsequent
mortality, which is available from the 1960s in the Cause of Death Register (see
Socialstyrelsen, 2009a).


In a second step, we use these four variables to construct a health index for all individuals
included in our sample. For each year, we create a health index based on the first principal

9
  The coverage of the outpatient care register is not complete during the first years of the period and increases for
each year. However, since we construct a health index for each year separately this is not a concern. The
information contained in the register helps dividing individuals into health quintiles, and the increased coverage
of the register over time may lead to better measures of health during the later years.

component of the available health variables that year. We include the yearly values and two
lags of in-patient care, out-patient care and drug prescriptions, as well as two leads of
mortality.


Figure 10 shows the average health percentile by age for men and women averaged for the
years between 2001 and 2008. Men are on average in a higher health quintile than women,
and health declines with age for both men and women. At older ages, however, the health of
women is very similar to the health of men.

3.4 Option value calculations
We use the option value measure (see Stock and Wise, 1990) for the economic incentive to
remain in the labor force. The option value uses the value function measuring the utility for a
particular individual at a particular age t for retiring at a particular age r as:

      (   )    ∑                        [ ( ) ]        (     )      ∑         [    (   )]              (      )

where ( ) is income from labor at age s, (                        ) is income from the income security system

at age s if retiring at age r, β is the subjective discount rate               , k reflects the marginal utility

of leisure and γ measures the marginal utility of consumption;                              (   ) gives the
probability of being alive at age s given survival until age t. The option value is then defined


                                                             16
as the difference between the utility of retiring at age t+1 compared to the utility of retiring at
the optimal age r*, the age yielding the highest utility value, i.e.,
                                   ( )      (    )      (        ).


We do not estimate the parameters δ, k and γ, but assign values similar to those that have been
obtained in previous studies (see primarily Gruber and Wise, 2004). We have chosen to set
the subjective discount rate (δ) to 3 percent, k to 1.5 and γ to 0.75.


The income from the income security system depends, in addition to the retirement age, on
how the individual leaves the labor force. As mentioned above, we consider two pathways to
retirement: the social insurance pathway and the pension pathway. There is a possible
endogeneity problem related to assigning possible pathway to retirement for each individual
in our sample. If we assign the more generous DI pathway to all, although we know that this
is not an available option for a large share of the sample, it will appear as the individuals in
the sample do not react on the more generous incentives to retire than they actually face and
we will consequently underestimate the effect of economic incentives on retirement. If we
instead assign the DI pathway when we observe that he or she has access to it, we will of
course overestimate the effect of economic incentives.


To handle this endogeneity problem we use a probabilistic approach. This means that we
calculate a weighted sum of the option value measure for the two pathways that we consider,
i.e.,


                                                        (                )     ,


where the OVDI is the option value measure for the DI pathway and OVSS is the option value
for the old-age pension pathway. DIweight captures the likelihood that the DI path is available
to the individual. These are determined based on the “stock estimator”. The weight for the DI
pathway is determined by the share of individuals between age 50 and 64 who have exited
through the social insurance pathway in each year, gender and education group. The pathway
probabilities were thus shown in Figure 4.


In the data, the social insurance pathway includes income from the disability, sickness and
unemployment insurances. The major source, however, is the disability insurance with about

                                                 17
75 percent of the person*year observations including only disability benefits. Those who exit
from the labor market through the unemployment or the sickness insurances switches in most
cases to the disability insurance after some time (see Palme and Svensson, 2004, for a detailed
analysis of different pathways). To simplify, we will only consider the economic incentives in
the disability insurance for the social insurance pathway.


The pension pathway consists of occupational pensions and the public old-age pension
system. In the option value calculations, we consider, in addition to benefits from these two
pension systems, also take housing supplements as well as the special housing allowance for
old-age pensioners, the so called old-age support into account (see the Appendix Section A3).
For both pathways, we calculate the option value net of income taxes.


To make earnings back-casts and forecasts, we use earnings data for the entire population of
Sweden during 1985–2010. Using an earnings equation as a function of age, age squared and
individual fixed effects, we back-cast earnings to age 23 and forecast earnings until age 70.
That is, we assume that a worker starts working and collecting pension rights at age 23. The
option value is expressed in EUR 10,000 (2011).


We do not account for spouse or survivor benefits, but treat all individuals as if they were
singles. Most of the financial incentives in the Swedish systems apply to the individual and
not the household and the differences that do exist between married and singles are relatively
minor.


Figure 11 shows the averages of the three different option value measures by age for men and
women, respectively. The figure reveals some interesting features. First, it can be seen that the
option value for the old-age pension pathway has a much steeper negative slope than the
option value for the DI pathway and the weighted average reflected in the inclusive option
value. This reflects the fact that the economic loss of retiring early is much larger for those
who only have access to the old-age pathway. Second, it can be seen that the inclusive option
value is as expected between the option value measures for the two main pathways, but much
closer to the graph for the old-age pathway. This is because the weights, as reported in
Figures 4a and 4b, are larger for the old-age pension pathway. It should be noted, however,
that these figures are based on a cross-section and thus affected by sample attrition by age.

As a background to the option value figures, Figure 12 shows the average social security
wealth by age and pathway to retirement for men and women, respectively. It can be seen that
the social security wealth for the DI pathway declines with retirement age, since the value of
the DI payments that one gives up by delaying retirement exceeds the expected value of
increases in the size of the benefits from longer work history. However, for the old-age
pension pathway it increases up to age 60, the minimum age for early withdrawal, and then
reaches a horizontal phase. This suggests that, on average, the present value of the benefit
payment one has to give up by remaining in the labor force is equal to the increase in the size
of the future benefits from delaying retirement.

4. Results


4.1 Main estimates
This section presents the results from the reduced form retirement choice models. The
estimates are obtained using probit models and are presented in three main sets. Table 1
shows the overall results for the entire sample. Table 2 describes sample heterogeneity in
response to economic incentives with respect to health status and, finally, Table 3 shows
heterogeneity of the result with respect to differences in educational attainments.


The results for the coefficient of the option value variable should be interpreted as the effect
of a 10,000 euro (measured in 2012 prices) change in the utility difference between retiring at
a given age compared to retiring at the optimal age on the probability of retiring. The effect of
a one standard deviation change in the option value measure is given in square brackets below
the coefficients. In addition, all results are presented in a second version of the tables (1b, 2b
and 3b), where the coefficients are presented as the estimated response to a one percent
change in the utility value of delaying retirement by one year.


Table 1a shows the results from eight different specifications. The first column shows the
results when we alongside the option value measure for retirement incentives and a linear age
variable have included dummy variables for each health quintile, with the first quintile, those
with worse health status, being the excluded category. As expected, there is a negative sign on
the coefficient estimate for the option value measure. Thanks to an exceptionally large sample
size the precision of the estimate is impressively high and the estimate is highly significant.
The magnitude of the estimate suggests that a 10,000 euro increase in the inclusive option
value measure would lead to a 0.12 percentage point reduction in the retirement rate. The
estimates also shows that those in the highest health quintile are on average about 1.6
percentage points less likely to exit the labor force compared to the quintile group with worse
health status.


The second column in Table 1a reports results from a specification where the linear age
variable has been replaced by a more flexible specification with age dummies for each one-
year age group. The results seem to be quite robust to this change. The coefficient estimate
changes from -0.0012 to -0.0020, a change on the fourth decimal. The specification shown in


                                                20
columns three and four corresponds to those in the first and second columns, but we now also
include controls for a number of demographic characteristics. The result for the inclusive
option value measure in the specification in the fourth column does not change much
compared to the one in column two. However, the estimate in the third column is substantially
smaller in absolute value compared to the corresponding one in column one. The estimates for
the demographic variables show for example that women on average retire earlier, since they
have an about 0.5 percentage point higher retirement rate than men. The estimates of the
dummy variables for the different education levels indicate large differences in the timing of
the exit from the labor market between different educational groups: the group with college or
university education has on average an about 1.1 percentage point lower retirement rate
compared to those with compulsory education only.


The models shown in the fifth through the eighth columns of Table 1a correspond to the ones
shown in the first four columns with the difference that the dummy variables for the five
health quintiles are replaced by a linear variable in the health indexed used for constructing
the quintile groups. The estimates of the inclusive option value measure for these alternative
specifications are very similar to the corresponding original ones.


To sum up, the results from the eight specifications shown in Table 1a all give negative and
significant estimates of the inclusive option value measure, i.e., estimates show that economic
incentives matter for the timing of the exit from the labor market. The preferred specification,
which includes the most flexible specification in age and health differences together with
controls for demographic variables shown in the fourth column, suggests that a 10,000 euro
change in the inclusive option value would lead to a 0.15 percent change in the retirement
rate. Since the average retirement rate is 5.19 percent in the age group under study, this
implies that retirement would change by 2.9 percent. Table 1a also shows that a one standard
deviation change in the option value would translate into a 1.34 percent lower retirement rate.
The result in Table 1b for this specification shows that a one percent increase in the option
value would lead to a 3.15 percentage point reduction in the retirement rate.

Table 2a and 2b show the same results as in Table 1a and 1b, but the sample is now divided
by health quintile. For obvious reasons, we now only include the health index linearly as a
control variable. The results reveal that the group with worse health status, the first quintile,
reacts strongest on economic incentives. The coefficient estimates decrease monotonically
across the five groups. However, if one relates the estimates to the average retirement rates in
the groups, it can be seen that the percentage change is very similar in all groups. This is true
also for the results of the response to the percentage change in the option value presented in
Table 2b.


Table 2c and 2d present the results corresponding to results displayed in table 2a and 2b but in
which we instead have estimated a more restrictive model. Here the heterogeneous effects are
estimated by adding an interaction between the option value and the linear health index to the
regression model. In contrast to table 2a and 2b, the marginal effects are decreasing with the
level of health. Although statistically significant, the magnitude of the estimated
heterogeneous effect is small.

Table 3a and 3b show the results when the sample is divided in four groups by educational
attainment. The first group includes individuals that have not obtained any education beyond
the compulsory level; the second group consists of those with vocational education in addition
to compulsory schooling; the third group those who graduated from an academic track in their
secondary education; and, finally, the fourth group are those with college or university
education. The specifications corresponds to the first four ones in Table 1a, i.e., all
specifications includes dummy variable for health quintiles; the specifications in the first and
third columns includes linear controls for age, while those in the second and fourth columns



                                                25
uses age dummies; the specifications in the third and fourth columns include controls for the
demographic characteristics shown in Table 1b.


Although the estimates vary somewhat between the four different specifications it seems that
the low education groups reacts more strongly on economic incentives in their retirement
behavior. This result emerges more clearly if one compares the lowest and the highest
education groups. The coefficient estimates for the inclusive option value measure is
significantly larger in all specifications for the low education group.

4.2 The model fit
To evaluate the model we use the preferred specification, shown in the fourth columns in
Tables 1, 2 and 3. Figure 13 shows the results when this model is used to predict the
retirement rates by age and compare it with the actual retirement pattern. Figure 13a and 13b
compare the hazard rates by age for males and females, respectively, and Figures 13c and 13d
show the corresponding results for the cumulative distribution function.
From these figures it can be seen that the model underestimates retirement in relatively early
ages and overestimates it in later ages for men. The opposite is true for women. Overall,
however, it is apparent that the model gives a very good prediction of the actual outcome.

4.3 Descriptive key results in graphical form
Figure 14 shows the results of Tables 2 and 3 graphically. Figures 14a and 14b show the
predicted retirement hazards by age for the five health quintiles, for males and females,
respectively. It can be seen that the largest difference in retirement behavior is between the
first quintile, those with worse health status, compared to the other four groups. This is true
for both males and females.


Figures 14c and 14d show the differences in predicted retirement hazards between the four
groups with different educational attainments. In general, it can be seen that the differences
between groups with different educational attainments are somewhat larger compared to those
between the quintile groups with different health status.

5. Implications of changes in DI eligibility stringency
A key motivation for the study of how economic incentives affect retirement behavior is that
it has implications for how screening stringency in the disability insurance program affects
labor force participation rates among older workers. If an older worker is denied DI, an
alternative is to claim old-age pension, which is a less generous exit path given actuarial
reductions for early withdrawal. We use our estimated preferred model (Table 1a Column 4)
to simulate the difference in retirement behavior in our sample under the hypothetical policy
regime that all workers were eligible for the DI pathway – regardless of health status –
compared to the regime where no one was eligible, i.e., if only the old-age pension path is
available. The driving force behind the observed differences is purely that the insured
individuals are affected by economic incentives in their decision on when to leave the labor
force.


Figure 15 shows the cumulative retirement hazards for these two policy simulations for males
and females, respectively. As a summary of the effects of the policy simulations, Figure 16
shows the expected remaining number years of work between age 50 and 69 of the two
hypothetical policy regimes compared to the actual state. As expected, the cumulative hazard
function for the policy regime where all workers are eligible to DI are everywhere below the
corresponding regime with no DI. As can be seen in the summary measure in Figure 16, the
simulated difference between the expected lengths of the work life is 0.82 years, or a 5.9
percent prolonging of the work life after age 50, for men and 0.75 years, or 5.6 percent for
women.

The Disability Insurance is not a relevant exit path from the labor force for a quite large share
of the population. This implies that the simulations shown above overestimate the effect
though economic incentives of every relevant policy reform altering the DI screening
stringency and should therefore be interpreted as an “upper bound” for possible effects of
such reforms. However, the problem is that we do not know the size of the group for which
DI is a relevant exit path depending on screening stringency. In addition, the group for whom
it is a relevant exit path differs from those for which it is not on several observable as well as
unobservable characteristics.


The most restrictive definition of the group for which the Disability Insurance is a relevant
exit path is to include only those who we observe use the DI pathway for exit from the labor
force. As an alternative simulation strategy, we therefore repeat the simulations reported
above on the sub-sample of individuals that we observe retiring through the Disability
                                                            30
Insurance path separately. The economic incentives for retirement facing these individuals
may differ from what we observe in the entire sample. These differences may generate
differences in the result of the simulation. However, since we use the same estimated models
as in the simulations reported above, possible heterogeneity parameters reflecting sensitivity
to economic incentives in retirement behavior between the two samples is not taken into
account.


Figure 17 shows the cumulative distribution functions for the subsample of DI recipients
under different regimes of DI acceptance probabilities. The graphs stop at age 63, i.e., at the
age when the individuals consider retiring at age 64, which is the oldest age for DI eligibility.
In addition to the simulation where we shut down the DI option – i.e., zero probability of DI
acceptance – and the simulation where everybody is eligible for DI, we also consider the
cases where one third (1/3) and two thirds (2/3) of the group is eligible for DI. As expected,
the differences between the simulations with zero probability versus 100 percent probabilities,
shown in the two upper panels of Figure 17 are much larger than the simulation of two thirds
versus on third DI probabilities, shown in the two lower panels of Figure 17.


As a summary measure for the simulations, Figure 18 shows the simulated expected
remaining time in the labor force at age 50 under the different policy regimes described
above. Comparing the results shown in Figure 18 with the corresponding ones for the entire
sample shown in Figure 16, it can be seen that the simulated expected duration of the
remaining work life is considerably shorter for those retiring through the DI program. This
reflects the fact that these individuals on average have an inferior health status and lower
educational attainments than the rest of the sample. However, comparing the simulated
differences between the policy regimes in Figure 18 with those in Figure 16 suggest that the
policy response is quite similar in the two samples. This suggests that differences in economic
incentives in retiring through the DI path do not drive the observed differences in retirement
ages.

6. Conclusions
In this paper we first estimate an econometric model for the choice between staying in the
labor market and leaving it for older workers in Sweden. We consider the economic
incentives of two different exit paths from the labor force: the old-age pension path and a
composite path consisting of other income security programs, where the DI program is the
most important. We then simulate the effect if the probability of being admitted DI is changed
from zero to 100 percent. The behavioral response to these changes comes through how the
individuals in the sample respond to economic incentives in their retirement decision.


We find that the option value of retirement has a statistically significant impact on retirement
behavior, i.e., economic incentives generated by income taxes and the income security system
significantly affects the timing of the exit from the labor market. We also find that there are
statistically significant differences between different population groups. The quintile group
with the most inferior health status reacts stronger on economic incentives and the strength of
the reaction seems to decrease monotonically with health. The difference is even larger
between groups with different educational attainments. People with lower education are more
sensitive to economic incentives in their retirement behavior.


The simulation exercises, however, show that the effects of economic incentives, through
changes in the stringency of DI admittance, overall are quite small. Going from 0 to 100
percent DI admittance probability in the male population would increase the expected number
of years in the labor force at age 50 from 13.17 to 13.93 years.


In Jönsson, Palme and Svensson (2012) it was shown that changes in the rules for DI
eligibility in the long run gave very sizeable effects on labor force participation. Also, Figure
2 in Section 2.2 of this paper shows that employment in the age group 60-64 increased from
around 50 in the year 2000 to almost 70 percent in 2012. Our results suggest that such huge
changes could not have been driven by economic incentives alone. Other factors such as
social norms, credit constraints and changes in population health may also have been
important.

Appendix: Sweden’s occupational pensions, income taxes and housing
allowances

A1. Occupational pensions

A1.1. The central government sector
The employees in the central government sector included in our sample are covered by two
different pension agreements. Those born before 1943 are covered by the PA-91 act and the
cohorts born from 1943 are covered by the PA-03 act. PA-03 replaced PA-91 in 2003. The
pension age in both agreements is 65, but pension can be claimed from age 60 under PA-91
and from age 61 under PA-03 with an actuarial reduction in benefits. Pension withdrawal can
also be delayed with an actuarial increase in benefits.


PA-91 includes a defined benefit pension and a supplementary defined contribution pension.
The defined benefit pension in PA-91 is based on the average earnings up to 30 increased
price base amounts during the five years preceding retirement. The pension from age 65 is 10
percent of the pensionable income below 7.5 increased price base amounts, 65 percent of the
pensionable income between 7.5 and 20 increased price base amounts and 32.5 percent of the
pensionable income between 20 and 30 increased price base amounts. For each month of early
withdrawal, benefits on the pensionable income below 7.5 increased price base amounts are
reduced by 2.6 percent and benefits on the pensionable income between 7.5 and 30 price base
amounts are reduced by 0.4 percent. For each month of delayed withdrawal benefits at all
levels are increased by 0.4 percent. The pension below age 65 is 101 percent of the
pensionable income below one increased price base amount, 65 percent of the pensionable
income between one and 20 increased price base amounts and 32.5 percent of the pensionable
income between 20 and 30 increased price base amounts. In addition, benefits below age 65
are reduced by 0.4 percent for each month of early withdrawal. Benefits are also reduced
proportionally if the number of contribution years from age 28 is less than 30.


The contributions for the supplementary defined contribution pension in PA-91 amounted to
1.5 percent of the pensionable income from January 1991 to March 1994 and to 1.7 percent
from April 1995. Pension rights are collected between age 28 and age 65 and are accounted
for also during years with disability benefits and early withdrawal of pension benefits. The



                                               35
defined contribution pension can be withdrawn life-long or as a temporary pension. Pension
rights collected under PA-91 are accounted for also for cohorts born after 1942.


PA-03 consists of two defined contribution pensions and one defined benefits pension. The
first defined contribution pension in PA-03 is the individual pension. The premium amounted
to 2.3 percent of annual income during 2003-2007 and 2.5 percent from 2008 for income up
to 30 income base amounts. Pension rights are collected between age 23 and age 65 and are
accounted for also during years with disability benefits and early withdrawal of pension
benefits. The individual pension can be collected from age 61 and is paid out life-long.


The second defined contribution pension in PA-03 is the supplementary pension. The
premium amounted to 1.9 percent of annual income during 2003 and 2.0 percent since 2004
for income up to 30 income base amounts. Pension rights were collected between age 28 and
65 until 2007 and between age 23 and 65 since 2008. The supplementary pension is paid out
life-long or as a temporary pension.


The defined benefits pension in PA-03 is based on the pensionable income, calculated as the
average income during the five years preceding retirement. In the long run the defined
benefits pension from age 65 will only be provided for individuals with income above 7.5
income base amounts and will amount to 60 percent of the pensionable income between 7.5
and 20 income base amounts and 30 percent of the pensionable income between 20 and 30
income base amounts. Cohorts born between 1943 and 1972 are covered by transitional rules,
however. For the cohorts born between 1943 and 1958, included in this paper, pension
benefits amount to between 6.3 percent for the youngest cohort to 9.5 percent for the oldest
cohort on the income below 7.5 income base amounts, between 62.60 percent for the youngest
cohort and 64.85 percent for the oldest cohort on the pensionable income between 7.5 and 20
income base amounts and between 30.9 percent for the youngest cohort and 32.4 percent for
the oldest cohort on the pensionable income between 20 and 30 income base amounts.
Benefits are reduced proportionally if the number of contribution years from age 28 is less
than 30.


Individuals on disability benefits are also granted supplementary benefits from the state
occupational pension plan from the retirement age up to age 65. The supplementary disability
benefits amounted to 21 percent on income up to 7.5 increased price base amounts, 81 percent

                                              36
on income between 7.5 and 20 increased price base amounts and 40.5 percent on income
between 20 and 30 increased price base amounts between 2001 and 2007. From 2008, the
supplementary disability benefits amount to 15 percent on income up to 7.5 increased price
base amounts, 75 percent on income between 7.5 and 20 increased price base amounts and
37.5 percent on income between 20 and 30 increased price base amounts.

A1.2. White-collar workers in the private sector
Private sector white-collar workers born before 1979 are covered by the ITP2 occupational
pension plan. The scheme consists of a defined benefit pension and a defined contribution
pension. The pension age is 65 but pension can be withdrawn early from age 55 and delayed
until age 70. For each month of early or delayed withdrawal, benefits are adjusted according
to the pension funds actuarially calculated guidelines.


The pensionable income under the defined benefit plan is the annual income up to 30 income
base amounts in the year before retirement. The occupational pension is 10 percent of the
pensionable income below 7.5 income base amounts, 65 percent of the pensionable income
between 7.5 and 20 income base amounts and 32.5 percent of the pensionable income
between 20 and 30 income base amounts. Benefits are reduced proportionally if the number of
contribution years from age 28 is less than 30.


The contributions for the supplementary defined contribution pension in ITP2 amounted to 2
percent of the pensionable income from 1977. Pension rights are collected between age 28
and 65. If the individual retires before age 65 but after age 62, pension rights are accounted
for until age 65 based on the pensionable income at the time of retirement. The supplementary
defined contribution pension is paid out life-long or as a temporary pension.


Individuals on disability benefits are also granted supplementary benefits from the state
occupational pension plan from the retirement age up to age 65. The supplementary disability
benefits amount to 15 percent on income up to 7.5 increased price base amounts, 65 percent
on income between 7.5 and 20 increased price base amounts and 32.5 percent on income
between 20 and 30 increased price base amounts.

A1.3. The municipality sector
Cohorts in the municipality sector born before 1938 are covered by the PA-KL agreement.
The pension points (P) for the defined benefit pension in PA-KL are the average earnings

                                               37
during the best five years of the seven years preceding retirement up to 30 increased price
base amounts divided by the increased price base amount. Gross pension points are calculated
according to the following formula:
-   0.785*P+0.1750 if pension points are between 1 and 2.5 increased price base amounts;
-   0.6*P+0.6375 if pension points are between 2.5 and 3.5 increased price base amounts;
-   0.64*P+0.4975 if pension points are between 3.5 and 7.5 increased price base amounts;
-   0.65*P+0.4225 if pension points are between 7.5 and 20 increased price base amounts;
-   0.325*P+6.9225 if pension points are between 20 and 30 increased price base amounts.
Gross pension points are reduced proportionally if the number of contribution years from age
28 is less than 30. The supplementary occupational pension from PA-KL is the difference
between gross pension points and the pension payments from the public pension system. The
pension age is 65 but benefits can be claimed from age 60 with an actuarial reduction. The
reduction is 0.3 percent per month if claimed at age 64, 0.304 percent per month if claimed at
age 63, 0.339 percent per month if claimed at age 62, 0.379 percent per month if claimed at
age 61 and 0.395 percent per month if claimed at age 60. Benefits are increased by 0.1 percent
for each month of delayed withdrawal up to age 67.


Cohorts in the municipality sector born from 1938 onwards were covered by the PFA98 and
PFA01 agreements until 1 January 2006. These agreements consist of a defined contribution
pension scheme for all workers and a supplementary defined benefit scheme for workers with
earnings above 7.5 income base amounts. Under the defined contribution pension scheme, the
premium amounts to 4.5 percent of annual earnings up to 7.5 income base amounts and 2.1
percent of annual earnings between 7.5 and 30 income base amounts. Pension rights are
collected between age 28 and 65. Pension could be withdrawn early from age 61 and delayed
to age 67.


The supplementary defined benefit scheme in PFA98 and PFA01 was based on the
pensionable income, calculated as the average earnings during the best five years of the seven
years preceding retirement up to 30 increased price base amounts. The supplementary pension
amounts to 62.5 percent on pensionable income between 7.5 and 20 income base amounts and
to 31.25 percent on pensionable income between 20 and 30 income base amounts. Benefits
can be withdrawn early from age 61 and delayed until age 67, with a reduction in benefits of
0.4 percent per month of early withdrawal and an increase in benefits of 0.4 percent per


                                              38
month of delayed withdrawal. Benefits are reduced proportionally if the number of
contribution years from age 28 is less than 30.


Since 1 January 2006 workers in the municipality sector are covered by the agreement KAP-
KL, consisting of a defined contribution pension scheme and a supplementary defined
benefits scheme. The premium for the defined contribution pension is 4 percent of annual
earnings up to 30 income base amounts during 2006 and 2007, 4.25 percent during 2008 and
2009 and 4.5 percent from 2010 onwards. For workers born between 1938 and 1943,
however, the premium is the same as in the PFA agreements, described above.


The pensionable income in the supplementary defined benefits scheme in KAP-KL is again
calculated as the average earnings during the best five years of the seven years preceding
retirement up to 30 increased price base amounts. For cohorts born until 1946, the
supplementary pension is the same as under the PFA agreements, amounting to 62.5 percent
on earnings between 7.5 and 20 income base amounts and to 31.25 percent on pensionable
income between 20 and 30 income base amounts. For successive cohorts benefits are
gradually reduced to a level of 55 percent on earnings between 7.5 and 20 income base
amounts and to 27.5 percent for earnings between 20 and 30 income base amounts, for
cohorts born in 1967 or later. Benefits can be withdrawn early from age 61 and delayed until
age 67, with a reduction in benefits of 0.4 percent per month of early withdrawal and an
increase in benefits of 0.4 percent per month of delayed withdrawal. Benefits are reduced
proportionally if the number of contribution years from age 28 is less than 30.

A1.4. Blue-collar workers in the private sector
Since 1996, blue-collar workers in the private sector are covered by the SAF-LO agreement,
which is a defined contribution scheme. Before then, workers were covered by the STP plan,
which is a defined benefits scheme. Cohorts born after 1968 are fully covered by the SAF-LO
agreement, whereas cohorts born between 1932 and 1968 are subject to special transitional
rules between the two schemes. The premium under the SAF-LO agreement was 2 percent of
annual earnings before year 2000 and is 3.5 percent on annual earnings from 2000 onwards.
Pension rights are collected between age 21 and 65. Pension can be collected from age 55.


The transitional rules for cohorts born between 1932 and 1968 are somewhat complicated and
we have not been able to find any documents explaining these rules. We only had these rules

                                              39
explained to us by an employee at AMF Pension, administering the pension payments. For
these cohorts, the pension wealth in 1996 was determined by the defined benefit pension
under the STP plan based on the average income from all years from age 28 until 1995. This
pension wealth was brought along to the defined contribution STP plan. From 1996,
individuals collected new pension points according to the STP rules. Since the transitional
rules are rather unclear, we simplify our calculations by assuming that pension rights for the
defined contribution plan SAF-LO was collected between ages 21 and 65 with a premium of
2 percent before year 2000 and 3.5 percent from year 2000 onwards.

A2. The income tax system
Individuals pay income taxes on earnings, public pension, sickness-, unemployment- and
disability benefits and occupational pension. This is accounted for in the option value
calculations. Individuals pay municipal income tax on the income, net of a basic deduction. If
income exceeds a certain break point, individuals also pay a state income tax. In 2007, an
earned income tax credit was introduced, which is also accounted for in the calculations.


The basic deduction is based on the total income (I) and is calculated according to the
following formula, expressed in price base amounts:
-   0.423 if I≤0.99
-   0.423+(I-0.99)*0.2 if 0.99<I≤2.72
-   0.77 if 2.72<I≤3.11
-   0.77-(I-3.11)*0.1 if 3.11<I≤7.88
-   0.293 if 7.88<I


The municipality income tax varies across municipalities and may change over time. In this
paper, we do not take the municipality of residence into account but apply the average
municipality income tax rate in each year for all individuals. The state income tax has two
thresholds. Above the first threshold, the state income tax is 20 percent and above the second
threshold, the state income tax is 25 percent. These brackets have changed over time. Table
A1 presents the average municipality income tax and the two thresholds in the state income
tax during the period 2001–2008, which is the period under study.

The earned income tax credit applied to earnings but not to income from public pension or
public transfers such as disability benefits. The tax credit was a function of earned income
(E), the basic deduction (BD) and the municipality income tax rate (T). Furthermore, there
was an age discontinuity in the tax credit schedule. Individuals who had turned 65 at the
beginning of the tax year received a substantially larger tax credit, roughly amounting to twice
the size of the tax credit for individuals below age 65. The formulas for the earned income tax
credit in 2007 and 2008, accounted for in this paper, are presented below.


For individuals below age 65, the earned income tax credit in 2007, expressed in price base
amounts, was:
-   (E-BD)*T if E≤0.79
-   (0.79+(E-0.79)*0.2-BD)*T if 0.79<E≤2.72
-   (1.176-BD)*T if 2.72<E


For individuals below age 65, the earned income tax credit in 2008, expressed in price base
amounts, was:
-   (E-BD)*T if E≤0.91
-   (0.91+(E-0.91)*0.2-BD)*T if 0.91<E≤2.72
-   (1.272+(E-2.72)*0.033-BD)*T if 2.72<E≤7
-   (1.413-BD)*T if 7<E




                                                     41
For individuals above age 65, the earned income tax credit in 2007, expressed in price base
amounts, was:
-   (E-BD)*T if E≤1.59
-   (1.59+(E-1.59)*0.2-BD)*T if 1.59<E≤2.72
-   (1.816-BD)*T if 2.72<E


For individuals above age 65, the earned income tax credit in 2008, expressed in price base
amounts, was:
-   (E-BD)*T if E≤1.79
-   (1.79+(E-1.79)*0.2-BD)*T if 1.79<E≤2.72
-   (1.976+(E-2.72)*0.033-BD)*T if 2.72<E≤7
-   (2.117-BD)*T if 7<E

A3. Means-tested benefits

A3.1. Housing supplement
Individuals collecting public pension benefits or disability benefits can be granted a means-
tested housing supplement if their income is low. The maximum housing supplement is 93
percent of the housing cost up to SEK 5,000 per month for singles, which is SEK 55,800 per
year. For married individuals, the housing supplement is lower. The first step in the
calculation of the housing supplement is to determine the individuals so-called “reduction
income”. It is the sum of public pension benefits, disability benefits and capital income, 80
percent of occupational income, 50 percent of earned income and 15 percent of the wealth
exceeding 100,000 SEK, minus 2.17 price base amounts. The reduction income is based on
gross income, before tax. The housing supplement is then calculated as the maximum housing
supplement minus 62 percent of the reduction income up to 44,500 SEK and 50 percent of the
reduction income exceeding 44,500 SEK.

A3.2. Special housing supplement and old-age support
Individuals with very low income can also be granted special housing supplement or old-age
support. The rules are very similar. The calculation is based on the total net income, including
housing supplement. The special housing supplement or old-age support equals 1.3546 price
base amounts plus the housing cost of maximum 6,200 SEK per month minus net income.
