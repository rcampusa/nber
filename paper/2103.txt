                  The Impact on Investment and Market Value

                                ABSTR


     This paper derives analytical measures of the combined effects of tax

changes and adjustment costs on investment and market value. Unlike earlier

measures, the effective tax rate derived is valid in the presence of adjustment

costs and anticipated tax changes. The derived measure of the impact of tax

changes on market value permits one to estimate the effects of various tax

changes on market value and its components, discounted pure profits and normal

returns to capital, and to decompose changes in the value of capital into

changes in the marginal value of new capital and changes in the relative value

of new and existing capital. These measures are used to evaluate tax changes

similar to those introduced by the recent U.S. tax reform.

1.   Introduction


     It is recognized that changes in tax policy influence investment behavior

and that anticipated tax changes may do so as well. Recent research has

shown, however, that the impact of expected future tax changes may push

current investment in a different direction than would be suggested by the

long—run effects. For example, though a future corporate tax cut would be

expected to increase investment in both the long and short runs, an

anticipated increase in the investment tax credit would be expected to

decrease current investment, as firms delay investment to take advantage of

the credit. Likewise, temporary tax changes may be more or less powerful than

permanent ones in their impact on investment behavior (e.g., Abel, 1982). In

this regard, the structure of taxation is important. For example, a temporary

tax cut's power depends crucially on whether depreciation allowances are

accelerated relative to economic depreciation.

     An important factor influencing the immediate impact of current and

future tax changes is the firm's technology. If it is very difficult for the

firm to adjust its capital stock, then temporary tax incentives may have

little impact on behavior, for example. Thus, the structure of taxation and

the structure of production interact in their effects on investment.

     A second way in which tax changes and adjustment costs interact is

through changes in the value of the firm. Tax policies that encourage

investment will also increase the marginal price of capital for the firm

facing adjustment costs. The change in firm value that results depends not

only on the magnitude of this increase in "marginal q," but also on the tax
                                        —2—



policy's relative treatment of old and new assets and pure profits. Policies

targeted at investment, such as investment tax credits, can have quite

different effects from the rate reductions that apply to income from all

sources.

     This paper derives analytical measures of the combined effects of tax

changes and adjustment costs on investment and market value. The measure of

the impact on investment is analogous to the "effective tax rate" found in

various studies (e.g., Auerbach, 1983; King and Fullerton, 1984). It is based

on the same principle of estimating the impact of taxes on new investment, but

unlike earlier measures it is valid in the presence of adjustment costs and

anticipated tax changes. Using it, one can estimate how a complicated set of

current and future tax provisions affects current incentives. The ability to

measure current as well as long-run incentives is important. In the recent

U.S. tax reform debate, for example, attention was continually focused on the

effective tax rates that would eventually prevail under new law even though

various phase-in provisions were being considered that would have

substantially affected investment behavior in the short run.

     The derived measure of the impact of tax changes on market value permits

one to estimate the effects of various types of tax changes on market value,

as well as the effects of such changes on the different components of market

value, pure profits and normal returns to capital. One of the results

presented below, for example, is a very simple and intuitive condition under

which an increase in the investment tax credit will increase the market value

of the firm's existing capital stock.

    Since the effects of temporary tax changes on investment depend on the
                                     —3—


nature of the production technology, the measure to be derived must be based

on a specific model of production. The model chosen here is the standard one

of a production function with adjustment costs commonly found in the recent

"q" theory literature, and used to analyze the effects of tax reform in a

number of recent papers (Summers, 1981; Abel, 1982; Auerbach and Hines, 1986).

Section 2 presents this model and its solution and derives an analytic

expression for the user cost of capital (and the effective tax rate) faced by

current investment. Section 3 presents results based on this measure, and

Section 4 some simulations of the impact of a tax reform like that recently

introduced in the U.S. Section 5 derives the measure of market value, or

"average q," based on the same model and considers the impact of particular

tax policies on market value and its components. Section 6 offers some

concluding comments.



2.   The Model


     Consider a firm that produces a single output using one factor of

production, capital, which depreciates exponentially. The firm is a

price—taker in both the capital market and the product market, and incurs

adjustment costs with respect to investment. It faces a corporate tax system

that includes depreciation allowances and an investment tax credit. Because

they have little impact on the problems considered here, personal taxes and

the corporate deductibility of interest payments are ignored.

     There is no uncertainty in the model, and the firm's planning is done

under perfect foresight. Therefore, its objective is to maximize the present
                                               —4—


value of future cash flows, discounted at the nominal, after—tax cost of

capital, r, which is assumed constant:


(1)        Vt =   fet)(pr(K)            -
                                            pC(I/K)I           -
                                                                   T5]ds

where



(2)        T5 =   r5[p5F(K    )
                                  - I PCLI/K   )IO(s,s—u)du] —          kpKC(I/K)I

is the tax bill at date s. The terms p5 and p are the price levels for

output and capital goods at date s,            is gross investment at date s, and

K5 is the capital stock. The production function F(.) is assumed to be concave,

while the investment unit cost function, CC'), is convex in its argument, the

rate of investment I/K. The convexity of C(') means that the unit cost of

investment, pKc(I,K), rises with the rate of investment itself. This

introduces the incentive to smooth investment.1

      The tax variables at date s are t, the corporate tax rate, k5, the

investment tax credit, and O(s,s-u), the depreciation allowance per dollar of

date u capital expenditure. Investment and capital are related by:


(3)           =         +
                  oK5

where 6 is the (assumed to be geometric) rate of economic depreciation of

capital.

      With (2) and (3), expression (1) may be rewritten as:


                                                     K

is predetermined at date t. At is the present value of tax savings due to

depreciation of investments made before date t. The term                           in expression (4)

represents the present value of tax savings per dollar of date s investment:

is the    marginal price of capital goods at date t, inclusive of adjustment
costs    (i.e. the increase in the total cost C(I/K)I with respect to I).

        Expression (1) differs from the standard Hall—Jorgenson cost of capital

formulation in two                   respects.       It accounts for changes in the effective capital

goods    price.      g(l—k—f), caused not only by changes in 9, but also by changes in

k and r, and for the fact that the full marginal return to capital includes

       a reduction in current adjustment costs per unit of investment.2

        Two additional simplifying assumptions facilitate further analysis: that
      E p and that the cost function C(.) is quadratic, normalized so that the

marginal price of capital goods defined in (8) equals K when the capital

stock is not growing (k         = 0):

(10)         C(I/K) =    1 -   $5 +       Ii$I/K.

Expressions (7), (11) and (12) yield a system of first—order, nonlinear

differential equations in the capital stock, K, and the relative capital goods

price, g/p, which may be rewritten (suppressing subscripts) as:

        For notational simplicity, let the real interest rate r -                      /p equal p.
and the relative capital goods price g/p equal q. Then (13a) and (lab)

become:

This system does not in general have an analytical solution. It may be

examined graphically using phase diagrams, as in Abel (1982). Such an

approach is very helpful in understanding how the model works and how K and q

will respond to various tax changes. For the present purposes, however, a

sense of magnitudes is also important. To obtain an analytic solution, one

may consider the behavior of the system near a steady state equilibrium, where

the local behavior of K and q can be approximated by the version of (Ida) and

(14b) linearized around the steady state. This approach is common in the

literature on dynamic models. It has been used in a related analysis of the

impact of tax changes by Judd (1985), for example.

        linearizing (ida) and (14b) around the steady state, one obtains (using

the facts that q =         I   and     =     =k=0         in the steady state)

        Using the fact that, in the steady state, (7) becomes:

       The term 6 defined in (16) is the rate of economic depreciation of the

capital stock, in the presence of adjustment costs.3 Expressions (isa) and

(15b') form a first—order linear system in K and q.              It can be represented as

a second-order linear equation in K by substituting q from (15a) and                 from

the derivative of (15a) into (lSb'). Doing so yields (with subscripts):


           k- ç — a(P+o)K       =   —
(17)                                    a(P+o)K*(lla]

where:


          a —
                F'(K*)

and


                (k*+r*)_(k+r)

                                            +


The term a equals the elasticity of F' with respect to K, —a lnF'/d in K,

evaluated at *, This term is important in the translation of capital cost
                                            -9-


changes into capital stock changes and vice versa. The term at represents the

proportional deviation in the cost of capital at time t from its long—run

value due directly to taxation (see (7)). If at > 0, the cost of capital will

be higher in the short run, Qiven the levels of investment and capital (since

the variables x. and         depend on      and Kt).4 Thus, at is the exogenous

component of the cost of capital variation.

       Factorization of (17) yields


(20)        (D_Ai)(D_A2)Kt =


where DXt =     and A1 and A2 are the equation's characteristic roots,

satisfying:


                  —   /24a(p+o)               +
(21)       A1            2           ;A2=         2


As long as the marginal product of capital is positive, then, since a and •

are also positive, A1 <      0 <
                                   A2, and the model has one stable root (A1) and one
unstable root (A2). This is the standard result in such models. Given the

initial value of K and the transversality condition ruling out the explosion

of q, there will be a unique saddlepath equilibrium for the system.

       To incorporate these two boundary conditions, we solve the unstable root

"forward" and the stable root "backward." Let Mt =
                                                           (0-Ai)Kt.   Then (20) may

be written as a first-order equation in P4:


(22)        (D_A2)Mt =


Solving   (22) forward, and then substituting for Mt using its definition,

yields the first-order equation in K:
                                           —10—



(23)           =
                   A1Kt
                          +
                              Je2(5t(K*(1_a5)ds.
Expression (23) could, in turn, be solved for K, using the initial condition

with respect to the capital stock. However, it is more easily interpreted in

its present form.

       Since A1A2 = —a(p+o)      (23) may be rewritten:


(24)           =



where


(25)           =   K*(1   —



and


(26)           =
                   A2JeA2(s_t)asds.

Thus, the firm's investment behavior at time t may be described by a partial

adjustment process, at rate -A1, which closes the gap between the actual capital

stock, Kt. and the "desired" capital stock Kt. This desired capital stock

differs from the long—run capital stock, K*, due to the existence of temporary

tax provisions between date t and the steady state. The presence of

adjustment costs means that A1 is finite and that future as well as current

tax—induced cost of capital effects influence current investment. The

intuition is clear. If, absent adjustment costs, the firm wished to invest a

substantial amount in the near future, the desire to smooth capital

accumulation may lead to increased investment today. The term    is a
                                                 —11—


weighted average of the current and future tax effects, as. with weights

summing to one and declining at rate X2. As $ gets smaller, X2 increases

(see (21)), making future tax effects less important because of a reduced

incentive to smooth investment.
                                                0
        From expression (25), it follows that -(--)           is   the proportional deviation

of the desired capital stock from K* due to short-run tax factors. Given the

definition of a, it follows that 0 represents the proportional increase in the

short-run cost of capital per dollar due to tax changes. That is:


(27)          —yr I     K*
                             =
                                 1 dF'      *)
                                 F'* dK K*(KK    = -a( K_K* ) =

        The current cost of capital effect, fl, combines future tax changes and

adjustment costs in a particularly simple way. One first estimates the date 5

impact of tax changes on the user cost of capital ignoring adjustment costs,
a5, for s >        t,   then weights these with the factors A2e)2(5t) to account for

the presence of adjustment costs. The term                  differs from at in that the former

includes cost of capital effects due to changes in the rate of investment that

make      *   0.    This difference would vanish if • =       0, for then there would be

no change in q due to investment.

        One may also relate the effect on investment to changes in effective tax

rates. Define the effective tax rate, B, to be that tax rate on true

economic income which, if applied without change over time, would yield the

level of investment that actually occurs at a given date. Then, by

definition,


                   =    F'—(p+ô)
 (28)
                         Fl-a


In the long run, the value of 0, 0*,             is   the standard measure of the effective
                                        —12—


tax rate found in the literature (e.g., Auerbach, 1983; King and Fullerton,

1984). The short run value, e., will differ from e because of the term £k.           In
the neighborhood of the steady state, we have (using (28)):

               —   9*                              F'
(29)                       * AF' = Qt(l_o*)    .

                                                   F'-b

       Note that, because it is based on      and not a. this effective tax rate

measure incorporates the impact of adjustment costs on the efficacy of future

tax changes.

       These results apply in general for small changes in the tax system, and Q

and S are quite easily calculated. In addition, one may simplify the

expressions for Q in particular important cases, making possible the further

analysis of the impact of anticipated tax changes in the next section.



3.     The Impact of Tax Reform


       This section considers the impact, Q, on the short—run cost of capital of

anticipated temporary and permanent tax changes.          It focuses on changes in the

corporate tax rate r and in the investment tax credit k, although other

experiments, such as changes in the schedule of depreciation allowances, could

also be examined. An important issue when considering the impact of a change

in -r is the pattern of depreciation allowances that prevails during the tax

reform. The extent to which such allowances are accelerated relative to

economic depreciation is important in determining short-run investment

incentives and changes in market value. To allow for different degrees of

acceleration, assume that the depreciation allowance function D(•) is

invariant with respect to time, and described by:
                                                           —13—


                                       a
(30)        0(a) =            ö'e6

where 6' is the rate of declining balance depreciation permitted for tax

purposes. Thus, the present value of tax savings per dollar of date s

investment is (from (6)):


               r =
(31)                        je_r_5)ruo1e_65)du.

Note that these tax savings are discounted at the nominal interest rate,

r = p +   it (where           it   = a/p),   since depreciation allowances are expressed in

nominal terms and not indexed for inflation. Under a constant tax system (and

hence in the steady state), r =                      rz,   where z =
                                                                       rO'    =         is   the present

value of the depreciation allowances themselves.

       It is now possible to consider the effects of changes in the corporate

tax rate, r, and the investment tax credit, k, on fi and current investment.



A.     Anticipated Tax Rate Change

       Suppose the tax rate is currently (at date t) equal to , and will remain

at i   until   switching permanently to r* at date T >                       t.   This will affect all

three terms on the right-hand side of (19), the expression for a. Solving for

rt from (31) yields:

(32)
               rt
                        = (t(I_e+ôHTt)] + T*ehtOHTt)}z
                        =          — &rz[1_e         bIt)]
where AT =                  - i and    z =
                                             p++b'     Differentiating (32) with respect to t

yields:


(33)                =       Arz(p+n+61)e+1t46T_t),
                                             —1 4-



which has the same sign as At, since depreciation allowances increase in value as

t —    1, for t* > t.

        The last impact on a of the impending change in t is the direct effect on

after-tax cash flows. Combining these three effects yields:


(34)         at = AT{—1       + 1_k*_r*[1 - e          O'T—t)      + (P+1T+â)e_(P+?T+ö)(T_t)]}
                                                                       p+ô

To interpret this expression, it is useful to rewrite it in the following

manner:


                          1        z          1      &rz        —(p+8)(T—t) d
(35)         at =   tnIh_r* +   1_k*_r*J +                  e                   e —(5'+ir—o)(T—t)
                                             p+o

The first term on the right—hand side of (35) is the percent change in the

long—run cost of capital q(p+ö)(1—k-L')/(l—T), holding q fixed, that results

from the change in the tax regime at date T. It is a long—run change in that

it compares the costs of capital under the two systems in the absence of

anticipated tax changes.

        The second term on the right—hand side of (35) accounts for the

additional impact on at due to the anticipated change to the new tax system at

date T.     It is nonzero if and only if 6' + iT           6. That is, an anticipated

change in T affects the no—adjustment—cost user cost (ar) in earlier years if

and only if depreciation allowances do not have the same time pattern as

actual economic appreciation. If depreciation allowances are accelerated

(6' + n > 6), then existing capital will be worth less than the equivalent

amount of new capital due to its already having received a disproportionate

share of its depreciation allowances. This gap in value will depend not only
                                         —15—


on the degree of acceleration, but also on the tax rate at which depreciation

allowances are deducted. An increase in T will widen the gap between new and

old capital values in the presence of accelerated depreciation. One would

expect the prospect of this to discourage current investment further. The

second term in (35) accounts for capital gains or losses that capital goods

purchased at date t will experience when the tax rate changes at date I as a

result in the change in relative value of existing to new capital goods. This

is now demonstrated.

       At any date, arbitrage must fix the -relative values of otherwise

identical old and new capital goods so that they differ to the extent that

they have different tax attributes. Consider a unit of capital purchased at

date t, holding all future capital expenditures constant. This yields an

increase in the level of productive capital at date T of e6(T_t) units,

taking account of additional subsequent capital expenditures made possible by

reduced adjustment costs (see footnote 3). This increased capital purchase at

date t also has depreciation allowances of qr(Tt) remaining, where r(Tt)

is the present value of the allowances per unit of capital expenditure made

(T—t) years earlier. Since a new unit of capital with the same future

quasirents costs q1e6(T_t) and receives investment tax credits and depreciation

allowances equal to q1e_&(T_t}(k÷r), the unit value of the capital bought in

year t, say q(Tt) must satisfy:



(36)        q.T_t)e_O(T_t) + qr(Tt) =    q1(1—kr)e8Tt.

Since r =   rz   and r(T_t) =   1(61HTt),           (36) may be rewritten (holding the

price of new capital goods constant at          =      =
                                                        —16—



(37)            q(Tt)q =         1 - k -       Tz(1_e(OOT_t))
the derivative of which with respect to time at date t is:


                d(g(Tt)/g)           —T
                                     —       d -(6'+ir-O)(T-t)
 38)
                         dt


The change in this value due to the tax change, discounted back to date t at a

rate (p+o) to account not only for the interest rate but also the fact that
           —O(T-t)
only e                   of the capital purchased at date t will be present at date 1,

yields the impact on the date t real capital gain of the change in relative

tax treatment of new and old assets at date 1. This value,

                                                                      I
differs from the second term in (35) by the factor                                ,   which
                                                                 (p+o)(1_k*_r*)
puts the price change into capital user cost units. The term is positive if

o' + n > 0, this discouraging investment it a tax increase is anticipated

because of the expected capital losses that will occur.

       Integrating a to obtain t' according to (26), yields:

As long as the tax increase increases the long—run cost of capital (i.e.,

a(1_k_F) has the same sign as at),           this     expression calls for a higher value of

       and a lower value of current investment, the sooner a tax increase occurs

(and a higher value the sooner a tax cut occurs). The intuition is that,

after T, the desired capital stock will be lower. Given the incentive to

smooth investment, the firm will reduce investment immediately. The sooner

the tax change, the stronger the incentive to smooth investment. The strength

of the smoothing incentive depends on A2. If there were no adjustment costs,

A2 would be infinite (see (21)); the firm would wait until date T to reduce

its capital stock. Similarly, if the production function were very concave, a

and hence A2 would be quite large (see (19) and (21)). Again, little

adjustment would be optimal before date T, in this case because little capital

investment would be required to move the marginal product of capital to its

new optimal level.

        It must be stressed that these particular results depend on the

assumption that 5 =    6'   +   it.   If   & <   6'   +   it, as   is more common in actual tax

systems, depreciation allowances decline more rapidly. This acceleration may

be a legislated one (i.e., 6' >            5), but        may also be attributable in part to

the fact that depreciation allowances on existing assets decline over time due

to inflation. In this case, this second term in (40) reinforces the reduction

in investment associated with a future tax increase. Indeed, the reduction in

investment today may be so great that it exceeds that which would occur under
                                                   —18-


an immediate increase in i       to   T*   (i.e.,    I =    t).   Alternatively, a delayed cut

in r may increase investment more than an immediate one. This possibility was

demonstrated by Abel (1982) for the case of instantaneous tax depreciation

(6' =    ),5   but there is a much weaker and more intuitive necessary condition

for the result to hold.

        Consider the effect on        of an increase in T:


(42)            =
                    h1X2e_X2(T t)([
                                               +
                                                    1_k*r*C1
                                                                  +   (616))]

                    -     z        p+ir+o'
                                                   (ö'+1t+Ô)(e(A2_(P+7t+ô')(I_t)l    }
                        1k*r* x2—(p+it+a') p+

For a delay in a tax increase to reduce current investment, this derivative

must have the same sign as Ar. At T =               t,    the second part of (42) equals zero,
                              dQ
so the condition that sgn(—) =             sgn(br)       is (given the definitions of F and z)


             (p+5)(1_k*_r*)
                  1-r*


The intuition for this result is quite simple. At time t, the new

investment's tax base is negative if its gross marginal product of capital is

less than its depreciation allowance. The left—hand side of (43) is the

long-run cost of capital per dollar under the new tax system, to which the

marginal product will eventually converge, while the right-hand side of (43)

is the instantaneous depreciation allowance per dollar. Although the matter

is complicated by the fact that the actual value of F' won't equal the

left—hand side of (43) immediately (because of adjustment costs), the

intuition is that it the underlying tax base is negative just after

investment, then a delay in a tax cut raises taxes and investment.
                                          —19-


       For I > t, the second term in (42) is nonzero. For accelerated

depreciation (6' + it > 6), it has the opposite sign of hi, making it less
                dr
likely that air- will have the same sign as hr. The intuition is that with

accelerated depreciation the tax base will increase, eventually approaching

the entire marginal product of capital. Thus, if j.t and hi have different

signs at I = 0, their signs remain opposite for I > 0.

       The following result may also be demonstrated.

                                                                             -

Proposition:     Suppose hr > 0 N 0) and          > 0 (c 0) at I = t. If (p46),

IT, and 8* are all nonnegative, and 6' + it > 6, then there exists a finite

value I > t at which         is maximized (minimized).



Proof: There are two cases to consider. If A2 > p + it + 6', it is clear that

the second term in brackets in (42) is negative and becomes arbitrarily large

in absolute value as I increases. This must make the entire term in brackets

negative for all T above some critical value. If A2 < p + it + 6', the second

term again is negative and increases in absolute value with I, but is bounded

by the value it approaches asymptotically at I = .         At I = , the term in

brackets in (42) equals:


(44)        —        +   1_kLr*t1 + (°':)(1 +


which has the same sign as



 45         -   (p÷o)(1_k*_I'*)   +
                                      A2-(p+6)
                     (1Tt)


By assumption, A2 c p + it + 6'. From the definition of A2       (in   (21)), it is
                                                   —20—



easily shown that              >   p. since a and $ are ) 0 and (p÷b) was assumed > o.
Since by assumption 6' + n >               6, expression (45) is bounded above by:


    46 )          —   (p+6)(1_k*_r*)   +   6'
C
                          (1_t*)

A sufficient condition for this to be negative is for the assumed conditions

to hold, that (p+6) ) 0, n                 0, and the effective tax rate 0* is nonnegative

(and hence (1_k*_r*)               (1—r*)). Therefore, expression (46) is negative and so is

the term in brackets in (42). Hence, this term is zero for some finite value

of T, and negative for all higher values.

            This result says that in the presence of accelerated depreciation there

is a finite date of introduction (perhaps the current one) at which the

impact of a tax change on current investment is maximized. For a tax cut,

this date is the date which maximizes current investment. For a tax increase,

it is the date which minimizes current investment.

            To summarize the results of this section, an anticipated tax change

influences current investment in two ways. The first relates to the desire to

smooth the investment path to a new desired long—run capital stock. As the

enactment date, T, becomes more distant, the current impact on investment of

this incentive declines. The effect disappears entirely when there are no

adjustment costs. The second effect, which is present even when there are no

adjustment costs, comes from anticipated capital gains or losses associated

with changes in the relative treatment of new and old capital goods. When

there is an impending tax cut (fri              < 0) and accelerated depreciation (6' +
n    >     6),   a delay of the tax cut may increase current investment if initial

depreciation allowances are sufficiently large. Eventually, however, the

first effect must dominate. (Even if $               = 0,   this is true, since the second
                                                  —21—


effect changes sign once assets have been substantially depreciated.)

       Considered next are the effects of changes in the investment tax credit,

both temporary and permanent.


B.     Anticipated Permanent Chauge in the Investment Tax Credit

       Suppose the investment tax credit changes from                  to k* at date I >   t.
Then, for s >       I,   a = 0      (see (19)). For s c I,

                                                  1_T*


Comparing (47) and (48) to (35) and (41), one observes that this effect of the

credit is equivalent to that of an anticipated tax cut in the presence of

economic depreciation allowances. A future increase in k leads to more

investment today to smooth the accumulation of the larger capital stock

desired after date T. Just as in the case of accelerated depreciation,

however, there is an additional effect associated with a change in the

relative values of new and old capital. When k increases it decreases the

value of existing capital, which does not qualify for the credit, relative to

new capital, which does. This effect, which discourages current investment if

k is expected to increase, is accounted for by the                     term appearing in (19).

       Because of the jump in k at I, k1 is undefined. Its impact on fl is
                                                     —22—


massed at I in a1. However, its effect can be calculated as the limit of the

effects of the Cc terms associated with a change from k to k* over an arbitrarily

short interval around 1. This yields an effect on                    of:




                       eA2(Tt)          Ak
(49)
             p+6


which has the same sign as Ak, discouraging investment if Ak >                 0.   Combining

(48) and (49) yields the total effect of the change in k:



                                          2 -(p+6)
                                         A
50             t
                   =
                         A,..
                       1k*•r*'
                                ,   +                at2uTt
                                             p6

If   A2 >   (p46), fl      exceeds the value it would have for no change in k (i.e.,

for I -,    ). In this case, the expectation of an increase in the investment
tax credit reduces current investment. The capital loss effect in (49)

outweighs the smoothing effect in (48). However, A2 may be less than (p+6).

From the definition of A2 in (21), it follows that A2 c (p+5) if and only if

a C          When the elasticity of quasirents with respect to changes in the

capital stock, a, is low, and adjustment costs, $,                are   high, smoothing can

outweigh the capital loss term. As shown below, this is the same condition

for the value of existing capital goods to increase with an increase in the

investment tax credit. The increase indicates that marginal q increases by

more than the gap between marginal and average q does. Since a capital gain

occurs in such an event, the anticipation of such a gain encourages current

investment.

       Because 6 depends on $,               the condition a c $6 will not be satisfied for

all $ above some critical level. In fact, it will be satisfied for a possibly
                                                       —23—



empty interval of $,             given 0 and a. Since 6 = 6(1—31*6),       a is less than
                                                                                        -   Y'1-2a
$6 =            - 31(,6)2 if and only if a < .5 and $ is in the interval (1
1 + P'1-2a
         a


C.           A Temporary Tax Credit

             In this case, we imagine a shift from k* to k          at   some date V <      T   before

the shift back to k* at 1. The shift at T has the effect on Q, just

estimated, while the effect of the earlier shift is:



                                       X —(p+6)
                            Ak          2
                    —              +              e —X2(T'_t)
(51)
                        1_k*_r*'
                                            p+6

Combining (50) and (51) yields the full impact of the temporary change from V
to 1:




(52)                    =
                                        (p+6)

Since I > U, this has the same sign as —Ak =                    k — k* if and only if
A2
     >       (p+6).     In this case, an anticipated temporary increase in the investment

tax credit from k*               to     raises the current cost of capital. Once again, the

desire to smooth higher investment during the interval (T', 1) is outweighed

by the anticipated capital losses at T' (net of the gains at 1) caused by

changes in the relative value of existing capital. Similarly, if A2 <

an anticipated temporary tax credit increases current investment.

             Using (52), one can estimate the impact of adjustment costs on the
                                                                                 dA2
current impact of an anticipated temporary change in k. Since                               < 0,   the

effect         on       of an increase in A2 is opposite that of an increase in $.
                                                                 —24—


Differentiating (52) with respect to A2, on obtains:


                dat —             —    _______

where AT =       I       -       1'    >   0.    Consider the "normal" case where (p+6) <
                                                                                                 A2, where an
anticipated credit discourages current investment. For a temporary increase

in k (Ak =       k*          —    k <      0),   the expression in (53) is positive if
                     1
(V-fl <             (Otherwise, the two terms in brackets on the right-hand
         A -(p+O)
on the rigt-hand side of (53) are of opposite sign and the overall sign is

ambiguous.) Thus, for a temporary policy that starts sufficiently soon

(T' -.    t),   an increase in $ (which decreases A2) will reduce fl, thereby

lessening the negative impact on current investment. For a more distant

policy, the inability to adjust quickly to changes in incentives when q is

large is opposed by the greater relevance of future tax changes.



4.       Numerical Simulations of Effective Tax Rates


         This section uses the expression derived in the last section to

illustrate the effects, 0, on the cost of capital associated with tax reforms

such as those recently enacted in the U.S., and translate these estimates into

the effective tax rates on current investment with expression (29).

         Performing these experiments requires values for several economic and

technological parameters. The real discount rate is set at 4 percent, as is
                                           —25—


the inflation rate. For the constant elasticity specification F(K) = AKT, the

parameter a =    1 - 1'   (see (18)). Since this production function corresponds to

the Cobb-Douglas function with other factors (such as labor) held constant,

one may view a as the complement of the capital share of gross output. Since

depreciation in the U.S. is typically about 10 percent of GNP, and capital's

share of net income is about one quarter, it is reasonable to set a =          .65.

This value of a guarantees that A2 >      (p+6), so that an anticipated cut in the
investment tax credit stimulates investment. The remaining technological

parameters, a and •, are varied to estimate the impact of tax changes for

different types of asset under different adjustment cost conditions. Values

of a   = .03   and .10 are used to represent structures and equipment, respectively,

and values of $ =     .5 and 20 are considered. The latter value of th is much
more consistent with findings in the empirical literature, though there are

arguments one can make suggesting that such estimates may be biased upward.7

       Consider a change in r and k such as that recently adopted in the U.S.

under the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The reform lowered the statutory corporate

tax rate from .46 to .34 and repealed the investment tax credit, which had

been .10 for equipment only. Thus, r = .46, r* =         .34,   k = .10 and k* = 0

in the base simulations for equipment and k =      k*   = 0   for structures. Tax

depreciation parameters of 6' = .20 for equipment and 6' = .05 for structures

are used to represent the fact that each asset has accelerated depreciation

under both old and new tax systems, relative to the direct measures of

economic depreciation, a.8

       The tax reform was enacted after several years of discussion, during

which it became progressively more likely that the reform would occur. In
                                      —26—


recent years before 1985, important changes in investment incentives were

introduced in 1981, 1982 and 1984. In 1981, as well as in 1986, the reform

eventually introduced was discussed and debated for at least two years. Thus,

it is quite important to consider the potential impact of anticipated tax

changes on current investment.

     To assess the impact of expectations, we consider permanent transitions

to the new tax system enacted immediately and with prior announcements of

one and five years. The simulation results are given in Table 1, which gives

effective tax rates B based on expression (29). For purposes of comparison,

simulations that consider the impact on equipment of the changes in T and k

alone are also presented. Results for each simulation include the values of

6, the true rate of economic depreciation, -A1, the speed of adjustment,

and A2, the discount factor applied to the terms a5 (s>t) in computing

     The impact of the tax changes in the long run is given by the tax rates

under immediate adoption, since there are no anticipated tax changes in these

Dimulations. As has been pointed out by many who analyzed the recent tax

changes, the long—run effective tax rates rise for equipment (when the

investment tax credit is removed) and fall for structures, with both new rates

very close to the statutory tax rate (at least when 6   6). The fact that

0*   r* does not, however, deny the presence of accelerated depreciation. It

simply indicates that the acceleration via 6' is roughly offset in present

value by the lack of inflation indexing. Indeed, the measure of acceleration

that matters in the current context is 6' + it, since this is the rate at which

real depreciation allowances decline. Thus, a delay in the tax cut provision

need not by itself increase the current effective tax rate.
                                      —27—


    When the tax change is delayed, the short-run results are different. For

structures, the present value of depreciation allowances is small, so the

positive effect of investment due to increased value of depreciation

deductions does not outweigh the negative effect of a reduction in the

long-run cost of capital. When $ =   .5,   the value of 0 under a five-year

delay nearly equals its value under the old tax system. The change is heavily

discounted due to the rapid speed of adjustment Ut2 =    .32).   For equipment,

the acceleration of depreciation itself, described in the second set of

simulations, is enough to make a delay in the tax cut increase current

investment and lower the current effective tax rate. This is because the

present value of depreciation allowance, z, is much higher for this more

rapidly depreciating asset. The anticipated removal of the investment tax

credit described in the third set of simulations increases current investment

as firms wish to invest more to take advantage the investment tax credit.

These two effects combined give the announced policy shifts a powerful effect

on current investment.

     As has been pointed out elsewhere (Auerbach and Hines, 1986), it is not

necessary that reductions in the effective tax rate associated with a delay in

tax changes also reduce tax revenues. Indeed, the delayed reduction in r

encourages equipment investment while raising revenue. This is because, while

taxes collected on new investment may be reduced (if 5' exceeds the marginal

product of capital), taxes collected on existing assets will be increased by

keeping the higher tax rate.

     This abilit9 to increase current investment and revenue at the same time

is another way of presenting the fact that windfalls are being given existing
                                      —28—


assets when the tax rate is cut. Such windfalls have been seen as an

important shortcoming of the tax reform, since if revenue is being held

constant the effective tax rate on new investment rises. However, one must

stop short of characterizing as superior or more efficient policies that

increase current investment without decreasing current tax revenue, since

taxing existing capital may well have an impact on expectations about the

shape of future "reforms." Nevertheless, the short—run impact of tax reforms,

as well as their long-run consequences, should be considered in light of the

frequency with which new provisions have been introduced.



5.   Tax Reform and Market Value


     Tax changes affect the value of the firm as well as the incentive to

invest. The close relation of these two effects has already been brought out

in showing how anticipated capital gains and losses are incorporated into

current incentives. It is also possible to calculate how tax reforms affect

the value of the firm as a whole, not just investments undertaken at a

specific date.

     At any given time, the value of the firm will depend not only on the

capital stock but also on the previous path of capital accumulation, since

depreciation allowances do not follow economic depreciation. This section's

analysis i limited to cases in which previous accumulation has been in a

steady state. Thus, the tax reform experiment is one not only near a steady.

state, but where the steady state has been disturbed.

     With a single factor of production, capital, and decreasing returns to
                                       —29-


scale, there are two sources of firm value in the absence of taxes: normal

returns to capital and pure economic profits. As always, it is possible to

reinterpret a decreasing returns technology with one factor as a constant

returns technology with two factors, the second being a fixed factor owned by

the firm that "earns" the economic profits as a factor reward. This is

especially helpful in the current context, for then it is possible to apply the

result of Hayashi (1982), adjusted for taxes by Summers (1981). that the

value of the firm's capital stock per unit equals the marginal cost of new

capital, adjusted for differences in tax attributes. Thus, the firm's value

has two components: this tax-adjusted value of marginal q, multiplied by the

capital stock, plus the discounted value of pure profits. This can be

expressed per unit of capital, yielding a value of average q that includes not

only the tax adjusted value of capital but also the discounted profits per

unit of capital. One can then consider the effects of tax reform on the total

as well as the components, a particularly useful exercise if one wishes to

consider the effects of tax reform on the value of the firm under different

assumptions about whether the firm has any pure profits.

     To begin, consider the value of the firm's capital stock. The marginal

price of new capital goods is, from (12) and the definition of q,

q = 1 +   •k/K.   This capital receives investment credits per unit of kq and

depreciation allowances worth rq, and yield a stream of after-tax quasirents in

the future. Hence, the existing capital stock, K, which has the same future

productivity per unit, must be worth q(1-k-r)K + A, where A is the present

value (in terms of taxes saved) of this capital stock's depreciation

allowance deductions.
                                             —30-


       Since it has been assumed that this capital was accumulated in a steady

state, a constant amount of capital, 6K, was purchased at each prior date, at

an average price of (1—1$6). This average cost is relevant for calculating

the total value of depreciation allowances, since allowances are based on

total capital expenditures. Thus, the value of depreciation allowances on

existing capital at the current date, zero, is:

                   0
(64)        A =   f oK(1_½$5)F(t)dt      = oKJ    r(t)dt


where r(t) is, as before, the present value of depreciation allowances

remaining for an asset of age -t.          If one assumes, as above, that depreciation

allowances are at a constant proportional rate 6' but not indexed, then (54)

may be rewritten:


(55)        A = OKJ e(O +1T)tflft =



It   follows that the average value of the capital stock is:



(56)        qK =   q(1-k-r)   + A/K =   q(1-k-r)   +


To simplify expression (56), note that, in the steady state, K = K*, the

optimal capital stock under the steady state's tax system          Thus, (24) and

(25) may becombined to yield, at t =         0,

(57)        k = (-A1)(K—K*) =


       Using (57) and the definition of q, one may rewrite (56) as:


(58)        qK     (1-k-fl5.) + A1.fll—k-r)Q/a.
                                                         —31—



In     the steady state, k =          k*,   F =      r*Z, and   0 =       0.    Thus, the deviation of

qK from its steady state value at time zero due to an unannounced tax policy

change is:


               K
(59)         Sq = qK      -
                               q
                                   K* =          -              5
                                                                          +
                                          —Ak0       AT0z(1—5,        )




Where Ak0 =
            k0
               —        k*    and Ar0 =              — r*.   This value will reflect both changes

in marginal q (through flu) and changes in the relative valuation of new and

old capital.

        Next, consider the impact of tax reform on the discounted value of pure

profits. By construction, these profits equal the after—tax quasirents in

each year in excess of the capital stock's marginal product, or, normalized by

the current capital stock,



(60)         qP =
                    jif e_Ptu_TtLEKt) — KtFI(Kt}]dt.
For a small change in tax policy around the steady state, the change in qP at

time zero is:



(61)         5qP =                                                    —
                             et_ATt[r(K*)_K*F1(K*)]

where Ar =
               r    —   1*. This          has two components, due to the change in the

taxation of existing profits, and the change in profits. Given (7') and the

definition of a in (18) this may also be written:



(62)         5qP                                                          +
                                                                               afePt(1_rt)(tK*}dt]

        An expression for Kt is obtained by solving the first-order differential
                                               —32—


equation (24), using the initial condition that K0 =            K*:


                             -
(63)        K = eAlt(K*          A1fe'1Kds)

which, iven the definition of K in (25), yields:


            K-K* A t
                =

        From these expressions, a number of points about the effects of changes in

r and k may be made. Each tax change affects the value of the capital stock,

qK, in two ways, represented by the two bracketed terms in (67a). The first

is the change due to the change in marginal q, the second the change in the

relative value of new and existing assets. Any policy that increases marginal

q (a cut in t        or   an increase in k) increases the first term, while with

accelerated depreciation, the credit increase and the tax cut affect the

second term in opposite directions ways. The credit increase causes a capital

loss by increasing the distinction between old and new capital, while the tax

cut narrows the difference associated with differences in prospective

depreciation allowances.

        A second difference between the two policies appears in expression (6Th),

the impact on the present value of pure profits. This is due to the extra

windfall given to the firm by a tax cut as the result of the reduced taxation

of existing profits. Since A2                   p (for F' and hence p + 6 >      0),     policies of

either type that encourage investment also increase profits through an

expansion of output. This profit increase depends on the assumption that the

firm faces fixed output prices.                 In a more general model, with other factors

of production or profits bid down by declining output prices, one might expect

all or part of this increase in profits to be absent.

        The division of changes in the total value of the firm between changes in

the value of capital and changes in the value of profits depends on the
                                        -34-


technology of adjustment. For an investment tax credit, the total change in

the value of the firm is simply      the discounted value of additional

investment credits. With high adjustment costs, A2 -.     p, so this appears
entirely as an increase in     there is little change in output or profits and

the firm simply receives the additional credits as a windfall to capital. At

the other extreme, with no adjustment costs, Aq1 =     -Ak, as the value of
marginal q doesn't change at all. At the critical intermediate value of

A2 = p + 6 (where, as shown above, a =   •6),   the effect on qi( is zero, as the


two effects in (67a) cancel.

     For a tax cut, the situation is more complicated, depending on the extent

to which depreciation allowances are accelerated. Total value increases by

more per unit increase in marginal q than in the case of the investment tax

credit for three reasons: reduced taxation of normal returns to existing

capital, reduced taxation of the component of the tax base associated with

recapture of previous accelerated depreciation, and reduced taxation of

preexisting profits. The first two effects are present in (67a), the last in

(67b). Even with no adjustment costs (A2 =      ), the   value of the capital stock

increases because of the reduced tax on recapture of accelerated depreciation,
           a
by £rz(1 5P÷)

     Since much of the criticism of the recent tax reform has focused on

shifts in the tax burden between new and old capital, it is interesting to

consider the effects on the value of the existing capital stock, qK, of such a

change.

     Table 2 presents calculations of          based on (67a) for the same permanent

tax reform considered in Table 1, the removal of the 10 percent investment tax
                                       -35-


credit for equipment and a cut in the corporate tax rate from .46 to .34. The

calculations use the same economic parameters as before (5    • .1,    5.   = .2   for

equipment, S =   .03, 6' = .05 for structures, and p = it = .04).     For each

case, the change, in qK is broken down into four components: the changes in

marginal q and the gap between marginal and average q caused by the changes in

k and 7.

     As expected, the combined effects coming through marginal q are negative

for equipment and positive for structures, with the effects larger when

adjustment costs are large. This impact of adjustment costs is especially

strong for structures because of the lower rate at which structures

depreciate; existing capital gets the benefit of increased after—tax returns

over a longer period. The "windfall" effects represented by increases in the

value of old relative to new capital are positive for both parts of the

policy, the removal of the tax credit and the reduction in the tax rate. For

equipment, each part of the policy raises the market value of capital, with

the total impact relatively insensitive to the size of adjustment costs. For

structures, the total increase value is substantially higher with higher

adjustment costs.

     Given the differences in modelling approaches (analytical linear

approximation versus exact calculations derived from a numerical simulation

model) and economic assuliptions these results are quite consistent with those

found by Auerbach and Hines (1986).

6.   Conclusion


     This paper has presented an analytical discussion of the impact of tax

reforms on current investment and market value, taking account not only of the

nature of the tax law but also the production and adjustment cost technology.

     Its main contribution has been the derivation of analytical expressions

for the impact of future tax provisions on the value of the firm and the user

cost of capital. These expressions are helpful in understanding the impact of

particular tax changes and the importance of investment smoothing and

announcement effects.

     Many important considerations have been omitted from the analysis. For

example, in recent years, tax losses and other constraints have been an

important phenomenon. The impact of such constraints varies across assets and

can either encourage or discourage investment (Auerbach, 1983, 1986; Auerbach

and Poterba, 1986; Altshuler and Auerbach, 1986). In an environment without

perfect loss offset, the effects of immediate or delayed tax reforms may be

quite different than those portrayed here. In considering assets individually,

one ignores the spillover effects that changes in one type of investment may

have on another through complementarity in the production function and shared

adjustment costs. A multiple capital stock model is too complicated for the

derivation of interpretable analytical expressions, although Auerbach and

Hines (1986) have considered the effects of large anticipated tax changes in a

numerical simulation model with two capital stocks.

     The analysis has emphasized the important relation between investment

incentives and changes in the firm's market value, both present and
                                      —37—


anticipated. For these to be useful in evaluating tax incentives, a better

positive model of the dynamic process of tax reform is needed.

1.   The expression for taxes in (2) treats all capital costs pKC(I/K)I as

part of capital expenditures for tax purposes. This is consistent with the

U.S. tax treatment calling for the addition of indirect costs (such as

installation) to basis. In reality, some of the indirect costs associated

with adding capital, such as retraining of labor, would normally not be

capitalized but simply deducted as an expense.

2.   This latter effect would be absent if adjustment costs depended only on

the level of investment, rather than the ratio of investment to the capital

stock. The ratio specification is typically used in the empirical literature

estimating adjustment costs. An additional reason for using it here is that

it makes analysis of the effects on market value easier. This choice of

specification has some impact on the results concerning investment behavior.

An earlier version of the paper used the level rather than ratio

specification. The differences in results are discussed below.

3.   The total cost to the firm of new   capital   goods is (1—o+igI/K)I =

(1-it$a)&K in the steady state. The steady state value of the firm's capital
stock is constant. Thus, depreciation, which is the reduction in capital

value plus expenditure on new capital goods, is (1-J4iö)6K = 6K.    Another way

of viewing the same result is that an increase in capital expenditure today,

holding future expenditure constant, yields an asset that depreciates at rate

o plus additional capital at each date in the future because of the reduced

unit price of capital induced by the current expenditure. The increase (in

the steady state) is      per unit of capital, compounded at each date,

Calculations are based on parameters used for simulations presented in Table 1.

Analytically, the effects are defined (based on (67a)) by:

        investment credit cut:

             marginal:            Ak(p+ö)/A2
             new-old capital:      hk

        corporate tax cut:

             marginal:
                                        ______ - z)(p+ö)1A2
