1. Introduction

In this paper we provide a simple explanation for the observation documented by Davis

and Haltiwanger [7, 8] that the variance of job destruction is greater than the vmiance of

job creation: job creation is costlier at the margin than job destruction. As Caballero [2]

has argued, asymmetric employment adjustment costs at the establishment level need not

imply asymmetric volatility of aggregate job flows. We construct an equilibrium model in

which (S, s)-type employment policies respond endogenously to aggregate shocks. Contrary

to Caballero [2], we find that macroeconomic asymmetries can dampen the respome of job

creation to an aggregate shock and cause it to be less volatile than job destruction.

    The employment policies we consider me ones for which an =tablishrnent keeps employ-

ment constant if it lim within a range determined by its idiosyncratic level of technology. If

employment is initially above this range it is reduced to the range’s upper boundary, and

if it is below it is increased to the lower boundary. The difference between our results and

Caballero’s [2] lies in how the ‘range of inaction’ responds to aggregate disturbances. If we

assume its boundwies respond equally in percentage terms to aggregate disturbances, then

total job creation and destruction will change by similar amounts.l                    In this case creation

and destruction will be, roughly, equally variable, as in Caballero [2]. However, if we solve

for the optimal response of the boundaries, job creation costs can cause the lower bound-

ary to be less elastic with respect to an aggregate disturbance than the upper boundary.

Because the level to which job destroyers reduce their employment changes by more than

the level to which job creators increase their employment, total job destruction can respond

proportionately by more than creation, leading to the former being more variable than the

latter.

    The asymmetric volatility of aggregate job flows is closely tied to another fact docu-

mented by Davis and Haltiwanger which has received considerable attention in the literature.

Namely, the observation that job reallocation, the sum of job creation and job destruction,

is countercyclical. The algebraic identities linking job growth (job creation less job destruc-

    1Here we are implicitly s.ssuming sticient   variability in idiosyncratic technology and symmetric aggregate
disturbances.




                                                         2
tion) and reallocation to job creation and destruction imply that job reallocation co-vari=

negatively with job growth if and only if job datruction is more volatile than job creation.

Thus our explanation for asymmetric volatility in aggregate job flows can be added to the

list of potential explanations for countercyclical job reallocation.2

    Our analysis builds on Hopenhayn’s [11] industry dynamics model of establishment size.

This is a natural starting point because the job creation and destruction data reflect es-

tablishment growth and contraction.            Anderson and Meyer [1] document large differences

between match creation and destruction and job creation and destruction.                       This suggests

an advantage of our approach to understanding the phenomena documented by Davis and

Haltiwanger relative to other approaches which focus on the job matching process.

    The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we present the indus-

try dynamics model and characterize stationary and dynamic equilibria. In section three we

analwyzeseveral parametric examples of the model to illustrate the impact on aggregate vari-

abl~ of asymmetric employment adjustment costs at the ~tablishment level. We conclude

in the fourth section by relating ow findings to other attempts in the literature to account

for the behavior of aggregate job flow%.



2. The Industry             Dynamics          Model

We extend Hopenhayn’s [11] industry dyntics                model to incorporate linear job creation costs

and uncertainty about labor supply. A key feature of the model that makes it tractable to

analyze is the assumption of unrestricted entry into the industry. As we describe below, this

assumption remov= the probability distribution of =tablishrrtents as a state variable in the

problems of individual agents, drastically lowering the computational complexi~ involved

in solving the model. We begin by describing the model environment. This is followed by

a description of the problem of a representative establishment owner in the industry. After

this we define a competitive equilibrium and chmacterize stationary equilibria and equilibria

with aggregate uncertainty.

    2See for example Cabrdlero fid Hamrnour [4] and Mortensen and Pisaarid= [13] who emphasize the
role of the job matching process in generating this phenomenon. Campbell and Kuttner [6] and Davis and
Haltiwanger [9] interpret counter-cyclical job reallocation as reflecting the itiuence of ‘reallocation shocks.’


                                                       3
2.1. The Model       Environment

The model’s industry consists of a continuum of &tablishments which each produce a single,

non-storable good for sale in a competitive market.             Aggregate demand for the good in

period t, is a given by ~~, where Pt is the market price and T <0 is the elasticity of demand.

Each establishment produces output using labor as its ordy variable input. We assume the

industry is a small portion of the economy so that the wage rate, W’t, is exogenous. It follows

a Markov chain over the grid { W1, Wh} and is the only source of industry-wide, or aggregate,

uncertain y.

    Output of a representative establishment at time t depends on its time t productivity

and labor input, Zt and nt, respectively, and is given by


                                      qt = ztnf,        O<a   <l.


The diminishing returns to labor reflect the presence of a fixed factor which can be tbought

of = a plant. We assume that the shift length is fixed so that nt can be interpreted as

employment. For each establishment, productivityy evolves as follows,


                       lnzt = pzlnzt-l +et,        e,   ~N(o!~;)
                                                              ,       IP.I   <1

    Entry to the industry is unrestricted and potential entrants face a cost of creating         a   new

establishment, K. When a new establishment is born, it draws its initial value of productivityy

fi-om a continuous distribution with p. d.j-. A (.). Establishment owers          face an exit decision

every period.    When making this decision they take into account the scrap due                  of an

establishment, 0< K. The decision to close an establishment is irreversible. Establishment

owners are identical, risk neutral, and discount future profits with a common rate, P.

   The owner of an establishment incurs an adjustment cost if it expands its employment.

Since new establishments begin life with no employees, they must always incur this adjust-

    3Our notational convention is to use upper case to denote aggregate variables, lower case to denote
establishment level variablea and Greek letters to denote parameters.

ment cost. If nt is an establishment’s previous employment, its job creation costs are


                                       T(nt – nt–l)I{nt    > nt–l} ,


where   T   >   0 is the per job creation cost.     The function 1 {.} equals one if its argument

is true and zero otherwise. We interpret these job creation costs m reflecting the costs of

reorgtizing      the tasks performed in a establishment to accommodate a lager work force.


2.2. The Establishment            Owner’s     Problem

At the beginning of a period, the owner of an establishment observes its productivity, z~, and

the output and input pric=, PL and Wt. On the basis of this information, employment at

each establishment is chosen. At the end of the period, owners must decide whether or not

to close their establishments. Let St denote a vector of payoff relevant aggregate variables.

It m-illinclude the cuurent output and input prices, Pt and W~, w well as any other variables

whi& aid in forecasting their future values. Then, the value of a typical establishment at

time t. t! (z~,n~-l, St), satisfies the following Bellman equation,


                v(z,, n,-~, s,)   =   rnn Ptztn~ – Wtnt – T (nt – nt-l) I{nt       > nt_l}

                                      +flm=    {0, E [v (z~+l,n~,S~+l)I z~,St]}.               (1)


In solving its dynamic program, the establishment owner is assumed to know the underlying

law of motion for St. We now discuss the optimal employment and exit policies which

corr-pond       to the solution to the establishment owner’s problem.

   As is well known, it is optimal in the presence of linear adjustment costs to follow an (S, s)-

type policy. To chmacterize the employment policy for the present case, let f+ (z~,nt, St)

denote the right derivative of ~ max {0, E [v (z~+l,n~,St+l) I zt, St]} with respect to nt, and

let j- (z~,nt, s~) denote the left derivative. Then, the necessary conditions for the owner’s

employment decision are


                       aPt ztnt~-1 – Wt –r+~-       (z~,nc, S~) <    0 if nt 2 nt-1            (2)



                                                     5
                        aPtztnt~–1 – W~+ ~+ (Z~,nt,S~) ~        O if nt < nt-l-             (3)


If nt > nt_l, then equation (2) must hold with equality, and if n, < nt-l, then equation (3)

must hold with equality. Define ~ (zt) and fit (zt) as the values of nt which satisfy equations

(2) and (3), respectively, with equality, for each possible value of zt. The dependence of th=e

functions on t is our notational shorthand for the fact that they depend on the aggregate

state St. The optimal employment policy now cm be written as




                                                                                            (4)




Below we refer to ~t (zt) as the date t job cmtion schedule since it indicates the employment

levels of job creating establishments.    Similmly, we refer to fit (z, ) = the job datwction

schedule.

   Just as in Hopenhayn [11], a threshold rtie characterizes the owner-s etit decision. This

is explained as follows. Notice first that the unique solution to (1) must be incr-ing       in

zt, which implies that E [v (zt+l, nt, St+l) I zt, St] is increasing in z~. Thus there exists a

threshold value, zt (nt),


                     Zt (nt) = sup{zlE [v (zt+l, nt, St+l) Izt = z, St] s 8},               (5)


such that all =tablisbents    with employment equal to nt and z~ s zt (nt) will exit, and all

others will remain. The exit threshold in general depends on the aggregate state which we

again summarize with the subscript t.


2.3. Competitive     Equilibrium

In order to define a competitive equilibrium it remains to d~cribe entry, aggregate quan-

tities and the transition rule for the distribution of establishments across productivity and

employment levels. Comider entry first. Because entry is unrestricted, the expected value




                                                6
of an entering establishment must be less than or equal to its cost, K, for all St. That is,


                                /~(zt)o)st)A(zt)             dzt<KVs,.                                           (6)


If any entry occurs during period t, then (6) must hold with equality. We use Bt to denote

the mass of new entrmts, or births, at time t.

     Total industry labor input and output, N~ and Qt, respectively, are defined as follows,


                                Nt =
                                             1/
                                                      ntGt   (zt,~t)   ~zt~~t
                                                                           ,                                     (7)

                                ~t       =   //       qtGt (zt, nt) dztdnt.                                      (8)


Here G~(., -) summarizes the measure of mtablishments across all possible pairs of produc-

tivity and employment levels at time t.

     The employment policy, (4), endows Gt with certain properties. First, it implies that

Gt (z~.n~) = 0 if nt < nt (zt) or if nt > Et (zt).               Second, it implies         a   positive fraction of
=tablishments will be on the schedties defined by ~ (zt) and Et (zt). Therefore, Gt (z~,nt)

m    be written in terms of three functions, Gt (zt), ~t            (zt)   and    G~ (zt,   nt),



                                         ~   (Zt) ,          if nt = D (zt) ,

                    G, (zt, nt) =        G? (zt, nt) , if ~ (~) < nt < ~t (zt) ,                                 (9)

                                         Ct (z,) ,           if nt = fit (zt) .
                                     [


The owner’s employment, entry, and exit decisions determine the transition rule for Gt. The

presentation of this truition   rule is straightforward but tedious, and so is left to appendix

A.

     In a competitive equilibrium, all potential entrants are either indfierent to entering or

strictly prefer to stay out of the industry, all of the industry’s estabolishmentowners choose

employment and m~e        exit decisiom to mtimize                 the present discounted value of their

expected profits, and both the product and labor markets clear. The following definition

summmizes this more formally.

   8. G; (zt, n~) is defined recumively as in appendti .4.


   Hopenha~      [11] shows that a competitive equilibrium exists and is tique        in a similar

industry dynamics model without aggregate uncertainty. Before proceeding to the charac-

terization of the competitive equilibrium with aggregate uncertainty, it is helpful to fist

study the model’s steady state, an equilibrium in which all prices and aggregate quantities

are constant.


2.4. The Steady     State

Consider a version of the above model in which the wage rate equals some constant, W*. A

stationa~ equilibrium for this model is a competitive equilibrium in which all other aggregate

prices and qumtities are also constant. We can compute the stationary equilibrium as follows.

First consider the solution to (1) given the constant wage md some constant output price, P.

Since v (zt, nt-l, St) is continuous and strictly increasing in P, u (P) = J w(z,, O,St) A (zt) dz,

is also. Because u (0) = O and limp+~ u (P) = m, there must exist a unique P* such that


                                                 8
u (P”) = K, This is the unique stationary equilibrium output price. From the associated

solution to (1) the stationary equilibrium employment and exit policies, n* (zt, nt– 1) and

x* (n~), can be derived.

   Given the owner’s stationary equilibrium policies and a value for entry, B, we can find

a fixed point of the transition equation for the measure of mtablishments over productivity

and employment. Denote this G (zt, nt). It is straightforward to show that G (zt, nt) is linear

in B, which, via (8), implies output is linear in B also. The equilibrium volume of entry, B*,

is easily found by solving for the value of B which equates industry supply with the quantity

demanded at the previously mrived at output price, P*T. With B* in hand, G* (zt, n~), Q*,

and N* can be computed.

   Notice that because G (zt, n~) is a linear function of entry, B* only determines the in-

dustry’s scale. It does not i~uence       the probability distribution of establishments across

productivity and employment levels. In the stationary equilibrium analysis of Hopenhayn

[11], this distribution is the primary object of interest. Because the establishment owner is a

price taker, the demand elasticity ~ does not effect the solution of her dynamic programming

problem in a stationary equilibrium. Therefore, ~ only tiects the industry’s scale also.


2.5. Equilibrium    with Aggregate        Uncertainty

We can construct an equilibrium of the model with a stochastic wage rate in much the

same way as for a stationmy equilibrium. The key once again is the free entry condition,

(6). If the volume of entry is always positive, then the free entry condition must always be

satisfied with equality. In this cme, the equilibrium price sequence is uniquely determined

by the stochmtic process for the wage, the owner’s dynamic programming problem, and the

free entry condition.   This simplifies the analysis considerably because it implies it is not

necessary to include Gt as an argument in the ~tablishment owner’s policy functions.4 We

now d~cribe how to solve the model with aggregate uncertainty in more detail.

   Suppose that Bt is always strictly positive in equilibrium and that the output price is a

function of the current wage only. Because the wage takw on one of two values, so must the

  Acab~lero ~d H~O~        [3]~ a si~lu   arg~ent       to solve   their model of job   creationandd~truction.



                                                    9
price. Let PI and Ph be the output prices when the wage equals WI and W~, respectively.

l~en   the output price follows this stochastic process, the solution to the owner’s dynamic

programming problem can be written as the pair of functions V1(zt, n~.l ) and v~ (zt, nt-l ).

These are the solutions to (1) when the wage is W~ and W~, respectively. Given these

functiom, one can compute the value of entry in the two states as a function of the prices:


         u’ (P’,Ph)=     /v’(zt,O)A(zt)dzt
                                      andu~(~’,~’)             = /v~(zt,O)~(zt)dzt.


Unrestricted entry drives profits to zero so we can use (6) holding with equality to find

candidate equilibrium prices. That is, candidates for equilibrium prices solve the following

system of two non-linear equations in two unknowns,


                                    u’ (P*,P’*)     =    K.,



                                    u’   (P”,P’”)
                                               =         K.




   Given three prices it is possible to compute quantities sequenti~y       for any given real-

ization of the process { W’t} and an initial condition for the industry. Go (~, M).     To see

this, suppose that in the first period. IV1 = W1, so that the candidate equilibrium price for

the first perod is PI = P 1. Since the transition rule for Gt, in the appendix, implies that

G1 (zl, nl) is m increasing function of entry, (8) implies that the total quantity produced

by the industry’s establishments at PI also is an increasing function of entry. Write this

relationship m Q1 (B). In the competitive equilibrium, the volume of entry must be exactly

that which clews the market for the industry’s good. So a candidate for equilibrium entry

in the first period, B1, solves

                                         Q, (Bl) = P:.

With B1 in hand, one can compute GI (zl, nl ) and any aggregate variable of interest. The

analogous procedure applies to future quantities.

   The candidate equilibrium for a given sequence of wagw will be a genuine equilibrium

as long as entry is strictly positive in every period. So, for example, if Q1 (0) > P: then

the constructive procedure fails. However, if the model has a stationary equilibrium with


                                              10
B* >0    and the support of Wt is narrow enough, the assumption that B~ is always strictly

positive should be satisfied. In appendix B we study a version of the model with aggregate

uncertainty but without job creation costs in which strictly positive entry is guaranteed to

hold. Using homotopy ideas we can expect versions of our model with positive job creation

costs to involve strictly positive entry as well. Indeed, in the simulations conducted for the

analysis in the next section entry is always strictly positive.



3. Job Creation          Costs and Aggregate                    Employment      Fluctuations

In this section we investigate the implications of job creation costs in our model. When job

creation costs are positive then we find that job d~truction may be more volatile than job

creation. To build intuition for this finding, it is useful to consider a version of our model

where ~ = O. In such a model, establishments’ employment decisions are entirely static

and analytical expressions for the job destruction and creation schedules, fit (zt) and Dt (zt),

respectively, can be derived:


                      ~~ ()(z~) =
                                    Wt+r
                                     aPtzt
                                               A
                                                      md n~(zt) =
                                                                    ()
                                                                     —
                                                                      Wt
                                                                     aP~zt
                                                                           A
                                                                           a—l

                                                                               “

Now consider how these schedules respond to exogenous changes in the wage rate. The

relevant elasticities are,


                ~ln(~, (z,)) =       1     ~    W,         ~d    ~~(fit (zt)) _—
                                                                              _   1
                   alnw,            a—l        Wt+r                alnwt        a–l”


Clearly, as long as job creation costs are positive, the job destruction schedde is more elastic

with r~pect to the wage than the job creation schedule. In response to a wage disturbance

the level to which job destroyers reduce their employment will vary by more than the level

to which job creators increase their employment. Other things equal, the larger the creation

cost, the greater the discrepancy between how much total job creation changes relative to

total job destruction. If dynamic considerations do not overcome these purely static effects,

then the foregoing suggests that we have some hope of accounting for the excess volatility

of job destruction with our model.


                                                      11
    The arguments in Caballero [2] should caution us in drawing conclusions about aggregate

variables from underlying rnicroeconomic behavior. As he has forcefully tigued, the evolu-

tion of the underlying distribution of establishments can have significant effects on aggregate

variables and lead them to behave very differently than establishment level variables. This

makes it crucial for us to simulate the model to derive its implications for aggregate employ-

ment fluctuations. In the rest of this section we describe the results of doing this for several

different parameterizations.      We begin by describing the main parameter selections which

underlie our simulations. This is followed by a brief discussion of the implied steady state

of the model which is designed to shed light on the empirical plausibility of our parameter

selections. Finally, we discuss the simdation results.5


3.1. Parameter       Values

The examples we consider share the same stationary equilibrium. In table 1 we list the

parameters which underlie this equilibrium. For the most part these parameters were chosen

so that statistics derived fro[n the implied station~         equilibrium resemble selected statistics

reported by Davis and Haltiwanger [8] for the US manufacturing sector. Specifically, we

attempt to match the average rate of job destruction as well as the average employment

weighted entry and exit rat~. ~ We use the variance of the innovation to technology, a=,

the scrap value, 19,and the support of the distribution for new entrants’ productivity to

accomplish this. We follow Hopenhayn and Rogerson [12] in specifying the distribution of

new entrants’ productivity, A(.).         It is assumed to be uniform with support that ranges

    5Detaila on the solution and simldation procedure are available horn the authors if requested. The
broad outlinm of our procedme are as follows. We proceed in two steps. In the 6rst step we solve for the
equilibrium prices and in the semnd step we simulate using an appraximation to the trmition        equation
for G. To arrive at the equilibrium prim we have to solve the owner’s Bellman equation. We do this by
approximating the value function with a polynomial and then finding a fied point in the pmmeters          of
the approximating polynomial. The solution to the Bellmm equation impli~ employment and exit policiw,
which, as is described in appendix A, determine the transition equation for G. We employ the method
dwcribed in CarnpbeU [5] b approximate the transition equation. Given an initial G, an approximate rule
for updating G, and a sequence of pseud~random wagea, a sequence of G’s can be generated. Using the
constructive procedwe d=ribed      in section 2.5 an entry sequenm can also be generated. Quantiti~ of
interwt can then be mmputed directly from their detitiona.
    GBecause the calculation of the stationary equilibrium is computationally intensive, a more formal pro
cedure for pmameter selection in which stationary equilibrium quantitiw are precisely matched with their
empirical munterparts is currently infeasible.

horn three standard deviations less than the mean of the unconditional distribution to some

upper bound.              By varying the upper bound we are able to improve our match with the

stationary equilibrium statistics of interest. The support we use throughout the analysis is

[-3~z/J=)ln(l.4)].

     Other parameters in table 1 are chosen on a ptiori grounds. The cost of entry, K, is just

a normalization so it has no consequence for the analysis. Labor’s share in the production

function, a, is chosen to be consistent with other quantitative studies. We assume that

the period length in the model is a quarter and that establishment owners discount future

profits at an annualized rate of 5 per cent.              This determin= the discount rate, ~.     The

autocorrelation of technology for ~tablishments,                p=, is chosen to be consistent with the

observation that there is substantial employment persistence in the manufacturing data. Of

ptiictiar            interest is the job creation cost, r. Since we normalize the steady state wage to

unity, our selection of 0.5 for this parameter is equivalent to one half the quarterly wage

in steady state. This does not seem exceptionally large to us. Finally, we use a demand

elasticity of 1/4.          The selection of this parameter is governed by the need to ensure that

along a given simulation entry always is strictly positive.




3.2. Properties             of the Stationary   Equilibrium

In the stationary equilibrium, the establishments’ employment policies can be summarized

by the job creation and destruction schedules, ~ (zt) and ii. (zt), and the exit policy X. (nt).

                Figure 1: Establishment Policies – ~ (zt), fio (z~), and Z. (nt).


Figure 1 plots th-        using the p~ameter value in table 1. As this figure indicates, just

as in the model utithout job creation ctis,                        establishments’ employment policies are nearly

log-linear in z,. .%clear exception to this is a discontinuity where each of the employment

schedules cross the tit    schedule. The exit schedule itself is nearly vertical, so establishments

exit decisions vary little with their current employment.

   The employment and exit polici~ determine the stationq                                                           equilibrium distribution of

establishments acrm        employment and productivity levels. The components of this dis-

tribution me plotted in figures 2 and 3. The panels of figure 2 graph the distribution of

=tablishments along the destruction and creation schedules. These are Go (zt) and ~                                                        (z~)

normalized by the total mass of establishments, respectively. Figure 3 plots cross-sectiom of

Gm (zt, nt) normalized by the total mass of establishments, the distribution in the region of

inaction. Specifically, each curve in this figure indicates, for a given log employment level,

the density in the region of inaction as a function of the log of technology.

   The fist point to note from the figures is that job creating establishments tend to be

more productive than job d~troying ones. The peak of ~                                                 (z~) is at a log technology level of

about 0.35, while the peak of Go (zit) is at about –0.2. Second, there is considerable mms

within the region of inwtion is discontinuous, reflecting the discontinuities in the creation and

destruction schedules. Finally, the establishments that lie between the intervention schedules

do not appear to be bunched up nem one schedtie or the other consistently throughout the

of the productivi~   distribution, the densi~ does not exhibit substantial asymmetry in the

placement of mass near one employment policy relative to the other.

destruction rates equal each other. The fact that they Mer somewhat in table 2 reflects

slight errors in our method of approximating the transition equation. Notice that the job

   Although the model’s implied statistics do not exactly match the statistics from the US

manufacturing sector, they seem reasonably close. This gives us some confidence that the

simulations we present in the next section have empirical relevance.


3.3. Employment        Fluctuations

The examples we describe in this subsection are differentiated by assumptions regarding the

forcing process for the wage rate and assumptions regarding the specification of creation

costs. Consider the wage proc~             fist.   The law of motion for the wage is chosen so that

the log of the wage resembles a first order autoregression with an unconditional standmd

deviation of 1%. In particular, the transition matrix, H, is specified as




where lpW[ <1 is the autocorrelation coefficient, and the two wage levels are given by


                             Wh =    exp    (0.01) and WL = exp (–0,01).


We explore the implications of aut~comelated wages, pW= 0.9, and i.i. d. wages, pW= O.

   Now consider the assumptions regmding job creation costs. In section 2 these costs were

=Urned to be invariant to the current wage.8 If job creation activity is labor intensive,

then this may be a poor assumption since it would suggest that creation costs should be

closely tied to the wage. This invariance plays a crucial role in the development of our

intuition, so it is sensible to explore how it itiuences our results. To do so, in addition to

the case of comtant creation costs we explore versions of our model in which creation costs

are proportional to the current wage. In these cas= creation costs are assumed to be equal

   7The employment weighted entry and exit ratw are the employment gains at entering =tablishments and
the employment losses at exiting establishments, divided by total manufacturing employment.
   ‘It may be helpful at this point h think of the output price, the wage, and the job crwtion mst as being
measured relative to the cost of creating an establishment, ~.

                   Figure4: Chang=in                                  Job Creation and D~truction Schedules


to ~Wt in each period t.

   Before studying the simulation r~dts                                          it is helpful to cofim                             that adding job creation

costs to the establishments’ technology dampens the employment r~ponses of job creating

establishments to chang~ in W~. Figure 4 plots the differences between the job creation

and destruction schedul~ in the two states. The solid lin~ of each panel plot the log of

the destruction schedule in the low wage state minus the log of the destruction schedule in

the high wage state and the dashed lines plot the dtierence between the creation schedules

in the two states. The top panel pertains to the examples in which job creation costs are

constant, md the bottom panel pertains to the examples where job creation costs are a

constant fraction of the current wage.

   Consistent with our intuition, when the job creation cost is constant the job destruction

schedule is considerably more volatile than the job creation schedde. Regardless of the degree

of serial correlation in the wage, the job destruction schedule changes about 2.570 more than

                                                                                          18
the job creation schedule when the wage changes. Notice that an establishment’s response

to a change in the wage depends on its current productivity. For those establishments falling

below the exit threshold, their employment decisions are static. That is, their employment

decisions are those from the model with @ = O. For those establishments above the exit

thr~hold, dynamic considerations become important. These considerations appear to raise

and then lower their responses to a change in the wage as their productivity increases.

Finally, serial correlation in the wage appears to amplify the responses for establishments

above the exit threshold but has little effect on those establishment about to exit.9

    In the lower panel of figure 4 we see that the job creation and destruction schedules

respond by roughly equal amounts to a wage change, regardless of the degree of serial cor-

relation in the wage. The dynamic effects on the shapes of the schedules evident in the top

panel are evident here also and these dynamic effects appear to be strong relative to the

purely static effect emphasized in the development of our intuition. As in the constant cost

case, adding wage persistence appears to amplify the response of the schedul= for higher

productivity establishments.

    We conclude from analyzing figure 4 that the model’s behavior depends in import ant ways

on the specification for job creation costs. In the US economy, job creation probably requir~

some labor input. Thus creation costs will likely vary with the wage. On the other hand,

the cost’s elasticity with respect to the wage will be less than one if job creation requires

some other input whose price has little correlation with the              wage.    If we want to think of

the wage in the current model as governing production workers and job creation costs being

associated with the effort of management employees, then to the extent that management

remuneration is uncorrelated with the wages of production workers it may make sense to

assume that creation costs do not vary on~for-one with wages. An empirically reasonable

specification for job crest ion costs probably lies somewhere between the two extremes of zero

and unit elasticity we consider here.

    We now examine whether the dflerential volatility in the job creation and destruction

schedules gives rise to differential volatility in job creation and destruction rates. In addition,

    ‘The fact that wage autocorrelation influenca the response of =tabkhments         below the exit threshold
reflects the difference in the equilibrium response of the price level xross the two cases.

we extine     several other employment flow statistics to evaluate the overall performance of

our model. Table 3 reports measures of volatility and co-movement for rates of job creation,

job destruction, job growth, and job reallocation as defined by Davis and Haltiwmger [8],

for each of the four specficatiom          we consider. 10 The first panel of the table indicates

overall employment volatility, as memured by the stmdard deviation of creation, as well

as the relative volatility of the remaining variables, M measured by the indicated miable’s

standmd deviation divided by the standard deviation of creation. The second panel indicates

correlation coefficients for all possible pa,irwise combinations of the variablm of interwt.

    Consider the top panel. Notice first that the constant creation cost examplw replicate

the empirical observation that job destruction is more variable than job creation. This is

   10The statistics reported in table 3 are based on simulating the model for 1100 periods, beginning from the
steady state distribution of establishments. We discarded the fist 100 observations and used the remaining
observations in our calculations.



                                                       20
in keeping with the intuition developed above.        The failure of the variable creation cost

examples along this dimension reflects our previous observation that the job creation and

destruction schedules in these cases respond by proportionally similar amounts when the

wage changes.

    The other statistics in this panel suggest that the constant creation cost version of the

model has other desirable properties. In particular, regardl~      of the degree of serial correla-

tion in the wage, this version of the model is able to account for the relative volatilities of the

employment flow variables. Increasing the degree of serial correlation seems to improve the

empirical performance in terms of the magnitudes of the relative volatility statistics. The

variable cost examplw are less successful in terms of accounting for relative volatilities. Fi-

nally, the main drawback of all these examples is that they imply too little overall volatility.

Reducing serial correlation in the wage appears to improve the performance of the model

along this dimension regardless of whether creation costs are variable or not.

    Now consider the lower panel of correlations. The performance of che constant creation

costs, p = 0.9 version of the model is seen to be quite strong here ~~ well. The signs of

the six correlations are correct and the magnitudes do not appear to k \WWfar off their

empirical values either. It seems reasonable to conclude that the overall performance of

this version of the model is good – the addition of job creation costs has the potential of

accounting for more than just the fact that job destruction is more volatile than job creation.

Reducing serial correlation in the wage in the constant cost case hmms the model’s c~

movement implications. In particular, when p = O the model predicts counteract ually that

job creation is negatively correlated with job reallocation. Finally, the specifications with

variable creation costs perform poorly in terms of c~movement, just as they do with respect

to relative volatilities.

   At this point we should caution the reader by noting that the statistics in table 3 do

not reflect entirely independent featurm of the data. We have already pointed out (in the

introduction) that the relative volatility of destruction versus creation determines the sign

of the correlation between job growth and reallocation.         The algebraic identities linking
creation and destruction with growth and reallocation imply other connections between the




                                                21
statistics. 11 However, we do not believe this fact diminishes the overall impression that the

constant creation cost, p = 0.9 version of the model does remmkably well at accounting for

the evidence on employment flows.



4. Discussion


The simulations dwcribed in the previous section confirm that the presence of asymmetric

employment adjustment costs at the establishment level can lead to asymmetric in aggregate

gross job flows. Of course, the presence of such costs is not the only available explanation

for this phenomenon.        In this section we conclude by describing how our work relates to

other attempts to account for the evidence on job creation and destruction.                      Recall horn

the introduction that the observation of countercyclical job reallocation is equivalent to the

observation that job destruction is more volatile than job creation. The discussion below

considers papers which share our focus on the variability of job creation and destruction.

    To begin with. consider Caballero [2]. He observed that asymmetric emplopent                       adjust-

ment costs at the establishment level need not imply aggregate asymmetries. His explanation

for the aggregate asymmetries relies on wsuming that aggregate shocks are asymmetrically

distributed. Since we consider only symmetrically distributed aggregate shocks, we atab-

Iish that the aggregate asymmetries in employment flows may have nothing to do with the

pattern of aggregate shocks and may be purely reflective of features of the microeconomy.

    Another explanation of aggregate employment asymmetries is provided by Caballero and

Harnrnour [3]. They construct a partial equilibrium model where jobs embody technological

progr~.      The key assumption          in their model are that the costs of creating a job are

increasing in the a~egate         volume of job creation, while the costs of destroying a job are

invariant to the aggregate volume of job destruction. Not surprisingly these assumptions

lead to a decrease in the relative volatility of aggregate job creation. Our analysis Mers in

that we assume asymmetric employment adjustment costs at the establishment level rather

than at the aggregate level.

   11Simple calcdations reveal the following connections. If creation and destruction are negatively correlated
then (i) growth and crmtion are positively correlated, (ii) growth and destruction are negatively correlated,
(iii) reallocation is less variable than growth, and (iv) growth is more variable than destruction.


                                                      22
   Finally, Foote [10] studies an (S, s) model in which the trend growth rate in industry

employment determin= the volatility of job creation relative to that of job destruction. In

his model, industry decline leads to the bunching of establishments neu their job destruction

points so that aggregate disturbances have a disproportionate impact on job destruction. An

-sential assumption in his analysis is that the decline in industry employment is carried out

by lowering average establishment size while leaving the number of establishments constant.

Our analysis clmifies when this is, and is not, a reasonable assumption. In our framework,

if the source of industry decline is a reduction in demand, it will be wcommodated by a fall

in entry, not a decrease in average estabolishmentsize. However, average estabolishmentsize

will decline if the source of the trend is an increase in the wage rate.

A. The Transition           Rule

In this appendix we present the transition rule for Gt. TO do so we m“akeuse of several
definitions. First, define two critical productivity levels, z; and z;,

                             z: = Zt (M (z;))         and Z; = Z~(fit (z;))”

Second, define n; and n; as




The functions gt (zt) and ~t (z~) intersect the exit threshold Zt (nt) at the points (z;,n;) and
(z:,~), respectively. Third, define & (n,) and fit (n,) to be the inverse functions of ~ (z,)
and fit (zt), respectively. Finally, we use @(zt+l I Zt) to denote the conditional density of z~+l
given Zt.
    To present the transition rule for Gt (z~,nt), it is easiest to consider each of the three
functions, ~~ (zt), Et (z~), and Gm (zt, n~), sepmately. We begin by describing the third
of these functions. Any establishment with employment between the schedules defined by
~+1 (z~+l)and fit+l (z~+l) employs the same number of workers as it did in the previous
period. Therefore, to find the ‘number’ of establishments with productivity zt+l which
employ nt+l workers, we need to add the ‘probabilities’ of all ~tablishments with previous

n~+l z ii:, then


                                                                                              (lo)

The &t term is the contribution of those between the employment rules in period t with em-
ployment nt+l who remain there, the second term is the contribution of those who increased
their employment during the previous period to nt+l, and the final term is the contribution
of those who decreased their employment during the previous period to nt+l.

The the differences between equations 10 and 11 reflect the exit of low productivity estab
lishrnents.
    Finally, if ~~ > nt+l, then
                                  Gfll (Zt+I, nt+l) = O.                               (12)

This is because all establishments with employment less than ~“ exit.
   To determine ~t+l (zt+l), it is useful to consider the same three cases. First, if Rt+l (zt+l)2

                                                                                                           (14)




Finally, if ~“ > Et+l (z~+l), then


                                                                                                           (15)

B. The Case of Costless               Job Creation

In this appendix we characterize analytically a version of the model with costless job creation.
This example is helpful since it illustrates a case where the usumption of strictly positive
entry, which underlies our strategy for computing equilibria in the more general version of
the model, is guaranteed to hold.
    Here we simplify the model of the main text in two ways: (1) we set T = O; and (2) we
assume tit elastic demand, ~ = – 1. To begin with, note that if job creation is costlws
current employment will be chosen to maximize static estabolishmentreturns,

                                                        Wt L     a—1
                                          nt=

                                                    ()
                                                    —

                                                    aztPt              -

This implies a one-to-one mapping between productivity levels and employment so keeping
tr~ of the joint distribution of employment and productivityy is pointless. Thus, we w-rite
the industry’s state variable M Gt (zt), which describes the measure of productivity over all
=tablishments.
    Theorems 2, 3, and 4 of Hopenha~ [11] gumantee that the model with zero adjustment
costs has a unique station~      equilibrium and that stationary equilibrium entry and exit
are strictly positive. 12 Suppose the industry’s initial measure over productivityy levels is the
stationary equilibrium measure, G* (zt), and that the wage in the current period is Wt instead
of the due used to compute the stationary equilibrium, W*. In this case static profits of
an establishment with productivity Zt are




Now, choose a price Pt so that nt (zt) equals its stationary equilibrium comterpti,


                                                                                              (19)

At this price profits of establishments as a function of productivity are the same as in the

  120ur model satisfies conditions U1 and U2 of Hopenhayn [11].


                                                        26
stationary equilibrium. Suppose the competitive equilibrium output price is given by (19) in
each period t. In this exe, since one period returns are the same as in the station~ equi-
librium, the establishment owner’s value function and exit decision rule will be unchanged
by the addition of aggregate uncertainty. If the value function is unchanged horn the sta-
tionmy equilibrium, the free entry condition must still be satisfied. Therefore, if B* new
establishments begin production during date t, the measure over productivity in that date
will equal G* (z~).
    We now examine whether Pt as given by (19) is a market clearing price. Our task is
to verify that aggregate demand equals aggregate supply at each date t with this price.
Consider fist aggregate supply. If Pt is the prevailing price and the current wage equals W~,
the output of a single establishment with productivity Zt is

                                                  @Pt *
                             qt (~t) =   Zt.
                                                  ()
                                                  —
                                                  w~



                                                          —a

                                     =   q’(z~)
                                                  ()  #         ,                            (20)

where q* (zt) is the output of an et abolishmentwith productivity level z~ in the stationary
equilibrium. Therefore, aggregate out put is given by




where we have assumed that B* new establishments begin production at every date t. Also,
Q* is the stationary equilibrium aggregate supply. Now consider aggregate demand. The
aggregate quantity demanded at the price Pt is

                                    p:= ()~w*
                                               p*-1             -“

                                        * Wt
                                           *
                                       Q (T)
                                         =
                                                           ‘a


Thus, the price given in (19) is indeed a market clearing price for every date t. Note
that the equilibrium we have constructed is for an initial measure of establishments across
productivity levels equal to the stationary equilibrium measure. In this special case, it is clear
that the assumption of positive entry in every possible state is valid since B* is guaranteed
to be positive.
