                  Output Effects of Government Purchases



                               ABSTRACT



    Because of a small direct negative effect on private spending, temporary

variations in government purchases as in wartime, would have a strong positive
                                            substitution effects would direct
effect on aggregate demand. Intertemporal

work and production toward these periods where output was valued unusually highly.

Defense purchases are divided empirically into "permanent" and "temporary"
                                     of (temporary) wars. Shifts in non—defense
components by considering the role

purchases are mostly permanent. Empirical results verify a strong expansionary

effect on output of temporary purchases, but contradict some more specific

expect ational propositions.

      Macroeconomic analysis typically assigns government purchases an impor-

tant role in influencing aggregate demand and thereby in affecting output

and employment. Bailey (1971) points out that these expansionary effects

are offset to the extent that governmentally-provided goods and services are

close substitutes for private consumption or investment expenditures. Hall

(1979) argues that temporary changes in government purchases can have a sub-

stantial business cycle role because they stimulate intertemporal substitution

of work and production. These effects are most important in the case of tran-

sitory expenditures that are not close substitutes for private spending--notably

for   wartime spending--but would not apply to long-run changes in government
purchases.
       The present analysis   focuses on the theoretical and empirical distinction

between   temporary and permanent variations in government purchases.   A simple

theoretical   framework is used to illustrate the   aggregate demand role of the

temporary    part of these purchases. Some consideration is given   also toc1irect

effects on aggregate supply, which arise to the extent that government services

constitute productive inputs for private firms.

        The empirical section estimates the division of defense purchases into

permanent and temporary components by considering the effect of war and of

war expectations. Defense spending associated with wars is largely transi-

tory, while other changes in defense spending turn out to be predominantly

permanent. Shifts in non-defense federal plus state and local purchases are

also mostly permanent in character. Analysis of output reveals a signi-

ficant expansionary effect of temporary defense purchases, a weaker but still

highly significant expansionary effect of permanent defense purchases, and
                                      —2--




 no   significant effect of non-defense purchases. These findings reject the
 polar   hypotheses that either permanent defense purchases have no output effects

 or that permanent defense purchases are as important for output as temporary

 purchases,. Some discrepancies between theory and evidence arise for detailed

 hypotheses that concern the formation of expectations on future values of

 defense purchases. Overall, the empirical results are mixed in the sense of

 verifying some aspects of the underlying theory--notably, in supporting the

 usefulness of separating government purchases into temporary and permanent

 components--but in contradicting some more specific expectational propositions.


 I. TheOretical Considerations

A. Aggregate Demand

        The   impact effect of government purchases on aggregate   demand involves

the    positive one-to-one effect of public expenditures net of any directly
induced    contraction of private demand. For givenvalues of pricesr including

anticipated real rates of     return, the reaction of private demand to changes
in    government purchases involves several channels: 1) alterations in perma-

nent private disposable income corresponding to shifts in the perceived amount

of resources absorbed by the government in a long-run average sense; 2) direct

substitution of public spending for private consumption or investment, as

stressed by Bailey (1971, pp 152—55); and 3) substitution effects associated

with changes in current or anticipated future tax rates.

       The first effect involves the perceived long-run average level of govern-

ment purchases. Since an increase in this average implies a corresponding

increase in the normal level of taxes--whether ocurring as explicit taxation,,

inflationary finance, or in a deferred form involving public debt issue--there

would be a roughly one-to-one downward adjustment of private consumer demand
                                        —3—




(see below). On this ground aggregate demand would be associated primarily

with deviations of government purchases from their perceived long-run average

value, rather than with the level of government purchases0 The channel of

direct expenditure substitution--as often illustrated by a publicly supported

school lunch program that replaces private spending on lun:clies--tends to less:en

the aggregate demand implications of government purchases even when those pur-

chases differ from the long-runrorm. Thethird channel involves substitutions

away from activities taxed by the government. In the case of labor earnings

taxes, the principal aggregate demand influence would be a negative ffect

of the normal level of government purchases on private demands, which would

correspond to a reduced average incentive to work rather than consume leisure.

(Note that an offsetting wealth effect on leisure would arise in consideration

above of the first channel of effects.) The aggregate demand influence of

consumption taxes, investment tax credits, or the like would depend more

closely on the timing of these levies.

     The aggregate demand effects outlined above can be examined within the

following formal model. Suppose that the representative household obtains

utility from a stream of non-durable consumption expenditures C(t) and govern-

ment purchases G(t). I do not distinguish here or in the empirical work between

current government purchases,/which involve partly gross investment, and the

flow of government-provided services, which involve partly rental income on the

publicly-owned capital stock., In order to highlight the main arguments of

the first two channels of effect mentioned above, the analysis abstracts initially

from the labor-leisure choice and assumes lump-sum taxation. I assume that a por-

tion of government purchases substitutes directly for contemporaneous private

consumption expenditure so that the effective consumption flow at date t is

given by C*(t) =   C(t)   +   OG(t), where o > 0.1   With C and G assumed to be measured
                                          -4-




 in equivalent commodity units per capita,2 B > 1 would require a form of

 efficiency advantage from public sector activity (as well as close utility

 substitution between publiô and private spending), In the main analysis I

 assume that 0 <      B   < 1   applies. At this stage government purchases are assumed

 to have no impact on private production functions; this type of supply effect

 is introduced below in section I.B, The utility function is assumed tO take

 the separable form

        (1) U   V1[C*(t...)J +

where   t,,,, represents a continuum of time starting at date 0 and extending

over an infinite horizon, and V2 measures the effect on utility of the part

of the stream of government purchases that does not substitute directly for

the contemporaneous value Of C. The inclusion of this term allows one to

distinguish substitutability between C(t) and G(t) from the issue of whether

G(t) is valued by the private sector. The function V1 is increasing with C

at any date and likewise for V2 with respect to G.

     Under lump-sum taxation the intertemporal budget equation for the rep-

Tesentative houaehold over an infinite horizon beginning at date 0 can be

written as


        (2) K(0) +
                     f0L(t)v(t)dt      f0C(t)(t)dt t   f0G(t)v(t)dt,
 where K(0) is initial assets (accumulated real capital) per capita;

 L(t) is the exogenous amount of real labor income per capita; and v(t)is

 a real discount factor: v(t)            exp[4   fr(t)dr],   where r(T)   is   the instan-

 taneous real rate of return on assets (capital) at date r. The last term

 in equation (2) is the real present value of government purchases per capita,
                                         —5—




 which corresponds to the real present value of tax collections perçapita
                                                  3
 possibly including inflationary finance0                 For convenience I assume that real

/ labor income per capita grows at a constant rate A (perhaps reflecting the rate
                                                                          At
 of labor-augmenting technical progress): L(t) = L(O)e                         ,   and that the

 "average" real rate of return is constant at a value i' > A.                        It is assumed

 that a departure of the current return r(t) from represents a transistory

 opportunity for a high or low return that may have strong intertemporal substi-

 tution effects, but nevertheless represents a weak income effect. In particular,

 v(t) etis assumed for convenience to be a satisfactory approximation in

 formulating the budget condition of equation (2).

    Defining the "average" ratio of government purchases to labor income as


    (3)(7t(O)           (i.X)f0[G(t)/L(t)]e A)tdt

and using the conditions C*(t)           C(t) +   eG(t),      L(t) =                   v(t) = e rt,
                                                                       L(O)eAt,
equation (2) can be rewritten as


     (4)   (   -
                    A)f0{C*(t)/L(t)]e
                                          -
                                              tdt     =   (   -   A)K/L   + 1 - (1     •-




where zeroes       in parentheses   are implicit in the symbols K, L and WE The

consumer's     problem amounts to choosing the path of "effective consumption"

C*(t), subject to given values for the time paths of G(t), r(t) and Lt),'

and subject to the form of the budget constraint shown                    in   equation (4).

     Neglecting private investment,4 current aggregate demand corresponds to


     (5) d cd +          G   = C* + (l-O)G,


where zeroes in parentheses have
                                         again been omitted. With 7t fixed, an
increase in G has no wealth effect
                                              on the right side of equation (4). Therefore,
for given values of real rates of return including the current value r(O),

C would be unchanged initially. Aggregate demand rises with G in equation (5)

in accordance with the coefficient (1-0), where 0 <   (1-0)   <   1.   The greater the

utility aubstitution between C and G, as measured by 0, the smaller the aggre-

gate demand impact of this type of temporary movement in government purchases.

Note that the implicit value associated with G, which would include the separable

utility influence measured by the V2 term in equation (1), is not directly

ertinent,

       If ?71T rises along with the increase in the current ratio GIL, there is

a negative wealth effect as shown on the right side of equation (4) C

declines in the normal case, which implies a reduced overall impact on aggre-

gate demand in equation (5). The quantitative relationship involves the

marginal propensity to consume out of "wealth." (Note that leisure is not

allowed to vary in the present setup,) Of particular interest is the net

effect on demand for the case where GIL and ?7i rise by equal amounts; that

is, when the change in. the government purchases ratio is permanent.

    In some simple cases there is a steady state value of K/L that is deter-

mined by parameters defining the production function, the utility function

in equation (1) including the "rate of time preference," and the growth rate

A.5 In this situation a change in T:ieaves unchanged the steady state ralue

of K/L,,6 At least when the initial value of K/L equals its steady state value,

the response in current C*IL would be one-to-one inversely with. the change in

(l-) (7L)       Aggregate demand as shown in equation (5) would then be invar-
iant   with the shift in government puchases In this situation aggregate
                                -7-




demand depends positively on (l-e)(G/L -   7r)-—that   is, on the value of

temporary government purchases--but is insensitive to shifts in the long-run

government purchases ratio 7t. This behavior implies in particular a strong

aggregate demand response to temporary movements in government purchases,

such as expenditures associated with wars, but no response to a secular

change in the government purchasestshare of gross national product,



Variable Labor Supply, Non-Lump Sum Taxation

    An immediate amendment for the case of variable labor supply concerns

the negative wealth effect associated with 7t in equation (4) when 0 ..      o < 1.
On this count an increase in ?7iT would tend to reduce leisure, which implies that

C declines by less than that calculated above. Accordingly;: aggregate demand would

tend to rise with equal increases in G/L and 7t, unlike in the previous example

where only the temporary component of government purchases influenced aggre-

gate demand However, this response is likely to be offset by substitution

effects of taxes, as discussed next.

    Suppose that taxes apply to labor earnings, rather than being lump sum.

If there is no strong utility interaction between consumption and leisure

at particular dates (for example, contemporaneously) or if tax rates are

based on the normal government purchases ratio         then substitution

effects of taxes on the current value of C* would involve primarily an

average of tax rates over time, which would influence the choice of the

present value of labor earnings. In particular, an increase in        would

raise this average of tax rates and thereby induce substitution toward leisure

and away from consumption at various dates, This inverse effect of G/L on
                                   —o—




C* offsets the wealth effect discussed above, Overall, the analysis of con-

sumption from the previous section is modified in accordance with the net

wealth and substitution effects on labor supply of a long-run change in

earnings taxes. If a long-run expansion of the governments spending ratio,,

7t, motivates a decrease in work effort, then aggregate demand would tend

to decline with 7i, and vice versa for the casehere work effort rises.8

    The analysis would be altered if tax rates do not always correspond to

the average value determined by 7t. Variations in current earnings taxes

could have an important substitution effect on current consumption if there

were a strong utility interaction between contemporaneous values of consump-

tion and leisure0 However, the sign of this interaction is not apparent.

The analysis requires more serious modification for cases of temporary taxes

on consumption, temporary credits for housing or other investment, and the

like,, The intertemporal substitution effects of these fiscal instruments

would become a central element of the analysis. However, if the levying of

these types of taxes is not closely related to the contemporaneous value f

government purchases, then these effects would be basically separable from

the present analysis. From an empirical standpoint, if substantial variations

in temporary taxes occur (which has not been demonstrated empirically in terms

of an overall fiscal package), it would be desirable to hold these effects

fixed separately.

     The main thoeretical conclusion remains as the major positive effect of

temporary   government purchases on aggregate demand; assuming that the direct
substitution   parameter 0 is well below unity. There are a number of channels

through which permanent changes in government purchases could influence
                                  -9-




 aggregate demand, but the overall presumption is for a substantially weaker

 effect (of ndeterminate sign), as compared with the effect of temporary

 movements.


 B. Aggregate Supply
      Aside from substituting for private consumer expenditure, government pur-

 chases may represent intermediate products that serve as inputs for private

 firms. For example, police and fire services, highways, and even a system

 of laws and national defense can be viewed in part as these types of interme-

 diate products. As discussed by Kuznets (1948, pp. :156-57) and Musgrave

  (1959, pp. 186—88), a consistent difinition of national product would treat

 these items as inputs that would not be double-counted as elements of final

 product. Problems with dividing government purchases into final and interme-

 diate categories make this adjustment difficult to make in practice. I3ven if

 these adjustments were accomplished it would remain necessary to consider the

 pgssible-effects of various public services, such as national defense, on

/ private aggregate supply.

       To model the simplest possible case (see Barro and Grossman, 1976, Ch. 1

  for some further discussion), suppose that a constant fraction 4, where 0 <    c,< 1,
  of current government purchases contributes one-to-one to aggregate commodity

  supply; that is,


       (6) Y5 =      ÷   G.

  In some cases, such as national defense, it may be more appropriate to model

  yS as responding to the long-run average value of purchases ,   rather   that G,

  but the analysis is not greatly affected by this change. I do not consider
                                         —10-




here dimininshing marginal product of public services, the interplay between

these services and private productive inputs, or the possibility that govern-

ment purchases would exert substantial intertemporal substitution effects on

private     commodity supply. (Compare the treatment of aggregate demand, as
discussed above in n,        1,)   Therefore, the portions of aggregate supply denoted
by   ...    in equation (6) are    assumed not to be affected directly by G,

       The previous analysis of aggregate demand must also be modified because

the flow G constitutes income to households (possibly involving firms as

intermediaries). The budget expression in equation (4) is therefore altered

so that the last term on the right side becomes -(l-O-)7t; that           is,   the nega-

tive effect of 7t on effective private resources is offset first, by the

fraction o that services equivalent to private consumer spending are provided

and second, to the extent           that aggregate commodity supplies are enhanced.

It is assumed now that 0 < 0 +          < 1 applies. In the case discussed above

where      the capital-labor ratio was invariant with changes in the government
purchases ratio, aggregate demand would now depend on (l-0)(G/L-7t) +
Therefore,      if 4 >   0, aggregate demand would now rise with a permanent expansion
of   the government purchases ratio.


C,    Effects on Output and the Real Rate of Return
        The translation of aggregate demand and supply effects into output        move-

ments involves the determination of real r tes of return in order to clear

the commodity market. The central assumption is that             is negatively related

to the current return r(O), while yS is positively related. The latter response

involves intertemporal substitution of factor supplies and final products,

which has been stressed by Hall (1979, section 2). In particular, periods
with relatively high values of r would be unusually rewarding to intensive

work effort and production.

     Consider a temporary expansion of government purhcases, where GIL rises

while the normal purchases ratio G/L is held fixed. Aggregate demand rises

roughly as (l-0)G while supply increases as $G..     (If supply depended on G

rather than G, there would be an increase only on the demand side.) Given

that (0+4>) < 1 applies, there is an excess demand for commodities-—that is,

a deficiency of currently desired saving--which requires a rise in the current

real rate of return r(O) to restore market clearing.9 Therefore, output and

the real rate of return both rise in response to an increase in (G/L -

The output effect is greater the smaller the value of 0 and the larger the

value of 4>.   In   any event the present setup implies that the output response

is less than one-to-one with the movement in G; that is, the model exhibits

a dampener rather than a multiplier.

     The positive response of output to temporary movements in government

purchases would apply especially to wartime periods.10 The real rate of re-

turn can be viewed as the price signal that induces the intertemporal substitution

of resources toward periods such as wars in which aggregate output is valued

unusually highly. This type of substitution has been stressed by Hall (1979,

section 2), who points out also that this behavior differs in some important

respects from the response of supply to monetary misperceptions that occurs

in some business cycle theories that stress intertemporal substitution on

the supply side (for example, Lucas and Rapping, 1969; Lucas 1975; Barro 1980).

The effect of government purchases on the time arrangement of work and pro-

duct ion does not rely on elements of misperception with respect to the general

price level or other variables.
     A permanent increase in the government purchases ratio, where G/L and

i7T expand equally, leads to comparable rises in d and S The real rate

of return would not be affected substantially, but output rises as long as

    0. The positive effect on GNP of a permanent change in government pur-

chases is smaller than the effect of an equal, temporary change, because the

supply effects are equal and the demand effect is smaller in the permanent

situation.11 Therefore, permanent shifts in government purchases also involve

a dampened response of output.

     Overall, temporary expansions of government purchases are distinguished

from permanent purchases in that 1) the positive effect on real GNP of

temporary purchases is larger, and 2) the relative value of the current

real rate of return is raised by temporary purchases.    The last effect may

be difficult to test empirically because of problems in measuring anticipated

real rates of return and because tax effects on the return to savings, which

would be associated primarily with the long-run average value of the government

                                          i on the overall level of real rates
purchases ratio, may imply an effect of

of return. In any event the present empirical investigation deals only with

output effects of temporary versus permanent movements in government purchases.



 II. Empirical Implementation
      The theoretical propositions will be tested by examining the effects

 of government purchases in a reduced form relationship for output, as

 measured by real GNP. The analysis is an extension of previous empirical

 research (Barro, 1977, 1978; Barro and Rush, 1980) that stressed the business
                                            —13—




cycle influences of monetary disturbances. This earlier work included a govern-

ment purchases variable (Barro and Rush, 1980, pp. 8,9) or a related measure

of military personnel, but did not distinguish temporary from permanent

government    spending.
       Suppose that a relationship has         been isolated for the normal government

purchases    ratio (Wt)     in   terms of a set of parameters a and currently ob-
served   exogenous variables Z:


       (7) (7r) =

A linear reduced form expression for the log of output could be written as


       (8) log(Y) . ÷ (G/Li +
or,   using equation (7),


       (9) log(Y)=           +               + 82F(Z;a),

where omitted variables denoted by ...             include   current and lagged monetary

shocks, as stressed in previous empirical research. Lagged values of GIL

and   7t   could also enter equations (&) and (9), but these effects were not

found to be important empiricallye

       One hypothesis to consider is the polar case where 8l -82 > 0;             that   is,

the situation where a rise in the temporary part of government purchases

increases output   through   an increase in aggregate demand, but where equal

changes in G/L and 7t do not affect output. Since this outcome requires a

zero supply effect of government purchases (c=0), it is more interesting to

test the weaker hypothesis,        t3] >   0, 82 < 0; which implies that temporary
                                   —14—




changes   tn government purchases have a larger positive output effect than

permanent changes. Since the effect of the latter is given by the sum of

the coefficients,     ÷     the result     >        > 0 implies that permanent

changes   in government /purchases increase output--as would be expected through
the supply channel--and vise versa for    _82
                                                >     >.
     Additional   hypotheses involve the manner in which the Z-variables appear

across equations (7) and (9). If these variables do not appear separately

in the list of omitted variables in equation (8), the         variables would

appear in equation (9) only as they serve as determinants for (W1T) in

the F-function of equation (7). Some cross—equation restrictions would

therefore be implied for the parameters of equations (7) and (9). The exclu-

sion of at least some of the Z variables from equation (8) is actually needed

even to test the hypothesis above that               0; see Barro, 1979b, section V,

for a general discussion of these types of cross-equation tests.

     The next sections deal with the problem of modeling a form of equation

(7) for government purchases in the United States.12


A. Government Purchases Bquation

     The stress on transitory movements in government purchases suggests

special attention to war-related expenditures, which are likely to be

viewed as largely temporary. I have proceeded empirically by separating

total government (federal plus state and local) purchases of goods and

services into a defense" component, GW, and other purchases, G. The

present analysis does not attempt to classify components of government

purchases in accordance either with their relative substitutabilities with
                                        —15—




private spending, as reflected above in the 0 parameter, or with their role

as inputs to private production, as measured above by the         parameter. Dif-

ferences between defense and non-defense items with respect to these parameters

affect the interpretation of some of the empirical findings. Presumably,

defense purchases are characterized by a relatively low value of 0 and possibly

by a relatively high value of           The former implies a relatively large output

effect of temporary defense purchases, while the latter would enhance the out-

put effects of both temporary and permanent defense purchases. The empirical

analysis would be sharpened by obtaining a division of non-defense purchases

into relatively homogeneous categories with respect to the 0 and           parameters,

but the feasibility of this classification is unclear.


Defense Purchases

      A primary determinant of GW would be the level of current and anticipated

future wartime activity, assuming that at least the timing of wars can be treated

as exogenous with respect to expenditure decisions. I have quantified this in-

fluence by using a casualty rate measure Bt, which represents battle deaths per

1,000 total population (see table 1) for the wartime years since the Civil War:

1898, 1917—18, 1941—45, 1950—53, 1964-72. Because of improvements in the tech-

nology   of caring for wounded and offsetting     changes associated with the

"efficiency"   of weapons, it   is   possible that this variable does   not consist-

ently measure the intensity of war at different dates. I considered using a

broader casualty measure that included wounded, but the ratio of this concept

to battle deaths showed no trend at least since the Spanish American War.13

Since I was unable to obtain reliable annual data on wounded for World War II,

I have restricted my analysis to the narrower, battle deaths concept of

casualty rates.

        Prospective wars would be likely also to influence current spending,

with good information on forthcoming military actions existing prior to at

least the U.S. entrances into World Wars I and II. Since I have been unable

to construct any instruments for these war expectations, I have introduced

some actual future values of B into an equation for current defense spending.

This procedure introduces errors-in-variables problems into coefficient esti-

ination, although the present analysis is concerned primarily with obtaining

conditional forecasts, rather than with coefficient estimation pse. Lagged

effects of B on spending are introduced also into the equation.

        Since defense expenditures involve a substantial investment component,

the amount of current spending would tend to be influenced negatively by the

size of existing capital stocks. Accordingly, I have/included in a defense

spending aquation the variable K1, which measures the beginning-of-period

real stock of military equipment, structures and inventories (table 2, col.5).

The relation of capital stock to current spending is assumed to be given by


    (10). K bG +       (l-a)K1,
where     is a depreciation rate and b measures the fraction of total defense

spending that constitutes investment (net of within-year depreciation on this

investment). The K' series was constructed with values of b and S that varied

over time (see the notes to table 2),but I have limited the theoretical dis—

cussion below to situations where these parameters are approximated satisfactorily

as constants. For generation of forecasts in the empirical analysis have

used the sample average values of 5 =      16 per year and b. =   .34.

    The estimating equation for GW takes the form,



        (11) g = A(L)Bt          -   yk't-l         +   ut'

where
         w               G is real defense expenditure, Y. is real GNP;

        A(L) is a polynominal in the lag operator L, which allows both lags and

The form of equation(ll) implies that a doubling f Y                                       and t—l' for

given values of the B variables, leads to a doubling of G.

        Empirically, two leads, the contemporaneous value, and up to a third lag

of B had significant explanatory power for g. In this case A(L)Bt = cLOBt +

where D is the first-difference operator and                                 E u_ui is a white noise
error term. A constant is insignificant when added to equation (12) in the

empirical analysis; that is, there is no trend in the defense purchases ratio.

Moving-average error terms or more complicated autoregressive error structures

also did not add to the explanatory value of the equation. The form of

equation (12) suggests that a current shock                                 would have a permanent effect

on the mean level of g". However, because of the inclusion of the k1

structure of the B variable, imply a distribution for future values of gW,

conditional     on information available at date t (which is assumed in the present

case to include the values of B+i and B2). Equation (12) implies that

future values of the spending-GNP ratio are given by

The effect of g is positive but less than unitary0 For a given value

of g, the effect of k1 is positive because it indicates that a greater

fraction of g' corresponds to a permanent component.

      For the case where A(L) includes three lag values and two leads, and

where observations on the B variable through B2 are av,ailable at date t,

the       expression in the last term of equation (15) can be written as a

function of the variables (B3, ..              , Bt)   and of anticipated future

casualty rates, which appear in the form,

The remaining work is to relate expectations of future values of B, as

entering through the ''     variable,   to currently observed variables, including

values of B up to Bt2.


Expectations of Future Wars

      Calculation of expected future casualty rates is based on the following

stationary probability model for wars)4 First, a 2-by-2 matrix is specified

for the probability of war or peace next year (or rather for year t+3 when

conditions at t+2 are assumed known at date t), conditional on war or peace

prevailing currently. It is assumed that information about the future

course of B is contained fully in the most recent observation; earlier

values of B and values of other variables not having to be considered.

The probability of war during at least part of next year, given peace

for the latest observation, is based on data over the 1774-1978 period;

namely,

      (17) p1    Prob. (Bt+1 >

whre 162 is the total number of peacetime years in the sample (where Bt
                                                                                                          15

CorrespondinglY the probability of peace continuing is given by

    (l.i) = Probo(Bt÷,
                          =
                               0Bt
                                      =   0)           .94.


The valt of p1 is slightly higher if the sample is limited to the more recent

period 1889-1978 (the sample for which'\elatively accurate observations on
and B are available), for which the result is p1 =                      5/63   =   .C7.

    The probability of the continuation of war is given for the 1774-1978

sample by

    (18) p2 =   Prob. (B+i >    olB           >   0)        33/42 =   .79,


where 42. is the number of war years (where Bt                        0) and 33 s the number

of these that were followed by anotheryear of war.'6 In other words. 9 wars

began and ended over the sample 1774-1978. For the 1889-1978 period the

result would be p2 = 16/21 =        .76.          Finally, the probability of no war

next year, given its existence this year,17 is given for the 1774—1978

sample by


    (l—p2) =   Prob. (B+, = OIBt          >   0)           .21.



    The expected value of B for the first year of a war is calculated as

the mean value for the 5 wars since 1889 (for whiôh accurate data on B are

available)


    (19) B     E(Bt+iIBt+i >   0,    Bt =         0)   =

                                          —21—




Since war could break out at any time during the year, the annualized value

of EBt+i, denoted by BA, would be roughly twice the above figure; that is,

       l24
    Finally, when Bt+i and             are both positive, the conditional expectation
                                  Bt
for Bt+i is given by

 future casualty rates in equation (16),


 on observation of B through Bt+2 and            for   a given value of the discount rate p.

 Specifically, the result takes the form,


       (21)      -o

                                    —22--




where p0 and p can be determined as functions of the p parameter.18 Speci-
fically, these coefficients are as follows for selected values of p:


                          p


                                 1.95       2,33

                         ,25     0.051      1.30




Since p corresponds to the difference between the real rate of return and the
real growth rate, the values of the p coefficients corresponding to the lower
values   of p would seem to be most pertinent.

   The combination of equation (21) with equations (16)and (15) allows calcula-

tion of the normal government purchases ratio g as a funciion of the variables

 (g, k1, B3,         ,
                         B)    and the parameters (p, ?,
                                                           cL0, a1, a2, a3, a1, a2),
where p is the net real discount rate, y measures the reaction of current defense

purchases to existing captial stock, and the a's and a's describe the effect of

the array of B variables on defense purchases. The results are therefore expressed

in terms of the general form of equation (7), except that government purchases

are now expressed relative to GNP, rather than relative to labor income.

Other coefficients that appear in the analysis, (cS, b, p1, p2, B) (see for
                                    —23-




example the expression contained in n. 18 above) are treated as fixed at the

values specified above:    (S   .16 per year, b =   .34,    p1 =   .06,   p2 =   .79,   B   .062.




Government Purchases of Non-Defense Items

     Statistical analysis of the non-defense portion of government purchases,

gP = g_gW, over samples beginning in 1929 revealed littled predictive value

for first differences Dg, except for a negative association with the contem-

poraneous change in the defense component, Dg'.19 This association would

reflect especially the crowding-out of non-defense government spending during

wars. The dependence of Dg only on DgW means that departures of gP from

the normal value gP are determined entirely by the difference between g" and

gW     Therefore, with gW_gW held fixed, changes in gP amount entirely to shifts

in the permanent component gP• Accordingly, with the gw variables held fixed,

the coefficient of the gP variable in an output equation would reveal the

effect of permanent changes in non-defense purchases.


B. Empirical Results

        The principal empirical analysis involves joint estimation of the govern-

ment purchases equation (12) and a relation for output of the form of equation (8)

(with government purchases variables now expressed relative to GNP, rather than

labor income). Hypothesis tests involving cross-equation coefficient restric-

tions derive from the calculation of g as determined by the coefficients from

equation (12), together with equations (15),(16) and (21). The first.set of

tests involves the polar restriction that g and g enter with equal and opposite

coefficients in the form of equation (8)--or, equivalently, that the coefficient

of g is zero tn a form where the variable g-g              is   held fixed--and that the
coefficient of g equals zero in this equation.                The       second   set of tests

                                                                    this ca.se 8t+2

rate p, but results turned out to be relatively insentive to variations

in this parameter at least over the range from .01 to .05 per year. The

main results refer to a fixed value of p = .02 per year, which is plausible

ex ante and   close   to a maximum likelihood estimate for this parameter (in

forms that calculate g for equation (8) as above).

                          thereby    influencing the fit for output in the form
ing the series g and

of equation (8). Therefore, the coefficients in the equation for Dg

 are not determined solely to obtain a best fit of equation (12). I have

 not carried out joint estimation in the broader context of choosing the order

 of the A(L) polynominal for the B variable in equation (12), in deciding to

 omit moving-average error terms in the Dg equation, in analyzing the Dg

 process, etc.

     kW              where           is real government defense capital stocks (1972 base),

     For present purposes. I focus on the role of the government purchases

variables in equation (22), neglecting the money shock variables, which have

effects similar to those discussed in previous research.22 The g variable

in the output equation is based on the specification for Dg in equation (23).

The main effect isolated in the equation for Dg is the strong positive spending

effect of wars, as measured by the casualty rate variable B. The equation shows

a two-year lead effect of the B variable and a lagged effect out to three years.

(The negative effect on Dg of the DB2 variable is difficult to interpret.)
For present purposes the most important aspect of war spending is its tern-

porary nature, although precise calculations for g' involve the distributed

lag pattern of DB effects on Dg and the implications of these responses

for the behavior of the capital stock ratio kW. Equation (23) shows also

the expected negative effect of Dk1 on Dg.

     Using equations (15), (16) and (21) and the value p= .,02, the point

estimates of coefficients shown in equation (23) can be shown to imply the

formula for g as follows:


     (24) g .012 + .73g + .l3k1 -                       + .02B2 -   . l7B1
                                               .05B3
                    —   .l9Bt   — .13B
                                     t+l
                                           —   .08B
                                                  t+2


Equation (24) shows a positive but less than one-to-one effect on g of

a positive effect of k1 (for a given value of g), and a basically negative

effect of the casualty rate variables (again given the value of g). Values

of g calculated from equation (24) are shown along with values of g in

table 2, column 4. Because the gW_gW concept corresponds to a gap between

the current and long-run average values of the purchases ratio, rather than

to a spread between actual and "anticipated" amounts, it should not be

surprising that the variable exhibits a substantial amount of positive serial

correlation. In particular, the large number of peacetime years with small

negative values of gW gW are offset by a small number of wartime years with
                 w      w
large excess of g over g .

     The temporary defense purchases variable, g'-g, has a significant

expansionary effect on output as shown in equation (22) ("t-.value" of 4.8).

The normal defense purchases variable g is also significantly expansionary
                                     —27—




in this equation Ct-value of 4.7). The estimated effect for the permanent

purchases variable is about half that of the estimated temporary effect.

The results permit rejection of two extreme hypotheses: 1) that only the

temporary part of purchases affects output (which would require the coef-

ficient of the g variables in equation (22) to differ insignificantly from

zero), and 2) that temporary and permanent purchases are of equal importance

for output. The latter case would correspond to equal coefficients for the

g-g and g variables; that is, to the proposition that the g variable would

be insignificant in an equation that held fixed the value of actual spending

g. For convenience, the results from equation (22) can be expressed in this

form as



     log(Y)
               ... + 0.98g    -
                                   .46g.
                      (.20)       1.22)


The coefficient of g differs significantly from zero, as indicated by

the t-value of 2.2. This result indicates that temporary defense purchases

are significantly more expansionary than permanent purchases.

     The estimated coefficient on the g-g variable in equation (22),

0.98, s.e.    .20, indicates a roughly one-to-one effect of a temporary

change in the level of real defense purchases on the level of output.

Considering the standard error of the estimated coefficient, this finding

is consistent with the theoretical implication of a dampened response of

output to a temporary change in real purchases. However, a moderate multi-

plier relationship would also not be rejected by this evidence. The relatively

high estimated output effect would be associated in the theoretical model with

 a small value of the 0-coefficient, a high value of the 4i cofficient (see below),
                                     —28—




and a high real rate of return elasticity of aggregate supply relative to

that of demand,

     The estimated coefficient on the g variable in equation (22), .51,

s,e. =   .11,   implies that a permanent increase by one unit in real defense

purchases leads approximately to a one-half unit rise in real GNP.23 This

result accords with the model's prediction that output would respond less

than one-to-one to a permanent change in government purchases; moreover,

the estimate is significantly below unity in this case.

     The non-defense purchases variable 4 is insignificant in equation (22).

This finding accords with the view that movements in 4-with the gW variables

held fixed--reflect permanent changes that would not have major consequences

for aggregate demand. According to the theoretical analysis, a small output

effect of 4 would correspond to a small supply coefficient .       Possibly,
the larger expansionary effect of g than of 4 in equation (22) reflects

the more important intermediate "production" role of defense purchases (see,

however, n. 23 above), This conclusion is not firm because of the large

standard error of the estimated 4 coefficient. In any case the estimated

coefficient on 4 in equation (22) is significantly below unity, which

rejects the existence of an output multiplier on non-defense government

purchases.

     A combination of equation (22) with the formula for g in equation (24)

implies a reduced form expression for output in terms of a constant, time trend,

DMR variables, g, 4, the B variables, and k1. Unrestricted estimation of

this reduced form affords a test of the hypothesis that the determinants of

g--specifically, the B variables and k1--affect output only in the manner
                                     —29—




implied by equations (22) and (24). The test is based on the likelihood

ratio corresponding to unrestricted and restricted forms of joint estimation.

The value of -.21og(iikelihood ratio) turns out to be 28.0, which exceeds the

5% critical value for the x2    distribution   with 6 degrees of freedom (the number

of coefficients restrictions in this case) of 12.6.24 Therefore, the hypothesis

that the determinants of g enter only in this indirect manner in influencing

output is rejected.

       A likely reason for rejection of the null hypothesis is the existence of

direct positive output effects of war, which do not operate through the channels

specified in the present analysis. However, because the war variables are also

theprime basis in this work for distinguishing temporary from permanent move-
ments in government purchases, it would not be feasible to allow unrestricted
direct wartime output effects and still carry out interesting tests of the
underlying   hypotheses. Other possible problems include errors in relating

g to the present war situation, as determined from equation (23) and
                                                                            the
simple model of war probabilities; arid     errors   in the construction of the

 DMR   variables;   in particular, in the role of the temporary federal expendi-

 ture variable in the equation for constructing anticipated money growth

 (n.   21 above). The present analysis has important implications for improving
                                                                       which. may
 on the measurement of this temporary federal spending variable,
 interact substantially with the estimated effects of the gW variables in

 an output equation.

the U.S. and recent issues of the U.S. Survey of Current Business. The
fraction of nominal defense purchases in total nominal federal purchases was
multiplied by figures on real federal purchases (1972 base). Data from

       'The form for C* (t) rules out an effect of the time path of G(t) on the

relative prIcettofC* at various dates. For example, a multiplicative inter-

action between C(t) and G(t) in the expression for C*(t) would generate a form

of complementarity where an increase in G(t) would stimulate a substitution

toward C(t) from private consumer spending atother dates. Complementarity

of this type between C(t) and the long-run average value of G would matter only

when the labor/leisure choice was introduced. The interaction of G with C

versus that with leisure would then come into the analysis.


       2Th1s setup abstracts from explicit modeling of a possible public goods-

type scale economy for government purchases.


       3See Barro (1979a) on the implications of deficit finance.


       4The wealth effects discussed in the present analysis would not apply

directly to private investment demand. Direct substitution of public projects

for private investment would seem similar to the consumption substitution that

is governed by the 0-parameter.


       51f production is subject to constant returns to scale, labor-augmenting,

technical progress occurs at rate X, G grows also at rate A, and

                                                    a[C*(t)]b,   a >   o,   o < b <   1,
V1 =   f0u[C*(t)]etdt,    where p.> A, u[C*(t)] =

then a steady state involves C*(t) growing at rate A with the rate of return

given by       p +   A(l-b).   Non-zero population growth could also be included,

as in Arrow and Kurz I97O, Ch. III). The steady-state value of K/L is deter-

mined by an equality between and the marginal product of capital.
            a finite horizon life cycle-type model, one would expect a decline

 in the "target value" of K/L. In this case there would be a smaller       negative
 response of the current C*/L to an increase in GIL. However, this sort of
 effect need not arise under finite lives if      intergenerational transfers are

 included in the model.


      7Barro (1979a, pp. 941-45) provides some optimizing rationale for this

 behavior on the part of the government.


      8This discussion ignores government transfers, which involve a substitu-

tion effect away from work activity, but not the sort of wealth effect discussed

above. (Other substitution effects could arise, of course, depending on the

nature of the     transfers.) Transfer payments also do not involve the direct
effect    on aggregate demand associated with purchases of goods and services.


     9The current price level will tend also to rise, possibly generating

the expectation of future deflation. A full analysis would require a model

of money supply behavior. Since the effects at issue are primarily non-

monetary in nature, it is unnecessary for present purposes to carry       out   the
details    of this analysis.

         10Wartime may   also be associated with. uncertainties on maintaining pro-
perty rights, which would tend to reduce private investment demand. The
                                                                                analysis
abstracts from this effect and from controls on prices or interest rates. Also

excluded are effects of patriotism or coercive behavior, such as conscription.

     12Levis Kochin has suggested tke attractive altern.tive of using the

current overall tax rate as a roxy for the anticipated long-run average

ratio of government purchases: to GNP. A rationale for identifying the tax

                                                   ratio is given in Barro
rate with the anticipated government expenditure

(l979a). The argument involves a deficit policy that smoothes tax rates

over time in order to minimize excess burden costs for a given present value

of net tax collections. Some problems with implementing Kochins suggestion

are 1) the distinction between purchases and expenditures implies that a

separate model would be required to predict future transfers (including

interest payments), which is not obviously easier than modeling purchases

directly; and 2) the use of the tax rate to proxy the permanent expenditure

ratio may work better for the federal government than for total government.

See Benjamin and Kochin (1978), who argue that mobility possibilities would

                                      from choosing an excess burden minimizing
prevent state and local governments

debt policy. However, this issue involves also the federal government's inter-

action with state and local governments.


      13The ratio of total casualties (including wounded but excluding deaths

 that were unrelated to combat) to battle deaths is 5.3 for the Spanish Añierican

 War, 4.8 for World War I, 3.3 for World War II, 4.0 for the Korean War, and 4.3

 for the Vietnamese War. See the notes to table 1 for sources of casualty data.


      14War probabilities and the distribution of sizes of wars need not be

 constant over time, although there is no indication of substantial structural

 change in the small sample of evidence afforded by the 200 years of U.S.

 history. (The largest value for the B variable would actually apply to the

                                                                  (continued)

  Civil War; see the notes to table 1.) From the standpoint of
                                                               constructing
  the g variable, shifts in the stochastic structure for wars would essentially

 be an alternative to the
                                  present specification that allows for shifts in spend-
 ing for a given war structure, as
                                            represented by the stochastic variable
                                                                                     u
 in equation (11). In the context of
                                               output analysis, it is unclear that there
 would be much empirical difference between these alternatives.

           The year 1978 is                   -
                            not included in this calculation, although it could

 have been if peace during 1979 were also included. War years are taken to be

 1775-83, 1812—15, 1846—48, 1861—65, 1898,. 1917—18, 1941—45, 1950—53, 1964—72.

 There may be some objection to
                                       starting the sample just before a war (which
 is not independent of the start of U.S. data), but the results are not highly

 sensitive to this chOice.


      16The probability p2 refers to the existence of war during at least
                                                                          part
 of a year following a period of war during at least part of the previous
                                                                          year.

      17This calculation pertains to the existence of peace over the entire

year t+1, conditional on war during at least part of year t.



      18The general formulae are


      p0   = [B1(1-p2)(1+p+p201)       +
                                           P2O0(l+P)(P+p1)]/[p(l+p+p1_p2)(ipp2o1)J,
           =
               p201/(l+p_p201).
