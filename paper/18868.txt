                                            ABSTRACT

This paper documents the role of the collateral lending channel to facilitate small business starts and
self-employment in the period before the financial crisis of 2008. We document that between 2002
and 2007 areas with a bigger run up in house prices experienced a strong increase in employment in
small businesses compared to employment in large firms in the same industries. This increase in small
business employment was particularly pronounced in (1) industries that need little startup capital and
can thus more easily be financed out of increases in housing as collateral; (2) manufacturing industries
where goods are shipped over long distances, which rules out that local demand is driving the expansion.
We show that this effect is separate from an aggregate demand channel that relies on home equity
based borrowing leading to increased demand and employment creation.

       1. Introduction



The recession that followed the financial crisis of 2008 was marked by high and very persistent
unemployment rates, which has drawn renewed interest to understanding the forces that affect labor
market dynamics over the business cycle. The ensuing debate has focused on two primary
explanations for the persistent unemployment. On the one side are researchers who argue that the
recession was propagated by a dramatic decline in consumer demand, which was exacerbated by
significant deleveraging at the household level and resulted in increased firm closures and
unemployment. 2 See, for example, Romer (2011) or Mian and Sufi (2011a).

On the other side are proponents of the idea that structural mismatches in the skill composition of
parts of the work force explain the persistent unemployment, see for example Kocherlakota (2010).
Similarly, Charles, Hurst and Notowidigdo (2012) argue that these structural problems in the labor
market were already present pre-2008, but were masked by the increase in house prices and the
ensuing rise in labor demand in the construction industry. Others, most prominently Mulligan
(2011), put forward that structural factors in labor market institutions, such as counter cyclical
unemployment insurance, reduce the incentives of unemployed workers to reenter the labor market.

Our paper documents an alternative channel that has received much less attention but significantly
affects the dynamics of employment creation over the business cycle: The impact of the collateral
lending channel, especially mortgage lending, on self-employment and small business starts. Going
back at least to the seminal papers by Bernanke and Gertler (1989) or Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) a
number of theories have suggested that improvements in collateral values ease credit constraints for
borrowers and can have multiplier effects on economic growth. This collateral lending channel
builds on the idea that information asymmetries between banks and firms can be more easily
alleviated when collateral values are high and therefore firms can have higher leverage (Rampini and
Viswanathan, 2010) and that these problems are especially acute for small, more opaque, firms
(Gertler and Gilchrist, 1994 or Kashyap, Stein and Wilcox, 1993). However, empirically it has been
very difficult to cleanly identify the causal direction of the collateral effect. The challenge is that
increased collateral values facilitate lending but in the reverse direction higher collateral values can
also be the result of improvements in economic conditions (e.g., Iacovello, 2005).

2   On average, households reduced their debt to income ratios by more than 20% following the house price bust.

                                                            1
In this paper we take a different approach and look directly at shocks to the value of collateral, in
particular the value of homes. In order to identify the causal effect of higher house prices we
instrument for the growth in prices between 2002 and 2007 using the elasticity measure developed
by Saiz (2010), which uses exogenous geographical and regulatory constraints to housing supply.
The measure therefore differentiates areas where an increase in housing demand either translates
into higher house prices and collateral value (low elasticity areas) or into higher volume of houses
built (high elasticity). By relying on exogenous restrictions on the expansion of housing volumes, we
separate out the effect of high collateral values on the creation of small businesses. This
identification strategy is similar to the study by Chaney, Sraer and Thesmar (2012), which looks at
corporate investment decisions or Mian and Sufi (2011b) who look at increases in consumption
from household leverage.

We show that leading up to the recession of 2008, areas with rising house prices (and increased
leverage) experienced a significantly bigger increase in small business starts and a rise in the number
of people who are employed in establishments with fewer than 10 employees compared to areas that
did not see an increase in house prices. The same increase in employment cannot be found for large
establishments in these same areas. In fact, the effect of house prices on job creation monotonically
decreases with the size of the firms. This asymmetric effect on small versus large only holds for
instrumented house prices, which suggests that the non-instrumented part of the variation (which is
the one that captures endogenous demand) mostly impacts employment at larger firms. This
asymmetry points to the interpretation of the collateral lending channel as an important driver of
employment creation in small firms, since large firms have access to other forms of financing and
thus should not be affected by this type of collateral channel.

While the result above supports the importance of the collateral channel for small business creation,
there are two alternative hypotheses that must be ruled out as explaining our results. First, increasing
house prices can drive local demand for goods (Campbell and Cocco, 2007) and, consequently,
employment at non-tradable industries (Mian and Sufi, 2011a). To the extent that small firms may be
more sensitive to changes in demand (Kashyap and Stein, 1994), the asymmetry in the results could
reflect this increased demand rather than the collateral channel. The second alternative hypothesis
comes from the fact that, by using housing and zoning restrictions for obtaining identification, we
rely on cross sectional differences between high and low elasticity areas. This means that these areas
could also vary along other dimensions, such as the level of economic vitality. For example, areas

                                                   2
with low elasticity might not only see high house prices when demand for housing picks up, i.e.
more available collateral, but they might also be the ones where more investment opportunities
become available.

We devise a number of additional tests to meaningfully differentiate the impact of the collateral
lending channel from these alternative hypotheses. First, we verify that the results are not driven by
changing industry composition: Even within industries, areas with increasing house prices saw
stronger employment growth in smaller establishments. 3

Second, and to further narrow in on the importance of collateral for business financing, we look at
the variation across industries in the start-up capital that is needed to set up a new firm. The idea is
that there are differences in the minimal feasible scale of businesses across industries and thus the
availability of collateral should matter more depending on that minimal scale. For example, some
businesses like home healthcare services can be started with small amounts of capital that could
reasonably be financed through house price appreciation. In contrast, many sectors within
manufacturing, for example, require large amounts of capital and fixed investments, and we do not
expect the housing channel to be as effective since the capital needs are too high to be financed via
individual loans against property. This strategy is similar to the approach used in Hurst and Lusardi
(2004).

Our results follow exactly the predicted pattern: when we repeat our regressions disaggregated by
industries above and below the median needs in terms of start-up capital we find that the effect of
house price growth on the creation of employment in small establishments is especially strong
among industries with lower capital needs. These results confirm that the collateral lending channel
played an important role in shaping employment dynamics. Borrowing against housing wealth
allowed people in the areas with quicker house price appreciation to start small businesses and
potentially alleviate the impact of job losses in the period leading up to 2008.

Third, we confirm that the results in our study are not driven by the non-tradable or the
construction sectors. As pointed out above, if the relationship between house price increases and job
creation in small firms was purely constrained to the non-tradable or construction sectors, one
would be concerned that the results are not driven by changes in the collateral lending channel but
by differences in local demand. However, our results hold for the manufacturing sector where

3   A similar relationship exists when we include proprietorships and unincorporated businesses in the regressions.

                                                              3
products are easily tradable, and more strongly so for manufacturing firms with low external
financing needs. The difference in employment creation between large and small firms is also
particularly strong for industries where firms report shipping goods across long distances. This
distinguishes these results from the work of Mian and Sufi (2011a), who show that areas where
house prices increased most also exhibited an increase in unemployment in non-tradable industries
due to deleveraging and lower demand in the aftermath of 2008. Any change in output in the low
elasticity areas must therefore be driven by changes on the input (production) side. This is the
collateral lending channel.

Finally, we also rule out that the results are driven by generally loosening credit standards in areas
with quick house price growth. The concern would be that the growth of small businesses is not
caused by better access to collateral but rather by easier access to other forms of credit because of
banks’ improved balance sheet position. We show that this is not the case. If anything, banks
became increasingly more selective in credit approval in low elasticity areas leading up to 2007.

Using a similar calculation as Mian and Sufi (2011a) we calculate the approximate contribution of the
collateral lending channel to changes in overall employment in the pre-crisis period. Using this
approach the collateral channel can account for 10-25% of the increase in pre-crisis employment
(depending on the assumptions we make about the reference group that best isolates the collateral
effect), while the demand channel explains about 40% over the same time period. The two effects
are mutually non-overlapping by construction. It is important to point out that these numbers
provide rough approximations of the relative magnitudes of these two channels, but they ignore any
general equilibrium effects in aggregation.

When we consider the period after the financial crisis when house prices started to decline (2007-
2009) we find that small firms experienced weaker employment declines than large firms in areas
where the run-up in house prices was stronger in the period before the crisis. This means that
smaller firms were more resilient than larger ones in those areas, suggesting that the firms created in
the pre-period may have been good projects, in the sense that they did not immediately disappear
with the advent of the crisis. However, to answer the question of whether these firms were, indeed,
the ones that survived in the post crisis, we need more detailed (firm-level) data that would allow us
to track individual firms over time.




                                                   4
Our study builds on a large micro literature that shows that credit constraints at the household level
matter for the creation of new businesses (Evans and Jovanovic, 1989, Holtz-Eakin et al, 1994,
Gentry and Hubbard, 2004, or Cagetti and De Nardi, 2006), although some authors have argued that
this relationship is only present at the very top of the wealth distribution (Hurst and Lusardi, 2004).
At the same time, housing wealth in particular has been shown to be an important factor in the
funding of business startups (Fan and White, 2003, Fairlie and Krashinsky, 2012 and Black, de Meza
and Jeffreys, 1996 for the UK). Previous work has also found that bank credit is an important source
of financing for small businesses (Petersen and Rajan, 1994; Robb and Robinson, 2012), and that
entrepreneurs often have to provide personal guarantees when they obtain financing (Berger and
Udell, 1998).

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the data used in the paper, as well as
the empirical methodology. Section 3 discusses the results and Section 4 concludes.


    2. Data and Empirical Methodology


    2.1      Data Description



We obtain employment growth from the County Business Patterns (CBP) data set published by the
U.S. Census Bureau. The CBP contains employment data by county, industry and establishment size
(measured in number of employees) between 1998 until 2010 as of March of the reported year. We
use the data at the 4-digit National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) level, broken
down by county and establishment size to construct our main dependent variable of interest, the
employment growth by establishment size between 2002 and 2007. The breakdown of
establishments by the number of employees allows us to differentially estimate the effect of house
price growth in the net creation of establishments of different sizes. 4

We use five establishment categories in our regressions that are commonly used by the Census
Bureau – establishments of 1 to 4 employees, 5 to 9 employees, 10 to 19 employees, 20 to 49 and
4 The data only includes the number of establishments in each county, industry and year by category of employment size
(1-4 employees, 5-9, 10-19, etc.), not the total employment for each establishment category. As such, in order to
construct the employment in each bin we multiply the number of establishments by the middle point of each category.
For example, in order to get the total employment of 1-4 employee establishments in a given industry, county and year,
we multiply the number of establishments by 2.5.

                                                          5
more than 50 employees. All these categories are given by the CPB except for the last one, where we
aggregate all establishments of more than 50 employees. The CBP has multiple categories above 50
employees, but using each one individually would only add noise to our estimation, as they become
rare at the county level, and even more so at the county and industry level, which we need for some
of the specifications discussed below. In order to create the category of establishments with more
than 50 employees we take the number of establishments in each category above 50 and multiply
those by the midpoint of the category (for example, for the category of 100 to 249 employees we
multiply the number of establishments by 174.5), and then we add all of them up.

The house prices used in the regressions come from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)
House Price Index (HPI) data at a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level. The FHFA house price
index is a weighted, repeat-sales index and it measures average price changes in repeat sales or
refinancings on the same properties. This information is obtained by reviewing repeat mortgage
transactions on single-family properties whose mortgages have been purchased or securitized by
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac since January 1975. We use data on the MSA-level index between 2002
and 2007.

The use of MSA level house prices is consistent with our identification strategy. In order to identify
the casual effect of house prices on small business creation we instrument house price growth
between 2002 and 2007 with the measure of housing supply elasticity of Saiz (2010), which varies at
the MSA level. The measure of the supply elasticity is constructed using geographical and local
regulatory constraints to new construction. Areas where it is difficult to add new housing (due to
geographic or regulatory restrictions) are classified as low elasticity and vice versa for areas where
land is easily available. Low elasticity areas correlate strongly with steeper house price growth in the
period of 2002 to 2007. This measure is available for 269 metropolitan statistical areas that we match
to a total of 776 counties using the correspondence between MSAs and counties for the year 1999
provided by the Census Bureau. 5 Although employment growth and our other controls are available
for a much larger sample of counties, all our regressions focus on the subset of counties for which
we have the housing supply elasticity measure.

An important measure for our analysis is the amount of capital needed to start a firm, since these
investment requirements might affect how much a given industry depends on the housing collateral
channel. In order to construct this variable we use the Survey of Business Owners (SBO) Public Use
Microdata Sample (PUMS). The SBO PUMS was created using responses from the 2007 SBO and
provides access to survey data at a more detailed level than that of the previously published SBO
results. The SBO PUMS is designed to study entrepreneurial activity by surveying a random sample
of businesses selected from a list of all firms operating during 2007 with receipts of $1,000 or more
provided by the IRS. The survey provides business characteristics such as firm size, employer-paid
benefits, minority- and women-ownership, access to capital and firm age. For the purposes of this
paper we focus on the “Amount of start-up or acquisition capital” for each firm and we group the
answers to this question at the 2-digit NAICS industry level (the finest level available in the data) for
firms established in 2007. The classification is virtually identical if we use all years in the data or if we
focus on 1-4 employee firms only. The median amount of capital needed to start a business in the
data is 215 thousand dollars. We follow Hurst and Lusardi (2004) and split industries above and
below the median to measure the differential effect of the collateral channel on business creation for
industries in the two groups. The average amount of capital needed by firms below the median is
132 thousand dollars, whereas the average amount needed for industries above the median is 260
thousand dollars.

Our classification of “non-tradable”, “tradable” and “construction” industries at the 4-digict NAICS
level is obtained from Table 2 of the Appendix to Mian and Sufi (2011a). 6 Non-tradable codes are
mostly included in the 44 and 45 sectors (Retail Trade), as well as under 72 (Accommodation and
food services). Construction industries include most codes under the Construction 2-digit NAICS
sector (23), as well as some subsectors in manufacturing, retail trade and services that are directly
connected to construction (e.g., 3273 – Cement and Concrete Products Manufacturing).
Manufacturing industries include all 31-33 subsectors (Manufacturing), and in some specifications
we restrict the sample to manufacturing industries that are also classified as “tradable” in Mian and
Sufi (2011a) (i.e. those not in construction or in “other industries”).

As we mention above, the measure for the amount of capital used to start a business is only available
at the 2-digit NAICS level. In order to obtain a measure at a more detailed level that also captures

the external financing requirements of firms, we use the external finance dependence measure
developed by Rajan and Zingales (1998). To construct this measure, we obtain capital expenditures
and operating cash flow for all firms on Compustat for the years between 2002 and 2007 and
compute the difference between capital expenditures (capx variable) and operating cash flow (oancf
variable), and we scale that difference by the capital expenditures. We then average over all years and
over all firms in each 4-digit NAICS industry for which there are 3 or more firms in each year-
industry cell.

In order to address the concern that the results might be driven by local demand, we construct a
measure of the average distance that firms in an industry ship their goods. This data is available from
the 2007 Census Commodity Flow Survey and it reports the distance traveled by shipments of a
sample of establishments in each 3-digit NAICS manufacturing industry. 7 The unit of observation in
the Census data is at the state and industry level, so we construct a dollar-weighted average distance
of shipments also for each state and industry individually. Summary Statistics of the average distance
shipped, as well as the frequency with which each industry appears in each decile, are shown in
Table A5.

We also use data on county-level births and deaths of establishments for each 2-digit NAICS
industry between 2002 and 2010 from the Census Statistics of US Businesses (SUSB). Data on births
and deaths of establishments is provided under the “Employment Change” section of SUSB and it
does not include a breakdown by establishment size at the county and industry level, which is why
we cannot use it as our main dataset. However, given that most establishment births are of a very
small scale (Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda, 2011), we view the regressions performed on this
dataset as an important test of the mechanism in our main results. We compute the cumulative
number of births and deaths between 2002 and 2007 for each county and industry as our dependent
variable of interest and scale this number by the total number of establishments as of 2002 in the
same county-industry cell.

The net creation of sole proprietorships at a county level is obtained from two sources. We use both
the yearly local area personal income and employment data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis
(BEA), as well as the Census nonemployer statistics. From the BEA we use Non-Farm
Proprietorship employment at a county level between 2002 and 2007 to estimate the growth of sole

7The year 2007 is the first year in which the data is reported at the 3-digit NAICS level (previous years included only
commodity identifiers rather than industry data).

                                                             8
proprietorships in this period. From the Census we obtain the number of establishments for the
period of 2002 to 2007 at the 2-digit NAICS level. We use both sources of data in the regressions to
ensure the robustness of our results.

Unemployment and unemployment rate at the county level are obtained using the Bureau of Labor
Statistics Local Area estimates. Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) are available for
approximately 7,300 areas that range from Census regions and divisions to counties and county
equivalent and this data is available between 1976 and 2012. We match the county equivalent data to
the CBP data using Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) county unique identifiers.

The migrations data is extracted from the IRS county to county migration data series. The migration
estimates are based on year-to-year address changes reported on individual income tax returns filed
with the IRS. The dataset presents migration patterns by county for the entire United States and is
split by inflows – the number of new residents who moved to a county and where they migrated
from – and outflows – the number of residents leaving a county and where they went. 8 We also
compute net flows as inflows minus outflows and we scale all figures by the number of non-movers
in the county. The data is available from 1991 through 2009 filling years.

To better identify the effect of house prices on self-employment we include a set of controls that
capture some of the cross-sectional differences across counties. We use county level information
from the Census Bureau Summary Files for 2000 on: the number of households in a county; the
natural logarithm of county-level population; the percentage of college educated individuals defined
as the number of people over 25 with a bachelor degree or higher as a proportion of the total
population over 25 years old; the percentage of employed people, defined as the employed
population over the total population 16 years old or older; the share of the population in the
workforce, defined as the total population in the civilian labor force over 16 year old divided by the
total population 16 years old or older; the percentage of owner occupied houses; and a measure of
exposure of each county to imports from china 9, and therefore, better control for changes in
investment opportunities in those counties



8 The data used to produce migration data products come from individual income tax returns filed prior to late
September of each calendar year and represent between 95 and 98 percent of total annual filings.
9
  We construct the measure of competition from imports from China by multiplying the fraction of employment in each
county and in each industry by the share of imported goods from China as a fraction of total domestic shipments in the
industry in the United States. The variation is virtually the same if we instead use the growth in the weight of imports for

                                                             9
         2.2.     Summary Statistics



Panel A of Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for our data set: The first row shows total
employment in 2002 for all counties in our sample, as well as the employment growth between 2002
and 2007 estimated from the CBP data. Our data includes a total of 775 counties with non-missing
total employment data. Employment in all counties in our data grew by an average of 10.6 percent
during the sample period, with the unemployment rate dropping by 0.9 percentage points. We also
split the sample into counties above and below the median of the housing supply elasticity measure.
We see that counties with low supply elasticity are larger but have similar unemployment rates as
those with high supply elasticity. The growth in total employment is somewhat lower in counties
with high supply elasticity, and we discuss this fact in more detail when we discuss the regressions
involving total employment and unemployment at the county level. As expected, counties with low
elasticity of housing supply experienced much stronger growth in house prices than did counties
with high elasticity of supply, and similarly experienced a much larger increase in average debt-to-
income ratio (consistent with Mian and Sufi, 2011a).

Panel B of Table 1 shows how employment is distributed across the different employment-size
categories. The biggest firm category, 50 employees or more, accounts for 51.7% of the total
employment in 2002, whereas the smallest category, 1-4 employees, accounts for 8.9% of the total
employed population. Growth in employment is stronger among larger companies in the 2002-2007
period, and especially so among the industries that we classify as having low start-up capital needs.


         2.3.     Empirical Model



This paper aims to test whether increases in real estate prices affect the growth in employment by
facilitating the creation of small businesses (collateral channel). To differentiate the collateral channel
from a pure (expansionary) demand shock, we look at the differential effect of house prices on the
net creation of establishments in different size categories. 10 Our identification relies on the idea that


each industry as a fraction of US domestic shipments between 1998 and 2005. The import data at the industry level is
obtained from Peter K. Schott’ website: http://faculty.som.yale.edu/peterschott/sub_international.htm
10 As we discuss in the data section, our data does not include changes in employment within establishments (i.e. along

the intensive margin), so our measure of changes in employment relies on multiplying the number of establishments in

                                                          10
improved availability of collateral in the form of higher house prices can positively affect the
creation of small businesses, while it is likely to have no effect on the creation of larger
establishments since these firms cannot be started with capital that can be extracted from a house.

We measure the availability of collateral to small business entrepreneurs by the growth in house
prices in the area where the establishment is located. However, it is challenging to establish a causal
link from the availability of collateral to the creation of small businesses, since there are many
omitted variables that could simultaneously affect both the value of real estate collateral and the
demand faced by small businesses, for example changes in household income in the area or
improvements in investment opportunities. In order to overcome this difficulty, we instrument for
the changes in house prices during the period of interest for our study (2002-2007) using the
elasticity of housing supply at the metropolitan statistical area, which was developed by Saiz (2010).
Our identification relies on the assumption that the elasticity of housing supply only impacts
employment creation at establishments of different sizes through its effect on house prices. The
exclusion restriction will be violated if housing supply elasticity is correlated with employment or
business creation for reasons other than house price growth. Similar approaches have been used
extensively in the recent literature – see, for example, Mian and Sufi (2011a, 2011b), Charles, Hurst
and Notowidigdo (2012); Robb and Robinson (2012).

We rely on two basic regression specifications for our analysis. The first specification aggregates data
up to the level at which our instrument varies, i.e. at the county-year-establishment size– level. Each
individual observation is the change between 2002 and 2007 of employees in a given county, year
and establishment size. Therefore we add up the number of employees in all industries in each
establishment category and take the growth in total number of employees as the dependent variable.
We then run two-stage least squares regressions of the type:

         Δ02−07 𝐸𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑦𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑗 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 Δ𝐻𝑃𝑗02−07 + 𝛽2 1𝑖 + 𝛽3 1𝑖 Δ𝐻𝑃𝑗02−07 + 𝛾𝑋𝑗 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗

We index counties by j and establishment size categories by i. Δ02−07 𝐸𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑦𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖,𝑗 is the change
in employment for establishment size category i in county j between 2002 and 2007. Similarly,
Δ𝐻𝑃𝑗02−07 is the growth in house prices at the county level for the same time period where, as we
discuss above, we instrument for the growth in house prices using the housing supply elasticity of

each size category by the midpoint of the number of employees in each bin. It is thus equivalent to interpret our results
in terms of number of employees or number of establishments.

                                                            11
Saiz (2010). 1𝐶𝑎𝑡 is a set of dummy variables for each of the four included establishment categories
(we omit the largest category of more than 50 employees). We then also include the product of the
establishment size dummies and the growth in house prices, and 𝛽3 is the coefficient of interest in
our regressions. In particular, the test we are interested in is whether the coefficient for the smallest
establishments is larger (and positive) than those of the larger categories, which would confirm that
house prices had a stronger impact on the creation of small establishments. 𝑋𝑗 is a set of county
level controls that include the size of the county, the percentage of the population with a bachelor
degree or higher, the percentage of the population that is employed, the percentage of the
population in the labor force, the percentage of owner occupied houses, and the county share of
china imports. Standard errors in this specification are heteroskedasticity robust and clustered at the
MSA level (given that the variation in the instrument we use is at this level as well) and all
regressions are weighted by the number of households in a county as of 2000 as in Mian and Sufi
(2011a).

The second specification disaggregates observations to the county, year, establishment size and 4-
digit NAICS level, yielding a much larger number of observations than the specification above (as
each county now appears multiple times for each industry). When using this disaggregated data we
can include industry fixed effects in the regression, which allows us to control even further for
common shocks (namely nationwide demand shocks) to each 4-digit industry. The coefficients in
this case represent the differential impact that house prices have on establishments of different sizes
within each industry. The specification becomes:

    Δ02−07 𝐸𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑦𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑗𝑧 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 Δ𝐻𝑃𝑗02−07 + 𝛽2 1𝑖 + 𝛽3 1𝑖 Δ𝐻𝑃𝑗02−07 + 𝛾𝑋𝑗 + 1𝑧 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑗

Where z indexes the industries and 1𝑧 is a set of indicator variables for each industry.

The breakdown at the industry level allows us to address an important alternative hypothesis to the
mechanism we identify, namely that higher house prices caused increased demand which then
prompted the growth in new businesses. This type of demand story (as opposed to the collateral
channel) comes in two versions: On the one hand one could argue that rising house prices lead to an
increase in demand since households feel richer or have access to home equity. This channel is
proposed in Mian and Sufi (2011a) to explain the drop in employment during the Great Recession
of 2007-2009. A second version of the demand hypothesis is that increasing house prices may


                                                   12
benefit certain industries more than others and that these industries happen to be made up of
smaller establishments on average (i.e., a “composition” effect).

We address these alternative demand hypotheses in a few different ways. First, by holding constant
industry fixed effects we identify how employment in the smallest establishments reacts differently
from that of large establishments within each 4-digit NAICS industry. This addresses the
composition effect described above. Second, as we have argued before, a pure local demand story
should affect establishments of all sizes similarly while the credit collateral channel is relevant mainly
for small business. There is, however, still the possibility that smaller firms are more sensitive to
local demand shocks than large firms. In order to see if this effect could explain our results we
exclude the most obvious candidate industries that might directly benefit from local demand shocks
due to higher house prices, namely those linked to construction and firms in the non-tradable sector
as classified in Mian and Sufi (2011a) and we also repeat our tests only for manufacturing firms,
those that should be least affected by local demand shocks.




    3. Empirical Results


        3.1.    House Prices and Employment at Small Establishments



Our central hypothesis is that the availability of more valuable collateral (in our case through
increased real estate prices) in the period before the financial crisis has an effect on the creation of
small firms or on self-employment, since it provided individuals with easier access to startup capital.
As a result we should see a sharper increase in self-employment and employment in small businesses
in areas that had steeper house price appreciation. We also expect this effect to be concentrated in
firms in the smaller size categories, since large firms cannot finance themselves using home equity.
This hypothesis is tested in Table 2, where we run two-stage least squares regressions of the growth
in employment between 2002 and 2007 on 5 different establishment size categories, and their
interaction with house price growth in the same period. The instrument for house price growth, as
we discuss above, is the Saiz (2010) measure of housing supply elasticity. In the first column of
Table 2 we show the first stage regression of house price growth on the Saiz measure of housing

                                                   13
supply elasticity to confirm the validity of the instrument. The coefficient of -0.09 means that a one
standard deviation increase in elasticity of housing supply is associated with an 11.7 percentage point
lower growth in prices (for an average house price growth of 33.9 percent). The F statistic on this
regression is 14.5 (above the conventional threshold of 10 for evaluating weak instruments). This
reflects that metropolitan statistical areas with higher elasticity of supply experienced significantly
lower house price growth between 2002 and 2007, in line with previous literature. In column (2) we
run a regression of employment change between 2002 and 2007 on the change in house prices
during the same time period. In this regression we do not instrument the change in house prices in
order to show the raw correlation between house prices and employment. The effect is positive and
economically large. A one standard deviation increase in house prices is associated with an increase
in total employment of 3.95 percent over this period, for an average growth in employment of 10.6
percent. In the simple weighted least squares regression we see no distinction between the effect of
house prices on small and large establishments. This result highlights the need for an instrument for
our dependent variable of interest given the numerous factors that are likely to drive both
employment creation and house prices (income growth, investment opportunities, etc.).

In column (3) of Table 2 we repeat the same regression but instrument the change in house prices
with the Saiz measure for the elasticity of housing supply. We see that there is a positive but not
significant causal relationship between county level employment change and house price growth on
average, in contrast to the results in the previous column. However, when we look at the differential
effect of instrumented house price changes, the increase in house prices has a significant and large
positive effect on the small establishments but no significant effect on employment growth for big
establishments (more than 50 employees). In fact, the coefficient on the interaction term between
house price growth and the 1-4 employee size category shows that a 1 percentage point increase in
house prices translates into a 0.19 percentage point increase in employment at these establishments
relative to the largest ones. This translates into an increase in employment of 5.3 percentage points
for a one standard deviation change in house prices, for an average change in employment at the
smallest establishments of 9.4 percent (the effects of a one standard deviation change in house
prices for each size category are shown in the appendix Table A3). Furthermore, the effect of
collateral is monotonically decreasing with the size of the firm. For firms with more than 10
employees the effect is indistinguishable from that of the very largest firms. This is consistent with
the collateral channel of house price appreciation being an important mechanism for small firm


                                                  14
creation, since the amount of collateral that is provided by real estate appreciation is not be enough
to start a larger firm. Also, these results suggest that the causal impact of house prices on
employment growth during 2002 to 2007 did not work through increased demand, since in that case
firms of all sizes (including the very large) should have been affected.

One concern with the above specification could be that the house prices change in areas with low
Saiz housing elasticity induces a local demand shock that especially affects certain industries. If those
industries are also, on average, disproportionately made up of smaller establishments, the result
above might reflect a composition effect, rather than the collateral channel as we suggest. While it
would need a number of factors to line up in a very specific way, we cannot rule it out on face value
with the specifications in Table 2. In order to eliminate the alternative hypothesis about industry
composition, we now use our more disaggregated data, which provides data at the county, 4-digit
NAICS and establishment size level. This allows us to hold industry fixed effects constant and test
whether, conditional on an industry, the growth of small establishments is significantly stronger than
that of large establishments in counties where house prices grew more. Intuitively, this specification
asks whether within an industry the fraction of employment generated by small firms grows more
quickly than that of large firms. This way we can confirm that the results are not a consequence of
changing industry composition. The results for this specification are shown in column 4 of Table 2.
Parallel to before, we find that impact of house price changes (instrumented with the Saiz measure)
is stronger for establishments with 1-4 employees when compared to the bigger firm categories. We
again find that the effect is monotonically decreasing and not statistically significant beyond firms
with 10 employees.

In order to confirm that the effect we estimated runs through the collateral channel, we test whether
our estimated effect is stronger in industries that have lower start-up capital needs. We expect this to
be the case given that the median total amount of home debt at its peak in 2006 for all US
households was approximately 117 thousand dollars (Mian and Sufi, 2011b) and that only a fraction
of this amount would be available for use in starting a business. Also, Adelino, Schoar and Severino
(2012) show that the average value of a single family home during this period is approximately 309
thousand dollars and that most families obtain an 80 percent LTV loan. Even accounting for the
fact that most entrepreneurs are over 35 years old, and that almost half are over 45 (Robb and
Robinson, 2012), and so we expect them to have built home equity relative to the initial 80 percent
LTV, it is not plausible to finance a very large amount of capital using home equity as collateral.

                                                   15
We split our sample of industries at the median amount of capital needed to start a firm to explore
this source of variation. As we describe in Section 2, we obtain this information from the Census
Survey of Business Owner Public Microdata Survey by selecting the sample of new firms in each
industry and averaging the amount of capital needed to start those firms.

We show the results split by the amount of start-up capital needed in each industry in columns 5
through 8 of Table 2. The results show that the effect of collateral on employment growth in small
establishments is stronger for industries where the amount of capital needed to start a firm is lower
(the average amount of start-up capital for industries below the median is approximately 132
thousand dollars). In fact, for this subset of industries the effect is statistically significantly different
from that of the largest group even for establishments up to 49 employees, i.e. the causal effect of
house prices extends to establishments other than the very smallest. When we include industry fixed
effects only the coefficient on the smallest establishments is statistically different from zero. For the
group of industries that require more start-up capital the effect of house prices on employment is
smaller and only statistically significant for the very smallest group both with and without fixed
effects. These results confirm that job creation at small businesses in response to house prices
changes is strongest in industries with low startup capital needs that can reasonably be financed
through loans on home equity.

In addition, we also document that our results are not driven by certain industries, in particular not
by construction or non-tradable industries. One might be concerned that the increase in house
prices led to an increase in demand for construction services or for local services (e.g. local retail or
restaurants) and thus new firms got started in these industries because that (e.g. more remodeling
and new housing construction, more dry-cleaners, etc.). This would be a consequence of increased
demand rather than an effect through the collateral channel. We re-run our main specifications
excluding all industries linked to either construction or the non-tradable industries as classified by
Mian and Sufi (2011a) and the direction and magnitude of the effects are virtually unchanged. We
also run our regressions only for the manufacturing sector given that these are the industries that
should be least affected by local demand. We report these results in Table 3. This confirms that a
simple demand side story is not driving our results and thus confirms the importance of the
collateral channel for the creation of smaller establishments in the period between 2002 and 2007.




                                                     16
In Table 4 we perform two additional tests only for the sample of manufacturing industries. In these
tests we split industries based on their needs for external finance, as well as the average distance of
shipments in each 3-digit NAICS industry. Similarly to when we consider the amount of start-up
capital needed in an industry, we expect the collateral effect to matter more in industries that have
low external financing needs, as those are much more likely to be met by using housing as collateral.
The advantage of this measure is that it is at a 4-digit NAICS industry level, which allows us to split
manufacturing industries into those that are above and those that are below the median dependence
on external finance using Compustat. The first two columns of Table 4 confirm that our result is
driven only by industries that have below median needs of external finance. When we consider the
distance at which industries ship their goods, the last 4 columns of Table 4 show that our result is
driven exclusively by industries that typically ship goods across large distances. This further mitigates
the concern that our results reflect local demand and instead points to the collateral channel we
emphasize.


         3.1.1. Magnitude of the Collateral Effect Relative to Previous Work

One way to give a rough estimate of the importance of the collateral channel is to compare the
magnitude of the employment gains that can be attributed to this channel to those that can be
assigned to the demand channel shown in Mian and Sufi (2011a). To do so, we follow the same
calculation used in that paper to aggregate the effect across all counties. The authors compute the
effect of debt-to-income (DTI) ratios as of the beginning of the crisis on the employment change
between 2007 and 2009 in non-tradable industries. 11 These are the industries that are most likely to
be affected by a drop in local demand due to over-levered households. They aggregate this effect by
computing the predicted change in employment in non-tradable industries and then extrapolating
this effect to the rest of the economy. 12



11 Using county-level debt-to-income ratio or the run-up in house prices between 2002 and 2007 as the independent

variable (as we do in this paper) yields virtually the same results, as counties with high debt-to-income by the end of this
period are also the ones that experienced large increases in home values.
12 This is done in four steps. First, the authors compute the county-level predicted change in employment in non-

tradable industries by multiplying the regression coefficient by the independent variable in each county (in this case the
DTI) and subtracting the predicted change in the 10th percentile county (to avoid being affected by outliers at the
bottom of the distribution).12 Second, they multiply the predicted county-level change by the non-tradable employment
in the county as of the beginning of the period to obtain a predicted change in employment in terms of numbers of
workers for each county. Third, the authors sum up the predicted changes across all counties, to obtain an economy-
wide predicted change in the non-tradable sector (in their case, a total of 769 thousand jobs). Fourth and finally, they

                                                             17
We perform essentially the same calculations for the period of 2002-2007 to establish a benchmark
employment effect that can be attributed to the demand channel. We start by obtaining the effect of
a change in house prices on employment in the non-tradable industries at a county level for the
2002-2007 period. That regression is shown in Table A6 in column 3. If we aggregate in the same
way as described above (where now the baseline employment is as of 2002) we obtain an increase in
employment in the non-tradable sector of 451.8 thousand jobs which, given a share of employment
in this sector of 18.4% as of 2002, translates into a predicted total job gain due to increased
aggregate demand of 2.452 million jobs. This is about 40 percent of the jobs created in the private
sector in the 660 counties used for the calculation.

We now turn to the calculation of the magnitude of the collateral channel over the same time period.
Here we rely on the differential impact of house prices on employment creation at small firms relative
to firms with more than 50 employees and we focus on the specifications where we exclude non-
tradable industries and construction. (Table 3, column 2). We again first compute predicted county-
level employment gains for these industries (relative to the 10th percentile county) and then we
aggregate to all counties. When we do that, we obtain an estimated total job gain in firms with less
than 50 employees relative to those with more than 50 employees of 1.698 million jobs in all
counties, or 27.8 percent of jobs created between 2002 and 2007 in this period. If we restrict our
attention to the specification where the demand explanation for our results is the least plausible, i.e.
the manufacturing sector and, in particular, firms in industries and states where the shipment
distance is largest (column 6 of Table 4), the same computation would yield an estimate of 676
thousand jobs, or about 11 percent of the total of jobs created in this period and subset of counties.

The magnitude we estimate above is a lower bound for the total importance of collateral for job
creation for a couple of reasons. First, our data does not allow us to track firms over time, so if a
firm grows to become very large we do not attribute the employment creation of that firm to our
effect (it would be in the 50+ category that we use as our baseline). Second, we are focusing on the
importance of this channel for very small firms. This ignores the role that collateral value plays for
larger firms, as pointed out in Chaney, Sraer and Thesmar (2012) and Cvijanovic (2012).




divide this number by the share of total employment in the economy represented by the non-tradable sector (19.6%),
which then yields a total predicted loss in employment due to the aggregate demand shock of approximately 6 million
jobs.

                                                         18
Finally, we should point out that this exercise is useful as a comparison to previous work and not as
a proper calibration of the importance of the collateral effect for the whole economy. In extending
the effect that we observe for a subset of firms and industries in individual counties to the whole
economy, we ignore general equilibrium effects that could potentially be important.




        3.2.    Births and Deaths of Establishments

Our measure of growth of establishments by size category does not allow us to directly observe the
creation and destruction of establishments, as all we can measure is the change in the number of
establishments in each category as of March of each year. In a separate set of regressions shown in
Table 5 we use the Statistics of US Businesses from the Census to look at births and deaths of
establishments at the 2-digit NAICS industry level. The disadvantage of this dataset is that it does
not include the breakdown of establishments by their employment size, but it does help us to check
that our result holds when we consider births of all establishments. Given that an overwhelming
percentage of new businesses are very small businesses (Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda, 2011;
Robb and Robinson, 2012), this robustness test directly speaks to the validity of our main results.

We find that births of establishments are very strongly affected by increasing house prices
instrumented with the elasticity of housing supply. The result holds when we consider the net
creation of establishments (i.e. births minus deaths) and the coefficient is unchanged when we
include 2 digit NAICS fixed effects (which is the finest industry category available in this dataset at a
county level). A one standard deviation increase in house prices is associated with a nine percentage
point increase in the number of births of establishments (between 2002 and 2007) as a percentage of
the number of establishments as of 2002 (or about ten percent of the average cumulative number of
births of establishments as a percentage of total 2002 establishments). The effect is stronger for
industries with below median capital needs, although that difference disappears when we include
NAICS fixed effects.

        3.3.    Sole Proprietorships

We now expand our analysis to include the creation of businesses without employees, also called
sole proprietorships or nonemployer businesses. Table 6 shows the effect of house price growth on
net creation of proprietorships relative to all the establishment categories that we have in the

                                                   19
previous tables using the Saiz measure to instrument for exogenous movements in house price
changes. The first column in this table uses employment data on sole proprietorships from the
Bureau of Economic Analysis, while the last three columns rely on data on nonemployer
establishments from the Census (which includes information on the 2 digit NAICS sector in which
the establishment operates). The coefficient on house price growth in Column (1) interacted with
the sole proprietorship category is significantly different from that on the largest establishments and
close in magnitude to that on the 1-4 employee category. In Column (2) we use data from the
Census and find a smaller coefficient on the sole proprietorships and we cannot distinguish that
coefficient from the others in the regression.

In the last two columns we again split the sample by the amount of capital that is needed to start a
business in a given industry as discussed above. We find that the effect of house prices on the net
creation of sole proprietorships is stronger in industries with low start-up capital needs, which is in
line with our findings for the other size categories. We should note, however, that the difference
between the coefficients in the two specifications (below and above median capital needs) is not
statistically significant.


         3.4.     Crisis Period (2007-2009)



One question that remains regarding the establishments that were created as a consequence of the
increasing value of collateral during the run-up in house prices is whether these establishments were
then eliminated once the housing bubble burst. The question is whether these were particularly
fragile firms that were disproportionately affected by the crisis or whether, on the other hand, they
were not of different quality relative to the rest of the firms in the economy.

Given the data we currently have we cannot give a definite answer to this question. The problem is
that we are not able to track individual establishments, which means we cannot know if the specific
firms that were created in the 2002-2007 period survived the crisis or not. We can, however, test
whether small establishments in general were more or less likely to downsize or disappear in the
crisis. Put differently, we can assess whether employment loss was stronger at larger or smaller firms
during the crisis in counties where the increase in house prices had been stronger in the pre-period



                                                   20
(which are also the most levered counties as shown in Mian and Sufi, 2011a). We run those
regressions in Table 7.

The results show that employment loss was similar across large and small establishments or, if
anything, it seems to have been worse at large firms (in the specifications without industry fixed
effects) in counties where house prices went up more. This suggests that, at least as a group, small
firms were no more likely to destroy jobs as a consequence of the increased leverage accumulated
during the pre-crisis period. This is consistent with the findings of Mian and Sufi (2011a) regarding
the non-tradable industries for this period.

In Appendix Table A5 we also show that the effect of house price growth in the period before the
crisis is similar for proprietorships as it is for 1-4 employee establishments, which suggests that the
result is not being driven solely by firms shrinking and transferring across the bins in our analysis
(for example, 10-19 employee establishments becoming smaller and appearing as 5-9 employee
establishments). Given that proprietorships are a different form of business entity altogether, it is
very unlikely that 1-4 employee firms are falling into the proprietorship category during this period.


        3.5.    Total Employment and Migration



We finally want to consider the effect of house price changes on total employment as measured in
the County Business Pattern (CBP). Columns (1) and (2) of Table 8 show county level regressions of
change in Total Employment on house prices changes instrumented with the Saiz measure. Column
(2) includes a number of county level controls such as population size, average educational
attainment, and unemployment rate in the pre-period. We find that house price growth had no
causal effect on total employment: the coefficient on house price changes is close to zero and
insignificant in either of the specifications. In contrast, when we repeat the same regression set up
using the level of unemployment as the dependent variable in Columns (3) and (4) of Table 7, we
find a significant and negative relationship both with and without controls. Finally, in Columns (5)
and (6) we show that house price changes also had a negative impact on the unemployment rate;,
consistent with the results of Charles, Hurst and Notowidigdo (2012). How can the negative effect
on unemployment be reconciled with no changes in total employment? Our results suggest that the
decrease in unemployment captures the transition of some agents in the labor force from being job


                                                  21
seekers to a self-employment status. However, these people are not observed in the total
employment measure, since the CBP data does not include non-employee firms (sole
proprietorships).

Finally we also look at the net migration of people in and out of the county. We measure net
migration as the difference between inflows and outflows at the county level. We repeat the same
regression set up in Column (7) and (8) to estimate the effect of house appreciation on county to
county migration and find that higher house prices caused a net out-migration from the counties
with high house price appreciation. In unreported regressions we confirm that this was produced by
larger outflows than inflows into those counties. This evidence is consistent with the idea that house
prices affected the composition of households in each county and, therefore, indirectly affected the
labor market dynamics.


        3.6.    Credit Conditions and Elasticity of Housing Supply



One possible concern with the instrument we use is that the behavior of lenders in high and low
elasticity areas during our time frame was different. Specifically, if it became easier to obtain credit in
low elasticity areas relative to high elasticity areas during our sample period for reasons unrelated to
collateral availability, and if this drove the creation of new businesses, this would violate the
exclusion restriction for our instrument. One mechanism for such an effect would be that banks
might become laxer on all their credit decisions because of the improvement on the quality of their
mortgage portfolio due to higher house prices. While it is not obvious why this should necessarily
affect small business credit provision, we want to address this concern directly.

To test whether such an effect is plausible, we use data on denial rates of mortgage applications
from HMDA. The underlying assumption is that the cross-sectional variation on the looseness of
credit conditions should be positively correlated with the same variation for mortgage credit,
especially given that the reason why credit might have become laxer is the fact that house prices
increased.

We consider the number of applications that are denied by financial institutions as a proportion of
the total loan applications in a county and in a year. 13 Using the yearly estimates we compute the
proportional change in denial rates between 2002 and 2007. We focus on loans used for purchasing
homes as they are less sensitive to the issue of relationship lending and/or private lender
information about the borrower, and therefore should better reflect the loosening of credit
conditions.

Panel A of Table 9 shows that credit conditions tightened rather than loosened in low elasticity areas
(those below median elasticity in the sample) when we use this measure of credit supply. Denial rates
increased by about 2 percentage points in counties with low elasticity of housing supply, whereas
they go down in high elasticity areas by one percentage points, i.e. credit loosened in those areas.
The difference between the two types of counties is statistically significant at the one percent level.
Additionally, total volume of applications decreases by one percent in low elasticity areas in
comparison to the 10 percent increase in the high elasticity areas.

We formally test these differences in a regression framework using a continuous elasticity measure as
our independent variable. Panel B of Table 9 shows the results of those regressions. Consistent with
the summary statistics of Panel A, we find that lower elasticity if associated with higher denial rates
of loan applications and these results are robust to different specification and controls.

Overall, this result allows us to rule out the concern that our instrument is picking up changes in the
way that lenders granted credit instead of access to credit through an increase in collateral values.


     4. Conclusion



Overall, the evidence we present in this paper identifies the causal effect house prices in the creation
of new small firms. These results show that access to collateral allowed individuals to start small
businesses or to become self-employed. We conjecture that without access to this collateral in the
form of real estate assets, many individuals would not have made the transition from unemployment
to starting a new business or self-employment.



13Volume of applications is calculated as the sum of all loans that are originated plus applications that are approved but
not accepted, applications denied by the financial institution and loans purchased by the financial institution itself.

We show that the effect of house prices is concentrated in small firms only and had no causal effect
on employment at large firms. Importantly, our results also hold when we exclude industries that are
most likely to be affected by local demand shocks and when we restrict our attention to
manufacturing industries. The effect of house prices is also stronger in industries where the amount
of capital needed to start a new firm is lower, consistent with the hypothesis that housing serves as
collateral but is not sufficient to fund large capital needs.

Table 1. Summary Statistics
Panel A reports summary statistics for all counties in the sample in Column 1, and Columns 2 and 3 show the summary statistics for counties above
and below the median elasticity of housing supply in the sample. For each variable we show the pooled average, median (italicized) and standard
deviation (in parenthesis). Total Employment refers to the total number of employees in a county in thousands across all establishment sizes and
industries using the County Business Patterns data as of 2002. Unemployment Rate is shown in percentage and comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
Local Area statistics in 2002. Number of Households, in thousands, comes from the Census Bureau in 2000. Growth of Total Employment is the percentage
change of Total Employment between 2002 and 2007. Growth in DTI is the percentage change in debt to income ratio between 2002 and 2007 and Growth
in Income is the percentage change in income in a county during the same period. The debt to income ratio is estimated using county level household
debt data from the New York Fed-Equifax and income is computed using IRS county-level information. Growth in House Prices is the percentage change
in house prices between 2002 and 2007at the MSA level from the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Finally, Change in Unemployment Rate, is the change
in the rate between 2002 and 2007. Panel B shows the Total Employment in 2002 in thousands, Employment Growth between 2002 and 2007 in
percentage points, and the percentage of Total Employment for each establishment size for all firms, as well as split by the start-up amount of capital
needed to start a firm.

Table 2. Employment Growth, Firm Size and House Price Appreciation
The table shows two-stage least squares regressions of employment growth on house price growth instrumented with the elasticity of housing supply, indicator variables for each establishment size (not shown
in the table) and interactions of house price growth with the size of establishments. All regressions are weighted by the number of households in a county as of 2000. Employment growth is the percentage
change in employment between 2002 and 2007 estimated using County Business Patterns (CBP) data. Growth in House prices is the percentage change between 2002 and 2007, and each interaction is with a
dummy indicator for the size of the establishment. Column 1 shows the first stage regression of the change in house prices between 2002 and 2007 on the Saiz elasticity measure. Columns 2 through 4 “All
Industries” shows the results for the whole sample of firms, first the weighted least squares results, then the IV at a county level and, finally, the IV results at a county and industry level. Columns 4 through 8
show the coefficients split by the start-up capital amount (above and below the median) also at the county and at the county and industry levels. The omitted category refers to establishments with 50 or more
employees. All regressions control for the natural logarithm of population, the percentage of the population with a college degree, the percentage of the labor force that is employed, the share of the population
in the workforce, and the percentage of homes that are owner-occupied. Columns 4, 6 and 8 include 4-digit NAICS fixed effects. Controls are at a county level for the year 2000 and are obtained using Census
Bureau Data Summary Files. Standard errors are in parenthesis and are clustered by MSA. *, **, *** indicate statistical significance at 10, 5, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 3. Employment Growth and House Prices: Excluding Non-Tradable Industries and
Considering Manufacturing Only
The table shows two-stage least squares regressions of employment growth on house price growth instrumented with the elasticity of housing supply,
indicator variables for each establishment size (not shown in the table) and interactions of house price growth with the size of establishments. Each
observation is at a county, 4-digit NAICS industry, and establishment size level. All regressions are weighted by the number of households in a county
as of 2000. House Price Growth is instrumented using the Saiz (2010) measure of elasticity of housing supply at an MSA level. Employment growth is
the percentage change in employment between 2002 and 2007 estimated using County Business Patterns (CBP) data. Growth in House prices is the
percentage change between 2002 and 2007, and each interaction is with a dummy indicator for the size of the establishment. All regressions include 4-
digit industry fixed effects. Column 1 shows the results when we exclude construction industries, column 2 excludes both construction and non-
tradable industries, column 3 includes only manufacturing industries (NAICS 31-33) and column 4 has manufacturing industries that are classified as
“tradable” in Mian and Sufi (2011a). All regressions control for the natural logarithm of population, the percentage of the population with a college
degree, the percentage of the labor force that is employed, the share of the population in the workforce, and the percentage of homes that are owner-
occupied. All controls are at a county level for the year 2000 and are obtained using Census Bureau Data Summary Files. Standard errors are in
parenthesis and are clustered by MSA. *, **, *** denote statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 4. Breakdown of Manufacturing Industries by External Finance Dependence and Distance
Shipped
The table shows two-stage least squares regressions of employment growth on house price growth instrumented with the elasticity of housing supply,
indicator variables for each establishment size (not shown in the table) and interactions of house price growth with the size of establishments. Each
observation is at a county, 4-digit NAICS industry, and establishment size level. All regressions are weighted by the number of households in a county
as of 2000. House Price Growth is instrumented using the Saiz (2010) measure of elasticity of housing supply at an MSA level. Employment growth is
the percentage change in employment between 2002 and 2007 estimated using County Business Patterns (CBP) data for manufacturing industries
(NAICS codes 31-33). Growth in House prices is the percentage change between 2002 and 2007, and each interaction is with a dummy indicator for
the size of the establishment. All regressions include 4-digit NAICS fixed effects. Columns 1 and 2 split manufacturing industries into Low and High
Dependence on External Finance as defined in Rajan and Zingales (1998) and Becker (2007). This measure is given by the average difference (for each
4-digit NAICS industry) between each firm’s capital expenditures and its operating cash flow, scaled by capital expenditures. Data for distance shipped
is from the Census Commodity Flow Survey for 2007 and represents a dollar-weighted average of shipment distance calculated at the 3-digit NAICS
and state of origin level. The third and fourth columns split industries and states based on the 30th percentile of the shipment distance distribution,
whereas the last two columns split the sample at the median distance (about 600 miles). All regressions control for the natural logarithm of population,
the percentage of the population with a college degree, the percentage of the labor force that is employed, the share of the population in the
workforce, and the percentage of homes that are owner-occupied. All controls are at a county level for the year 2000 and are obtained using Census
Bureau Data Summary Files. Standard errors are in parenthesis and are clustered by MSA. *, **, *** denote statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1%
levels, respectively.

Table 5. House Price Growth and Creation of Establishments
The table shows two-stage least squares regressions of establishment births and deaths on house price growth instrumented with the elasticity of housing supply. Each observation is at a county level for the
regressions without sector fixed effects (odd numbered columns) and at a county and 2-digit NAICS industry level whenever we include fixed effects (even numbered columns). All regressions are weighted by
the number of households in a county as of 2000. House Price Growth is instrumented using the Saiz (2010) measure of elasticity of housing supply at an MSA level. Births and deaths of establishments come
from the Census Statistics of US Businesses and are summed between 2002 and 2007 and scaled by the number of establishments in a county as of 2002. Growth in House prices is the percentage change
between 2002 and 2007, and each interaction is with a dummy indicator for the size of the establishment. Columns 1 and 2 shows the results for births of establishments, columns 3 and 4 show results for
disappearance of establishments and columns 5 and 6 use the net creation of establishments as the dependent variable. The final four columns split the sample by the amount of capital necessary for starting a
business and show results for establishment births. All regressions control for the natural logarithm of population, the percentage of the population with a college degree, the percentage of the labor force that
is employed, the share of the population in the workforce, and the percentage of homes that are owner-occupied. All controls are at a county level for the year 2000 and are obtained using Census Bureau Data
Summary Files. Standard errors are in parenthesis and are clustered by MSA. *, **, *** denote statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 6. Proprietorships and House Price Appreciation
The table shows two-stage least squares regressions at a county level of employment growth on house price growth, indicator variables for each
establishment size (not shown in the table) and interactions of house price growth with the size of establishments. Proprietorships are establishments
with zero employees. Each observation is at a county and establishment size level. All regressions are weighted by the number of households in a
county as of 2000. House Price Growth is instrumented using the Saiz (2010) measure of elasticity of housing supply at an MSA level. Employment
growth is the percentage change in employment between 2002 and 2007 estimated using County Business Patterns (CBP) data except in the case of
proprietorships. The data on growth in proprietorships is obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the first column and from the Census in
columns 2 through 4. All regressions control for the natural logarithm of population, the percentage of the population with a college degree, the
percentage of the labor force that is employed, the share of the population in the workforce, and the percentage of homes that are owner-occupied. All
controls are at a county level for the year 2000 and are obtained using Census Bureau Data Summary Files. Standard errors are in parenthesis and are
clustered by MSA. *, **, *** denote statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 7. Employment Growth, Firm Size and House Price Appreciation, Crisis Period (2007-2009)
The table shows two-stage least squares regressions of employment growth between 2007 and 2009 on house price growth for the previous 5 years
(2002-2007), indicator variables for each establishment size (not shown in the table) and interactions of house price growth with the size of
establishments. All regressions are weighted by the number of households in a county as of 2000. House Price Growth is instrumented using the Saiz
(2010) measure of elasticity of housing supply at an MSA level. Employment growth is the percentage change in employment between 2007 and 2009
estimated using County Business Patterns (CBP) data. Growth in House prices is the percentage change between 2002 and 2007, and each interaction
is with a dummy indicator for the size of the establishment. Columns 1 and 2, All Industries, shows the results for the whole sample of firms (first the
weighted least squares results and then the IV), columns 3 through 6 show the coefficients split by the start-up capital amount. The omitted category
refers to firms with 50 or more employees. The first column for each sample of industries is aggregated at the county and establishment size level,
whereas the second column is at the county, establishment size and industry level, and includes industry fixed effects. All regressions control for the
natural logarithm of population, the percentage of the population with a college degree, the percentage of the labor force that is employed, the share of
the population in the workforce, and the percentage of homes that are owner-occupied. All controls are at a county level for the year 2000 and are
obtained using Census Bureau Data Summary Files. Standard errors are in parenthesis and are clustered by MSA. *, **, *** denote statistical
significance at the 10, 5, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 8. Total Employment, Unemployment and Migration
The table shows two-stage least squares regressions at a county level of the total growth in employment, unemployment, the change in the
unemployment rate and net migration on house price growth between 2002 and 2007. All regressions are weighted by the number of households in a
county as of 2000. House Price Growth is instrumented using the Saiz (2010) measure of elasticity of housing supply at an MSA level. Total
Employment is estimated using County Business Pattern data on the number and size of establishments. Unemployment and Unemployment Rate are
obtained using Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area estimates. Net Migration, Inflows and Outflows are obtained from the IRS county-to-county
migration data series. Net Migration is calculated by county using inflows of taxpayers minus outflow of taxpayers in a year as a proportion of non-
migrants (i.e. people that filed in the same county in t-1 and t). For each dependent variable the first column shows the results for the regressions
without controls, and the second column shows the coefficients controlling for log of population, the percentage of the population with a college
degree, the percentage of the labor force that is employed, the share of the population in the workforce, and the percentage of homes that are owner-
occupied. All controls are at a county level for the year 2000 and are obtained using Census Bureau Data Summary Files. Standard errors are in
parenthesis and are clustered by MSA. *, **, *** denote statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 9. Denial Rates
This Table shows the relationship between mortgage denial rates and mortgage volume at a county level and the elasticity of housing supply. Total
application volume is calculated as the sum of all loans that are originated plus applications that are approved but not accepted, applications denied by
the financial institution and loans purchased by the financial institution itself in each county and year, all scaled by the total number of households in a
county as of 2000. Denial rates are computed as the proportion of applications denied by the financial institution over total volume in each county and
year. All the data is extracted from HMDA LAR records. Panel A shows the average denial rates and average volume in 2002 and 2007, as well as the
change in these variables during this period for counties above and below the median elasticity of housing supply in the sample. Panel B shows OLS
regressions of the change in denial rate the change in total volume of applications on housing supply elasticity as a continuous variable and controls
(debt to income level and changes, the natural logarithm of the population, the percentage of the population with a college degree, the percentage of
the labor force that is employed, the share of the population in the workforce, the percentage of homes that are owner-occupied). All regressions are
weighted by the number of households as of 2000. *, **, *** denote statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1% levels, respectively.

The table shows two-stage least squares regressions at a county level of employment growth on house price growth split by size of establishment. All
regressions are weighted by the number of households in a county as of 2000. House Price Growth is instrumented using the Saiz (2010) measure of
elasticity of housing supply at an MSA level. Employment growth is the percentage change in employment between 2002 and 2007 estimated using
County Business Patterns (CBP) data. Growth in House prices is the percentage change between 2002 and 2007, and each interaction is a dummy
indicator for the size of the establishment. All regressions include 4-digit industry fixed effect and control for log of population, the percentage of the
population with a college degree, the percentage of the labor force that is employed, the share of the population in the workforce and the percentage
of homes that are owner-occupied. We drop the top and bottom one percentile of the change in employment in each county, industry and
establishment category. Standard errors are in parenthesis and are clustered by MSA. *, **, *** denote statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1% levels,
respectively.

Table A2. Robustness Test: Difference between High and Low Start-Up capital
The table shows two-stage least squares regressions at a county level of employment growth on house price growth split by size of establishment and
interacted with a High Startup Capital indicator (indicator itself not shown). High Startup Capital is defined as 4-digit industries for which the amount
of capital to start the firm is higher than the median for all industries. All regressions are weighted by the number of households in a county as of 2000.
House Price Growth is instrumented using the Saiz (2010) measure of elasticity of housing supply at an MSA level. Employment growth is the
percentage change in employment between 2002 and 2007 estimated using County Business Patterns (CBP) data. Growth in House prices is the
percentage change between 2002 and 2007, and each interaction is a dummy indicator for the size of the establishment. All regressions include 4-digit
industry fixed effect and control for log of population, the percentage of the population with a college degree, the percentage of the labor force that is
employed, the share of the population in the workforce, and the percentage of homes that are owner-occupied. We drop the top and bottom one
percentile of the change in employment in each county, industry and establishment category. Standard errors are in parenthesis and are clustered by
MSA. *, **, *** denote statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table A5. Proprietorships and House Price Appreciation, Post-Crisis (2007-2009)
The table shows two-stage least squares regressions at a county level of employment growth on house price growth, indicator variables for each
establishment size (not shown in the table) and interactions of house price growth with the size of establishments. Proprietorships are establishments
with zero employees. Each observation is at a county and establishment size level. All regressions are weighted by the number of households in a
county as of 2000. House Price Growth is instrumented using the Saiz (2010) measure of elasticity of housing supply at an MSA level. Employment
growth is the percentage change in employment between 2007 and 2009 estimated using County Business Patterns (CBP) data except in the case of
proprietorships. The data on growth in proprietorships is obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the first column and from the Census in
columns 2 through 4. All regressions control for the natural logarithm of population, the percentage of the population with a college degree, the
percentage of the labor force that is employed, the share of the population in the workforce, and the percentage of homes that are owner-occupied. All
controls are at a county level for the year 2000 and are obtained using Census Bureau Data Summary Files. Standard errors are in parenthesis and are
clustered by MSA. *, **, *** denote statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1% levels, respectively.
