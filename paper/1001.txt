                 The Response of Short—Term Interest Rates
                       to Weekly Money Announcements

                                  ABSTRACT

       The response of short—term interest rates to weekly money announcements

since the Federal Reserve's change in operating procedures on October 6, 1979,

is examined in this paper. The results indicate that the response increased

significantly since October 1979, and that it varies nonlinearly according to

the relation of money growth to the Federal Reserve!s long—run targets. The

results also suggest that the increase in the response and the rise in the

volatility of unanticipated money have contributed about equally to the large

rise in interest rate volatility during this period.

                 THE RESPONSE OF SHORT—TERN INTEREST RATES
                       TO WEEKLY MONEY ANOIJNCEMENTS

                              V. Vance Roley*

      Each Friday at 4:10 p.m., e.s.t., the Federal Reserve announces its esti-

mate of the narrowly defined money stock for the statement week ending nine

days previously. These money announcements have become one of the main events

in financial markets if for no other reason than the fact that significant

movements in interest rates have been associated with large unanticipated

changes in the money stock. Moreover, since the late 197Os interest rate fluc—

tuations in response to money stock announcements have dramatically increased.

Over the 1 1/2 hour intervals spanning the weekly announcements, for example,

the variance of the change in the 3—month Treasury bill yield in the two years

since October 1979 is more than 30 times larger than that of the previous two—

year period.-1

      Two factors may account for a large portion of the increased volatility of

short—term interest rates. First, on October 6, 1979, the Federal Reserve

adopted a reserve—aggregate approach to monetary control replacing a procedure

which emphasized stability of short—term yields. Second, despite the greater

emphasis placed on monetary control, the variance of weekly announced changes

in the money stock has risen by about 65 percent since late 1979. In turn,

if greater volatility of announced changes makes future changes more difficult

to predict, the volatility of unanticipated weekly changes in money would have

also increased.-' Thus, if financial markets are efficient and if weekly

money announcements contain relevant information, larger unanticipated changes

in money may have caused larger fluctuations in interest rates.

      The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, the basic linear model
                                    —2—



advanced by Berkman [1], Mishkin [11], Grossman [8], and Urich and Wachtel [20]

to investigate the impact of unanticipated changes in money on interest rates

is extended. The generalized model allows the most recent week's unanticipated

change in money as well as revisions to the previous week's announced level to

affect interest rates. The model also relaxes the linearity assumption, and,

following Urich and Wachtel [19], distinguishes among unanticipated money

changes according to the relationship of the money stock to the Federal

Reserve's targets. Second, the generalized model is used to estimate the rela-

tive contributions of the change in the market's responsiveness to unantici-

pated changes in money and the increase in the volatility of unanticipated

changes in explaining the rise in interest rate volatility since October 6,

1979. To anticipate these results, the increase in market responsiveness is

found to account for about 30 percent of the increased volatility of the 3—

month Treasury bill yield, and the rise in the volatility of unanticipated

changes in money is estimated to account for another 25 percent. In previous

studies using simple linear models, the percentage increases associated with

these two sources have ranged from about 28 to 35 percent and 2 to 7 percent,

respectively. (See Evans [4] and Roley [16].)

      In the first section of this paper, the specification, data, and estima-

tion results of the basic linear model are presented and compared to previous

studies. The estimation and test results of the generalized model are dis-

cussed in the second section. In the third section, the implications of the

Federal Reserve's change in its monetary control procedures are investigated.

The main conclusions of this paper are summarized in the final section.

      I. The Basic Model

      In this section, the efficient markets hypothesis is used to motivate a
                                        —3—



 simple linear model of the response of short—term interest rates to unantici-

 pated weekly changes in money. Following the discussion of the important

 features of this specification, the data and estimation results are presented.

 The estimated equations are then contrasted to those reported in previous

 studies, and the estimated responses in the pre— and post—October 1979 periods

 are compared.

 pcification

        The notion that financial markets are efficient has been frequently

 employed to model the behavior of interest rates.--' In the specific case

 involving the response of short—term interest rates to unanticipated weekly

 changes in money, the efficient markets hypothesis has two main implications.

 First, immediately prior to a money announcement, the market uses all informa-

tion which is costlessly available in setting interest rates, including the

expected money stock announcement. Thus, any change in money market yields

immediately following a money announcement should not be correlated with infor-

mation which was previously available. Second, if the announced weekly change

in money differs from the market's expectation, and if the new information is

relevant, money market yields will move to new equilibrium levels shortly after

the announcement.

        Assuming interest rate responses are linear, these consequences of the

efficient markets hypothesis imply

          e =    random error term uncorrelated with any information available
                 to the public prior to the money announcement in week t.

The coefficient in this equation reflects the movement in short—term yields

associated with an unanticipated weekly change in money. Under the pre—October

1979 monetary—control procedures used by the Federal Reserve, previous studies

have found that this estimated response was positive. (See Berkman [1],

Grossman [8], and Urich and Wachtel [20].) If an announcement was higher than

expected during this regime, for example, the observed rise in short—term

yields most likely resulted from the market's assessment that the Federal

Reserve would try to offset at least part of the unanticipated rise. Under the

new monetary control procedures, the estimated response would also be expected

to be positive, and two factors may cause it to be somewhat larger than before.
                                                      demand for reserves at a
First, under the reserve—aggregate approach, excess

given level of money market yields is not accommodated by increasing nonborrowed

reserves. In turn, with lagged reserve accounting, the new information provided

by a larger-than—anticipated weekly increase in money may cause investors to

revise upwards their expectation of the aggregate demand for reserves through

Wednesday of the current statement week. Thus, with a fixed supply of non—
                                                                 rise in this
borrowed reserves, investors might expect short—term yields to

case to equilibrate the market for reserves.   Second, in conjunction with the

                                                  market may have detected a
adoption of the reserve-aggregate approach, the

greater commitment on the part of the Federal Reserve to offset unanticipated

fluctuations in money growth. Thus, for both of these reasons, the change in

policy regimes makes the Lucas 110] critique relevant.

      Another feature of the model (1) also deserves comment. In particular,

used to measure changes in interest rates either should be short, or innova-

tions in other relevant economic variables should be included in the specifica-

tion. The former approach is employed by Berkman [lJ, Grossman [8], and Urich

and Wachtel [20], while the latter is adopted by Mishkin [ll].—" In the

studies by Berkman [1] and Urich and Wachtel [20], however, changes in interest

rates from 3:30 p.m. on Thursday to either 10:30 a.m. or 3:30 p.m. on Friday

are used to estimate the impact of Thursday money announcements. In this case

it can be easily shown that if the money surprise causes investors to revise

their expectations about other relevant economic data typically announced on

Friday at 9:00 a.m.—such as the unemployment rate and the consumer price

index—then the estimated response will be biased. Biases could also be present

in Mishkin's [11] estimates because of the failure to include surprises in all

relevant data. However, Mishkin's use of quarterly data makes this a virtually

impossible task. Because of the importance of collecting adequate data, the

data used here are discussed in some detail below.

Data

       All of the data described below are weekly and span the period beginning

on September 29, 1977, and ending on November 20, 1981. For the subsample

beginning on September 29, 1977, and ending on October 11, 1979, three of the

106 observations are excluded due to discount rate changes on the day of a

money announcement. In the post—October 6, 1979, subsample, six of the 111

observations are omitted due to four discount rate changes and two dates with

missing values for one of the series.

       Changes in the Money Stock. The money stock data consist of announced

weekly changes in the narrowly defined money stock, in billions of dollars, as

reported in the Federal Reserve's H.6 release. Both a revised estimate of the
                                    —6—




previous week's announced level and the change in money for the statement week

ending on Wednesday of the previous calendar week are reported. The data from

September 29, 1977, through January 31, 1980, correspond to "old Ml," and weekly

changes were announced on Thursday. From February 8, 1980, through November 20,

1981, weekly money announcements were made on Friday, and they were in terms of

Mi—A and Mi—B. Announced changes in Mi—B are analyzed here because of the

emphasis placed on Mi—B by Federal Reserve policymakers and market participants.

Also, it should be noted that the Mi—B data for 1981 are those for nonshift—

adjusted money ba1ances.

      Because of the changes in both policy regimes and money definitions, the

data are divided into three subsampies. The first corresponds to pre—October 6,

1979, weekly announced changes in Ml. Weekly changes in Ml in the post—

October 6, 1979, period comprise the second subsample. The third subsample

corresponds to announced weekly changes in Mi—B.

      Expected Changes in the Money Stock. Because the efficient markets hy--

pothesis implies that only unanticipated changes in money cause movements in

interest rates at the time of an announcement, some measure of the market's

expectation must be obtained. A convenient source of this expectation is the

data constructed by Money Market Services, Inc., which surveys about 60 money

market participants each week.-7' Prior to February 8, 1980, surveys were con-

ducted twice each week, on Tuesday and Thursday. Since this time the survey

has been conducted only once each week, on Tuesday. For the period ending on

February 8, 1980, the median of the Thursday survey is used to represent the

market's anticipated money announcement on each Thursday. For the remainder of

the sample, both the median of the Tuesday survey and a revised expectation

reflecting the availability of new information from Tuesday to Friday are used
                                          —7—




for   each Friday's money announcement.

          The estimated equation used to form the revised expectation is reported in

the first row of Table 1. The revised expectation is defined to equal the fitted

values of the regression of the announced change in money at 4:10 p.m. on Friday

on the survey measure and the change in the 3—month Treasury bill yield from

Tuesday at 3:30 p.m. to Friday at 3:30 p.m. The change in the 3—month bill yield

is taken as a proxy representing the receipt of all new information during this

period. The test results reported in the last column indicate that the change in

the bill yield adds significant information to the survey measure.

          Both the survey measure and the revised expectation are subjected to three

tests in the remaining rows of Table l.' First, the unbiasedness of the survey

data is examined. If the survey data are rational, no systematic bias should be

evident. The test results indicate that unbiasedness cannot be rejected at the

5   percent   level of significance, although it can be rejected at the 10 percent

level. A similar test is not reported for the revised expectation measure since

it is unbiased by construction.

          Second, the efficiency of both the survey and revised expectations measure

is tested. Following Modigliani and Shiller [12],      the   basic notion behind this

concept is that if weekly changes in money are generated by an autoregressive

process, the market's expectation should be generated by the same process. Thus,

coefficients on lagged values of weekly changes in money in a regression with

      —   M   as the dependent variable should be insignificantly different from

zero.-' As indicated in equations (1.3) and (1.4) in the table, the null hypoth-

esis cannot be rejected at reasonable significance levels for either of the

expectations measures.

          Finally, the forecast performances of the two expectations measures are

compared to that of an autoregressive model. Because the autoregressive model is

a better performance than the survey measure.

      Interest Rates. Following Grossman [8], the change in short—term interest

rates in response to an unanticipated weekly change in money is represented by

the difference in 3—month Treasury bill yield from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on the

day of a money announcement. The yield data for 3:30 p.m. are taken from a daily

release prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, "Quote Sheet of Closing

Rates." The 5:00 p.m. data are taken from the Telerate data base. Both series

are converted to coupon—equivalent yields, in percent, and the average of the bid

and ask quotes is used.

      Because the two yield series are taken from different sources, the con-

sistency of the two series is examined. To investigate their consistency, an

implication of the efficient markets hypothesis is used to form a test—i.e.,

that the 3—month yield follows a random walk over the 1 1/2 hour period. In a

specification analogous to that used for the unbiasedness test in Table 1, the

hypothesis that the bill yield follows a random walk cannot be rejected at the

5 percent level of significance. Moreover, in the two post—October 1979 sub—

samples, the marginal significance levels are both over 30 percent, while in the

first subsample it equals about 10 percent.' Thus, on the basis of these

tests, it appears that the data from these two sources are consistent.

in order to evaluate the efficient markets hypothesis. This basic form of the

model is estimated over the three subsampies described above. Again, the first

subsample comprises all of the available survey data prior to October 6, 1979,

and the post—October 6, 1979, period is divided into two subsamples corre-

sponding to Thursday Ml announcements and Friday Mi-B announcements.-' In

the latter of these subsamples, two equations are estimated—one using the

Tuesday survey measure and the other using the revised expectation measure

which includes new information from Tuesday to Friday.

      The estimation results indicate that the relationship between unantici-

pated changes in money and changes in the 3—month Treasury bill yield is statis-

tically significant in each of the subsampies. Also, with one exception, the

hypothesis that only unanticipated money affects the movement in the bill yield

cannot be rejected at high levels of significance. Moreover, specification

tests of equations (2.1), (2.2), and (2.4) reported in the last two columns of

the table do not reveal any significant structural shifts or heteroscedasticity

problems.

      In contrast to these results, equation (2.3)—which is estimated using

the unadjusted survey measure—has several undesirable characteristics. In

particular, the effect of anticipated money is statistically significant at

the 5 percent level. As a result, the hypothesis that only unanticipated

money matters can be rejected at low significance levels. Furthermore, the

results of the Goldfeld—Quandt test indicate that the null hypothesis of

homoscedasticity can also be rejected. At least in part, these results moti-

vate the use of the revised expectation.

      The individual coefficient estimates in Table 2 support the view that the

3—month Treasury bill yield has become more responsive to unanticipated
                                      —10—



announced changes in money since October 6, 1979. In particular, a $1 billion

money surprise in the first period is associated with a 0.7 basis point rise

in the bill yield, while in the third period the response rises substantially

to about 7 basis points. The hypothesis that the response coefficients are the

same across periods is formally tested on the bottom half of Table 2. The

estimated equations used for the tests are based on the specification in which
                                    13/   The test results indicate that the null

hypothesis can be uniformly rejected when comparing the estimated response in

the first period to that of either the second or third periods, or both. Thus,

the empirical results of the basic linear model suggest that the Federal

Reserve's change in its monetary—control procedure may have significantly

affected the responsiveness of short—term rates to unanticipated announced

changes in money.

Comparison to Previous Studies

      As mentioned above, several studies have previously examined the respon-

siveness of short—term interest rates to unanticipated weekly changes in money

in the pre—October 1979 period. Of these studies, the methodologies employed

by Grossman 181 and Urich and Wachtel 120] correspond most closely to that

used here. Thus, as a check on the robustness of the estimates to slight

variations in data and sample size, a comparison to their estimates is pre-

sented.

      Apart from an apparent difference in sample size and the possible use of

quoted bids on Treasury bills, Grossman's estimation results should correspond

exactly to those presented here for the pre—October 1979     period. Urich
and Wachtel's results, however, may differ because of their use of yield data

collected on Fridays at 10:30 a.m. instead of Thursdays at 5:00 p.m.      The
                                   —11-



estimates reported in these studies, and their attempted replications, are

presented in Table 3. On the top half of the table, estimates of the basic

linear model are compared. In terms of Grossman's results (3.1), the replica—
                                                     but the degree of disparity
tion (3.2) yields qualitatively similar estimates,

is nevertheless puzzling.' The disaggregatiOn of money surprises into

positive and negative components sheds some light on the source of this

difference, as it appears that the disparity may result from the estimated

effects of negative surprises.

      The difference in estimation results in comparison to Urich and Wachtel's

study is even more striking. In particular, they find that anticipated money

is a statistically significant determinant of the change in the bill yield from

Thursday at 3:30 p.m. to Friday at 10:30 p.m. Moreover, both positive and

negative surprises are statistically significant, as is apparent in the bottom

of the table.

      II. Extensions to the Basic Model

      In this section, the basic linear model is generalized in several direc-

tions. First, an additional term is included in the specification to test the

possibility that revisions to the previous week's announced level of the money

 stock affect short—term interest rates. Second, the possibility that interest

 rates respond nonlinearly to unanticipated changes in money is examined.

 Finally, the degree of interest rate responsiveness is allowed to vary

 depending on the relation of the observed money stock to the Federal Reserve's

 monetary aggregate targets.

 Money Stock Revisions

       In conjunction with each week's announced change in money, the Federal

 Reserve announces a revised estimate of the previous week's level of the

money stock. Because this revised estimate represents new information which

may be relevant to investor's expectations about future Federal Reserve policy

actions as well as inflation, it might be expected that interest rates respond

to these revisions.

        The hypothesis that the 3—month bill yield responds to revisions in past

money stock data may be tested in the equation

                    =
                        b1.(M_LMe) + b2.(M_Me) + e                            (2)

where           Mt = announced level of the narrowly defined money stock in
                     week t

                    =   market's expectation of the announced level of the narrowly
                        defined money stock in week t

            b1,b2 =     estimated      coefficients.

In this equation, the hypothesis that revisions do not affect interest rates is

equivalent to the hypothesis that rates do not respond to surprises in the

level of the money stock. This equivalence may be seen by first noting that

                    =        —
                        Mt       M1                                           (3)

where       M1 =        announced revision in week t of the previous week's announced
                        level of the narrowly defined money stock.

In turn, if investors expect no revision in the previous week's announced level

of the money stock, then

                                                                              (4)
                t        t       t—l
where       M       =   level    of the narrowly defined money stock announced in week
                        t—l.

Equations (3) and (4) together imply that equation (2) may be rewritten as

             LR =                                                             (2)
                        (b1+b2).(_Me)         + b2.(M i_Ne i + e.
Thus, the testing b2=O in (2) is equivalent to testing the hypothesis that the

bill yield does not respond to money stock revisions. Moreover, the hypothesis
                                          —13—



that interest rates respond equally to announced weekly changes in money and to

revisions in the previous week's announced level is equivalent to testing b10

in equation (2).

       The estimation results of equation (2) for the first and third periods

are presented on the top half of Table 4. For the first period, neither of the

estimated coefficients is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. In

the third period, however, the estimated coefficient on the surprise associated

with the announced change, b1, is statistically significant when the revised

expectation measure is used. The estimated coefficient on the unanticipated

component of the announced money stock level is again insignificant in this

case. As a whole, the results suggest that the 3—month bill yield does not

respond to announced revisions in the level of the money stock.

Nonlinear Response to Unanticipated Changes in Nqy

       The next extension to the basic linear model involves the addition of a

nonlinear response term to the original specification (1). This term allows

the magnitude of the interest rate response to vary with the absolute value of
                                        16/
the change in unantcpated money.— The model allowing a nonlinear response

may be represented as

              t
                  =   (b   01
                           +b   .IN
                                  t
                                    Ne)(M

In   this specification, if b1=0, the model reduces to equation (1).

        The estimation results of the nonlinear model (5) are reported on the

bottom half of Table 4. The values of the estimated coefficients indicate that

the response of the 3—month bill yield per dollar of an unanticipated change in

money declines with the size of the surprise. As is apparent in the table,

this result holds for the first period as well as for both expectations mea-

sures in the third period. The estimated coefficients on the nonlinear ternis

are, however, marginally statistically significant at best. Nevertheless, in

the more general model presented immediately below, nonlinear terms are found

to be statistically significant.

Federal Reserve Monetary Targets

      The final extension to the basic linear model (1) considered here involves

the disaggregation of money surprises according to the relation of money growth

to the Federal Reserve's long—run ranges)-' Urich and Wachtel [19] consider

similar effects, although in their study short—run ranges are used. Long—run

ranges are used here for two reasons. First, market participants probably made

more accurate assessments of the Federal Reserve's long—run ranges. Second,

the short—run ranges (and later, paths) were, in principle, set to be consis-

tent with eventually obtaining money growth within the long—run ranges.

      The model allowing both asymmetric behavior due to the long—run ranges

and nonlinear responses may be written as

                                                    + (b +b
                                                                     a,t I)

a, w, and b denote money growth above, within, and below the long—run range,

respectively; the superscripts "+" and "—" denote positive and negative unantici-

differs from (5) in that unanticipated changes in money are disaggregated

according to whether the surprise is positive or negative, and whether observed

money growth is above, within, or below the long—run range set by the Federal

Reserve.

       The estimation results of this model are presented in Table 5. The

results indicate that a variety of linear and nonlinear terms are statistically

significant and that the estimated responses apparently vary depending on the

classification of the surprise. Various hypotheses associated with this model

are formally tested on the bottom of Table 5. The hypotheses that the coeffi—

cients on linear and nonlinear terms equal zero are reported on lines (5.4) and

(5.5), respectively. In the first period, these hypotheses can both be rejected

at very low significance levels. In the third period, the marginal significance

levels are slightly higher on average, but neither hypothesis can be rejected

at the 10 percent level when the revised measure of the expected announced

change in money is used.

       The next three tests in the table—reported on lines (5.6), (5.7), and

(5.8)----examine the equality of coefficients across different classifications of

money surprises, The hypothesis that all linear responses are equal—tested on

line (5.6)—cannot be rejected at the 10 percent level in the third period. On

line (5.7), the equality of nonlinear responses is investigated. The hypothesis

that nonlinear responses are equal can be rejected at low significance levels

in the first period, and somewhat higher levels in the third period. The most

important of these tests is reported on line (5.8). In this case, the null

hypothesis corresponds to the basic linear model (1). The results for both

the first period and the third period with the revised expectation measure

indicate that the null hypothesis can be rejected at less than the 1 percent

level of significance. Thus, the generalized model appears to provide better

representation of the response of the 3—month bill yield to money surprises

than the simple linear model used in previous studies.

      The final two rows in the table further investigate the role of the policy

ranges. On line (5.9), the hypothesis that the bill yield does not systemat-

ically respond to money surprises when money growth is either above or below

the limits of the long—run range is tested. In the first period, this hypoth-

esis cannot be rejected. In the third period, however, this hypothesis can be

rejected at less than the 0.01 percent level of significance. Opposite to

these results, the hypothesis that the bill yield does not systematically

respond to money surprises when money growth is within the long—run range—

tested on line (5.l0)—can be rejected at extremely low significance levels in

the first period, but not in the third period. Thus, these results suggest that

once money growth was outside the long—run range, the market did not expect the

Federal Reserve to react to further deviations during the pre—October 1979

period, but expects the Federal Reserve to react only in these situations since

October 1979.

      III. Itpplications of the October 1979 Change in Operating Procedures

      The results presented above suggest that the 3—month Treasury bill yield

exhibited different responses to unanticipated weekly changes in money in the

pre— and post—October 1979 periods. In this section, the estimated responses

across periods are further examined, and their equality is formally tested.

Following these tests, the volatility of the 3—month Treasury bill yield in the

post—October 1979 period is decomposed to evaluate the impact of the Federal

Reserve's change in monetary—control procedures.

Market's Response to Unanticipated Changes in Money

      The estimated equations reported in Table 5 are used to test whether the

market's response to unanticipated weekly changes in money is significantly

different in the pre— and post—October 1979 periods. The summary statistics
                                    —17—



associated with these tests are reported on the top half of Table 6.   In the

first row, the test considers changes in the bill yield when money growth is

outside of the Federal Reserve's long—run range. In this test, the null hypoth-

esis that the responses are equal across periods can be rejected at less than

the 0.01 percent significance level when either the survey or revised measure

is used to represent expected money.---' In contrast, the hypothesis that the

responses are equal across periods when money growth is within the long—run

range cannot be rejected at the 25 percent level of significance. The strong

divergence in responses when money growth is outside of the long—run range is

nevertheless sufficient to enable rejection of the hypothesis that all

responses are equal, as reported on line (6.3).

      Two conclusions may be drawn from these tests. First, the change in

policy regimes has significantly affected the behavior of the 3—month bill

yield in the 1 1/2 hour intervals around weekly money stock announcements.

Second, this change in behavior apparently reflects the market's assessment that

the Federal Reserve will respond more vigorously to deviations in money when

money growth is outside of the long—run range.

Decomposition of Short—Term Interest Rate Volatility

      The change in the responsiveness of the 3—month bill yield associated

with the adoption of the new monetary—control procedures has direct implications

for the volatility of short—term interest rates. One implication may be seen

by decomposing the volatility—defined as the mean of the sum of squared 1 1/2

hour changes—of the 3—month bill yield in the third period. This decomposi-

tion is presented on the bottom of Table 6, where components consist of the

volatility in the first period, the effect of changes in the volatility and

type of unanticipated money, the effect of the change in the market's response,

and the change in random volatility. The first of these sources merely equals

the observed volatility of the bill yield in the first period. The second is

due to the rise in the volatility of unanticipated money, and shifts in the

relation of money growth to the long—run range from the first to third periods.

The change in the market's response refers to the differences in the estimated

coefficients across subsamples, as reported in Table 5. The final term—the

change in random volatility—is defined as the difference in the mean of the

sum of squared residuals in the estimated equations from the first to third

periods in Table 5.

      The results of this volatility decomposition are presented on the bottom

of Table 6 for both measures of the expected change in money. As shown in the

table, the volatility of the bill yield in the first period amounts to only 2.5

percent of the third period's volatility. In contrast, with the revised expec-

tation measure, the change in the volatility and type of unanticipated money

comprises about 26 percent of the bill yield's volatility in the third period.

Similarly, the change in the market's response accounts for about 29 percent

of the increase. While the estimated contribution of the change in the market's

response is similar to that found in previous studies using simple linear models,

the impact of the volatility of unanticipated money is much larger than that

reported previously. In particular, previous estimates of the impact of the

volatility of unanticipated money range from about 10 to 20 percent of that

attributed to changes in the market's response. (See Evans [4] and Roley [16].)

      IV. Summary of Conclusions

      The empirical results presented in this paper suggest several conclusions.

First, in modeling the effect of unanticipated weekly changes in money on short—

term interest rates, the basic linear model used in previous studies does not
                                    —19—




take several significant factors into account. These factors include the

different responses of short—term yields depending on the relation of money

growth to the Federal Reserve's monetary targets, and nonlinear responses to

money surprises.

      Second, the response of the 3—month Treasury bill yield to weekly money

surprises is significantly different in the pre— and post—October 1979 periods.

Indeed, the empirical results indicated that the Federal Reserve's adoption of

a new monetary control procedure in October 1979 has led to sharper fluctuations

in short—term yields for a given money surprise when money growth is outside

the long—run target range. Thus, the market apparently views the new proce-

dures as part of a greater commitment by the Federal Reserve to control money

growth.

      Finally, the increased responsiveness of the bill yield to unanticipated

weekly changes in money since October 1979 accounts for about 29 percent of the

volatility of this yield during the 1 1/2 hours spanning weekly money announce-

ments. About an equal amount of the bill yield's volatility is due to the

increased volatility of unanticipated weekly changes in money, which accounts

for 26 percent.

1. To be precise, the variance of the change in the 3—month Treasury bill yield
from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on the day of a money announcement is 0.0016 for
the September 29, 1977 to October 4, 1979 period, and 0.0543 for the October 11,
1979 to November 20, 1981 period. These data are further discussed in the first
section of this paper.

2. The variance of weekly announced changes in the money stock has increased
from 4.329 in the September 29, 1977—October 4, 1979 period to 7.128 in the
October 11, 1979—November 20, 1981 period. In addition, with the market survey
data used here to represent the market's expected announced change in money,
the variance of unanticipated changes in money has increased from 2.374 to
4.995 over the same two periods. These data are further discussed in the first
section.

3. For applications of the efficient markets model to weekly money announce-
ments, see Berkman 11], Cornell [2], Grossman 18], and Urich and Wachtel 120].
For a discussion of the general implications of the efficient markets hypothesis,
see Fama [5].

4. Note that this specification also implies that short—term interest rates
follow a random walk over the time interval spanning a money announcement.   If
this interval is short in comparison to the maturity of the security, and if
the expectations hypothesis describes equilibrium yields, then this result
follows from Pesando 114]. Even if short—term yields contain time—varying term
premiums (see Jones and Roley [9]), the random—walk model would be expected to
approximate yield changes over short intervals. In any event, the random—walk
specification is tested below in this section.

5.  In contrast to these studies, Evans 14] uses weekly averages of average
daily yields which make his results difficult to interpret. In addition to
this problem, he excludes innovations in other relevant variables during the
week, and includes current and future levels of the federal funds rate which
most likely causes simultaneity bias in his estimates. It should also be noted
that Mishkin Ill] considers a different problem than that examined here, but
the underlying models are identical.

6. Starting in 1981, Ml—B was adjusted by the Federal Reserve to reflect the
introduction of nationwide NOW accounts. While the target range for shift—
adjusted Ml—B was emphasized by the Federal Reserve, weekly announced changes
were not shift adjusted.
7. I am indebted to Mr. Raul A. Nicho, who is a vice president with Money
Market Services, Inc., for making the survey data available for this project.
For descriptions of the various methods used by market participants to form
their weekly money forecasts, see Sivesind [17].

8. These tests are reported for only the third subsample. Grossman [8] and
Urich and Wachtel 119] conduct similar tests for the pre—October 1979 period,
and the results generally support the rationality of the survey data. These
tests were replicated with the data used here, and the results were found to be
virtually the same as those reported previously.

9. If relevant variables are excluded from the information set, this test is
still valid because the bias will be the same in each autoregression under the
null hypothesis. Also note that the single—equation efficiency test specified
here is equivalent to testing the hypothesis that money surprises are uncorre—
lated with previously announced changes in money. For other applications of
the efficiency test, see Pesando [14] and Friedman [7].

10. See for example, Pearce [13] for an analysis of the forecast performance of
the Livingston inflation survey data.

11. The lower marginal significance level in the first subsample is not sur-
prising. In particular, prior to October 1979, trading in the Treasury bill
market was thin after 4:00 p.m., which may account for Urich and Wachtel's 120]
decision to use 10:30 a.m. rates on the day following a money announcement.
Nevertheless, as discussed below, their estimated impact of unanticipated money
is roughly the same as that reported here. Thus, it appears that the 5:00 p.m.
quotes embody the new information obtained in money announcements.

12. The former of the two subsamples includes only 17 observations, and is not
considered further in subsequent sections. In addition to the problem posed by
the sparcity of data, it may also be desirable to exclude some period of time
after the change in policy regimes to allow adjustment by market participants.
In particular, this 17—week period may be characterized as one of transition,
and therefore may not provide an accurate guide to ultimate market behavior.
This learning behavior is consistent with the rational expectations models
presented, for example, by Taylor [18] and Friedman 16].

13.  To avoid potential problems associated with heteroscedasticity, the equa-
tions in each of the three periods are weighted by the reciprocals of their
estimated standard errors.

14. The sample sizes used in the replications were inferred from information in
these studies. The samples vary according to the treatment of holidays and dis-
count rate changes. Bid data are used to replicate Grossman's estimates, and
average bid—ask quotes are used to replicate Urich and Wachtel's estimates.

15. However, using Grossman's point estimates, the test that the estimates are
the same has an F—statistic of F(3,96)  0.2328, implying a marginal signifi-
cance level of 0.8729.
16. The estimation results of models specified in terms of surprises in money
stock levels are not reported in the remaining tables in this paper due to the
apparent lack of statistical significance of these terms. The statistical
significance of surprises in money stock levels was nevertheless examined in
the context of the nonlinear model, and the hypothesis that coefficients on
both linear and nonlinear terms equal zero could not be rejected at the 5 per-
cent significance level in each period. In contrast, the analogous null
hypothesis involving surprises in announced changes could be rejected in each
period at the 5 percent level.

17. Prior to 1979, annual long—run ranges were set each quarter, and they
spanned the current and next three quarters. From the third quarter of 1977
through the third quarter of 1978, the growth ranges were set each quarter at
5 to 6 1/2 percent for Ml. Thus, despite the fact that the public was not
informed about these ranges until at least one month after they were set, it is
assumed that throughout this period the market accurately assessed the ranges
because of their rather lethargic nature. In the fourth quarter of 1978, the
Federal Reserve departed from its 4 to 6 1/2 percent range as a consequence of
the introduction of the automatic transfer service (ATS). In this case, it is
again assumed that the market correctly assessed the long—run range for
narrowly defined money prior to its public availability. Since 1979, the
Federal Reserve has set a single long—run range for each monetary and credit
aggregate, with the ranges spanning an entire calendar year. These ranges are
announced each February, and the Federal Reserve has the opportunity to change
them each July. Moreover, preliminary ranges for the subsequent year are
announced in July. Thus, with this information, the market may be expected to
form fairly accurate assessments of the long—run ranges. In determining the
relation of money growth to the long—run ranges, it was assumed that the base
quarter's average money stock occurred in the middle week of the quarter.
Ranges for each week were then computed using this base week, and announced
weekly levels were compared to the upper and lower limits.

18. In the tests, the equations in each of the periods are weighted by the
reciprocals of the estimated standard errors reported on the top of Table 5.
