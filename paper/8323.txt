       What is the relationship between a country’s financial development and its economic

growth? And how do a country’s financial development and economic growth relate to the extent of

its participation in the global economy? In particular, is there a relationship between domestic

financial development and participation in global capital markets? Few would doubt that countries

with highly developed financial systems might well export capital to other countries. But are there

conditions under which having such a system might also promote imports of capital? These are the

broad questions that motivate our paper.

       To address the questions and attempt to answer them, we draw on insights from two bodies

of research that have developed independently of one another, but that in our view are quite related.

One includes the work of economic historians on the development of financial systems--especially

banking systems--in various countries, and the impact of financial developments on economic

growth within those countries. Also included in this historical work is a vast body of literature on

aspects of globalization: cross-border financing and capital flows, international banking and financial

crises, and the integration of the world’s money and capital markets. Among economic historians,

these two strands of literature, one dealing with domestic and the other with international

developments, are not always related to one another. Both, however, are elements of the story of

financial globalization.

       The other body of research on which we draw is the work of contemporary economists on the

relationship between measures of financial development and such variables as the growth of real per

capita income and investment. Typically these are cross-country analyses based on models of the

finance-growth nexus for the postwar period, when broadly consistent data for a large number of

countries at varying levels of economic development became available. They are the economists’

equivalent of the economic historians’ comparative studies of national financial and banking systems



                                                   1
and their relationship to economic growth. They do not say much about financial globalization.

        Our goal here is to integrate and extend these two bodies of existing research, the historical

and the economic, in a longer-term investigation of financial globalization during the past two

centuries. Our operating hypothesis is that countries with well-functioning financial systems have

one of the conditions, perhaps a key one, conducive to economic growth and also a set of institutions

that give confidence to foreign investors and thus promote financial globalization by allocating the

world’s capital more efficiently.

        We begin with a discussion of what we mean by a good or well-functioning financial system

(Section 1). Next (Section 2) we develop several historical case studies of countries that built such

systems early in their modern economic histories: the Netherlands, Great Britain, the United States,

France, Germany, and Japan. For each case, we consider when and how a modern financial system

emerged, how it contributed to economic growth, and what relationship it had to the country’s

participation in international finance. With some lessons of financial history drawn from the cases in

mind, we then investigate, in the context of a larger set of countries for which we have data covering

the period from the middle of the 19th century to the present, the finance-growth nexus, and the

finance/growth/globalization nexus. This 12-century period encompasses two eras of economic

globalization that others have identified, that of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and that of the

late 20th century extending now into the 21st century. After discussing data sources and

methodological considerations (Section 3, with a Data Appendix in Section 6), we present and

discuss our econometric results (Section 4), and conclude (Section 5).


1.1 What is a Good Financial System?

        History appears to indicate that a good financial system is one that has five key components.

These components are (1) sound public finances and public debt management, (2) stable monetary


                                                    2
arrangements, (3) a variety of banks, some with domestic and others with international orientations,

and perhaps some with both orientations, (4) a central bank to stabilize domestic finances and

manage international financial relations, and (5) well-functioning securities markets.1 Such an

articulated financial system, once it is in place and functioning, can mobilize capital domestically

and thereby promote a country’s economic development and growth. In a financial globalization

context, it can also serve, either directly by the facilities it offers or indirectly by enhancing growth

prospects, to attract the interest of foreign investors.

        To place our vantage point here in perspective, we make two comments. First, academic

specialization being what it is, contemporary scholars and those of previous generations often focus

their attention on one or a subset of the components. Some economists are public finance experts,

while others study money, banking, and central banking. Securities markets and company finance

are usually the provinces of finance departments in business schools. Even economic historians,

who often take a longer and broader view of economic development than economists and finance

specialists, tend to concentrate on one component--usually banking--or a subset of them. Our view is

that in a well-functioning financial system, there are numerous interactions among all of our five

components. Hence, we think that the unit of observation for studying finance’s role in economic

modernization should be the financial system as a whole, and not just one or two of its components.

        Second, whenever one peels back the layers of the great onion of history, stopping at a layer

that seems important for later developments, the question inevitably arises, “But what made that

layer possible?” In our case, what makes a good financial system possible? What are its


   1
    Insurance might well be added to our list, as a sixth component. We leave it out here, in part
because it involves a function—risk management—similar to that in which another component,
banking, engages, and in part because, in a global historical context, it could be and often was
supplied by insurers in other countries. Nonetheless, we recognize that the leading economies to be
discussed in Section 2 did develop the insurance component of their financial systems early in their
financial and economic modernizations.

                                                     3
prerequisites? Without going into detail, we would say that the prerequisites would likely include a

combination of good government, including representative political institutions, an independent

judiciary or court system, clearly defined and secure property rights, and financial savvy on the part

of leaders--finance ministers, central bankers, and so on–among the components of a good system.

        We place sound public finance first in our list of financial-system components largely for

historical reasons. In modern history, good financial systems emerged out of the needs of the nation-

state for financing, often to fight its wars with other nation-states.2 Sound public finance includes

setting and controlling public expenditure priorities, raising revenues adequate to fund them

efficiently, and if--as is often the case--that involves issuing public debt, then provision must be

made for servicing the debt to gain and keep the confidence of the investors who purchase it.

        The historical primacy of public finance in the development of financial systems, to be

documented below, serves another purpose. It reminds us that much of finance, historically and

now, and especially when finance has global dimensions, is inextricably bound up with politics. It

is both naive and a misreading of history to assume that capital moved throughout the world solely,

or even mostly, in search of the highest available return commensurate with the risks taken. It is

equally naive to assume that capital usually moved in response to the demands of users who want to

make productive economic investments. In a world without governments and foreign policies, that

might have been the case. But ours is not such a world. This is a reality that needs to be kept in

mind in any discussion of economic globalization. Nonetheless, it should also be kept in mind that

the needs of governments to raise and deploy funds internationally for reasons of state (typically,


   2
     Unless one subscribes to an economic theory of war, the importance of war in shaping financial
systems in modern history argues for treating the origins of modern financial systems as
economically exogenous rather than endogenous. Later in the chapter, we discuss the debate
between those who say real-sector economic changes lead to financial-developmental responses and
those who, like us, would give more primacy to financial development as leading to real-sector
development.

                                                    4
wars) resulted in the creation of financial systems that could mobilize capital and deploy it for

productive economic purposes (Ferguson 2001).

       Stable money is desirable for the usual textbook reasons. Money is useful as a medium of

exchange, a store of value, and a standard of deferred payments. All three uses, but especially the

latter two, are harmed if money fluctuates and depreciates in value in unpredictable ways.

Banks and banking have played large roles in modern economies. Once a monetary base is

specified, banks of deposit, discount, and note issue amplify it into a money stock that consists

largely of bank money convertible into the monetary base. They do this by granting credit to

entrepreneurs and other users of funds. The credit-granting function turns banks into risk managers,

the essence of their role as financial intermediaries. A lot of the risk that banks manage arises from

borrowing short and lending long. Individual banks and banking systems become troubled, even fail,

when recipients of bank credit are unwilling or unable to repay on schedule (illiquidity and default

problems) or at all (insolvency and repudiation problems). If depositors, the holders of bank money

from whom the banks borrow short, learn of such problems, they may compound them by attempting

en masse to convert their bank money to base money.

       Central banks, the fourth of our key components of a modern financial system, can prevent

such problems from arising, or at least alleviate them when they do arise. They do this by

monitoring and regulating the operations of individual banks in a banking system with the goal of

preventing problems. And they do it to alleviate problems when they do arise by acting as lenders of

last resort. Central banks also act in the areas of other financial-system components. For example,

they often serve as the government’s bank, that is, as an adjunct of public finance. And they act to

stabilize the value of a country’s money, both domestically and internationally.

       Securities markets, the last component, facilitate the issuance of public and private debt



                                                   5
securities and private equity securities. Specialized banks--investment or merchant banks--serve

here as financial intermediaries between the borrowers/issuers (governments and business

enterprises) of bonds, stocks, and other forms of securities, and the lenders/investors who purchase

securities. Once securities are issued, trading markets provide them with transferability and liquidity

that enhance their appeal to investors, be they domestic or foreign.

       One could arrive at the above list of key financial-system components as an inference from

observing the financial systems of highly-developed national economies today. Such financial

systems are one of the characteristics of these countries that distinguish them from the far larger

number of less developed economies. We turn now to the historical origins of such systems.


2. Good Financial Systems in History: Case Studies

        The foregoing discussion of a good financial system in terms of its key components and their

connections to one another raises several questions. When, where, and how did such articulated

financial systems appear in modern economic history? And did it matter for the countries concerned

in terms of their economic growth and their participation and status in the world economy?

        Our reading of modern economic history is that countries that developed such good financial

systems early in their histories grew rapidly thereafter and often attracted foreign capital inflows that

served to enhance their growth. The Netherlands, Great Britain, and the United States are leading

examples. In succession, these three countries after their financial emergence went on to become the

economic leaders of the past four centuries and also leaders in the export of capital.

        The Dutch Republic was the first country to develop such a system early in the 17th century.

Despite its small size, the country became a leading political and economic power of the 17th

century, and its economic leadership continued into the 18th century.

        Great Britain developed such a system at the end of the 17th century and in the first decades


                                                    6
of the 18th century. It went on to have the first industrial revolution later in the century, to build a

worldwide empire, and to succeed the Dutch Republic as the leading world economy during the 18th

and much of the 19th century.

        At the end of the 18th century, the newly independent United States also developed such a

system. It was then a small country on the periphery of a world system dominated by Europe, with

about half a percent of the world’s population. A century later, with about 5 percent of world

population, the United States had become the world’s largest economy, a position it maintains after

the elapse of another century.

        In each of these three cases, financial innovation led to economic leadership, and then to the

Dutch, the British, and the Americans successively becoming world leaders in the export of capital

to other countries.

        During the second half of the 19th century, France and Germany in Europe, and Japan in

Asia also became financial innovators, with beneficial results for their economic growth and their

ability to become major exporters of capital. In 1914, at the end of the first era of globalization, the

four European countries and the United States accounted for about 90 percent of the world’s capital

exports. Together with Japan, now the world’s second largest economy, their share in the second era

of globalization at the end of the 20th century has not changed much from what it was nine decades

earlier. Even peculiarities of the earlier era remain, with the United States again--as in 1914--being a

net importer of capital even as it exports a great deal of it.

        We now examine these countries’ early financial development in more detail. There are

many similarities among them, but also some differences. The United States and Japan are of special

interest because their financial revolutions were far separated in time and space from the European

home-ground of modern finance and because they have become the two largest national economies.



                                                     7
2.1. The Dutch Republic

        The Republic or United Provinces was born late in the 16th century when the northern

provinces of the Spanish Netherlands revolted against Spanish Habsburg rule and, over several

decades of protracted warfare extending well into the 17th century, established independence from

Spain. Even before Dutch independence, provincial governments in the Spanish Netherlands

developed a permanent public debt market, likely the world’s first, when annuities were issued as a

means of lightening tax burdens in response to the revenue demands of Spanish overlords (Tracy

1985). This would now be termed tax-smoothing. At roughly the same time, the Spanish Netherlands

perfected a continuing market in negotiable international bills of exchange to finance trade without

necessitating large movements of hard money across borders (Van der Wee 1963; Neal 1990).

        The Dutch revolt maintained the public-debt and money market innovations in the United

Provinces. When coupled with the new republic’s tolerance of minorities in the southern

Netherlands, the revolt also led to an inflow of both capital and financial expertise to Dutch cities,

particularly Amsterdam (De Vries and Woude 1997, p. 669). In 1609 came two additional and major

financial innovations. One was the Wisselbank, or Bank of Amsterdam, an exchange bank for

merchants and the government whose bank money was better than gold, or at least better than the

motley collection of gold and silver coins then in circulation. Similar banks were established in other

Dutch cities, as were local private banks (kassiers) and, somewhat later, merchant banks. The other

innovation of 1609 was the common stock, created when the Dutch East India Company decided to

make its capital permanent and issued dividend-paying, tradable shares to its owners instead of

liquidating each of its trading expeditions at its conclusion and distributing all of the proceeds to the

owners. As warfare with Spain wound down in the early decades of the 17th century, and with the

aid and example of Wisselbank money, the Dutch guilder became stable in value and remained so



                                                    8
until the end of the 18th century (Neal 1990; Hart et al. 1997; De Vries and Woude 1997).

        Thus, by the early 17th century, the Dutch Republic had established a version of each of the

key components of a modern financial system: strong public finances, stable money, banks, a central

bank of sorts, and bond and stock markets. There followed an era of great development and

prosperity variously described as “the first modern economy” (De Vries and Woude 1997), “the

golden age,” and “the embarrassment of riches” (Schama 1988). The Republic could not long keep

the dominating political power that by the mid-17th century it had derived from its strong economy.

It was too small a country and too decentralized a state to accomplish such a feat in a world

increasingly dominated by larger, more centralized states. But Dutch wealth continued to

accumulate, Dutch capital sought returns all over the world, and Dutch financial expertise was

exported to other countries.


2.2. Great Britain

        Dutch expertise in finance was introduced directly to England after the Glorious Revolution

of 1688, when the Dutch stadhouder, Willem of Orange, was invited to become King William III of

England. After generations of erratic financial behavior of previous monarchs, the British, envious of

Dutch economic and financial power and hoping to surpass it, passed control of their country’s

finances and monetary system from king to Parliament.

        Adopting Dutch finance, the British also improved upon it. The Bank of England was formed

in 1694 as a bank of discount, deposit and note issue capitalized by public debt, and was thus closer

to the modern concept of a central bank than the Amsterdam Wisselbank. The metallic currency was

recoined and paper issues such as Bank notes were made convertible into the metallic base. England

thus achieved a stable money (Capie 2001a, 2001b). In subsequent decades the public finances were

also stabilized, in part by the introduction of standardized perpetual annuities that became the basis


                                                   9
for a liquid public debt market. A domestic money market in bills of exchange appeared. Even

earlier, the British East India Company followed its Dutch counterpart by making its capital

permanent and issuing tradable shares against it, and an active equity market in company shares was

present by the 1690s (Neal 1990; Chancellor 1998). These developments have been described as an

English “financial revolution” (Dickson 1967), and as “the sinews of power” that enabled the British

state to win wars and build an empire (Brewer 1988).

        After the mid-18th century, note-issuing country banks began to dot the English and Welsh

countryside, joining the long-existing private bankers of London and the Bank. The banking system

was knit together via the London money market, through which capital surpluses of English

agriculture could be recycled to finance the capital deficits of areas industrializing in the first

industrial revolution (Pressnell 1956). In Scotland, large banking co-partnerships with branches and

freedom of note issue joined several corporations chartered with banking privileges earlier in the

century (Cameron et al. 1967, Checkland 1975).

        Larry Neal’s (1990) study of the 18th-century London and Amsterdam capital markets

documents the manner in which these developments promoted a flow of capital to England, mainly

from the Dutch Republic but also from other continental financial centers. Foreign holdings of shares

in leading British companies (East India, South Sea, and the Bank of England) reached nearly 20

percent of the total by mid-century, and foreigners also held about 14 percent of the English national

debt. Neal also demonstrates that the two markets across the North Sea from each other were

remarkably integrated, with nearly equivalent prices and price changes for the same securities. Even

the famous French and English bubbles of 1720 were synchronized in ways that were probably

orchestrated by Dutch investors (Neal 1990, pp. 101-15, 147). At the end of the century, during the

French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, Neal argues that the ability of these markets and



                                                    10
institutions to transfer flight capital from the continent to England enabled the industrial revolution

there to proceed. Because of international capital market integration, heavy British government

borrowing to finance war efforts did not crowd out private investment.

        If one is willing to consider northwestern Europe as the world, the 18th century surely was

the first era of financial globalization. It was the result of two modern financial systems, most likely

the only two such systems existing then, linking up with each other across the North Sea, to the

advantage of borrowers and investors in both the Dutch Republic and Great Britain. These systems

had a version of each of the five key components of a good financial system.


2.3. The United States.

        If one thinks that true financial globalization must link continents separated perhaps by an

ocean, and not merely two countries separated by the North Sea, history does not stand in the way

with much of a delay. That is because the United States in the early 1790s engineered a financial

revolution quite like the earlier ones of the Dutch Republic and Britain (Sylla 1999b). The engineer

was Alexander Hamilton, first Secretary of the Treasury (1789-1795) of the new federal government

that assembled in 1789 under the Constitution. Hamilton’s earlier writings indicate that he had

absorbed many of the key lessons of Dutch, English, and French financial history. In office, with the

backing of the president, the Congress, and the private sector, he applied them.

        First, Hamilton set up a federal revenue collection system based on import tariffs and

domestic excise taxes authorized by Congress, as well as hoped-for revenues from land sales that

were slow to materialize. While proceeding with that, Hamilton in 1790 proposed and Congress

adopted a plan for restructuring the par value of the national debt from the American Revolution.

The debt included state debts assumed by the new federal government and arrears of interest on it

that the previous government had been unable to pay. The restructuring took the form of three new


                                                   11
issues of new federal securities with varying interest-rate terms. The new securities were payable,

principle and interest, in hard-money dollars to be collected by the revenue system. These provisions

applied to the domestic debt of some $65 million; an additional $12 million owed to foreigners,

mainly the French government and Dutch investors, was rolled over with fresh loans from Dutch

bankers (Perkins 1994).

        Also in 1790, Hamilton proposed a Bank of the United States modeled on the Bank of

England, but with several innovative features including a large capital ($10 million), the possibility

of branches and partial (20 percent) government ownership. Like the Bank of England, it was to be

the government’s bank and it could also engage in private-sector banking. There were only three

other banks, small state institutions, in the country at the time. Congress enacted the Bank proposal

early in 1791. The Bank had its initial public offering in July of that year; it was quickly

oversubscribed. The Bank opened in Philadelphia at the end of 1791, and branches were established

in other cities starting in 1792. Fearing that the federal bank with its branches would dominate U.S.

banking, the states moved quickly in the 1790s to charter more banks of their own. A country with

no banks prior to1782 became one a decade later with a rapidly expanding banking system, and one

that by 1802 had 35 chartered banks (Fenstermaker 1965, p. 111).

        With the Bank proposal enacted, Hamilton next produced a report on a mint, which defined a

new U.S. dollar in terms of both gold and silver (i.e., a bimetallic monetary base), and proposed

establishing a mint to make a variety of coins based on the decimal system, also an innovation, albeit

one earlier proposed by Hamilton’s cabinet colleague, Thomas Jefferson. Banknotes convertible into

a specie base gradually replaced the early fiat paper issues of state governments.

        The new federal debt securities appeared late in 1790, followed by the stock of the Bank in

mid-1791. So many new and putatively high-quality securities energized the informal trading



                                                   12
markets of Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. Trading was vigorous, speculative spirits were

unleashed, and new private issues joined those of the government. Government debt that had sold at

15 cents on the dollar in 1789 reached par in 1791, and 120 percent of par in early 1792, just before

Wall Street’s first crash knocked 20 percent off their value in two months. New York State enacted

a law to end speculation in the streets, causing brokers to meet under a buttonwood tree in Wall

Street in May 1792, and draw up an agreement to trade indoors. This was the origin of the New

York Stock Exchange.

       In roughly three years, from 1789 to 1792, the United States was transformed from a

bankrupt country with a primitive financial system to a country servicing its debts and equipped with

a modern financial system like the ones that the Dutch and the British had developed earlier over

many decades. What were the effects of that system? In keeping with the general approach of our

paper, we discuss them under growth and globalization.

       In an earlier paper (Rousseau and Sylla 1999), we analyzed relationships between financial

developments and real growth in the period 1790 to 1850. Although good data do not become

available until late in this period (and show the U.S. economy growing at modern rates), it is the

consensus of economic historians that real growth, total and per capita, accelerated over the six-

decade period. Our work developed several annual time series measures of financial development

(money stock, bank numbers and capital, and the number of securities listed in major securities

markets), and measures of real growth and development (investment, imports, and an index of the

cumulative stock of business corporations chartered, which we regard as a measure of

entrepreneurial activity). A set of VAR models indicated that in general causality ran from the

financial to the real variables, with an occasional feedback effect of real developments on finance.

These results led us to conjecture that the acceleration of U.S. growth that occurred in the 1790-1850



                                                  13
period was “finance led.”

        What does “finance led” mean? The discussion above suggests the possibility that Dutch and

British economic growth may also have had roots in financial development. In the Dutch case, a

modern financial system was in place before the Golden Age and the rise of the Dutch economy to

17th-century preeminence. In the British case, a modern financial system was in place before the

first Industrial Revolution and the rise of the English economy to 18th-century preeminence. In the

U.S. case, a modern financial system was in place before the U.S. industrial and transportation

revolutions and the westward movement of the 19th century, by the end of which the United States

was the pre-eminent economy. We see a pattern emerging in this history.

        What about globalization? Does having a good financial system mean that foreign capital is

more likely to flow to that country? Although residuals from balance of payments data indicate only

modest net capital inflows during the period from 1790 to 1812 (Davis and Cull 1994, 2000), more

detailed data on foreign holdings of U.S. securities tell a different story. Benchmark estimates of

such holdings in 1789 and 1803, a period encompassing the financial revolution of the Hamiltonian

Federalists, indicate that foreign investors increased their holdings by $48-52 million from a 1789

base of $17-18 million, the majority of which consisted of Revolutionary War debts owed to France

and the Dutch (Wilkins 1989, Table 3.1, p. 50). The inflow of portfolio capital implied by Wilkins’s

data is fairly consistent with U.S. Treasury and other records for 1803 on total U.S. securities

issuance and the amounts in domestic and foreign hands. Foreign investors held 53 percent of the

U.S. national debt in 1803, and 62 percent of the stock of the Bank of the United States. With shares

of state banks, insurance and transportation companies added in, there was a grand total of $122

million in public and private securities issued, almost all after 1789 as state chartering of

corporations took off. Foreign investors held nearly half of these securities, or $59 million (Sylla,

Wilson, and Wright 1997, Tables 4 and 5).


                                                   14
        The modern concept of an emerging market involves the generation of confidence among

foreign investors. The ingredients of confidence include fiscally responsible governments, stable

money, and sound domestic financial institutions, markets, and instruments. Confidence in a

country’s securities increases, we think, when there are domestic stock and bond markets to enhance

their liquidity. Two centuries ago the United States was such an emerging market and, with an

occasional slip, it has remained a Mecca for foreign investors ever since. A century earlier, Dutch

and other foreign investors saw something similarly attractive in England. A century before that,

foreign investors saw it in the Dutch Republic. Emerging markets are not new in history.


2.4. France and Germany.

        After Great Britain, France and Germany were the leading foreign lenders in the era of

globalization during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Even then, however, these two large and

relatively prosperous European countries lagged well behind Britain, another large country, in

international lending, and, on a per capita basis, even behind the Netherlands. Moreover, the Dutch

and the British became foreign lenders and international investors long before the French and the

Germans. This raises two questions. What accounts for the French and German lag? And why did

the two countries then play major roles in the financial globalization that of the late 19th century?

        We would answer both questions by saying that until the middle of the 19th century neither

France nor Germany had developed all of the components of a good financial system that the

Netherlands developed two centuries earlier, Britain a century earlier, and the United States half a

century earlier. In the case of France, while England was having its financial revolution in the

decades around 1700, the country’s public finances were chaotic, and the collapse of John Law’s

scheme in 1720 made the French public suspicious of paper money and banking for a century or

more (White 2001, Murphy 1997). Nonetheless, after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815,


                                                   15
France’s public finances and currency were stabilized and the central Bank of France had been

present since 1800. There were also a variety of bankers, but nothing like the extensive banking

systems that existed in the United States and Britain. Paris had a stock exchange, but it listed just a

few securities, mostly government debt. France’s relative financial backwardness during the early

19th century resulted from the state’s strict controls on, and limitations of, banking and securities

market development (Cameron et al. 1967). Kindleberger (1984, pp.114-115) provides an extensive

list of reasons for concluding that “France lagged a hundred years behind Britain in money, banking,

and finance … this was both a reflection and a cause of its economic retardation.” More recent

research drawing attention to loan-market substitutes, such as loans arranged by notaries that France

developed to compensate for its lag, serves to confirm the country’s relative backwardness in

financial development (Hoffman, Postel-Vinay, and Rosenthal 2000). The substitutes gradually gave

way to modern forms of finance in the 19th century.

        In the case of Germany, the country was of course not unified in fact until the middle of the

19th century, or in law until 1871. When the United States began its financial revolution in 1790,

there were hundreds of separate German states, each with its own ruler. By the early 19th century (if

not before), the major German states had stable public finances and stable money, but in other

financial-system components respects they lagged even behind France. The Prussian Bank,

forerunner of the central Reichsbank that came in 1875, was not founded until 1846. There were a

variety of private bankers, including such famous houses as the Rothschilds that began in Germany,

and other public and private financial institutions. But as in France, state controls limited banking

development. Securities markets were slow to develop, and the ones of the early decades of the 19th

century were more adjuncts of the private bankers’ businesses than independent sources of finance.

        In both France and Germany financial systems began to take on a more modern form around



                                                   16
1850. The capital needs of large enterprises such as railways and the growing perception that the

two countries were lagging behind Britain provided reasons for change. Change came in more

liberal state approaches to banking development, in particular the innovation (for these countries,

although it had existed in the United States for 6-7 decades and in England for 2-3 decades) was

joint-stock banking. The French leader Louis Bonaparte, after declaring himself Emperor Napoleon

III in 1851, sought to justify his authoritarian regime by fostering rapid economic development.

With his backing, the joint-stock Credit Mobilier bank was formed in 1852; it combined commercial

and investment banking. Although the Credit Mobilier failed in 1868, it had an impact in and

outside of France. With the French Credit Mobilier as an example, the Germans founded similar

institutions (Landes 1965; Cameron et al. 1967; Born 1983; Kindleberger 1984). During the middle

decades of the 19th century, France and Germany thus added missing elements of a good financial

system. As their financial systems mobilized capital more effectively, the two economies grew faster

and their financiers began to invest large sums of capital in other countries.


2.5. Japan

        Japan until the 1850s was almost totally “out of the loop” of western economic development.

Yet it quickly became a major economic and political power during the era of globalization a century

ago, and then within a century became the world’s second largest national economy. That makes

Japan perhaps the most interesting of the cases studied here. How did it happen?

        Among the important reasons is that Japan, like the other cases here but unlike so many of

the world’s countries, had a financial revolution that resulted in a good financial system. After the

Meiji revolution toppled the isolationist shogun regime in 1868, there were in the 1870s both bold

initiatives and false starts in building a modern financial system. The bold initiative included

commuting feudal dues paid in rice to government bonds paid in money. This created a securities


                                                   17
market, and the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges formed in 1878 to trade the new issues. The false

starts included excessive issues of fiat currency and an attempt to copy the U.S. national banking

system with bank notes backed by government bonds. The banks purchased large amounts of

government bonds and issued large amounts of bank notes against them, without much attention to

the specie reserves they were supposed to maintain. Fiat money and bank-created money led to

rampant inflation from 1876 to 1881 (Tamaki 1995).

        Financially, Japan turned the corner during the 1880s. The Yokohama Specie Bank was

founded in 1880 and given the task of accumulating specie through financing the countries exports

so that a currency convertible to specie could in time be established. The alternative of gaining

specie by means of a foreign loan was rejected on grounds that foreign lenders could not be trusted

or given influence in Japanese affairs. The Specie Bank’s operations were clever. It paid Japanese

exporters in Japanese currency advanced from the government when goods were exported, then drew

bills of exchange collectible in specie on the foreign purchasers and collected them at branches it

established in foreign cities, and finally remitted the specie to the government to repay for the

government’s advance (Tamaki 1995; Sylla 1999a). Financial innovation thus encouraged exports

and the government’s accumulation of specie.

        In 1881, Masayoshi Matsukata became Japan’s finance minister, an office he held for many

years. Matsukata played a role in Japan’s financial revolution comparable to that of Hamilton in the

United States. In 1882, he established the central Bank of Japan. He also instituted a regime of fiscal

austerity and deflation to end the inflationary excesses of the 1870s. By 1885, paper-money

circulation was reduced enough, and the government’s specie accumulations had increased enough,

for the Bank of Japan to introduce silver-convertible bank notes. Private bank note issue rights were

taken away in 1883, and the government’s fiat issues were gradually retired. Bank of Japan notes



                                                   18
were 2 percent of Japan’s note circulation when they were introduced in 1885; by 1897 they had

increased to 75 percent. Along with these changes, Matsukata instituted reforms of Japan’s banking

system (Sylla 1999a).

       With fiscal and currency stability achieved by the mid 1880s, Japan recovered quickly from

the deflation of the decade’s first years. Company formation tripled between 1885 and 1890. During

a credit crisis in 1889, the Bank of Japan found a way to aid these companies and the Japanese

securities markets. The bylaws of the Bank forbade lending on securities, but it could increase

market liquidity by “special discounting” of bills covered by high-quality public and private

securities. The innovation allowed companies to repay the banks during the credit crunch, and it

thus cemented ties between companies, banks, and the Bank of Japan by encouraging the banks to

hold company shares (Morikawa 1992). Although this might seem to indicate the origins of modern

Japan’s strong bank-firm relationships, we now know that securities markets and equity finance were

important independent sources of firm financing from the 1880s to the 1920s (Miwa and Ramseyer

2000a, 2000b, 2001).

       In 1897, aided by an indemnity in gold paid by China after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-

1995, Japan adopted the gold standard and started the system of long-term credit banks. These banks

were joint stock companies, although under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance. Issuing

debentures, most of which were purchased by the Ministry with surplus government funds and postal

savings deposits, the new banks invested the proceeds in infrastructure and other investments

(Cameron et al. 1967).

       Once on the gold standard maintained by the world’s leading economies, Japan lost its earlier

aversion to borrowing abroad and quickly became an emerging market. Loans were raised in

London in 1897 and 1899. Foreign loans totaled 140 million British pounds from 1899 to 1907,



                                                  19
enough to cover 70 percent of the costs of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 (Suzuki 1994,

Tamaki 1995; Sylla 1999).

        It is often wondered why, of all the possible candidates, Japan was the one non-western

country to modernize its economy and join the ranks of the wealthy western countries. We think an

important part of the answer, and one supported by Rousseau (1999) with time series evidence, is

that early in its history, during the Meiji era, Japan developed a sophisticated financial system like

that of the western leaders. As in the other cases essayed here, that financial system included stable

public finances, sound money, banks, a central bank, and securities markets. It enabled Japan, a poor

and relatively isolated country in 1870, to become an emerging market and a rapidly growing

economic and political power by the early 20th century. As Herbert Feis long ago put it,

                Japan, of all the countries of the Orient, proved itself capable of using to good
                advantage the capital of Europe. Its government succeeded in the threefold
                task of promoting internal industrial development, extending and reinforcing
                Japanese economic interests in Korea and China, and adjusting its plans to
                the political rivalries of the European continent …. The growing strength
                obtained from the use of that capital made Japan a better credit risk for
                investors and a more important ally. By 1914 the small island empire had
                become a great power in its own right and might (Feis 1930, p. 429).

Japan had learned an important lesson of history, namely that financial development can be the basis

of economic growth and participation as a major player in the global economy. With all the

elements of a good financial system in place before the 20th century, Japan’s economic success

seems less an exception to the rule of West-dominated economic modernization and more a

confirmation the key role of financial development in promoting economic modernization.


3. Data and Methodology

3.1. Overview

        In Section 2, we identify a well-functioning financial system as central to the economic



                                                   20
growth of five Atlantic economies and Japan at various times over the past three centuries. We next

ask whether the available data support a leading role for finance in the growth of incomes for a

broader set of countries, and whether financial development promoted globalization by facilitating

trade and reducing international dispersion in long-term interest rates. We do this using the cross-

country regression framework of Barro (1991), with the availability of appropriate data over a long

historical period limiting our sample to seventeen countries from 1850 to the present. The study is to

our knowledge the first to apply recent cross-country regression techniques in a systematic study of

the finance-growth nexus that includes the period before 1960.3 The results, which we describe

below, support the view that finance affects growth most emphatically in the earlier stages of

economic development. In this respect, they are consistent with Cameron (1967) and Rousseau and

Wachtel (1998), who conducted comparative analyses on smaller sets of countries. We also find a

role for both financial development and trade in reducing interest rates and promoting their

convergence across the Atlantic economies in the pre-1914 period.

       Before presenting these findings, however, we observe that macroeconomic theory has made

much progress over the past decade in laying the analytical foundations for scientific discussion of

the finance-growth nexus.4 Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990) and King and Levine (1993b), for

example, formulate general equilibrium models in which banks and other financial intermediaries

arise endogenously to improve the allocation of available credit. This so-called “total factor

productivity” (or TFP) channel thus operates through the selection and funding of projects with high

private and social returns. Other models, such as those of Bencivenga and Smith (1991) and



   3
    This part of our study can thus be viewed as the historical analogue to the cross-country analysis
of King and Levine (1993a).
   4
     Earlier, more descriptive studies of the relationship between financial factors and growth
include, among others, Gurley and Shaw (1955), Goldsmith (1969), and McKinnon (1973).

                                                  21
Rousseau (1998), emphasize “debt accumulation” or the ability of a well-functioning financial

system to mobilize resources for projects that would otherwise have remained in the drawer.

Empirical investigations, including Levine and Zervos (1998) and Bell and Rousseau (2001), offer

evidence on the TFP and debt accumulation channels, respectively, with the latter suggesting

accumulation as even a precondition for improved allocation in developing countries. If this is

indeed the case, the confidence of potential market participants, as enhanced by the first four

characteristics of a good financial system that we describe in Section 2, is critical to achieving a

threshold level of lending activity from which a fuller menu of financial institutions can emerge.

        Our study does not distinguish empirically between these complementary yet distinct

channels of finance-led growth due to the limitedness of measures of financial development that are

available over the past century and a half for the broad set of countries that we consider. Since

emerging financial institutions are likely to have affected both the accumulation and allocation of

resources in the economies that we study, however, we do not view our joint tests for both channels

as particularly limiting.

        Finance, some would argue, perhaps should not be considered a truly exogenous component

in the growth process. Indeed, the consensus view of economists some fifty years ago, and which to

some degree persists, can be summarized by Joan Robinson’s (1952) assertion that “By and large, . .

. where enterprise leads, finance follows.” In the long-run, increases in economic activity will

undoubtedly generate demand for financial services and lead to a larger intermediating sector. This

channel might be important in the later stages of development when financial systems have matured,

and possibly in providing one of the impulses needed to develop a financial system in the first place.5



   5
    Our historical survey of financial system development in Section 2 indicates that the politics of
war, if anything, was more important than the economics of enterprise and growth as an impulse for
financial modernization.

                                                   22
In contrast, the TFP and debt accumulation channels are likely to operate most emphatically in the

early to middle stages of a country’s economic modernization, with the TFP channel retaining

importance as the economy matures. In the formal analysis, we will address the endogeneity of

financial institutions by using instruments and predetermined variables in our cross-country

regression models.


3.2. The Data

       To study relationships between the financial and real sectors, we first identify measures of

financial development, outward orientation and real-sector performance that can be constructed with

the available historical data. To this end, we build a panel using annual data for 1850-1997 from

three main sources. From 1960, we use the World Bank’s World Development Indicators database.

For earlier years we use data from worksheets underlying Bordo and Jonung (1987) and Obstfeld and

Taylor (2000), and supplement with financial, trade, and public sector aggregates from B.R.

Mitchell’s (1998a, 1998b, 1998c) volumes of International Historical Statistics. The resulting data

set includes seventeen countries. The Data Appendix describes the sources in detail.

       Table 1 lists the seventeen countries along with their average annual growth rates of real per

capita income and financial depth (as measured by the ratio of the broadest available monetary

aggregate to output) for the 1850-89, 1890-1929 and 1945-94 periods.6 It also includes the level of

real per capita income measured in 1960 U.S. dollars at the midpoints of these periods (i.e., 1870,



   6
     The starting years of the averages that appear in Table 1 under the column headings “1850-
1889" are as follows: Argentina 1884; Australia GDP growth 1870; Australia Money/GDP 1880;
Brazil 1880; Canada 1870; Denmark 1850; Finland 1860; France 1850; Germany 1850; Italy GDP

money to GDP are averages of the available annual observations over the 1850-89, 1890-1929 and 1945-97 periods.




                                                                24
1910, and 1970).7 The remarkable feature of the table is the growth in the ratios of the broad money

stock to GDP in all but three of the seventeen economies between 1850-89 and 1890-1929 periods,

with the ratio rising by more than 50 percent in nine of the countries. In contrast, financial depth

grew in only ten of our countries between the 1890-1929 and 1945-94 periods, and only three

countries experienced growth in the ratio of more than 50 percent.

          Bordo and Jonung (1987) examine the behavior of the velocity of circulation, which is

roughly the inverse of our measure of financial depth, for five of the countries (Canada, Norway,

Sweden, the U.K., and the U.S.) in our study and observe a U-shaped pattern from 1870 to

1975.assets.8 They then present evidence that the downward portion of the curve can be explained

by financial development in the form of monetization, as measured by the changes in the

agricultural/industrial mix of the economy and the ratio of financial assets to total assets, while the

upward portion may reflect an availability of substitutes for money as an asset. The evidence in

Table 1 is consistent with this interpretation for our broader sample in the pre-1930 period. The ratio

of the money stock to output may thus be a particularly useful proxy for financial development in the

earlier decades of our study in that it reflects industrialization as well as an increased use of financial

assets.

          Turning to the potential real effects of finance, for which we are most interested, we observe

that among the nine countries in Table 1 that saw financial depth rise by 50 percent or more, six of

them saw real per capita GDP also rise by more than 50 percent. Interestingly, all three of the

countries that saw financial depth rise by more than 50 percent in the postwar period also had

     When computing output growth rates, we use GDP in real local currency units. When computing
levels in 1960 U.S. dollars, we use the U.S. dollar equivalents from the World Development
Indicators database for 1960-1997. For earlier years, we use official exchange rates to convert local
currency output into U.S. dollars and then deflate the result using the U.S. implicit price deflator.

income growth of more than 50 percent. The data thus indicate wide disparities in the growth

experiences of the economies in our sample but also suggest a correlation between financial depth

and real incomes. We now proceed to investigate these relationships more formally.


3.3. Methodology

        Our examination of links between financial development, trade and income focuses on the

broad implications that can arise in a cross country framework. This type of analysis has become a

near-tradition in the empirical study of growth and its determinants since Barro (1991) isolated key

variables, such as education and political stability, as members of a benchmark set of robust

correlates. Given that most studies of financial factors in growth are extensions of this framework

(see, for example, King and Levine 1993a, and Levine and Zervos 1998), we begin by exploring

partial correlations between growth and the ratios of broadly-defined money and international trade

to output from 1850 to the present and over two sub-periods covering 1850-1929 and 1945-94.

        The ratio of the liquid liabilities to output is a common measure of the size and possibly the

sophistication of the financial sector in an individual country, yet it is imprecise because of nonbank

intermediaries such as insurance and investment companies whose liabilities do not wind up in the

broad money aggregate. These omissions are likely to be far less important in the prewar period, but

quite substantial in recent years. Further, a financial system should be characterized by all of the

institutions that promote the accumulation of capital, including securities markets. Rousseau and

Sylla (1999) show that securities markets played an important role in early U.S. growth presumably

because they attracted foreign capital, while Levine and Zervos (1998) and Rousseau and Wachtel

(2000) present evidence of their importance in cross-country models that use recent data.

Unfortunately, we do not yet know the extent of securities market development in the prewar period

for most of the countries in our sample, and so to conduct an analysis that allows for consistent


                                                   26
comparisons across time periods we must for now be satisfied with the ratio of broad money to GDP.

        A reasonable way to measure economic performance is through growth in real per capita

incomes. Although such a measure ignores the impact of the distribution of income on welfare, it

nevertheless provides a convenient summary of economic conditions in a given country and has the

important advantage of being readily available for a fairly large set of countries as far back as the

mid-19th century. We use it here as the primary measure of economic outcomes.

        Measures of economic “globalization” are even more difficult to identify for a large set of

countries. It is clear, however, that the degree to which a country has an “outward orientation” is

related to the extent of its integration with other markets, and trade data is readily available for most

of the counties in our sample – in most cases even farther back in time than output. To participate

in trade arrangements, short-term finance is critical, and much of this financing is provided through

the banking sector in the form of credits and acceptances. When seen in this light, banks can

contribute to economic globalization by providing the credits needed to promote trade. To examine

the importance of these effects, we also consider models in which the ratio of trade (the sum of

imports and exports) to GDP enters either as a regressor or as the dependent variable.

        Existing empirical studies of the relationship between trade and growth have reached mixed

conclusions, presumably because most measures of openness are themselves endogenous and

influenced by non policy factors (see Edwards 1998 for a useful survey). This has led to sensitivity of

trade effects in cross-country regressions to the choice of conditioning variables. Frankel and Romer

(1999) have recently shown, however, that geographic characteristics are good instruments for

isolating the impact of the predetermined component of trade on the level of real income, and that

this effect is large but not always significant statistically. Such an effect is likely to be more elusive

in our study, where the focus is on growth rather than levels. We nevertheless attempt to extract the



                                                    27
predetermined component of the ratio of trade to output with instruments and then examine its

explanatory power when added to our cross-country specifications.

        The tendency for real interest rates to converge in the Atlantic economies prior before 1914

and again more recently is documented by Obstfeld and Taylor (1997), and has been interpreted by

them as an indicator of the extent of economic integration. What remains unstudied is the role of

financial institutions, and primarily banks, in promoting interest rate convergence. Since Homer and

Sylla (1996) and Obstfeld and Taylor (2000) together make annual interest rate series for long-term

debt available for twelve of the countries in our study well into the 19th century, we conclude by

examining the roles of finance and trade in the process of convergence in the pre-1914 period.


4. Results and Discussion

4.1 Finance, Trade, and Growth

        Our first set of specifications use decadal average growth rates of real per capita GDP from

1850 to 1997 as the dependent variable and condition on the level of real per capita income (in 1960

U.S. dollars) at the start of each decade.9 The “convergence” or “catch up” effect, as manifested by a

negative sign for the coefficient on initial income, has been shown to be quite strong in cross-country

regressions for the post-1960 period (see, for example, Barro 1991). By including initial income in

our baseline specification, we can determine if it is important in the pre-Depression period as well.

Placing the ratio of broad money to GDP on the right-hand side allows us to evaluate the role, if any,

that finance plays in the conditional growth process. Since the levels variables are trending in nature

and we would like to control for other business-cycle related effects, we include (but do not report

coefficients on) dummy variables for each decade.


  9
     We compute a “decadal” average for a country in any decade for which observations are available
for seven or more years. When we divide the sample and work with five-year subperiods, observations
must be available in at least three years before computing a five-year average.

   The table reports coefficients from OLS regressions with standard errors in parentheses. The
   dependent variable is the growth rate of real per capita GDP averaged for each decade from 1850
   to the present. Initial values are taken from the first year of each decade. Decade dummies are
   included in the regression but are not reported. * and ** denote statistical significance at the 10
   percent and 5 percent levels respectively.


        Table 2 presents the regressions, which use the first observations of each decade as

regressors to ameliorate the impact of possible reverse causality from growth to additional finance.

This technique cannot fully eliminate the simultaneity problem due to autocorrelation in the time

series for financial depth, but it does ensure that all regressors are predetermined and thus plausible

determinants of subsequent growth. The first column of Table 2 presents our baseline, which

includes only initial income, financial depth and time effects on the right hand side, while columns

(2)-(4) report results for specifications with the ratios of international trade and/or government

expenditure to GDP as additional conditioning variables. We include the ratio of trade to output to

control for direct effects of international trade on growth that do not operate indirectly through



                                                     29
finance. We include the government expenditure variable because it is likely that the resource

requirements associated with large public expenditure “crowd out” private investment and lead to

less efficient resource allocations than the private sector might be able to provide.

        A strong convergence effect, as indicated by negative and significant coefficients on initial

income, and a positive and significant role of financial depth in subsequent growth is common to all

four regressions that we report in Table 2. When included with financial depth on the right-hand

side, trade is not significant and government expenditure, as expected, is negative and significant.

The inclusion of the conditioning variables in equations (2)-(4) all tend to reduce the measured effect

of finance on growth, yet significance of the broad financial aggregate persists. The R2 from the

regressions suggest that a large portion of the cross-sectional variation in output growth can be

explained by our simple models.

        Table 3 presents a similar set of specifications, but instead of using initial values of the data

in each period as regressors, we use contemporaneous averages and control for simultaneity with

instruments. By including the initial values of the complete set of regressors as well as initial

inflation as instruments, these two stage least squares regressions extract the predetermined (i.e.,

explainable through information in the initial information set for each period) components of the

right-hand side variables and use them in place of the actual regressors in the estimation. This

alternative yields results that are quantitatively very similar to those presented in Table 2. As a

group, the regressions reported in Tables 2 and 3 are thus consistent with a leading role for financial

factors in growth for our seventeen country sample over a 150-year period.10


   10
       Our findings are consistent with growth being “finance-led,” but do not preclude the possibility
that growth may also be promoting further financial development. In fact, when we momentarily set
the relevant growth theory aside by moving finance to the left-hand side of our regressions and
placing the growth rate of output on the right, we find that output growth enters with a positive and
significant sign in the pre-1930 period, though not over the full sample or in the postwar period. This
result is consistent with, though not overwhelmingly supportive of, the priors of generations of

       Tables 4 and 5 evaluate the robustness of the OLS and IV results in subperiods covering

1850-1929 and 1945-94. To make more observations available for each estimation, we work with

five-year rather than decadal averages of the data. In the pre-1929 period, we note again the

significance of the convergence and finance effects on growth and the robustness of the results to




economists who have stressed what we would call “reverse causality” in the finance-growth nexus.
Indeed, in time series analyses of five countries in our sample (Canada, Norway, Sweden, the U.K.,
and the U.S.) from 1870 to 1929, Rousseau and Wachtel (1998) do not find a role for growth in
promoting additional finance in the short to medium term. Our main cross-sectional results, which
reduce simultaneity problems by using initial values of finance as regressors in OLS specifications
and as instruments in IV specifications, are meant to suggest that finance plays an important leading
role in the growth process-- a role that is likely to be central.

 The dependent variable is the growth rate of real per capita GDP averaged for each five-year period
 from 1850-54 through 1925-29. Initial values are taken from the first year of each five-year period.
 Standard errors are reported in parentheses. Period dummies are included in the regressions but not
 reported. * and ** denote statistical significance at the 10 percent and 5 percent levels respectively.
 The left panel of the table reports coefficients and standard errors from OLS regressions using initial
 values as regressors. The right panel reports coefficients and standard errors from two-stage least
 squares regressions. The IV regressions use the five-year averages of the data as regressors.
 Instruments include initial values of the full set of regressors as well as the inflation rate.

the choice of estimation technique. Government expenditure remains negative but less significant in

the pre-Depression period, perhaps because the government, in the absence of a less sophisticated

financial system, must play a more central role in delivering resources to productive projects.

        A less prominent role for finance in the postwar period is the striking feature of Table 5.

Financial depth retains significance when appearing alone on the right hand side, but this effect

vanishes when trade is included in the regressions either explicitly or in the instrument set. King

Levine (1993a) find the effects of finance on growth robust to the inclusion of trade using post-1960

data for a wider group of industrialized and emerging economies, and that the trade variable itself is

not statistically significant. We attribute this difference to the industrialized nature of nearly all of

the countries in our sample by 1960.

        On the face of it, the results imply that the effects of finance on modern growth may arise

primarily through indirect trade effects. It is in this sense that our results are also consistent with the

“export-led” growth hypothesis that has emerged from the literature on economic development.

Macro economists, on the other hand, hesitate to draw strong conclusions because of potential

problems of collinearity between trade and the other regressors. It is also possible that the trade

aggregate in recent decades has proxied for a concept much broader than trading volume, namely the

degree to which an economy is integrated internationally. In mature economies, a banking system

may indeed be a less important factor in such integration.

        We move toward disentangling these effects by exploring the degree to which finance affects

“outward orientation” across sample periods in Table 6. In these regressions, the ratio of trade to

output serves as dependent variable, and we again control for initial income. The financial variables

are significant over the full sample and the 1850-1929 period but are not significant in the postwar

period. These results suggest that financial systems do play a role in promoting trade in the earlier

stages of financial and economic development, and that to the extent that trade promoted growth,

finance was a leading sector in making such expansions possible.

4.2 Finance and Interest-Rate Convergence

          In this section, we examine the possible roles of finance and international trade in promoting

the decline and convergence of long-term interest rates among the economies in our sample over the

1850-1914 period. Figure 1, which presents nominal interest rates for ten of the truly “Atlantic”

economies in our sample indicates that decline and convergence is indeed the general pattern of

long-term rates.11 The convergence is most striking among the European and North American

countries, whose capital flows as a share of GDP over this period exceeded those achieved at any

point in the postwar period,12 and for which financial deepening over the period was particularly

vigorous. To examine more explicitly whether these factors contributed importantly to the pattern in

Figure 1, we turn again to cross-country regression analysis.

          In our first specification, for which we report results in Table 7, the dependent variable is the

nominal interest rate averaged over 5-year periods for each country. Such a regression allows us to

test for the role of finance and openness in one of the characteristics that is clear from Figure 1,

namely the decline in interest rates. To control for Fisher-type effects, we include current period

inflation on the right-hand side. Since economic theory also suggests a long-run link between the

growth rate of the economy and the real rate of interest, we include, as in cross-country growth

regressions, the initial log level of per capita real GDP on the right-hand side. The left panel of

Table 7 presents regression results for all 12 countries for which we have interest rate data (i.e., the

10 countries from Figure 1 plus Japan and Australia), while the right panel excludes the non-

“Atlantic” economies. We use initial values of financial development as regressors for the OLS

regressions, and contemporaneous averages of finance and trade for the IV models, with initial

values of all regressors and the ratio of government expenditure to output as instruments.

        The results indicate a negative partial correlation between initial financial depth and

subsequent interest rates, but the results for trade and initial income (right panel) are larger when we

exclude Japan and Australia. These countries were far more isolated both economically and

geographically from the others, and it is thus likely that convergence would have been slower for

them. The regressions in the right-hand panel seem to fit the conditional convergence model more

snugly, with initial income entering with the expected negative and significant coefficient, and

inflation entering with an expected positive coefficient that is significant at the 10 percent level. The

final IV specification reveals a partial correlation between trade and subsequent interest rates that is

negative and significant at the 5 percent level. These results are consistent with roles for finance and

to capital as globalization succeeded in directing resources to the most productive uses and

reductions in risk premiums that were made possible by the improved risk-sharing arrangements

which accompany increasingly sophisticated financial systems.

        In Table 8, we present regressions that examine the other key feature of Figure 1 – absolute

convergence in nominal long-term rates. To do this, we subtract the mean of the average interest

rates of countries with observations in a given 5-year period from the individual country average, and

use it as the dependent variable. The right-hand sides, estimation techniques, instrument sets, and

country samples are the same as in Table 7. These results show that, controlling for time, initial

income, and inflation, countries with greater financial depth at the start of a 5-year period had long-

term interest rates over that period that were closer to the periodic mean of the sample than those that

were less well-developed financially by our measure. Trade effects, though important in reducing

the level of rates, do not appear to contribute to their convergence over the 1850-1914 period.

5. Conclusion

        Our paper brings together two strands of the economic literature – that on the finance-growth

nexus and that on capital market integration – and explores the key issues surrounding each strand

through both institutional/country histories and formal quantitative analysis. We find a robust

correlation between financial factors and economic growth that is consistent with a leading role for

finance in a broad cross section of seventeen economies over the 1850-1997 period, with the effects

of finance strongest prior to the Great Depression. This result suggests that our earlier findings for

the United States between 1790 and 1850 (Rousseau and Sylla, 1999) may have broader implications

in other parts of the 19th- and early 20th-century world.

        We next showed that countries with more sophisticated financial systems engage in more

trade and appear to be better integrated with other economies by econometrically identifying roles

for both finance and trade in the absolute convergence in long-term interest rates that is observed

among the Atlantic economies between 1850 and the start of the First World War. The results, when

combined with the evidence presented from historical case studies of the Dutch Republic, England,

the U.S., France, Germany and Japan over the past three centuries, suggest that the economic growth

and increasing globalization of the Atlantic economies might indeed have been “finance-led.”


6. Data Appendix

        In this section, we list the data sources for the series used in our regression analysis. The data

draw from six sources: World Bank’s World Development Indicators 1999 database, worksheets

underlying Obstfeld and Taylor (2000), Bordo and Jonung (1987), Rousseau and Wachtel (1998),

and Rousseau (1999), and published interest rates from Homer and Sylla (1996). Of course, these

sources themselves draw upon a vast body of government documents and the collective work of

generations of economic historians whose efforts have made it possible to consolidate key


                                                   39
macroeconomic and financial aggregates into a database that covers the Atlantic economies for the

past century and a half. We do not list the primary sources here, but refer the interested reader to the

materials listed above for details.

        In nearly all cases, data for a given series are from more than one source. Further, the

definitions across sources of a given data item are not always consistent. For example, we use the

broad M3 aggregate as a measure of financial development for the later years of our sample, but in

many cases have only a narrower aggregate such as M2 for earlier years. When the data are obtained

from multiple sources and differ in value at the point of joining, we always use the most recent data

as it appears and adjust earlier data with a ratio-splice.

        We present the data sources below by country.
