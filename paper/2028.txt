             Immigrants, Minorities, and Labor Market Competition




                                   ABSTRACT



    This paper analyzes the extent of labor market competition among

immigrants, minorities and the native population. The study reveals that

immigrants tend to be substitutes with some labor market groups, and comple-

ments with others. However, all these effects of shifts in immigrant supply

on the earnings of native-born men are numerically very small, so that even

if immigrants are substitutes with some native-born groups their numerical

impact on the native-born wage is trivial. In addition, increases in the

supply of immigrants do have a sizable impact on the earnings of immigrants

themselves. Increases of 10 percent in the supply of immigrants reduce the

immigrant wage by about 10 percent. Thus the main competitors of immigrants

in the labor market are other immigrants.

1.   Introduction

     The literature on the economics of immigration has, in the past decade,

been dominated by analyses of two questions: How do immigrants do in the U.S.

labor market and what do immigrants do to the U.S. labor market? Beginning

with the work of Chiswick (1978), most of the empirical studies have focused

on the first of these issues (see also Borjas, 1985). The literature on the

second question of what immigrants do to the labor market is much less devel-

oped. Little is still known about the labor market adjustments caused by the

large influx of immigrants in the last twenty years. Some studies in this

literature (e.g., Johnson, 1980) develop theoretical models of the labor

market interaction between the native- and the foreign-born populations. In

effect, these models build in the basic assumption that the two groups are

substitutes in production, even though the type of technological relationship

between the two groups is entirely an empirical question.

     The empirical determination of the extent of substitutability or comple—

mentarity between any two labor inputs is, of course, based on neoclassical

input demand theory. The main methodological tool of such studies is the

estimation of the production technology in which various race, gender, and

other (demographically defined) labor inputs, as well as capital, enter as

inputs in the producton process (see Borjas, 1983; Grant and Hamerinesh, 1981;

and the survey by Hamermesh, 1986). The parameters of the production tech-

nology provide important information about the technological relationships

among the various inputs, and are used to infer the extent of substitutability
                                     2




or complementarity between any two inputs. The application of this framework

to the relationship between native- and foreign-born workers has been conducted

by Borjas (1986a, lYS6b) and Grossman (1982). These studies, despite major

differences in methodological approach and in the data sets analyzed, conclude

that immigrants have a very small numerical impact on the earnings of the

native-born population.' However, these studies aggregate rather different

groups of individuals (e.g., Mexicans, Vietnamese, Chinese, Cubans., Italians,

etc.) into a single immigrant population. It is well known that the national

origin of the immigrant population (as well as the racial/ethnic background of

native-born men) is an important characteristic in the determination of earnings.

Thus the existing result that immigrants have had little impact on native

earnings may well be masking important country or race specific distinctions

in the extent of substitutability. This paper extends the analysis available

in the literature by presenting estimates of the extent of labor market

competition between immigrants and natives where both the native- and

foreign-born population have been disaggregated by race and national
                                                -

origins.

     Section II of the paper presents the basic conceptual framework used in
the analysis. This framework utilizes the Generalized Leontief production

function as the cornerstone of the analysis. Using this framework, Section

III presents the basic empirical results of the analysis, while Section IV

discusses the sensitivity of the results to changes in the underlying as—

suinptions of the study. Finally, Section SI summarizes the main results of

the paper.



II. Framework

     Assume that the production tecimology is characterized by the Generalized

Leontief production function (Diewert, 1971):
                                                3



                              Q =   I   Y(XiXY2,
                                                                       (1)




where Q is output, X. are the various inputs, and y.. are the technology co-

efficients. The production function in (1) is linearly homogeneous and

restricts the values of the technology parameters so that y.. =

The sign of y. determines whether inputs i and j are substitutes (y.. < 0)

or complements (y.. >   0).
     The assumption that firms in the labor market maximize profits and face

constant input prices leads to the following system of labor demand functions:


                              r. =
                               1     y..
                                      1-i
                                            +       y. .(X./Xj½
                                                     1] 3   1
                                                                        (2)




The system of equations in (2) illustrates the usefulness of the Generalized

Leontief functional form: wage equations are linear-in-parameters and hence

can be easily estimated by standard least squares techniques. Further, the

functional form in (2) provides an intuitive understanding of the underlying

process. In particular, the wage of group i, r., is affected by the number

of type j individuals in the labor market pç member of group i (X./X.).

Thus the relative quantities of other factors of production affect group

i's wage through the technological parameter y.., and when group i is com-

plementary (substitutable) with group j, an increase in the supply of

group j increases (decreases) group i's wage. Finally, the simplicity of

the wage equation arising from the production function (2) indicates that the

Generalized Leontief technology may provide a much needed link between demand

theory and the many studies of wage determination in the literature.

     Although the signs of the parameters y. contain useful information

about the possibilities for technical substitution among the n inputs, it

is instructive to transform these parameters into quantities which are more
                                             4



tractable. Define the Hicks partial elasticity of complementarity (Hicks

1970):


                                             QQ..
                                  c. .   =                                       (3)
                                   ij        Q.Q.


where Q. = DQ/3X., Q.. = a2Q/8X.3X..             The Ricks elasticity of complementarity

measures the effect on the relative price of factor i of a change in the rela-

tive quantity of factor j, holding constant the marginal cost and the quanti-

ties of other factors. Since the analysis in this paper is mainly concerned with

estimating the impact of changes in the supply of immigrants on the earnings of

the native-born population, the elasticity of complementarity (rather than its

dual, the elasticity of substitution) is the natural measure to quantify this

impact.

     A useful property of the elasticity of complementarity is given by:


                                 d ln r.
                                 d ln X.
                                                 =   s.c..                      (4)




where s. =   r.X./Q,   the relative share of income accruing to factor j. Hence

the elasticity of factor price (dlnr./dlnx.), which measures the percentage

change on the earnings of group i due to a one-percent increase in the supply

of group j, is proportional to the elasticity of complementarity. Knowledge of

the elasticities of complementarity, therefore, provides a complete picture of

price shifts occurring among the native-born as a result of a supply shift in

the immigrant population.

     It can be shown that under the Generalized Leontief technology, the

elasticities of complementarity are given by:
                                                S

As implied by the earlier discussion, the sign of y.. determines the sign of

the (cross) elasticity of complementarity, which, in turn, determines the sign

of the elasticity of factor price.

       The estimation of the demand system in (2) is affected by two major econo-

metric problems. -   First,   equations (2) are not wage-determination functions unless

(relative) supply conditions are also specified. It is common in the input demand

literature (see, for example, Grant and Hamermesh, 1981, p. 355) to estimate the

production technology under the assumption that input supply is exogenous. The

usual justification for this assumption is that the supplies of age-specific sex/

race groups are essentially fixed at a point in time. However, this assumption

ignores the fact that although the total stock of specific labor inputs may be

treated as fixed, its distribution across labor markets is likely to be guided

by input price differentials. In the empirical analysis below the assumption of

inelastic relative supplies will be used, and the sensitivity of the results

to more complex supply models will be addressed.

       The second econometric problem that has also been ignored in the labor

demand literature concerns the aggregation of workers into the labor inputs

X. An implicit assumption in specifying production functions such as (1)

is that all group i workers are homogeneous within and across labor markets.

Of course, there exist marked differences in the skill levels of individuals

within each of these groups, and this may lead to group i individuals having

different average skills across different labor markets. Hence wage differen-

tials across labor markets may simply reflect an unequal distribution of skill
                                         6




levels, seriously biasing the estimates of the production function.

     This problem can be approached (in the Generalized Leontief framework) by

characterizing an individual's effective labor supply in terms of a fixed effect

indicating the skill level of the individual. In particular, the wage paid to

individual 2 in group i, r.2, depends on: (a) the market-determined wage

level for the average group i person, r.; and (h) how the skills of indi-

vidual 2 vary from the skills of the average group i person, f2. Hence,

in general, r2 =
                    r.2(w,f2),     and the individual's wage rate depends both on

market forces and on his (relative) skill level.

     To make this approach useful it is necessary to add structure to the model.

Two possible simplifications are r. =
                                 i2
                                             r.f
                                              i2 and   r. =
                                                       ti
                                                              r.i   +   f2   .   The addi-

tive fixed effect assumes that the wage premium due to differential skills is

independent of the demographic characteristics of the labor market, while the

multiplicative specification allows for the possibility of such an interaction)

For simplicity, the analysis in this paper uses the additive specification. If

it is assumed that f1 can be written in terms both of observable socioeconomic

characteristics, Z, and a random uncorrelated error, e2,, the stochastic

equivalent of (5) is given by:


                    =                                                   . ,n.

                            J tl



Equation   (7) specifies the wage-determination process at the individual level

and will be used throughout the empirical analysis. It is important to note

that estimates of the demand system in (7) control for observable differences

in socioeconomic variables within each of the labor inputs, but do not control

for differences in these variables across the groups. It is these differences

in socioeconomic variables, as well as differences in unobserved characteristics
                                    7




captured by the error term, which prevent the production technology from

degenerating into a system where all inputs are perfect substitutes.



III. Data and Basic Results

     The data set used in the analysis is the 1980 5/100 A Sample from the

U.S. Census.4 The analysis was restricted to working-age individuals (18

age C 64) who: (a) are not in the military; (b) are not self-employed or

working without pay; and (c) had records containing complete information on

the variables used in the analysis. The "local labor market" is defined to be

the SMSA where the individual resides.

     To account for the differences in ethnicity and race among persons, as

well as for the difference between native- and foreign-born status, the anal-

ysis is initially conducted using a nine-way breakdown of the labor force:

white native males (WN), black native males (BN), Hispanic native males (HN),

Asian native males (AN), white immigrant males (WI), black immigrant males

(RI), Hispanic immigrant males (HI), Asian immigrant males (AT), and females

(F). Three points should be made regarding this particular decomposition of

the labor force. First, the analysis allows for the disaggregation of the

four largest racial/ethnic groups that can be identified in the 1980 Census.

Secondly, all women are aggregated into one group because previous research

(e.g., Smith, 1977) shows that earnings differentials among different types of

women are much narrower than earnings differentials among different types of

men. This fact suggests that employer differentiation of women is likely to

be less important than employer differentiation of men. Finally, the samples

defined as "white", in fact, contain all non-black, non—Asian, non-Hispanic

observations.
                                    8



     The employment data necessary for the estimation of equations (2) are

obtained from the Census files. The labor input X. (in the SMSA) is defined

as the number of individuals in group i who are of working age and were

employed in 1979. Finally, the capital (K) data is drawn from Grant (1979).

It gives the capital stock in each of 84 SMSAs for over a ten-year period

up to 1969, and was constructed from the Census of Manufactures and the

Annual Survey of Manufactures.5 The capital data, used below is the 1979

extrapolation made from the time-series.6 It is well known that capital stock

calculations are subject to large measurement errors. To complicate matters,

the capital data is available only for manufacturing industries. Since the

analysis in this paper is conducted over all industries, the capital data

leads to biased parameter estimates unless it is assumed that the aggregate

capital stock in the SMSA is (roughly) proportional to the manufacturing

capital stock. The capital data is only available for 84 SMSAs, hence the

analysis is restricted to persons residing in these labor markets.

     Before proceeding to the estimation of the demand system, it is useful to

present summary statistics on the earnings and relative sizes of the 9 labor

groups under study. Table 1 presents these basic statistics which illustrate

the well—known differences in earnings across groups, and also show how the

large Hispanic immigration is creating a labor force with almost as many

Hispanics as blacks.

     Equation (2) was estimated on the micro Census data using 1979 annual

earnings as the dependent variable. The estimation was conducted by stacking

the data for all 9 labor force groups (so that all the coefficients of the

nine earnings functions were estimated jointly), and by simultaneously intro-

ducing the across-equation restrictions implied by the symmetry constraints.

The use of annual earnings, instead of the wage rate, facilitates comparison
                                    9



between the results in this paper and those available in the labor demand

literature which uses the average income share in a given year to estimate

translog equations.7 The variables held constant in the vector Z include:

years of schooling, years of labor market experience (age-schooling—6), and

years of labor market experience squared.

     Table 2 presents the estimated technology parameters. Several findings

are worth stressing. First, all immigrant groups have had a negative impact

on the earnings of the white native-born population. Thus immigrants, as a

group, are substitutes with the single largest demographic group in. the labor

force. Second, this strong degree of substitutability is not evident in the

black native-born population. Table 2 provides no evidence that black native-

born men have been adversely affected by white or Asian immigrants, and only

marginal evidence that black natives and black or Hispanic immigrants are sub-

stitutes. Surprisingly, the technological relationship between black natives

and white immigrants (who make up over 40 percent of the immigrant population)

is one of strong complementarity. Finally, there is no evidence of substitut-

ability between the Hispanic native-born population and the three other native-

born groups under analysis (whites, blacks, and Asians). This result resembles

the finding obtained by Borjas (1983) in his study of the 1976 Survey of

Income and Education.

     It is of substantial interest that the results in Table 2 show a different

kind of technological relationship between black natives and white immigrants

than between black natives and either Hispanic or black immigrants. In par-

ticular, the former relationship indicates complementary inputs, while the

latter relationships indicate (weakly) substitutable inputs. These findings

are consistent with the theoretical expectation that "like" inputs are more

substitutable than unlikeit inputs. White immigrants, for instance, tend
                                        10




to originate in Western European countries and have high levels of education.

On arrival to the U.S. ,    these immigrants - unlike black natives - perform
relatively well in the labor market. Elack and Hispanic immigrants, on the

other hand, are characterized by low levels of education and -     like   black

natives - do not perform well in the labor market. The finding in Table 2,

therefore, implies that the impact of immigration on black natives is likely

to shift over time as the skill composition of the immigrant population in

the United States changes.

        A more insightful way of assessing the substantive implications of these

technological relationships can be obtained by calculating the corresponding

elasticities of factor prices, d ln r./d in X, for the relevant technology

parameters. Table 3 presents the estimated changes in the earnings of the

four native-born male groups as the supplies of the four immigrant groups

increase. These cross-elasticities of demand are most revealing for what they

do not show. In particular, despite the statistical significance of many of

the technological parameters, Table 3 does not show these effects to be numeri-

cally important. For example, the cross-elasticity of the earnings of white

native-born men with respect to the quantity of white foreign-born men is

-   .025.   This implies that a 10 percent increase in the supply of these immi-

grants decreases white native earnings by less than three-tenths of one per-

cent, and that even a doubling in the number of these immigrants reduces white

native earnings by only 2.5 percent.

        This remarkable result is evident in each of the 16 elasticities pre-

sented in Table 3. None of the elasticities take on a value exceeding j.03j.

Thus even if some immigrant groups compete with the native-born in the labor

market, the numerical impact of this competition is trivial.

        It is worth noting that this result has also been obtained in the earlier

paper by Grossman (1982). Using a different methodology (estimating translog
                                    11




production functions) and a different data set (the 1970 Census), Grossman

estimates that a 10 percent increase in the number of immigrants reduces the

native-born wage by between .2 and .3 percent (Grossman) 1982, p. 600). The

similarity between these results and those of TableS 3, despite the major

differences in their derivation, suggests that indeed immigrants have not

played a major role in the determination of wage levels for native-born men in

recent years.

     Immigrants, however, have had a sizable impact in the determination of

their own wage levels. Table 4 presents the set of price elasticities of

demand describing what happens to the earnings of immigrant men as the quant-

ities of immigrant men increase. These elasticities, on the average, are much

larger than the cross—elasticities between native earnings and immigrant

supplies. In particular, the own-elasticities presented in Table 4 reveal

that increases in the supply of type i immigrants significantly reduce the

earnings of those immigrants. For example, a 10 percent increase in the

number of white immigrants reduces the earnings of white immigrants by 10.9

percent; a 10 percent increase in the number of black immigrants reduces black

immigrant earnings by 5.8 percent; a 10 percent increase in the number of

Hispanic immigrants reduces Hispanic immigrant earnings by 13.9 percent;

and a 10 percent increase in the number of Asian immigrants reduces Asian

immigrant earnings by 7.9 percent. Therefore, even if increases in the

supply of immigrants have little impact on the earnings of the native-born,

they induce a sizable reduction in their own earnings.8



IV. Extensions of Empirical Analysis



1.   Endogeneity of Supply

     The validity of the assumption of inelastic labor supplies, implicitly
                                      12




used in the estimation of the results in the previous section, can be

questioned. After all, the wage differentials created across labor markets

by the interactions among labor inputs are likely to induce internal migra-

tion patterns where the groups move to areas where they are likely to do

relatively well. The present of mobility costs and/or imperfect information

suggests that the wage differentials do not vanish in the long run and that

the correct estimation of (2) requires that the supply of inputs to labor

markets be modeled more fully.

     To account for the endogeneity of the supply variables, it is assumed

that at the SMSA level relative supplies of labor inputs are affected by a

vector of socioeconomic characteristics, A, describing the SNSA. Hence:



                                 (x./xj½ =   AD +   c.
                                  31                                    (6)




The vector A includes the proportions of the labor force employed in each

of the one-digit industrial groups, the probability of receiving Supplementary

Security Income (551) assistance (relative to the poverty rate), and the mean

level of 581 payments (relative to the mean wage level in the Sl,ISA).9 The

industrial composition of the SMSA is likely to affect supplies since par-

ticular combinations of industrial concentrations will attract individuals

with specific skills to the locality. Similarly, the chances of receiving

a particular form of public assistance (551), relative to the SMSA's poverty

rate, as well as the "real" levels of that assistance, measure the economic

welfare of low income individuals in the SMSA. If the expected value of

public assistance payments differs significantly across SMSAs, geographic

differences in the location of racial and/or immigrant groups are likely

to arise.

     The demand system in (2) was reestimated using two stage least squares,

and the resulting estimates are summarized in Table 5. This table parallels

the cross-price elasticities presented in Table 3. A comparison of these two

tables shows that the qualitative impact of immigrants on the earnings of

the native-born is generally unaffected by the estimation procedure (except

for the effects on black natives), although the 2SLS cross—price elasticities

tend to be slightly larger than the corresponding OLS estimates. Despite the

absolute increase in the numerical impact, however, it must be stressed that

even the 2SLS elasticities predict numerically small impacts. For example a

10 percent increase in the number of white immigrants reduces white native—horn

earnings by .4 percent according to the 2SLS regression and by .25 percent

according to the OLS regression. Thus even though the 2SLS technique roughly

doubles the size of the cross—price elasticity, the numerical impact remains

trivially small.



2.   The Heterogeneity of Hispanics

     In the previous sections, male Hispanics have been disaggregated by

nativity status rather than by national origin. There are four major national

groups in the Hispanic/Americanpopulation: Mexicans (MX), Puerto Ricans (PR),

Cubans (CU), and "other" Hispanics (Os), where the last group is composed

mostly of Hispanics of Central and South American origin. Previous research

(Reimers, 1983; Borjas and Tienda, 1985) has documented that differences in

labor market outcomes across these four Hispanic groups are as large, if not

larger, than the differences by nativity status. These findings suggest that

an alternative substantively important decomposition of the Hispanic labor

force exists. The demand system in (2) was reestimated, using ordinary least

squares, after replacing the Hispanic native and Hispanic immigrant group with
                                    14




four Hispanic groups based on national origin. The cross—elasticities of

demand between the four Hispanic groups and the other male labor force groups

are presented in Table 6. Several interesting findings are provided by these

selected results. First, Mexicans -- who make up nearly 60 percent of the

male Hispanic population -- have had a negative impact on the earnings of both

white and black native born men. This impact, however, is numerically small:

a 10 percent increase in the number of Mexicans reduces the earnings of white

native born men by .03 percent, and that of black native born men by .07

percent. Second, Puerto Ricans are substitutable inputs only with black

immigrants; there is a complementary or independent relationship between

Puerto Ricans and all other native-born male groups. Third, Cubans have not

had an adverse impact on the earnings of any of the native-born male groups.

In fact, a significant complementary relationship exists between Cuban men and

white, black, and Asian native-born men. Interestingly, Cubans are substitut-

able only with one of the immigrant groups -—   Asian immigrants. It is of
interest to note that this immigrant group, like Cubans, tend to exhibit above

average success in the labor market. It must be stressed, however, that

despite the statistical significance of these cross effects their numerical

magnitude is small.

     Table 7 shows that, on the other hand, the numerical impact of increases

in the supply of the different types of Hispanics on their own wage is much

larger. The own price elasticities of demand for the various Hispanic groups

range around unity (in absolute value) for three of the groups, and is perversely

positive but insignificant for the fourth (Cubans). Thus a 10 percent increase

in the supply of Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, or other Hispanics will lead to about

a 10 percent decease in the wage of the own   group.

V.   Sunnoary

     This   paper has analyzed the extent of labor market competition between

immigrants, minorities and the native-born population. Using a Generalized

Leontief production function, the demand system for the various labor inputs

was estimated. The main empirical results of the analysis were:

     1.     Immigrants tend to be substitutes with some labor market groups,

and complements with others. White native-born men tend to be adversely

affected by the increase in immigrant supply, while black native-born

men, if anything, have gained slightly from increases in the immigrant

supply. All these cross—effects of shifts in immigrant supply on the

earnings of native-born men are numerically very small, so that even if

immigrants are substitutes with some native-born groups their numerical

impact On the native-born wage is trivial.

     2.     Increases in the supply of immigrants do have a sizable impact

on the earnings of immigrants themselves. Increases of 10 percent in the

supply of immigrants reduce the immigrant wage by about 10 percent. Thus

immigrants' main competitors in the labor market are other immigrants.

     3.     These results are robust to changes in the estimation procedure,

and to disaggregations of Hispanics into national origin groups. Increases

in the supply of the various Hispanic groups -- Mexicans, Puerto Ricans,

Cubans, and other Hispanics -- have small effects in the earnings of non-

Hispanics, but sizable effects on the earnings of the groups themselves.

     Despite these varied results, the empirical study of the impact immi-

grants have had on the U.S. labor market is still in its infancy. Difficult

substantive and technical problems remain to be resolved. Perhaps the most

important of these issues is the modelling of the labor supply decisions of

immigrants and native workers. In particular, it is well known that a large

fraction of immigrants reside in a relatively small number of labor markets.
                                    16




The factors motivating these internal migration decisions among the foreign-

born population need to be specified explicitly in the wage determination

processs. In addition, since the geographic concentration of immigrants in

a small number of labor markets is likely to exaggerate their impact within

those labor markets, the native population may respond by initiating its own

set of migration flows. These problems, therefore, suggest that future work

in this area is likely to lead to an increased understanding of the wage

determination process for both native- and foreign-born persons. It is

important to note, however, that at this stage of the research process, the

often assumed large impacts of immigrants on native earnings are not con-

firmed by Census data. Even a detailed disaggregation of the immigrant

population by racial/ethnic background and of the Hispanic population by

national origin fails to reveal a single instance in which cross—effects

are numerically important.

          One crucial difference between the Borjas and Grossman studies is

the use of different functional forms to describe the production process (i.e.,

the Generalized Leontief versus the translog). There is no a      priori   reason to

prefer one function over the other since both are second—order approximations

to any arbitrary production function. In addition, experiments by Griffin

(1982) and Wales (1977) show that over certain ranges of the data the translog

function provides a better fit while over other ranges the Generalized Leontief

equation does a better job.

          In addition, diminishing marginal productivity for input £ requires

that not all y2.(y=1,. .   . ,2—1,2+1,. . ,n) be negative. For a discussion of this

and other related restrictions see Diewert (1971), and Sato and Koizumi

(1973).




          Note that the definition of the fixed effect requires that

E(f2) = 1 in the multiplicative specification, and E(f) = 0 in the additive

model.



          Since the Census data is quite large random samples were drawn for

some of the larger population groups. The sampling proportions used are avail-

able from the author on request.

          The 84 SFISAs used by Grant (1979) to construct the capital time

series are not a random sample of the 310 SMSAs identified in the A sample of

the 1980 Census. Instead they tend to be the largest SMSAs in the country.



     6              .
          The analysis also experimented with using the 1969 level of the

capital stock, rather than the 1979 extrapolation made from the 1959-1969

trend. The impact of this change in the definition of the capital variable

on the estimated coefficients was trivial.



          The study was replicated using the wage rate as the dependent

variable with similar qualitative results.



     8
          One important criticism of these results - as well as of most of the

labor demand literature -   is   that substantive findings are being obtained from

across—StISA correlations between wage levels and relative supplies. If, as is

likely, some small groups are concentrated in a relatively few labor markets,

"outlying" labor markets may play a relatively large role in the estimation

procedure. However, recent work by Borjas (1986a), using the 1970 Census,

shows that restricting the analysis to the few ENSAs which contain relatively

large numbers of minority groups (e.g., blacks or Hispanics) or to SMSAs in a

particular region (e.g., the South) does not have a major impact on the estimated

demand system.



          The industrial composition variables were calculated from the

1980 Census file while the public assistance variables were obtained from

the 1976 Survey of Income and Education.
