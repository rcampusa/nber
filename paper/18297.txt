There is great interest in evaluating the impact of private equity investments on innovation and economic
growth. However, there is no direct empirical evidence on the effects of such transactions on the innovation
strategies of entrepreneurial firms. We fill this gap by examining a rich project-level data set consisting
of entrepreneurial firms receiving Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program research awards.
 We find that SBIR firms attracting private equity investments are significantly more likely to license
and sell their technology rights and engage in collaborative research and development agreements.
 Our results suggest that private equity investments accelerate the development and commercialization
of research-based technologies, thus contributing to economic growth. We conclude that both public
investments and private investments are key to innovation performance.

     Private Equity and the Innovation Strategies of Entrepreneurial Firms:

      Empirical Evidence from the Small Business Innovation Research Program



I. Introduction
    There is considerable interest in assessing the antecedents and consequences of private equity
investments (Cumming, Siegel, and Wright (2007); Bloom, Sadun, and van Reenen (2009)). A
key research question is whether these transactions improve performance. Most empirical
studies of the performance effects of private equity investments report evidence on their impact
on short-run stock prices (i.e., event studies), long-run stock prices, financial returns to private
equity investors, or accounting profits of publicly-traded firms. Such approaches focus on firm-
level financial returns to private equity investments.
    An emphasis on firm financial performance suffers from several limitations. First, from a
policy perspective, it is more important to evaluate the impact of private equity investments on
key economic variables, such as innovation and total factor productivity (TFP). Regulatory
decisions regarding private equity investments should be based on their impact on economic
efficiency and innovation or R&D—which we call real effects—and not exclusively on their
financial effects.1
    Another drawback of most empirical studies, as noted in Lichtenberg and Siegel (1990), is
that the firm is not always the appropriate unit of analysis because many private equity
investments occur below the firm level. That is, the majority of private equity transactions do
not involve a transfer of ownership of an entire publicly-traded firm. Instead, most private
equity deals or buyouts are divestments of a unit of a large firm, or a transaction that affects only
a few establishments. The end result is that full-firm transactions involving publicly-traded
companies constitute only a very small percentage of aggregate private equity activity. As a
result, several studies of the real effects of private equity transactions have been based on plant
or establishment level data (e.g., Lichtenberg and Siegel (1990); Harris, Siegel, and Wright
(2005); Davis, Lerner, Haltiwanger, Miranda, and Jarmin (2011)). In the case of R&D and

productivity related performance.

                                                         2
innovation, it is more desirable to have data at the project level because that is the appropriate
unit of analysis for specific research investments.
   Table 1 summarizes key studies of the effects of private equity investments on innovation
and TFP. Note that the unit of analysis has been the firm, division, or plant (establishment) but
none of these investigations has been based on project-level data. In addition to the aggregation
issue, these studies have been based on incomplete measures of a firm’s innovation strategies.
More specifically, they rely on input and output measures associated with the innovation process,
such as R&D expenditure and new product development, but not on the underlying innovation
strategy to use inputs to generate outputs.
   The purpose of this study is to extend analyses of the real effects of private equity
investments by assessing their impact on the innovation strategies of entrepreneurial firms.
Specifically, we examine a rich and unique project-level data set containing comprehensive
measures of dimensions of the innovation strategies of entrepreneurial firms and associated
private equity investments.


II. Empirical Analysis
   A. Analytical Framework
   As noted in the previous section, there have been no project-level studies of the relationship
between private equity investments and innovation strategies. We begin to fill this void by
estimating variants of the following model:


   (1)     innovation strategy = F (private equity, X)


where, from our empirical vantage, innovation strategy refers to four dimensions of a firm’s
innovation strategy, private equity refers to four sources or types of private equity investments,
and X is a vector of project- and firm-specific characteristics.
   We view this model as a starting point to investigate the underlying relationship between
private equity investments and innovation strategies. It explicitly assumes that success in
attracting financial investors influences the firm’s pursuit of an innovation strategy to further
develop and commercialize its technology. However, we recognize that this relationship will
often be simultaneous; a firm’s ability to attract private equity investments might be influenced

                                                  3
by the innovation strategy that it has already adopted. Pursuit of a focused innovation strategy
might therefore send a positive signal to potential investors, as might indications of success
during early stages of the development endeavor.2 Thus, the empirical analyses that follow are
descriptive and exploratory in nature, and our findings should be interpreted in that light.


    B. The Data Set
    The data analyzed in this paper relate to projects funded through the Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) program of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), within the
Department of Health and Human Services. The SBIR program is a set aside program
established through the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982.3 The objectives of
the program were and still are to use small businesses with 500 or fewer employees to stimulate
technological innovation, to meet federal research and development (R&D) needs, to foster
participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in innovation, and to increase private sector
commercialization of innovation from federal R&D. The Act initially required agencies with
greater than $100 million in extramural research to set aside 0.20 percent of their external
research budget for small firms. That percentage has increased over time, and it is now 2.5
percent.4
    The Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000 mandated that the National Research
Council (NRC) within the National Academies evaluate the economic benefits associated with
the SBIR program. In 2005, as part of its study, the NRC conducted an extensive survey of
projects completed from Phase II awards made by five agencies between 1992 and 2001.5 NIH
was one of these five agencies.6 NIH was selected for this study because it maintains a large



2
  As discussed below, the data analyzed are not sufficient to model the timing of receipt of private equity
investments or the timing of the adoption of an innovation strategy.
3
  SBIR is the largest public program that subsidizes small firms in the United States. Lerner (1999) has referred to it
as an example of government acting as venture capitalist. Link and Scott (2010) have referred to the SBIR program
as an example of government acting as entrepreneur.
4
  See Link and Scott (2012a), and references therein, for a legislative history of the SBIR program.
5
  Phase I awards are to establish the technical merit and feasibility of potential for commercialization of the
proposed R&D. Phase II awards are to continue Phase I R&D. Generally, Phase I awards lasted for 6 months and in
2005 were capped at $100,000; and Phase II awards lasted for 2 years and were capped at $750,000. These award
guidelines were increased when the SBIR program was reauthorized at the end of 2011.
6
  The other agencies were the Department of Defense (DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the National Science Foundation (NSF). DoD is the largest SBIR-
sponsoring agency accounting for about 57% of Phase II projects funded in 2005; NIH ranks second at 19%.

SBIR program—second only to the Department of Defense (DoD)—and because the lion’s share
of the technologies resulting from the SBIR-funded research are competed in the marketplace.7
    Table 2 shows the data reduction process to arrive at the population of 495 randomly
sampled Phase II projects funded by NIH between 1992 and 2001. Thirty-four of these project
had not been completed at the time of the survey and information was missing for 32 additional
projects, resulting in a final analysis sample of 419 projects.8


    C. Discussion of the Variables
    The two categories of variables of interest in this study are the innovation strategies adopted
by the firms conducting the Phase II research, and the private equity investments received to
support further development and commercialization of the technology resulting from the funded
research. Measures of these variables are defined in Table 3 along with the covariates included
in vector X in at least some specifications of equation (1). Descriptive statistics on these
variables are presented in Table 4.
    Data are available in the NRC data set on four innovation strategies undertaken with another
firm(s) to commercialize the technology developed through the SBIR project: a licensing
agreement for the technology (lic), a sale of technology rights (tech), a joint venture agreement
which includes the collaborative development of the technology (joint), and an R&D agreement
which includes collaborative research (r&d).9
    In the analyses that follow we examine the adoption of each of these innovation strategies
individually. We also consider two aggregated or combined measures based on these innovation
strategies. The first is a binary variable equaling 1 if the firm adopted at least one of these
defined strategies, and 0 otherwise (commdv). The second is a count of the number of innovation
strategies—0 to 4—that the firm pursued (comm).
    Following Wessner (2009), four sources or types of private equity investments are
considered: U.S. venture capital funding (vc), foreign investments (for), other (non-venture
capital) domestic private equity investments (odpe), and other domestic private company
7
  The primary mission of NIH’s SBIR program is the development of fundamental knowledge and its application for
improving health. Over 12 percent of DoD’s awards through 2005 resulted in technologies purchased and used by
the federal government compared to less than 2 percent for NIH.
8
  In 31 of 32 cases, information was missing on the alternative investments. We were not able to ascertain why these
questions had not been responded to in these cases.
9
  A preliminary analysis of these innovation strategies, and other marketing and manufacturing strategies, is in Link
and Scott (2012b).

                                                          5
investments (odpc).10 The presence of each source is measured dichotomously in some
specifications and in dollar ($) terms in others. As with innovation strategies, we also considered
two aggregated or combined measures of private equity investments. The first measure is binary
equaling 1 if the firm received any form of private equity investment to support its project, and 0
otherwise (priv). The second measure is the dollar amount of such aggregated investments
(priv$).
       Four variables are subsumed in vector X in equation (1). First, the gender of the owner of the
small business is held constant (female). It has been shown by Gicheva and Link (forthcoming)
that women-owned entrepreneurial companies are disadvantaged in private equity investment
markets. Thus we control for gender to obtain estimates of the marginal impact of the private
equity investment variables on innovation strategies.
       Second, the amount of time since receiving the Phase II award is held constant (years). We
posit that years will enter negatively in equation (1). The longer the time since receiving the
award the more likely the firm will have discontinued a project and thus the less likely that any
particular innovation strategy would have been adopted.
       Third, we control for the scale of the project by the log of the number of employees in the
firm at the time of the Phase II award submission (lnemp). To the extent that larger firms have
more experience and resources to devote to the commercialization of technology, they might be
less likely to pursue an innovation strategy with another company(ies) to develop further or
commercialize their technology. Thus, we predict that lnemp will enter negatively in equation
(1).
       Finally, we control for whether a university was involved in the SBIR-funded research.
Baldwin and Link (1998) have shown that universities act as honest brokers when involved with
a firm(s) in research. That is, university involvement increases the likelihood that the research
results will not remain proprietary. Thus, other firms or investors might be less likely to
participate in an innovation strategy for concern that their returns will be diminished. Therefore,
we predict that univ will also enter negatively in equation (1).


       D. Empirical Results



10
     This category includes angel investors. See Wessner (2008).

                                                          6
     Alternative specifications of equation (1) are considered, and the estimated results are
presented in Tables 5 through 10.11 When the dependent variable is dichotomous (i.e., a
particular innovation strategy is adopted, or not) we estimate equation (1) as a probit model and
report marginal effects with other regressors evaluated at their sample means. When the
dependent variable is a count variable (i.e., the number of innovation strategies adopted), we
estimate (1) as a negative binomial model and report the estimated coefficients. In all cases, we
report robust standard errors that are clustered at the company level (the 419 projects in our data
set were conducted by 313 firms).
     Regardless of the specification, we find that firms receiving private equity investments to
support the development and commercialization of their SBIR technology are more likely to
enter into an innovation strategy with another firm(s).12
     Tables 5 and 6 show the empirical results for equation (1) when the two aggregate measures
of innovation strategy are the dependent variables and the aggregate measures of private equity
investments are the independent variables of key interest. In all cases, the presence of private
equity investments (columns (1) and (2)) or the amount of these investments (column (3) and
(4)) are positively related to the likelihood that an innovation strategy will be pursued.
Moreover, the estimated effects are large. For example, the receipt of private equity investments
is predicted to increase the probability that a company follows at least one of the innovation
strategies by 40 percentage points—from 35 to 75 percent—and to raise the number of
innovation strategies by over 200 percent—from 0.5 to 1.6. See rows (1) and (2) in Table 7.
     Also, the adoption of an innovation strategy is more likely to occur sooner rather than later.
In all of the specifications in Tables 5 and 6, the estimated coefficient on years is negative, as
predicted, and statistically significant at least at the .10 level.
     Firm size at the time of the Phase II submission, lnemp, is consistently negative as predicted,
but its estimated coefficient is not always significant at a conventional level.



11
   With reference to Table 1, an important econometric issue is possible selection into the survey sample of 495
projects. Link and Ruhm (2009, 2011) and Link and Scott (2010) have examined the NIH SBIR data in various
contexts and have found no empirical evidence of selection bias. Thus, the issue is not reconsidered herein.
12
   Here and throughout the analysis, we examined whether the results are sensitive to changes in the econometric
specifications such as measuring private investment dollars in logs rather than levels, or including a quadratic term
for the dollar investment. We also estimated models with the number of employees at Phase II submission measured
in levels (rather than logs) or with a quadratic term included. The results were not materially affected by these
changes.

                                                          7
     University involvement in the SBIR-funded research, univ, is consistently negative, as
anticipated, and its estimated coefficient is always significant at least at the .15 level in Table 5
and it is close to that level of significance in Table 6.
     In columns (1) and (3) of Tables 5 and 6, we controlled for the type of technology (e.g.,
product, process, or service) resulting from the SBIR-sponsored research that will be
commercialized by including covariates for the Institute within NIH that funded the research.13
However, these Institute effects are not significant, and these variables are not considered in
subsequent regressions.
     The results in Tables 8 through 11 correspond to an analysis of each of the innovation
strategies separately. In column (1) of each of these tables, the estimated coefficient on the
binary measure of private equity investments (priv) is positive, significant, and of large size (15
to 37 percentage points, compared to sample averages ranging between 10 and 30 percent). We
interpret this finding to suggest that, other things held constant, the presence of private equity
investments in any amount and from any source is sufficient to incentivize the company to
pursue in an innovation strategy with another firm(s). See rows (3) through (6) in Table 7.
When the dollar amount of these private investments is considered (priv$)—column (3) in
Tables 8 through 11—the same conclusion follows for all of the strategies except involvement in
a joint venture, where the estimates fail to indicate a relationship.
     The estimated results in columns (2) and (4) of Tables 8 through 11 disaggregate the private
equity investments by source or type. In the specifications reported in column (2) of each table
the disaggregation is dichotomous, while in column (4) of each table the disaggregation is in
dollar terms. The empirical results vary by type of innovation strategy.
     Comparing the results in column (2) of each table, other (non-venture capital) private equity
investments (odpe) are positively and strongly correlated with all four innovation strategies, as

13
  These specifications included separate controls for the following Institutes: National Institute on Aging; National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Cancer Institute; National Institute on Drug Abuse; National
Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases; National Institute of General Medical Sciences; National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute; National Institute of Mental Health; National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke; and National Center for Research Resources. We also included an “other”
institute variable for the following Institutes that had small numbers of projects: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse
and Alcoholism; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases; National Institute of Dental
and Craniofacial Research; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; National Eye Institute; National
Library of Medicine; National Human Genome Research Institute; and National Institute of Nursing Research.

are other private company investments (odpc) for all cases except joint ventures. Conversely, the
presence of foreign investment (for) only affects, in a statistical sense, the likelihood of a
licensing strategy being pursued, and the presence of U.S. venture capital (vc) only affects the
likelihood of a R&D strategy being pursued. However, the venture capital effect on R&D is the
strongest of any of the four investment types. A similar picture emerges when other (non-venture
capital) private equity investments are measured in dollar terms in column (4) of each table,
although the coefficients are measured with less precision. Particularly noteworthy is the
positive relationship between venture capital funding and the adoption of a R&D strategy in
Table 11. This finding is robust regardless of whether venture capital funding is measured
dichotomously (vc) or in dollar terms (vc$).
   The predicted relationships in Table 12 summarize the impacts of private equity investments
by source on each innovation strategy.
   The predicted effect of gender on a company’s innovation strategy varies by type of strategy,
although it is never statistically significant when innovation strategy was measured collectively
in Tables 5 and 6. Conversely, the gender effect is positive in all of the licensing specifications
in Table 8, although only significant when private equity investment is measured dichotomously.
But, the effect of gender on innovation strategy is insignificant when related to a joint venture
strategy, and negative and significant when related to the adoption of a R&D strategy or sale of
technology.
   Finally, in all of the specifications in Tables 8 through 11, university involvement is
negatively related to the adoption of any specific innovation strategy. The effect is significant
with regard to licensing and R&D, and marginally so with respect to the sale of technology and
engagement in a joint venture.


III. Concluding Observations
   There is great interest in evaluating the impact of private equity investments on innovation
and economic growth. However, there is no direct empirical evidence on the effects of such
transactions on the innovation strategies of entrepreneurial firms. The purpose of this paper was
to fill this gap by examining a rich project-level data set consisting of firms receiving SBIR
awards. One-sixth of these entrepreneurial firms attracted private equity investments.



                                                  9
       Our analysis reveals that firms attracting private equity investments are significantly more
likely to adopt innovation strategies such as entering into licensing agreements and selling their
technology rights, and engaging in collaborative R&D agreements. However, these relationships
differ across types of investment activities. For example, where the presence of non-venture
capital private equity investments are positively associated with all of the innovation strategies
studied, the effects of venture capital investments are particularly strong on for one innovation
strategy, engagement in a collaborative R&D agreements. Understanding these disparate effects,
and the reasons for them, is clearly an important topic for future research.
       Our findings can be interpreted to suggest that private equity investments accelerate
commercialization of publicly funded research and the diffusion of knowledge by becoming an
integral part of the entrepreneurial firm’s innovation strategy. This interpretation thus
underscores the importance of both public and private investments in the development and
commercialization of research that firms would not have undertaken on their own.14
       Several caveats must be noted. For example, Link and Ruhm (2009) have shown that firms
receiving Phase II NIH SBIR awards are far more likely to commercialize these innovations if
they receive additional investment funding from outside sources than if they do not. However,
our analysis here has not determined the degree to which these effects are causal, with the
outside investments directly leading to adoption of the innovation strategies that we study, and to
what extent promising technologies attract these sources of funding but would (eventually) be
commercialized even without it. Our suspicion is that both factors are at play and that there are
also interactive and complementary effects, whereby promising technologies are more likely to
receive outside funding which, in turn, accelerates and expands the commercialization of these
innovations.

* We thank Dr. Charles Wessner for the NRC for making these data available for this study.
** The NRC surveyed a number of non-randomly selected projects. These were projects that resulted in significant
commercialization success, and the NRC wanted to highlight them in their final report to Congress (Wessner 2009).
*** These 419 projects were undertaken by 313 different firms.
