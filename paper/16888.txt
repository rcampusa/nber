Testing for the Role of Prejudice in Emergency Departments Using Bounceback Rates
Shamena Anwar and Hanming Fang
NBER Working Paper No. 16888
March 2011
JEL No. I11,J7

                                                ABSTRACT

We propose and empirically implement a test for the presence of racial prejudice among emergency
department (ED) physicians based on the bounceback rates of the patients who were discharged after
receiving diagnostic tests during their initial ED visits. A bounceback is defined as a return to the ED
within 72 hours of being initially discharged. Based on a plausible model of physician behavior, we
show that differential bounceback rates across patients of different racial groups who are discharged
after receiving diagnostic tests from their ED visits are informative of the racial prejudice of the physicians.
Applying the test to administrative data of ED visits from California and New Jersey, we do not find
evidence of prejudice against black and Hispanic patients. Our finding suggests that, at least in the
emergency department setting, taste based discrimination does not play an important role in the racial
disparities in health care.

1       Introduction

        The presence and pervasiveness of racial disparities in health care and health outcomes have been
abundantly documented.1 It is conceptually useful to broadly group the various potential channels for
racial disparities in health outcomes into three categories. First, patients of different races may contract
various illnesses at different rates. Such differences may result from different exposures to environmental
hazards, different life style choices, and different genetic dispositions toward illnesses. This category of
mechanisms will lead to racial disparities in health prior to the interactions between patients and the health
care system. Second, patients of different races may have differential access to health care facilities and
physicians. The differential health care access can result from different rates of health insurance, different
proximity of health care facilities, and different qualities of available health care facilities. Third, patients
of different races may receive differential quality of care even if they have access to the same health care
facility and physicians.2 Two major pathways for the racial disparity in the quality of health care delivered
by health care providers are statistical discrimination, and racial prejudice. This paper contributes to the
literature on understanding the roles of statistical discrimination and racial prejudice in explaining the
racial disparities in health outcomes, in the context of emergency care.
        Statistical discrimination (or stereotyping) by health care providers may cause racial disparities in
health care because almost all of the physicians’ decisions are made under uncertainty (Arrow, 1963;
Eisenberg, 1986; Phelps, 2000). Physicians typically cannot perfectly observe the disease and its severity
and do not precisely know the effectiveness of a treatment on a particular patient. They have to make
treatment decisions based on information collected during their encounter with the patient and possibly
other noisy signals from diagnostic tests.3 A benevolent physician who aims solely to maximize the net
payoff of the patient may rationally choose to use the average of the patient group (i.e. stereotype) in
forming his/her prior. Specifically, the doctor’s posterior assessment of the probability that the patient
has a particular disease given an observed symptom is, according to the Bayesian rule,

                                                         Pr (symptom∣disease) × Pr (disease)
                          Pr (disease∣symptom) =                                             .
                                                                   Pr (symptom)


Thus, statistical discrimination can appear in two instances. First, doctors may believe the prevalence of
a disease differs by racial/ethnic group, and thus the ex ante probability of a patient having a disease,
    1
     Institute of Medicine (2002) provides the most comprehensive review of the literature, and Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (2011) presents the most updated information regarding disparities and inequalities in health access and health
outcomes in the U.S.
   2
     Health outcome disparities could also result from different post-treatment behavior by patients of different races (see, e.g.,
Simeonova, 2007 and Polsky et al., 2008). It can be argued, however, that physicians should have anticipated such racial differ-
ences in post-treatment behavior in a more integrated care delivery system.
   3
     As such, a physician’s problem is similar to that of an employer who needs to decide whether to hire a job applicant (e.g.,
Coate and Loury, 1993), or a highway trooper who needs to decide whether to search a motor vehicle (e.g., Anwar and Fang,
2006).



                                                                1
Pr (disease) , differs by race. Second, a physician may believe that the accuracy (or the signal/noise ratio)
of a given diagnostic test differs by race, i.e., Pr (sympton∣disease) may depend on race.4 Notice that to the
extent that Pr (symptom∣disease) and Pr (disease) depend on race, doctors may make diagnosis decisions
differently for minority patients even if they exhibit symptoms identical to those of white patients. If
doctors’ beliefs regarding prevalence of a disease and the accuracy of diagnostic tests are accurate, such
disparate treatment will then reflect a desire for effective medicine, and not an intent to discriminate.
       In contrast, physicians that harbor racial prejudice against minority patients will care less about the
wellbeing of minority patients (relative to whites). This will lead to worse health outcomes for minorities.5
       In order to effectively reduce racial inequities in health care and health outcomes, it is vitally impor-
tantly to know the causes for the racial disparities. Obviously, disparities due to the racial differences in
the propensity to contract illnesses will call for different policy responses than disparities due to racial
differences in access to health care; likewise, disparities that result from racial prejudice would call for a
very different policy intervention than disparities due to statistical discrimination. For disparities caused
by physicians’ prejudice, policymakers would like to identify those physicians with prejudice and replace
them with physicians without racial animus. On the other hand, if racial disparities in health care are
caused by statistical discrimination, policymakers may want to provide accurate information regarding
Pr (symptom∣disease) and Pr (disease) within patients of different races to physicians.
       Thus understanding whether racial disparities result from racial prejudice or from statistical discrimi-
nation is at least as important in the health care setting as in other settings that have attracted more acad-
emic attention.6 However, most of the existing literature in health economics has focused on documenting
racial disparities in health care (both in diagnosis and treatment) and health outcomes, as well as docu-
menting how much of the racial disparities could be explained by socio-economic and health insurance
status. The racial disparities are still significant after controlling for these variables (see Institute of Medi-
cine, 2002; Williams, 2007 and references cited therein). There are surprisingly few studies that attempt to
examine whether the racial disparities reflect some degree of racial prejudice or is merely statistical dis-
crimination. One paper in this vein is Balsa, McGuire and Meridith (2005) who tested whether doctors’
diagnosis is affected by the prevalence of the disease (hypertension, diabetes and depression) in the racial
group, which they interpret as the priors of the doctors. They found evidence consistent with statistical
discrimination. Some have tried to test whether racial and ethnic concordance between physicians and
patients can affect health care disparities by reducing the racial differences in Pr (symptom∣disease) held
   4
      Balsa, McGuire and Meridith (2005) referred to the two forms of statistical discrimination respectively as a prevalence hy-
pothesis and a miscommunication hypothesis.
    5
      It can also reflect unfounded stereotypes that a doctor may hold about the health-related behavior of minorities. We will not
attempt to distinguish unfounded stereotypes from racial animus in our test.
    6
      For example, Goldin and Rouse (2000) and Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004), among others, studied disparities in employ-
ment; Ross and Yinger (2002) in mortgage lending; Knowles, Persico and Todd (2001), Anwar and Fang (2006), Grogger and
Ridgeway (2006) and Antonovics and Knight (2009) in motor vehicle stops and searches; Anwar, Bayer and Hjalmarsson (2010)
in jury decisions; Ayres and Waldfogel (1994) and Bushway and Gelbach (2010) in bail setting; Alesina and La Ferrara (2009) in
prosecution and capital sentencing; Mechoulan and Sahuguet (2011) in parole releases; and Price and Wolfers (2007) in sports
refereeing.



                                                                2
by doctors. For example, Strumpf (2010) studied the impact of concordance on quality of care received
by patients of different races. She found that concordance is not generally an important predictor of
outcomes. The most related study in the health literature is probably Chandra and Staiger (2008). They
attempt to identify provider prejudice in the setting of heart attack treatments based on a model where
they show that if providers are prejudiced against minority patients, then one would expect to find that
minority patients should have higher returns from being treated, whereas under statistical discrimination
the expected return from treatment, conditional on the treatment being received, should be equalized
across patients of different races. They did not find evidence of prejudicial behavior against women or
minorities by providers. However, even though Chandra and Staiger (2008) used the outcome test, their
test is valid only under the assumption that the distributions of the unobserved component of the treat-
ment effect is identical across the racial and gender groups (see page 6 of Chandra and Staiger, 2008).
    In this paper, we propose and implement an “outcome test” for the role of prejudice vs. statistical
discrimination in the Emergency Department (ED) setting. The outcome test, first proposed by Becker
(1957, 1993a,b), attempts to infer about the role of racial prejudice using patients’ outcomes. In our setting,
we measure patients’ outcomes by whether or not they ”bounce back” subsequent to being discharged
from their ED visit. A “bounceback” is defined in the medical literature as a return to the Emergency
Department after being discharged home from the initial ED visit within 72 hours. According to Weinstock
and Longstreth (2007), each year there are approximately 115 million visits to Emergency Departments in
the United States. Approximately 3% of these patients will “bounce back” (about 3.3 million occurrences
per year) and 0.6% will bounce back and require admission (660,000 occurrences per year). Of the patients
who return, 18-30% return due to a possible medical error made during the initial visit (600,000 to 1 million
occurrences per year).7, 8 Given the vital role of emergency departments in the U.S. health care system, it
is important to examine whether there is evidence of disparities in the quality of care received by patients
of different races; and more importantly, whether racial prejudice plays an important role in the racial
disparities in emergency departments.
    Our approach of inferring about the role of racial prejudice from the bounceback rates of discharged
patients differs from most of the existing literature in health disparities, which attempts to infer racial
prejudice from racial disparities in care prescribed by the physicians to patients. For example, Schulman
et al. (1999) assessed physicians’ recommendations for management of chest pain after they viewed vi-
gnettes of “patients” who complained of symptoms of coronary artery disease. “Patients” varied only
in race, sex, age, level of coronary risk and the results of an exercise stress test. The authors found that
physicians were less likely to recommend cardiac catherization procedures for women and African Amer-
icans than for whites and men. However, it is possible that the lower catheterization utilization rates ob-

and Bodiwala (1991) for the original articles for the above statistics.
   8
     As we describe below, our definition of bounceback is similar to the restriction that the return to the ED is due to a possible
medical error made during the initial visit. Thus, our bounceback rates of 0.05% in New Jersey and 0.10% in California are within
the bounds of those reported in the literature.



                                                                 3
served among black patients reflect an effort by the physicians to provide more appropriate care to these
patients. Barnato et al. (2005) examined the within-hospital racial disparities in the treatment of acute
myocardial infarction (AMI) among Medicare beneficiaries, and found that within-hospital analyses nar-
rowed or erased black–white disparities for medical treatments received during the acute hospitalization,
but widened black–white disparities for follow-up surgical treatments, and augmented the survival ad-
vantage among blacks.
   By examining bounceback rates in the ED we can determine whether the different diagnoses and care
that patients of different races receive lead to different health outcomes: if they do, then the differential
treatment of patients of different races is likely due to racial prejudice; otherwise, the differences in treat-
ment are likely driven by statistical discrimination of the physicians trying to provide more appropriate
care to patients of different races. Formally, we present in Section 2 a model which justifies the use of the
comparison of the bounceback rates as a test for racial prejudice by the doctors. The basic idea is that if
doctors are prejudiced against minority patients, then they are more willing to release them from the ED.
This will lead to more bouncebacks for minority patients. Since our test belongs to the class of “outcome
tests”, it has to deal with the well-known “infra-marginality problem” in its application. We argue, based
on a plausible model of ED physician behavior, that conditional on the patients receiving diagnostic tests
during their initial ED visit, the bounceback rates for blacks and whites should be equal if physicians are
not racially prejudiced. In other words, restricting ourselves to the sample of discharged patients who
received diagnostic tests during their ED visits, the infra-marginality problem will not be an issue for our
inference about racial prejudice. In Section 3, we formalize the infra-marginality problem associated with
the outcome-based test idea and explain our proposed solution in detail.
   In Section 5, we apply our proposed test for prejudice to administrative data of ED visits from Cali-
fornia and New Jersey. We do not find evidence of prejudice against black and Hispanic patients. Our
finding suggests that, at least in the emergency department setting, taste based discrimination does not
play an important role in the racial disparities in health care.
   The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we present a plausible model of
Emergency Department physicians’ behavior and argue that bounceback rates of patients who are dis-
charged after having diagnostic tests done can be used as the basis for an outcome test to detect racial
prejudice. In Section 3 we describe the outcome test for racial prejudice and highlight the main difficulty
in its empirical implementation–the infra-marginality problem. We also discuss some recent attempts to
deal with the infra-marginality problem and explain why our use of bounceback rates conditional on di-
agnostic tests resolves the infra-marginality problem. In Section 4 we describe the data sets used in our
empirical application. In Section 5 we present descriptive statistics of our sample, the basic test of our
model, and our main results regarding the role of racial prejudice in the ED. In Section 6 we conclude.

2       A Model of Emergency Department Physicians’ Behavior

        We now present a plausible behavioral model of ED physician behavior and describe how the mo-
del can allow us to design an outcome-based test of prejudice that is not subject to the infra-marginality
problem. Consider a patient with race 𝑟 and other characteristics 𝑐 who comes to the Emergency De-
partment. The characteristics included in 𝑐 could encompass variables that researchers may have about
patients such as gender, age, insurance status, etc., as well as other variables that may not be collected in a
typical dataset such as the patients’ past medical history (including comorbidities) and the patient’s cur-
rent complaint that led them to ED. Let 𝐹𝑟 (𝑐) be the cumulative distribution function of 𝑐 among race-𝑟
patients.
        Suppose that such a patient can either have a minor problem (𝑁 ) whereby they can be treated in the
ED and discharged home, or a major problem (𝐽) for which they will need to be admitted to the hospital.
Let 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) > 0 be the doctors’ initial assessment that a patient with race 𝑟 and characteristics 𝑐 has a major
problem.


Determination of the Discharging Thresholds.                   We assume that the ED physician will admit the patient
to the hospital if their assessment that the patient has a major problem exceeds a threshold 𝜋 ℎ (𝑟, 𝑐) ∈
(0, 1) , and will release the patient if the assessment is lower than 𝜋 𝑙 (𝑟, 𝑐) ∈ (0, 1), where 𝜋 ℎ (𝑟, 𝑐) >
𝜋 𝑙 (𝑟, 𝑐). For simplicity, we assume that 𝜋 ℎ (𝑟, 𝑐) is set by the physician in charge of admitting patients to
the hospital, so that ED doctors take this as given. Thus, we will set 𝜋 ℎ (𝑟, 𝑐) = 𝜋 ∗ℎ for all 𝑟, 𝑐.9 However,
the ED doctor must decide on the threshold 𝜋 𝑙 (𝑟, 𝑐) below which they will discharge the patient from the
ED.
        The ED doctor chooses discharging standard 𝜋 𝑙 (𝑟, 𝑐) to maximize his expected utility, which is given
by:
                                           max 𝑈𝑟 (𝜋 𝑙 ) = 𝑅(𝜋 𝑙 ) − 𝜌 (𝜋 𝑙 ) 𝑆 − 𝜋 𝑙 𝑎𝑟 ,                                        (1)
                                          {𝜋 𝑙 ≥0}

where (i). the first component 𝑅(𝜋 𝑙 ) represents the total revenue (i.e., the benefit) to the doctors of using
the discharge standard 𝜋 𝑙 , and we assume 𝑅′ (𝜋 𝑙 ) > 0 and 𝑅′′ (𝜋 𝑙 ) < 0;10 (ii). the second term, −𝜌(𝜋 𝑙 )𝑆,
represents the loss in payoff if the doctor is successfully sued by the patient in the event that a major
problem occurs following the discharge, where 𝜌 (𝜋 𝑙 ) is the probability that the patient who experiences
a major problem following the discharge would file and win a lawsuit, in which case the ED doctor will
    9
      Assuming that the threshold for admission to the hospitals 𝜋 ℎ (𝑟, 𝑐) is not controlled by the attending ED physician is without
loss of generality. As will be clear from our analysis below, we will only be using the outcomes of a subset of the discharged
patients to infer about racial prejudice of the physicians. If the ED physicians also control the thresholds for admission, then it is
possible that the outcomes of the patients who are admitted to the hospitals may also be informative about physicians’ prejudice.
It is not clear, however, what will be the appropriate outcome measure for those admitted to the hospitals. Moreover, one also
needs to have data of ED patients linked to their treatment and outcomes in the hospitals.
   10
      A rationale for these assumptions is as follows. The higher the threshold to discharge patients 𝜋 𝑙 is, the less time ED
doctors have to spend with each patient, and the more patients they can see in a given time period. Since ED doctors have
profit incentives to see as many patients as possible, their total revenue will increase as 𝜋 𝑙 increases. However, each subsequent
increase in 𝜋 𝑙 should increase total revenue by less.

measures the expected amount of affinity ED doctors have towards race-𝑟 patients if they discharge a race-
𝑟 patient for whom a major problem can arise with probability 𝜋 𝑙 . In a sense, this measures how much
doctors personally care about the outcomes of their patients aside from worries about the probability the
patient will sue them.

Definition 1. We say that the doctors are racially prejudiced if 𝑎𝑟 ∕= 𝑎𝑟′ for 𝑟 ∕= 𝑟′ . We say that the ED doctor is
racially prejudiced against race-𝑟 patients if 𝑎𝑟 < 𝑎𝑟′ , i.e. if the ED doctor feels less affinity for the race-𝑟 patient’s
sufferings.

       Figure 1 shows the determination of 𝜋 𝑙 for race-𝑟 and race-𝑟′ patients for which 𝑎𝑟 < 𝑎𝑟′ . From (2), the
result below immediately follows:

Proposition 1. If the ED doctor is racially prejudiced against race-𝑟 patients relative to race-𝑟′ patients according
to Definition 1, i.e., if 𝑎𝑟 < 𝑎𝑟′ , then the doctor will set 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) > 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟′ ); if the doctor is not racially prejudiced, i.e.,
if 𝑎𝑟 = 𝑎𝑟′ , then 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) = 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟′ ) .


Determination of the Diagnostic Tests. Now that we have obtained the lower bound the doctor will
use to discharge patients, we can describe the optimal behavior of the ED doctor towards a patient they
initially assess with probability 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) of having a major problem:

   𝑆 can reflect the cost of a lawsuit, damage compensation, as well as lost future revenues and increased malpractice insurance
premiums.



                                                                     6
    ∙ if 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) ≥ 𝜋 ∗ℎ , the ED doctor will immediately admit the patient to the hospital without any addi-
        tional diagnostic tests;

    ∙ if 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) ≤ 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) , they will immediately discharge the patient without any additional diagnostic
        tests;

    ∙ however, if 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) ∈ (𝜋 ∗ℎ , 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟)) , the ED doctor will have to perform diagnostic tests before they can
        decide whether to admit or discharge the patient. We describe the decisions about what diagnostic
        tests to perform below.

Definition 2. Diagnostic tests are indexed by two numbers (𝑛𝑓 , 𝑝𝑓 ) where 𝑛𝑓 = Pr (negative∣𝐽) > 0 is the false
negative probability and 𝑝𝑓 = Pr (positive∣𝑁 ) > 0 is the false positive probability.

    We make two plausible assumptions about the diagnostic tests:

Assumption 1. ED doctors have a continuous battery of diagnostic tests available to them, so that they can choose
any diagnostic test (𝑛𝑓 , 𝑝𝑓 ) ∈ (0, 1)2 .

Assumption 2. The costs of the diagnostic tests are born by the patients.

    Under Assumption 2, the ED doctors will simply choose diagnostic tests that can allow them to make
decisions upon receiving the test outcomes, without having to worry about the costs of diagnostic tests.
Specifically, the doctors will choose (𝑛𝑓 , 𝑝𝑓 ) such that the doctors’ posterior assessment that a race-𝑟 pa-
tient has a major problem, given that the test-(𝑛𝑓 , 𝑝𝑓 ) turns up positive, will just hit 𝜋 ∗ℎ ; similarly, the
doctors’ posterior assessment that a race-𝑟 patient has a major problem given a negative result on the
tests will just hit 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) where 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) is the optimal threshold as defined in (2) for race-𝑟 patients. Given
Assumption 1, the doctors will, for race-𝑟 patient with characteristics 𝑐, choose the test-(𝑛𝑓 , 𝑝𝑓 ) that satis-
fies:

                                                                 (1 − 𝑛𝑓 )𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐)
                            𝜋 ∗ℎ = Pr (𝐽∣positive) ≡                                        ;                    (3)
                                                      (1 − 𝑛𝑓 )𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) + 𝑝𝑓 [1 − 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐)]
                                                                     𝑛𝑓 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐)
                         𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) = Pr (𝐽∣negative) ≡                                         .                  (4)
                                                       𝑛𝑓 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) + (1 − 𝑝𝑓 ) [1 − 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐)]

Equation (3) says that the doctor chooses test-(𝑛𝑓 , 𝑝𝑓 ) such that the doctor’s posterior for a race-𝑟 patient
with characteristics 𝑐 having a major problem after observing a positive test outcome should just hit the
upper threshold 𝜋 ∗ℎ for being admitted to the hospital. Using tests any more precise than this is a waste of
resources, as there is no benefit to the ED of getting a patient to exceed the admission threshold. Similarly,
Equation (4) says that the doctor would choose test-(𝑛𝑓 , 𝑝𝑓 ) such that the doctor’s posterior for a race-𝑟
patient with characteristics 𝑐 having a major problem after observing a negative test outcome should just
hit the lower threshold 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) for being discharged home. Again, it is not necessary for doctors to use more
precise testing, since the threshold 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) was chosen optimally by definition.

                                                           7
      Solving the above two equations for 𝑛𝑓 and 𝑝𝑓 , we have:

                                                                 𝜋 ∗ (𝑟) [𝜋 ∗ℎ − 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐)]

                                                                                 ]

                                                                                 [


2.1        Main Implication

      Our empirical test is based on the implication of Equation (4). It says the following: after a doctor ob-
serves a race-𝑟 patient with characteristics 𝑐, they first determine the initial probability of a major problem
𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) . If 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) ∈ (𝜋 ∗ℎ , 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟)) , so that the doctor needs diagnostic tests to determine the course of actions
                                                                                                     (                  )
(discharge home, or admit to the hospital), they will choose the optimal diagnostic test 𝑛∗𝑓 (𝑟, 𝑐) , 𝑝∗𝑓 (𝑟, 𝑐)
                                                                          (                  )
according to the formulas given by (5) and (6). Under test- 𝑛∗𝑓 (𝑟, 𝑐) , 𝑝∗𝑓 (𝑟, 𝑐) , Equation (4) guarantees
that every race-𝑟 patient discharged home after undergoing diagnostic tests has a probability of a major
disease that is equal to their discharge threshold 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) , independent of other characteristics 𝑐.

Assumption 3. A patient will return to the ED, i.e., bounce back, if he/she encounters a major problem following
discharge in the previous ED visit.

   Since every patient of race-𝑟 that is discharged home after undergoing diagnostic tests has probability
𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟)
      of having a major problem, Assumption 3 ensures that we can estimate 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) by computing the
proportion of bounceback patients among discharged race-𝑟 patients who underwent diagnostic tests
prior to their discharges. Denote the bounceback rate for discharged race-𝑟 patients, conditional on them
obtaining additional diagnostic tests while in the ED, as 𝐵 (𝑟∣Diagnostic Tests) , which we can express as:
                                                                                      ∗

To understand the above expression, note that in line (7) the numerator is the total measure of race-𝑟
patients who actually have major problems but are discharged home because the diagnostic tests yield a
false negative outcome. The denominator is the total measure of race-𝑟 patients who are discharged after
getting a negative test result. Line (8) follows from the definition of 𝑛∗𝑓 (𝑟, 𝑐) as defined in (4).
      Together with Proposition 1, we immediately have the following result:

Proposition 2. Under Assumptions 1-3, ED doctors are racially prejudiced against race-𝑟 patients relative to
race-𝑟′ patients if and only if 𝐵 (𝑟∣Diagnostic Tests) > 𝐵 (𝑟′ ∣Diagnostic Tests) .



                                                                        8
      Proposition 2 provides the basis of our empirical test that we explain in detail in Section 5 below. Note
that to implement this test, we only require information on the race of the patient, whether diagnostic tests
were done, and whether they returned within three days after being discharged home. All of this data is
readily available. Our test does not rely on knowing the information contained in 𝑐, which is vital, since
no data set contains information that detailed. In this way, our mathematical model of physician behavior
allows us to develop a simple outcome test that gets around the omitted variable problem previous studies
have run into.


2.2     Other Implications

      Having shown in Proposition 2 that comparisons of the bounceback rates conditional on receiving di-
agnostic tests, 𝐵 (𝑟∣Diagnostic Tests) , across patients of different races can be informative of the ED doc-
tors’ racial prejudice, we now show that three other, seemingly related, alternative tests that researchers
might be tempted to do are not informative about doctors’ prejudice.
    First, the comparison of the bounceback rates across patients of different races without restricting to
the sub-sample of discharged patients who received diagnostic tests in the initial visits is not informative
of physicians’ racial prejudice. To see this, note that the unconditional bounceback rate of discharged
race-𝑟 patients, denoted by 𝐵 (𝑟) , is give by
                                                     ∗
                        ∫                                                       ∫
                          {𝑐:𝜋(𝑟,𝑐)∈(𝜋∗ℎ ,𝜋∗𝑙 (𝑟))} 𝑛𝑓 (𝑟, 𝑐) 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) 𝑑𝐹𝑟 (𝑐) + {𝑐:𝜋(𝑟,𝑐)≤𝜋∗𝑙 (𝑟)} 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) 𝑑𝐹𝑟 (𝑐)
 𝐵 (𝑟) = ∫                        {                         [              ]             }                                           . (10)
                                      ∗ (𝑟, 𝑐) 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) + 1 − 𝑝∗ (𝑟, 𝑐) [1 − 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐)] 𝑑𝐹 (𝑐) +
                                                                                                        ∫
           {𝑐:𝜋(𝑟,𝑐)∈(𝜋ℎ ,𝜋𝑙 (𝑟))} 𝑓
                       ∗   ∗        𝑛                               𝑓                           𝑟         {𝑐:𝜋(𝑟,𝑐)≤𝜋∗𝑙 (𝑟)} 𝑑𝐹𝑟 (𝑐)

Note that the difference between the expression for the unconditional bounceback rate 𝐵 (𝑟) above and
                                                          ∫
that for 𝐵 (𝑟∣Diagnostic Tests) in (7) is the extra term {𝑐:𝜋(𝑟,𝑐)≤𝜋∗ (𝑟)} 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) 𝑑𝐹𝑟 (𝑐) in the numerator and
∫                                                                   𝑙
                 𝑑𝐹
 {𝑐:𝜋(𝑟,𝑐)≤𝜋 (𝑟)} 𝑟
            ∗       (𝑐) in the denominator.    These,  as  we will discuss    in Section 3 below, represent the
             𝑙
infra-marginally discharged patients for whom the doctors’ initial assessment 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) is sufficiently low
not to warrant a diagnostic test. The addition of these infra-marginal patients results in 𝐵 (𝑟) depending
on 𝑐. Since the distributions 𝐹𝑟 (𝑐) are likely to vary by race, unconditional bounceback rates can differ
either because doctors use different discharge thresholds or because patients of different races have dif-
ferent underlying disease prevalence. A comparison of 𝐵 (𝑟) across 𝑟 will thus not be informative of the
relationship between 𝑎𝑟 and 𝑎𝑟′ .
    Second, comparisons of discharge rates (or, equivalently, hospital admission rates) whether condi-
tional on diagnostic tests [denoted by 𝐷 (𝑟∣Diagnostic Tests)], or unconditional [denoted by 𝐷 (𝑟)], are
not informative of the physicians’ racial prejudice. To see this, note that the conditional and uncondi-




                                                                    9

Note that cross-race differences in either of the discharge rates calculated above mix together the three
sources for racial differences: the first channel is that the groups may have ex ante differences in the
probability of major problems, as represented by the potential difference between 𝐹𝑟 (𝑐) and 𝐹𝑟′ (𝑐) , and
the fact that the initial assessment 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) depends on 𝑐 and 𝑟; the second channel is racial prejudice, which
leads to differences in 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) which appear in the region of integration; and the third channel is potential
statistical discrimination, which we define below:

Definition 3. Suppose that 𝑎𝑟 = 𝑎𝑟′ . We say that the doctors engage in statistical discrimination if, conditional on
                                      (                       ) (                            )
any diagnostic tests being prescribed, 𝑛∗𝑓 (𝑟, 𝑐) , 𝑝∗𝑓 (𝑟, 𝑐) ∕= 𝑛∗𝑓 (𝑟′ , 𝑐) , 𝑝∗𝑓 (𝑟′ , 𝑐) if 𝑟 ∕= 𝑟′ .

    To understand why Definition 3 captures the notion of statistical discrimination, note that if ED doc-
tors do not have racial prejudice, then they will choose 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) = 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟′ ). According to Equations (3) and (4),
(                        )  (                           )
  𝑛∗𝑓 (𝑟, 𝑐) , 𝑝∗𝑓 (𝑟, 𝑐) ∕= 𝑛∗𝑓 (𝑟′ , 𝑐) , 𝑝∗𝑓 (𝑟′ , 𝑐) can occur only if 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) ∕= 𝜋 (𝑟′ , 𝑐) , i.e., the ED doctor forms
different assessments for race-𝑟 and race-𝑟′ patients with identical characteristics 𝑐, which is exactly the
commonly used definition of statistical discrimination. Because both the conditional and unconditional
discharge rates defined above mix all three channels for racial differences, they are unable to be directly
informative about the role of racial prejudice.
    Finally, we should emphasize that comparisons of the types or the numbers of diagnostic tests done,
which should reveal something about the test-(𝑛𝑓 , 𝑝𝑓 ) used, are not informative about the role of physi-
cians’ racial prejudice. The reason is simple. From expressions (5) and (6), we know that the doctors’
choices of 𝑛∗𝑓 (𝑟, 𝑐) and 𝑝∗𝑓 (𝑟, 𝑐) depend not only on 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) [which is reflective of racial prejudice as we
show in Proposition 1], but also on 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) , which reflects both underlying differences in 𝑐 and statis-
tical discrimination. Thus, the comparison of diagnostic tests suffers exactly the same problem as the
comparison of discharge rates in inferring about racial prejudice.
    The following proposition summarizes the above discussions:

Proposition 3. Without further assumptions on the distributions of initial assessment 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) across patients of
different races, neither the cross-race comparisons of the unconditional bounceback rates (10), nor the discharge rates
[whether conditional (11) or unconditional (12)], nor the types and amount of diagnostic tests done are informative
about the physicians’ racial prejudice.




                                                                   10
2.3     Discussion of the Model

      So far, we have established that comparisons of the conditional bounceback rates as defined in (7)
are informative about the physicians’ racial prejudice: physicians are prejudiced against race-𝑟 patients if
and only if their bounceback rate is higher conditional on having received diagnostic tests in the initial
ED visit. It is useful to point out that up to now we have couched our discussion strictly in terms of
race-based prejudice. However, it is obvious that we can allow the affinity parameter 𝑎𝑟 in the doctor’s
problem (1) to be indexed by any vector of observable patient characteristics. For example, the group may
be indexed by race, gender, age and insurance status, instead of just race. The logic of our proposed test
for prejudice based on comparisons of conditional bounceback rates remains valid.
      The most important assumption of our model is Assumption 1, which states that doctors have ac-
cess to a continuous array of diagnostic tests which differ in their false positive and false negative rates.
This strong assumption is what we rely on to ensure that the probability of having a major problem
among those who were discharged with some diagnostic tests is independent of potentially unobserved
(by econometricians) characteristics 𝑐.


2.4     Testable Implications of Our Model

      It is also important to recognize that our model has two testable implications. First, our model predicts
that those patients discharged without any diagnostic tests should have lower bounceback rates than those
who were discharged with diagnostic tests. This implication follows from the threshold behavioral rule
of the physicians in our model, as the only discharged patients that don’t get diagnostic tests done are
ones with bounceback rates that are below the lower threshold. We will provide evidence in support of
this prediction in our empirical results below.
      Second, our model predicts that, conditional on race (and/or any observable characteristics that physi-
cians may base their prejudice on), the accuracy of the diagnostic tests, as measured by 𝑛𝑓 and 𝑝𝑓 , should
not affect the bounceback rate. While patients will have different tests done depending on what is nec-
essary to get them to the discharge threshold 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟), all patients of the same race should bounce back at
exactly the same rate. The implementation of this test is not easy, though, because we are typically unable
to observe the 𝑛𝑓 and 𝑝𝑓 directly. However, in the empirical section, we proxy for 𝑛𝑓 and 𝑝𝑓 with the type
of test done, and show evidence in support of this prediction.


3     The Empirical Test

      In this section, we describe in more details the advantages of outcome-based tests, as well as the well-
known infra-marginality problem associated with the outcome test. We then explain how our model
of the ED physicians’ behavior allows us to avoid the infra-marginality problem when we focus on the
sub-sample of discharged patients who received diagnostic tests in their initial ED visit.


                                                       11
Outcome Test for Prejudice.            There is a large literature in economics that attempts to distinguish the
contributions of statistical discrimination and racial prejudice to racial disparities in a variety of set-
tings, including employment, health care, mortgage and other lending situations, motor vehicle stops
and searches as well as all phases of law enforcement such as jury selection, prosecution and sentencing.
The standard approach of using regression analysis to infer bias would regress, as the left side variable,
an indicator of the actions taken by the treater, on a list of variables, including race and/or gender, that
are thought to be possibly related to the treater’s decision. It is well recognized, however, the regression
approach suffers from both the “omitted” and “included” variable biases.12
       More recently, a growing literature has advocated the use of an “outcome test”, first proposed by
Becker (1957, 1993a,b). The idea of the outcome test is quite intuitive. If decision-makers, say the ED
physicians, are prejudiced against a group of patients, then that group of patients are likely to be pre-
maturely released relative to other groups of patients, resulting in a higher bounceback rate for the
prejudiced-against group. Thus, the comparisons of the outcomes of different groups of patients, i.e.
the bounceback rates, would be informative of the racial prejudice of the physicians. The application
of the outcome test, however, is plagued by the “infra-marginality problem,” which refers to the differ-
ence between the comparisons of the average and marginal outcomes across racial or gender groups (see
Knowles, Persico and Todd, 2001, Anwar and Fang, 2006 and Persico, 2010 for descriptions of this prob-
lem).


The Infra-maginality Problem and Our Proposed Solution.                         Figure 2 illustrates the infra-marginality
problem in our setting if we were just to compare the bounceback rates of all discharged patients across
patient races. It also explains how our model of physician behavior allows us to avoid the infra-marginality
problem if we focus on the sub-sample of discharged patients who received diagnostic tests in their ini-
tial ED visits. The dark curve in Figure 2 depicts the distributions of the initially assessed probability
by physicians that race-𝑟 patients have major problems, i.e., 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) . As we describe in Section 2, the ED
physicians will observe the 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) for a particular race-𝑟 patient and will then decide upon the course
of action according to where 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) lies relative to the two thresholds 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) and 𝜋 ∗ℎ : if 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) ≤ 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) ,
the patient will be discharged without any additional tests; if 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) ≥ 𝜋 ∗ℎ , the patient will be admit-
ted to the hospital without any additional tests; however, if 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) ∈ (𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) , 𝜋 ∗ℎ ) , then diagnostic tests
(                        )
  𝑛∗𝑓 (𝑟, 𝑐) , 𝑝∗𝑓 (𝑟, 𝑐) will be ordered for the patient and the physicians will discharge the patient if and
only if the outcomes from the diagnostic tests are negative.
       Notice, as we highlighted in expression (10) for the unconditional bounceback rates, the comparisons
of the average bounceback rates for race-𝑟 and race-𝑟′ patients may not reveal the ranking of 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) and
𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟′ ). In Figure 2, the discharge thresholds for race-𝑟 and race-𝑟′ patients are such that 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟′ ) > 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) ,
  12
    The “omitted variable” bias arises if there are variables that are legitimately related to the decision making, but not included
in the regression. If there is correlation between race/gender with the omitted variable, the race/gender coefficient may be
picking up the effect of the omitted variable. The “included variable” bias arises if variables correlated with race that should not
have legitimately mattered are included as regressors (see Ayres, 2010 for a discussion).

i.e., the physicians are prejudiced against race-𝑟′ patients. However, because the distribution of 𝜋 (𝑟′ , 𝑐)
has a higher lower tail than that of 𝜋 (𝑟, 𝑐) , the average bounceback rate for race-𝑟′ patients is lower than
that for race-𝑟 patients. This is exactly the infra-marginality problem.
    However, if we restrict ourselves to the comparisons of the bounceback rates to patients discharged
after receiving diagnostic tests, their posterior assessments are all concentrated at 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟) and 𝜋 ∗𝑙 (𝑟′ ) respec-
tively for race-𝑟 and race-𝑟′ patients. This is ensured by the physicians’ optimal choices of the diagnostic
tests as described by (5) and (6).
    We should mention that the idea that continuous control variables by decision-makers may allevi-
ate the infra-marginality problem in the outcome test is independently developed in Mechoulan and
Sahuguet (2011), where they use the outcome test idea to test for the role of racial prejudice by parole
boards.13 They argue that, to the extent a parole board can choose the time of release for a parolee to
minimize the number of parole violations, it implies that all released parolees should have the same prob-
ability of a parole violation. Thus from a researcher’s perspective, there is no infra-marginality problem.
They find that in almost every state with a discretionary parole board, African American parolees are more
likely to violate parole than White parolees by about ten percentage points, suggesting that parole boards
are more lenient in their releasing decisions when they face African American prisoners.14
   13
      The potential that continuous control variables available to the treators may alleviate the inframarginality problem has also
been discussed in Ayres and Waldfogel (1994), Ayres (2002) and Ayres (2005, p. 14).
   14
      One objection to their study is that parole violations are not objectively measured; instead they are determined by police
officers, who may be discriminatory against black parolees. However, Mechoulan and Sahuguet (2011) argue that police dis-
crimination should be invariant to how parolees were granted parole. In the data, though, they found that there is a larger
discrepancy in violations between black and white parolees who have been released through discretionary parole relative to
those released through mandatory parole in states where both types of parole release coexist. These two findings are somewhat


                                                                            13
Difference from KPT’s Justification for the Outcome Test.                     It is also useful to distinguish our justifi-
cation for the use of the outcome test from the justification provided in the seminal paper by Knowles,
Persico and Todd (2001) in the context of racial profiling in motor vehicle searches. Knowles, Persico and
Todd (2001) develop a simple but elegant theoretical model about motorist and police behavior and show
that in equilibrium the infra-marginality problem may not arise. In their model, motorists differ in their
characteristics, including race and possibly other factors that are observable to troopers but may or may
not be available to researchers. Troopers decide whether or not to search motorists while motorists decide
whether or not to carry contraband. In this “matching pennies”-like model they show that if troopers
are not racially prejudiced, all motorists, if they are searched at all, must in equilibrium carry contraband
with equal probability regardless of their race and other characteristics. Thus in their model there is no
difference between the marginal and the average search success rates.
    In contrast, the key for us and for Mechoulan and Sahuguet (2011) to address the infra-marginality
problem is that the decision makers, in our case the ED physicians and in Mechoulan and Sahuguet
(2011)’s case the parole board, have continuous controls that can affect the relevant outcomes (bounceback
rates in our case and the parole violation rates in Mechoulan and Sahuguet, 2011).


4    Data

    The data sets we use to implement our proposed test for racial prejudice in Emergency Departments
using bounceback rates come from New Jersey and California. The New Jersey data was obtained by
combining data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) and the New Jersey Depart-
ment of Health and Senior Services, and covers the period from January 2006 through July 2007.15 The
HCUP databases collect patient-level hospital data from the majority of U.S. states and organize the data
in a unified framework. It represents the largest collection of longitudinal hospital data in the U.S. The
California data was obtained from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD)
and covers the period from January 2006 through September 2007.16 In both data sets, we have informa-
tion on all Emergency Department (ED) visits that occurred during their respective coverage period. For
both states, we observe a patient’s admission and discharge date, the procedures done, the diagnoses and
the final disposition of the patient (i.e., whether they were admitted to the hospital or discharged home).
In both data sets there is a patient indicator which allows patients’ visits to be tracked over time. How-
ever, for New Jersey, this indicator is not unique across hospitals, and thus we can only track a particular
contradictory and puzzling at first glance. The first finding suggests that judges are being lenient toward black prisoners in
terms of the threshold probability used in releasing them, despite the fact that black prisoners typically serve a larger fraction
of their sentences before obtaining parole release. One would then have expected that when parole boards are not allowed to
strategically and differentially time the release of black and white prisoners, the gap in the parole violation rates would become
larger, not smaller. One likely reason is that the crimes for which the mandatory parole rule is used differ from those for which
the discretionary parole rule is used.

patient’s visits to the same ED; for California, this indicator is unique across hospitals, which allow us to
follow all of a patient’s ED visits even if the return visits are to an ED in a different hospital.
       The sizes of our samples are very large, with about 3.86 million and 11.7 million ED discharge obser-
vations in NJ and CA respectively. Such large samples are necessary to examine bounceback rates because
bouncebacks occur with quite small probability (due to their severe consequences). However, in order to
use this admission data to identify missed major problems in a way that is robust to potential behavioral
differences between white and minority patients, we must restrict our analysis to some subsamples. We
explain our sample selection criterion below and describe the construction of some of the key variables.


4.1      Sample Selection

       In order to test for discrimination we need to identify the exact proportion of patients given diagnostic
tests that are mistakenly discharged home with a major problem. The data we have only includes infor-
mation on patients’ ED visits. In order to use this data to identify the patients where a major problem was
missed, we first identify the proportion of patients discharged from the ED that bounce back. In the ED
literature (see, for example, Weinstock and Longstreth, 2007), bounceback patients are ones that return to
the ED within three days of being discharged. If on the second visit, the patient is admitted to the hospital
with a major problem that is different than what they were diagnosed with on their first visit, then this
is a strong indication that a major problem was missed on the patient’s first visit.17 If a patient does not
bounce back, it implies they do not have a major problem, and the doctor was correct in their decision to
discharge them home.


Major Problems. Patients may return to the ED after being discharged for various reasons with or with-
out major problems, and importantly, the return rates may differ by race. In order to use the proportion
of bounceback patients to identify the exact proportion of patients that had a missed major problem, two re-
quirements must be satisfied: (1) everyone that has a missed major problem must result in a bounceback;
and (2) any patient that bounces back does so because the doctor missed a major problem on their first
visit. In order to satisfy these two requirements we restrict our definition of “major” problem to only in-
clude extremely serious problems which would require a patient to return to the ED.18,19 We also restrict
  17
     The return window of three days is somewhat arbitrary, as some definitions of a bounceback allow the patient to return
within seven days. The key is that the return window needs to be short enough that one can assume the problem was present
on the first visit, but not caught. As the problems we are trying to detect are quite serious, it is likely that patients with missed
diagnoses will return to the ED sooner rather than later, which is why we use three days.
  18
     For less serious problems, a patient with a missed diagnosis may choose to go to their general practitioner, who might
correctly diagnose them. Because they never return to the ED, we have no way of knowing that their case was missed. In
contrast, when we only examine serious problems like heart attacks, the patient will be forced to return to the ED no matter who
they see.
  19
     Note that a patient might choose to return to a different ED. Because we can track patients across hospitals in California, as
long as the patient returns to a California hospital, we will observe their bounceback. In New Jersey, however, we can only track
patients’ visits to the same hospital, and thus if they bounceback to a different hospital we will not observe it. We will do some
robustness checks with the California data to see whether this is likely to affect the results.



                                                                 15
this definition to only include underlying problems that cannot be affected by a patient’s behavior. For
example, suppose a patient is diagnosed and discharged with a simple infection and told to take antibi-
otics. If they do not follow these instructions properly, the infection can turn into sepsis, and the patient
will need to return and be admitted. This bounceback, however, is not because the doctor misdiagnosed
the patient on the first visit, and thus should not be counted. After consulting with an ED physician about
the diagnoses that jointly satisfy both requirements, we settled on the following major problems: menin-
gitis, encephalitis, heart attack, cardiac dysrhythmia, stroke, aneuryism, embolism, pulmonary collapse,
appendicitis, intestinal obstruction, peritonitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and intracranial injury.20 We
thus define a bounceback as a patient that returns to the ED within three days and is subsequently admit-
ted to the hospital with, or dies from, one of these major problems.


Discharge and Bounceback.              Our test requires us to identify the proportion of patients receiving diag-
nostic tests discharged home by an ED doctor that bounce back. This means that any patient visit whereby
either the patients were admitted to the hospital, or they were discharged by the ED doctor to a different
facility, or they left against medical advice, or they died in the ED, is not an eligible visit to be a bounce-
back. The only visits that are eligible to be bouncebacks occur when the ED doctor discharges the patient
home. The bounceback variable is coded as one if they return to the ED within three days, are admitted
to the hospital, have a principal diagnosis that is one of the major problems listed above, and their prin-
cipal diagnosis is different than any of the diagnoses from their first visit. For all other eligible visits, the
bounceback variable is coded as zero. Importantly, since the NJ and CA data sets differ in the ability to
track patients across different hospitals, a bounceback occurs in NJ if the patient returns to the same ED as
the initial visit within three days of being discharged, but in CA a bounceback occurs if the patient returns
to any ED because we can track patients across hospitals there.21
       We then arrange the visits for each patient into visit sets, where a visit set consists of all of the patient’s
ED visits that are within three days of each other. If a patient only has one ED visit in a three day period,
there will be only one visit in the visit set. Because patient visits within a visit set are likely to be related
to the same underlying problem, we only include one of the visits. We assume that different visit sets
for the same patient correspond to a different underlying problem. If there is no bounceback in the visit
set, we only include the first eligible visit. If there is a bounceback in the visit set, we only include the
ED visit that directly led to the bounceback. All other visits are dropped. Only including one visit in
the visit set allows us to determine what proportion of underlying problems discharged are successfully
handled, as opposed to what proportion of patient visits are successfully handled. This allows our test to
be robust to any differences between minorities and whites in terms of the frequency of their visits for a
given underlying problem (i.e., the number of visits in a visit set).22

  21
      In Table 9 this is referred to as the baseline bounceback definition. Table 9 shows that the results do not change if we instead
also define a bounceback to occur in CA if the patients return to the same ED.
   22
      Suppose, for example, a white and minority patient come in for a problem and are both correctly discharged home. Suppose


                                                                 16
Diagnostic Tests. To implement our empirical test, we also need to identify patients that received di-
agnostic tests before being discharged, as our theoretical model only predicts that bounceback rates are
the same among patients of the same race who were discharged after receiving diagnostic tests.23, 24 The
diagnostic tests patients are likely to receive to screen for these major problems include lab tests, CT scans,
chest x-rays, and/or EKG’s. Identifying patients that receive any of these procedures is somewhat prob-
lematic, because different hospitals have different definitions of what a procedure is. The hospitals in
our data are only required to record procedures that are surgical in nature or carry a procedural or anes-
thetic risk. Because the diagnostic tests listed above are not invasive, some hospitals in New Jersey and
California do not record these procedures at all. These hospitals are somewhat easy to identify, however,
because none of their patients are recorded as having these procedures, which is unrealistic and implies
they just do not count these diagnostic tests as procedures. Thus any hospital that records no lab tests,
no CT scans, no chest x-rays or no EKG’s was dropped. We also dropped hospitals where less than 10%
of the patients discharged from the ED underwent any kind of diagnostic test. This included about 68%
of the CA hospitals and about 25% (21 out of 83 hospitals) of the New Jersey hospitals. If a hospital is
dropped, all of the corresponding eligible visits for that hospital are also dropped.
    One remaining issue with the above diagnostic test restrictions is that not all patients receiving diag-
nostic tests are actually screened for a major problem. For example, a patient that comes in with a broken
leg will typically be x-rayed to aid in fixing the fracture. However, the doctor is using the x-ray test for
treatment purposes, not to screen for any of the major problems. Our test requires that we identify pa-
tients that have had diagnostic tests for the purpose of screening for a major problem (since these are the
patients among which the bounceback rate will be the same). To that end, we recode patients that are
discharged with a diagnosis which implies they likely would not have been screened for a major problem
as having zero diagnostic tests done. We consulted with an ED physician to determine the diagnoses that
fit this criteria, which primarily include skin and tissue infections, bone fractures, and open wounds.
    With our definition of a bounceback, we should be able to accurately identify the proportion of pa-
tients where one of the above major problems was missed. This means we can only identify whether
the white patient chooses to follow up with their general practitioner, but the minority patient returns back to the ED to follow
up, and thus ends up with more visits in the visit set. If we counted all visits in the visit set, then the minority patient would
be credited with two ‘successful’ visits, while the white patient would only be credited with one. This would result in us over-
estimating the successful visits for minority patients.
   23
      Note that running our empirical test only on patients that receive diagnostic tests helps deal with the fact that minorities
might use the ED differently than a white patient does. If minorities are less likely to have a general practitioner, they might go to
the ED to receive treatment for more minor problems than white patients will. One might worry this will reduce the proportion
of missed serious problems for minorities since these visits have extremely low risk of there being a major problem, and thus the
proportion of successful problems treated will increase. However, by requiring that diagnostic tests be done we can effectively
eliminate these types of low-risk visits as they will typically not be serious enough to merit diagnostic tests.
   24
      Our model predicts that all patients of the same race discharged after having diagnostic tests done will have the same
probability of having a major problem. These major problems are mutually exclusive, and it is assumed that doctors are only
screening for one of these problems (the specific one tested for depends on the patient’s initial complaint). We assume doctors
set the same discharge threshold across all of these major problems. As these are all extremely serious problems, this is a rational
assumption. These assumptions ensure that everyone discharged has the same probability of bouncing back, and does not
require us to separate out the analysis by visit reason.



                                                                 17
doctors engage in discrimination when they diagnose these particular diseases. Because of the nature
of our data, we cannot determine whether doctors discriminate in their diagnosis of other diseases. The
strength of our test for prejudice, however, is that it is robust to underlying differences between minority
and white patients, such as their propensity to use the ED. In the appendix, we describe in Table A1 how
we arrived at our analysis sample from the raw data sets we obtained from New Jersey and California.25


4.2      Descriptive Statistics

       In this section, we provide some descriptive statistics of our data set. Table 1 reports the disposition
of emergency department patients in New Jersey and California. For this purpose the sample used in
Table 1 includes not just the patients that were discharged home (as would be in our sample in the main
analysis below), but all ED patients including those that were admitted to the hospital, those that died in
the ED, those who left the ED against medical advice, and those who were discharged elsewhere. These
data sets were formed by combining ED discharges with ED visits that led to hospital admissions, and
then making race and hospital restrictions. We drop all visits to hospitals that did not always record the
diagnostic procedures.26
       From January 2006 through July 2007, there were a total of over 3.5 million visits to the relevant emer-
gency departments in New Jersey. Of all these patients, 28.44% of them were discharged without any
diagnostic tests, 49.1% were discharged after some diagnostic tests were performed, and about 20% of
them were admitted to the hospital either immediately or after diagnostic tests. A small fraction (1.03%)
were discharged elsewhere and some (1.36%) left the emergency department against medical advice. Fi-
nally, 0.13% died in the ED. However, the dispositions differ substantially when we stratify the sample
by racial groups. We restricted our attention to white, black, and Hispanic patients. Due to their relative
number, we also included Asian patients for California. For example, 23.24% of the white patients, but
only 16.96% of Blacks and 13.93% of Hispanics were admitted to hospitals; 24.25% of whites, but 33.5%
of Blacks and 34.73% of Hispanics, were discharged without diagnostics tests. The fractions of death
are respectively 0.16% for whites, 0.12% for Blacks and 0.06% for Hispanics. The fractions of patients
discharged with diagnostic tests were quite similar for whites and Hispanics at 49.97% and 49.11% re-
spectively, and for Blacks at a somewhat lower rate of 33.5%. The overall disposition pattern is quite
similar in California, though the fraction discharged without diagnostic tests at 33.41% in California is
higher than, and the fraction discharged with diagnostic tests at 42.77% is lower than, their respective
counterparts in New Jersey. However, the total fractions of patients discharged are remarkably similar in
the two states. Racial disparities in California are also quite large. Asians seem to be much more likely to
be admitted to the hospital than other patients, and much less likely to be discharged without diagnostic
  25
      The file we use for our California analysis actually has five more observations than is listed in Table A1. It is impossible
to exactly replicate the file we used because the code involves grouping the patient visits. If a patient continues to return to
the ED on the same day, we don’t know which visit was first, and so the ordering of the visits can change, which leads to the
discrepancy in observations. Of course, none of the results should be sensitive to five out of more than 2.6 million discharges.
   26
      See the subsection “Diagnostic Tests” in Section 4.1 above for the hospitals that are dropped.


                                                               18
tests. The death rate in ED is also much higher for Asians and whites than Blacks and Hispanics.
       Table 2 reports the race, gender, age, and insurance status for the emergency department visits we
included in our analysis (those that ended up in being discharged home), for both California and New
Jersey. With the sample restrictions discussed above, we end up with over two million visits for both
California and New Jersey. For both states, whites make up the majority (with 56.5% in New Jersey and
53.8% in California), although black and Hispanic patients make up a sizable proportion of the visits in
both states. There are substantial differences between the insurance makeup of the patients in New Jersey
and California. Patients in New Jersey are much more likely to have private insurance, while patients in
California are more likely to be on Medicare and Medicaid. In terms of age, the majority of patients in both
California and New Jersey are young (age 40 and under). However, California has a higher prevalence of
older patients than New Jersey does.
       Table 3 shows the breakdown of insurance status and age by race. About 60% of white patients in
New Jersey have private insurance, while only 45% of black patients do. Overall, one can see that white
and Asian patients are more likely to have private insurance or Medicare. Black and Hispanic patients
are more likely to have Medicaid or no insurance. In terms of age, black and Hispanic patients tend to be
younger than white and Asian patients.
       Table 4 provides the descriptive statistics on the diagnostic tests received by ED patients in New Jersey
and California by demographic and insurance status. In our analysis sample, 47.3% of ED patients in NJ
and 42.6% of ED patients in CA received at least one diagnostic test before being discharged home, with
the unconditional mean number of tests being 2.43 in NJ and 2.25 in CA respectively. The mean number
of diagnostic tests conditional on having at least one test are also quite similar in the two states, with
5.13 in NJ and 5.27 in CA. In both states, female patients are more likely to receive diagnostic tests than
male patients: 52.4% of the female patients, and 41.4% of the male patients in NJ received at least one
diagnostic tests, and in CA, the respective fractions are 46.9% for females and 37.3% for males. The
fraction of patients receiving diagnostic tests also differ by insurance status and age. Medicare patients
are most likely to receive diagnostic tests, which is partly explained by their age as older patients are also
most likely to receive diagnostic tests. The patterns are very similar in NJ and CA.
       Table 5 shows the bounceback rate for all eligible emergency department visits, as well as only the
visit sets where diagnostic tests were done. Overall, only .05% of the visits in New Jersey and .1% of the
visits in California result in a bounceback. Part of the reason for the higher bounceback rates in California
is likely due to the fact that we are using a broader definition of bounceback for CA patients (return to
any ED) than that for NJ patients (return to the same ED). These bounceback rates were quite consistent
with that described in the medical literature.27 As a bounceback is a mistake that can have extremely
serious consequences, we would expect the rate to be quite low. The remainder of the table breaks down
the bounceback rate by race, gender, age and insurance status. The column 𝑝-value under each grouping
  27
   As we discussed in the introduction, Weinstock and Longstreth (2007) estimated the “serious” bounceback rates (for which
hospital admission was required) due to possible medical error in the initial visit to be betwwen 0.1% to 0.18%.

     Table 5: Bounceback Rates in New Jersey and California with and without Diagnostic Tests.
     N OTE : (1). All numbers, except for the 𝑝-values and sample sizes, are percentages.
     (2). The row 𝑝-values is the 𝑝-value for the null of equal bounceback rates with and without diagnostic tests against the alternative that the bounceback rate with
     diagnostic tests is higher than without for the sample listed in the row heading. The column 𝑝-value refers to the 𝑝-value for the null of equal bounceback rates for
     different rows within the same column against the alternative that they are not equal.
comes from a Chi-Square test of whether the bounceback rate depends on the categories in that grouping;
the row 𝑝-value tests whether the bounceback rates for discharges with and without diagnostic tests are
equal against the one-sided alternative that the bounceback rate is higher for discharges with diagnostic
tests.
         One can see from these descriptive statistics that whites are actually more likely to bounce back than
blacks and Hispanics, and Medicare patients are significantly more likely to bounce back than patients
with other types of insurance. One likely reason for this is because white patients and Medicare patients
are older on average than the other patients in their respective grouping. As one can see from the last
panel of Table 5, the bounceback rate increases significantly as patients get older. While this might reflect
age discrimination, it more likely reflects the fact that doctors are less likely to get sued if they miss a
serious problem in an older patient. The consequences are more severe when they miss a serious problem
in a relatively young patient. If the probability of getting sued decreases as patient age increases, doctors
will rationally allow for a higher threshold in dismissing older patients. The regression analysis will allow
us to determine if the racial differences in the bounceback rate result from discrimination, or are simply
due to the different age distributions among the different races.
         It is also important to note that, with the exception of Medicare patients and patients 65 and older,
the bounceback rate for those discharged with diagnostic tests is always higher than for those discharged
without diagnostic tests. This is consistent with our model’s implication that only patients for whom
physicians’ initial probability assessment that they have a major problem is sufficiently low are discharged
without diagnostic tests. In a subsection below, we will present more formal tests to confirm this basic
implication of the physicians’ behavioral model.


5        Empirical Results

5.1        Main Result

         Our main results are reported in Panel B of Tables 6 and 7. The sample used in these regressions is
the set of patients who were discharged from the initial ED visit with at least one diagnostic test. In order
to test for racial prejudice we need to determine whether the bounceback rate depends on the race of the
patient. We also need to control for all other variables the bounceback rate could depend on, such as age,
gender and insurance status.28
         Panel B of Table 6 shows that among the patients who were discharged home with diagnostic tests in
New Jersey, the bounceback rates do not differ by race of the patients. If anything, Black and Hispanic
patients have somewhat lower bounceback rates than the omitted racial group, the White patients. Fe-
male patients have a significantly lower bounceback rates than male patients. Interestingly, we find that
patients with Medicare and other insurance, once we control for age, have lower bounceback rates. As ex-
    28
    The bounceback rate can depend on age, gender and insurance status either because doctors discriminate against people
based on these variables, or because it is acceptable for the bounceback rates to differ within these variables.

pected, we find that older patients are more likely to bounceback than younger patients.29 These findings
are quantitatively and qualitatively similar across the OLS, Logit and Probit specifications.
       The results for California, reported in Panel B of Table 7 are mostly similar to those for New Jersey. In
all specifications, we find that the bounceback rates for Black and Hispanic patients who were discharged
from their initial ED visit with diagnostic tests are somewhat higher than that of the White patients,
but the difference is not statistically differently from zero. The only exception is Asian patients, whose
bounceback rate is higher than that for the White patients, and the difference is statistically significant at
10% level. We also find that, similar to New Jersey, Female patients have a significantly lower bounceback
rates than male patients, and patients with Medicare and other insurance have lower bounceback rates
than those with private insurance; finally, we find that older patients are more likely to bounceback than
younger patients.
       Using the conceptual framework we outlined in Section 3, we can conclude that in our data set, there
is no evidence that the ED physicians exhibit prejudice in their treatment decisions against black and
Hispanic patients relative to white patients, though there is some evidence of prejudice against Asian
patients in California as they exhibit a higher bounceback rate.


5.2      Testing the Model’s Implications

       Our test result is credible only if the behavioral model of physician behavior in Section 2, on which our
test is based, is plausible. Fortunately, as discussed in Section 2 our model has some testable implications.
Firstly, the model predicts that the bounceback rate for patients discharged after having diagnostic tests
should be higher than for patients discharged without diagnostic tests, since the latter were discharged
with a bounceback rate that is below the lower threshold. In Panel A of Tables 6 and 7, we explicitly
check this by regressing the dummy of whether a discharged patient bounces back on a set of covariates,
including the dummy variable of whether the patient is discharged after receiving diagnostic tests. In
all specifications, we find that the diagnostic dummy is positive and statistically significant at the 1%
level. That is, controlling for the other covariates, individuals who are discharged with diagnostic tests
are indeed more likely than those discharged without diagnostic tests to return to the ED within 72 hours.
The magnitude of the diagnostic dummy is also quite large because the baseline average bounceback rates
of all patients are respectively 0.05% and 0.10% in NJ and CA.
       The second implication of our model is that, among those discharged with diagnostic tests, the ac-
curacy of the diagnostic tests used (as measured by 𝑛𝑓 and 𝑝𝑓 ) should not affect the bounceback rate
conditional on race (and/or any observable characteristics that the physicians may base their prejudice
on). Unfortunately, while we know the diagnostic test codes for each patient, we do not know the ac-
curacy of these tests as measured by the false positive and false negative rates. To proxy for this, we
stratified the various diagnostic tests into six groups: lab tests (which primarily include blood and urine
  29
   Thus the higher bounceback rates of Medicare patients reported in Table 5 is completely driven by the older ages of the
Medicare patients.

tests), electrocardiograms (EKG’s), ultrasounds, x-rays, CT scans, and other tests. The costs of these tests
can be measured by both how long they take to perform and get the results back (time-intensiveness),
and how invasive they are to patients. Overall, lab tests and EKG’s are considered to be the least costly,
as opposed to ultrasounds which are more time-intensive, x-rays which are more invasive, and CT scans
which are both time-intensive and invasive. Thus, if lab tests and EKGs are helpful in screening for a
major problem the doctor is concerned about, doctors should always want to do these tests first. The only
reason ED doctors would choose to do other tests (either alone or in combination with these tests) is if
they were more accurate. Thus, we create the indicator variable “accurate” which equals zero if the patient
had either an EKG only, lab tests only, or both an EKG and lab tests; “accurate” equals one if the patient
had any of the more costly tests (either by themselves or in combination with lab tests and EKG’s). Table
8 presents the results from regressing the bounceback indicator on the traditional covariates, as well as
the accurate variable for the sample of patients that received diagnostic tests. If our model is correct the
coefficient on accurate should be insignificant, which implies that the accuracy of the tests used does not
affect the bounceback rate. This is indeed what we find for New Jersey in Column (1). We repeat this
analysis for California in Column (3), but do find the accuracy of the tests is significant at the 10% level.
However, when we restrict to the sub-sample of patients who are younger than 65, shown in Columns
(2) and (4), we find that the accuracy of the tests has no effect on bouncebacks for both New Jersey and
California. Recall that earlier in Table 5 we found evidence that the first test of our model does not work
on patients over 65, as the bounceback rate is higher for those patients without diagnostic tests. Taken
together, these results provide support for our model for patients less than 65.30


5.3      Robustness of Results

       In this subsection, we provide evidence that our basic finding above is robust to some different sample
and econometric specifications. The model checks performed above implied that our model seems to
work best for patients younger than 65. We thus check if the same general results we found in Panel B of
Tables 6 and 7 for the full sample holds up for patients younger than 65. We present the OLS regression
results in Columns (1) and (2) of Table 9. For New Jersey, none of the coefficients change appreciably.
For California, the only changes are that the coefficients on Medicaid and other insurance now become
significant, although the signs remain the same. The coefficients for Blacks and Hispanics continue to
be insignificant for both states, implying that our conclusion of no racial prejudice against these groups
  30
     We also tested the second implication of our model by using the number of diagnostic tests a patient received as a proxy for
the accuracy of the tests done, making the plausible assumption that the more tests done, the higher the overall accuracy should
be. However, we found that the coefficient estimates on the number of diagnostic tests are positive and statistically significant,
which goes against the model’s predictions. One potential reason for this positive correlation is that a high number of tests
can indicate the doctor is very uncertain about which of the various major problems the patient can potentially have, and thus
tests them for many different things. Our model works best in the situation where a doctor has narrowed down the potential
major problems to only a few and tests for those. Using the number of diagnostic tests can stratify patients according to doctor’s
uncertainty about what the major problems are, which might be why the test fails. In contrast, the regressions shown in Table 8
that use the type of test as a proxy for accuracy do not necessarily stratify patients according to doctor’s uncertainty.

continues to hold for this subsample. Another robustness check we perform is to determine if the results
are sensitive to the fact that in the California data, we can link patients across hospitals, while in New
Jersey we cannot. So far, we have treated any Californian patient returning to any hospital within 72 hours
of being discharged as a bounceback, while for New Jersey patients, we only treat patients returning to the
same hospital within 72 hours of being discharged as a bounceback. It will be useful to examine whether
the data limitation in New Jersey might make a difference in our inference about racial prejudice of the
ED physicians. To examine this, we examine whether the results in California change when we use the
New Jersey definition of a bounceback (i.e., any bounceback whereby the patient returned to a different
hospital is coded as a successful visit). Results from OLS regressions are shown for the full sample in
Column (3) of Table 9, and for the age-restricted sample in Column (4). Once again, the coefficients do not
change much as compared to Column (4) of Table 7. In particular, the coefficients on Black and Hispanic
continue to be insignificant.


5.4      Results from Inappropriate Tests

       In this section, we report in Tables 10 and 11 the results from other descriptive tests researchers might
be tempted to do when testing for racial prejudice in the ED, as we described in the text preceding Propo-
sition 3. Specifically, Column 1 in these two tables test for racial difference in the unconditional bounce-
back rates among all discharged patients, as opposed to the subsample who were discharged home with
diagnostic tests. Other potential descriptive tests include testing for racial differences in the following:
the discharge rate of patients (Column 2), the proportion of discharged patients receiving diagnostic tests
(Column 3), the number of diagnostic tests discharged patients received given they received at least one
(Column 4), and the accuracy of the diagnostic tests done (Column 5). All of these tests were shown
to be inappropriate tests for racial prejudice in Proposition 3. There might be racial differences in these
variables either because doctors are racially prejudiced, or because there are underlying differences in the
patient’s condition that are correlated with race. The results of these OLS regressions are shown in Tables
10 and 11 for New Jersey and California, respectively, where we proxy for the accuracy of the diagnostic
tests done by the indicator variable “accurate” dummy described earlier.31 Table 10 shows while there are
no racial differences in the bounceback rates among all patients, there are significant racial differences
among the other descriptive indicators. The race results do not, however, all go in the same direction.
Specifically, black patients are more likely to be discharged, but are also more likely to have had at least
one diagnostic test done. Conditional on having at least one test done, blacks get less tests done, and
also get less accurate ones. Meanwhile, Hispanics are less likely to be discharged and are more likely to
have gotten at least one diagnostic test. They also get more diagnostic tests done, although the tests done
are less accurate. Table 11 shows a similar pattern for California, in that there are no racial differences
among bounceback rates for all discharged patients (except for Asians), while there are significant racial
  31
    The sample used in the specifications in Column 2 are all hospital discharges and admissions, where we have excluded those
patients that either died in the ED or left against medical advice.

    The results from these tests show the consequences from running incorrect tests. Overall, the results
show that patient race has a significant effect on the discharge rate, whether diagnostic tests are done,
and the amount and accuracy of the tests done. This would lead researchers using these descriptive tests
to conclude racial prejudice was occurring, while our correct test implies there is none.


6    Conclusion

    In this paper we propose and empirically implement a test for the presence of racial prejudice among
emergency department physicians based on the bounceback rates of the patients who are discharged from
their initial ED visit after getting diagnostic tests. A bounceback is defined as a return to the ED within
72 hours of being initially discharged. Based on a plausible theoretical model of physician behavior, we
show that differential bounceback rates across patients of different racial groups who are discharged af-
ter receiving diagnostic tests from their ED visits are informative of the racial prejudice of the physicians.
Applying the test to large data sets from California and New Jersey, we do not find evidence of racial prej-
udice. Our finding suggests that, at least in the emergency department setting, taste based discrimination
does not play an important role in the racial disparities in health care.
    This paper contributes to the literature on the outcome-based test for racial prejudice by providing an
explicit model in which the availability of continuous control variables by the decision maker – in our
case the ED physicians – may generate subsamples in which the infra-marginality problem for the use of
the outcome test can be avoided. In our setting, we show that the bounceback rates are the same for
same-race discharged patients if they received diagnostic tests in the initial ED visits, and thus applying
the outcome test to this subsample is not subject to the infra-marginality problem.
    Importantly, we also provide evidence broadly consistent with the testable implications of our mo-
del, lending credibility to our model and thus our empirical findings that there is no evidence of racial
prejudice in the ED. Specifically, two testable implications of our model are empirically examined and
supported. First, the data shows that the bounceback rates are higher for those who were discharged
without diagnostic tests than those who were discharged with diagnostic tests. Second, we show that a
measure of the accuracy of the diagnostic tests does not predict the bounceback rates once conditioning
on race and other characteristics of the patients. Finally, we show that the conclusions from our condi-
tional bounceback rate test differ from other commonly used, but inappropriate (according to our model),
tests.

                         Appendix: Accounting for the Sample Selection

       Table A1 shows how the primary data samples used for both New Jersey and California were formed
from the original files of all ED discharges. For New Jersey we first dropped all patients that were not
either white, black or Hispanic. Panel A shows how imposing the sample restrictions discussed in Section
4 leaves us with 2,413,874 discharges. For California, we did not impose any initial sample restrictions;
Panel B shows that imposing the necessary sample restrictions leaves us with 2,611,228 observations.32

    As we explained in Section 4.1, the analysis sample for California actually has five more observations than is listed in Table
A1 (2,611,233 instead of 2,611,228).
