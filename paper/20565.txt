                                               ABSTRACT

Although doctors and hospitals own their patients' medical records, state and federal laws require that
they provide patients with a copy at "reasonable cost." We examine the effects of state laws that cap
the fees that doctors and hospitals are allowed to charge patients for a copy of their records. We test
whether these laws affected patients' propensity to switch doctors and the prices of new- and existing-patient
visits. We also examine the effect of laws on hospitals' adoption of electronic medical record (EMR)
systems. We find that patients from states adopting caps on copy fees were significantly more likely
to switch doctors, and that hospitals in states adopting caps were significantly more likely to install
an EMR. We also find that laws did not have a systematic, significant effect on prices.

Introduction

       Property rights in a patient's medical records are effectively shared between the

doctor or hospital that created them and the patient on whom the records are based. The

general rule in American law is that information (such as that contained in a medical

record) can not be formally owned, but a tangible manifestation of information (such as a

medical record itself) is the property of the party that produced it (Samuelson 2000). In

this sense, both printed and electronic medical records are owned by doctors and

hospitals. However, these ownership rights are not absolute. Federal law regulates how

doctors and hospitals can use patients' records, including requiring that patients be

allowed to obtain a copy at "reasonable cost."

       This hybrid approach to records ownership is a topic of considerable debate.

Some health policy analysts have suggested that the "reasonable cost" standard is an

ineffective way to ensure patients can get access to their information because it leaves

room for doctors and hospitals to demand significant fees (Hall and Schulman 2010).

This hypothesis is consistent with a survey that found that the charges for a copy of a

medical record ranged from nothing to hundreds of dollars (Fioriglio and Szolovits

2005). Although the most obvious implications of this claim are distributional, it may

also have consequences for efficiency.

       First, allowing doctors to impose copying costs may enable them to make it

difficult for patients to switch to a competitor (Parente 2010; Ozdemir, Barron, and

Bandyopadhyay 2011). The strategic opportunity to impose switching costs arises

because most medical care involves a series of encounters over time, each of which is

more useful when it is coordinated with the others. Care is highly customized, and
through repeated interaction, a physician gains information about the patient’s clinical

characteristics, preferences and health behaviors which enables her to provide more

effective treatment. Switching doctors is therefore easier when medical records are more

transferable. Economic theory suggests three ways that strategic imposition of switching

costs could reduce welfare in markets for physician services: by leading to higher prices

(through reduced competition), less switching (even when it would be otherwise

efficient), or the delivery of treatment in more costly or lower quality ways (Farrell and

Klemperer 2007).

       Second, allowing doctors and hospitals to impose copying costs may reduce their

incentives to adopt electronic medical records systems (EMRs). EMRs reduce the cost of

creating a copy of a medical record (Fioriglio and Szolovits 2005). Thus, making

patients responsible for the costs of copying contributes to the disconnect between who

pays for EMRs and who benefits from them (Hillestad et al. 2005). If contracts were

complete and markets for health services were perfectly competitive, this would be

irrelevant; but because these stylized conditions are unlikely to be true in practice,

assignment of copying costs may affect the medical care production process (Coase

1960). This too could have important effects on social welfare. Miller and Tucker

(2011) show that hospitals' failure to adopt EMRs leads to higher rates of neonatal

mortality, driven by an increase in deaths from conditions requiring careful monitoring.

They calculate that the adoption of EMRs would be a cost-effective way of improving

health outcomes.

       The importance of these hypotheses is an open empirical issue. Although there

are reasons to believe that giving patients greater rights to their records would reduce




                                                                                             1
switching costs and enhance incentives for EMR adoption, there is no evidence about

their likely consequences for patient or provider behavior. Few papers have sought to

assess the current approach to records ownership or whether alternatives could lower the

cost or improve the quality of care.

         This paper seeks to fill this gap. We examine the effects of state laws that cap the

fees that doctors and hospitals are allowed to charge patients for a copy of their records.

These laws effectively reallocate property rights in medical records from physicians and

hospitals to patients. As such they are an important example of the broader class of

reform that seeks to expand patients' control of their personal health information.

         We test whether these laws affected patients' propensity to switch doctors and the

prices of new- and existing-patient visits. We also examine the effect of laws on

hospitals' adoption of EMR systems. We find that patients from states adopting caps on

copy fees were significantly more likely to switch doctors, and that hospitals in states

adopting caps were significantly more likely to install an EMR. We also find that laws

did not have a systematic, significant effect on prices. Because we do not have

information on patient health outcomes or other measures of quality of care, we cannot

definitively conclude that assigning the cost of records transfer to providers would create

benefits for consumers that exceed the cost burden imposed on providers. However,

combining the results of other research with reasonable assumptions, we conjecture that it

would.

         The paper proceeds in five sections. Section I outlines the law governing

ownership of medical records, the role of state statutes capping copy fees, and previous

research into the effects of medical records ownership on markets for health care.




                                                                                              2
Section II describes the data that we use to investigate the effects of caps on medical

record costs. Section III presents our empirical models. Section IV presents our results,

and Section V concludes.



I.         Medical Records Ownership Law: Previous Research

           The law governing ownership of medical records is an example of the broader

phenomenon of property rights that are not absolute. The historical rule has been that

providers could use medical records however they would like, as long as they satisfied

their common-law duties arising out of the doctor-patient relationship (Hall and

Schulman 2010). Starting in the 1970s, states began to codify these duties in statutes,

focusing on the protection of patients' privacy. State privacy laws limited the

circumstances in which providers could disclose information without patient consent,

imposed requirements for obtaining consent, and specified penalties for violations (Miller

and Tucker 2009). The passage of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability

Act of 1996 (HIPAA) extended these efforts to the federal level. In addition, HIPAA

required the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to ensure individuals'

access to their personal health information. In December of 2000, HHS promulgated the

"Privacy Rule," which specified (among other things) that providers could charge

individuals at most a reasonable, cost-based fee (including labor) for a copy of their

records.1

           States have also passed statutes that required providers to take explicit steps to

provide patients with access to their records, including floors on the length of time that

records needed to be retained, ceilings on the time that providers had to respond to a

                                                                                                3
records request, and limits on the fees that could be charged for copying and release.

Prior to the Privacy Rule's taking effect in 2001, 30 states had imposed specific

restrictions on what providers could charge patients for a copy of their records. Between

2002 and 2007, eleven additional states adopted specific caps on what providers could

charge. Although the language in the statutes varied, the effective caps that they imposed

were similar. As Pritts, Kayne, and Jacobson (2009) show, with the exception of

Kentucky (which required providers to provide patients with a free copy of their medical

record), most states with a specific law capped the cost of a 100 page record at between

$40 and $70. Table 1 shows which states had specific caps, when they adopted them, and

their location in state statutes.

        Previous research has examined the implications of state privacy laws. Miller and

Tucker (2009) show that, by inhibiting hospitals' ability to exchange information across

platforms and facilities, more stringent privacy laws reduce hospital adoption of EMRs.

Although this work suggests that privacy regulation has had real effects on the process by

which health services are produced, it does not provide direct evidence on the

consequences of reforming laws explicitly governing the allocation of property rights

between patients and providers. According to Miller and Tucker (2009), the principal

consequence of enhanced privacy protection is to raise providers' compliance costs.

While high compliance costs on the part of providers may raise the cost of providing

patients with a copy of their medical records, these effects operate through an increase in

the cost of transferring information rather than a reallocation of the cost between

providers and patients.




                                                                                           4
        Despite potential consequences of giving patients greater control over their

medical records, no empirical work has investigated either the practical importance of

reallocating such rights or the effectiveness of states' policy response in this context. We

examine how patient switching among physicians, physician prices, and hospital

information-technology adoption changed in response to the adoption of caps on medical

record copying fees. To address the first two questions, we use MarketScan claims data

from 2001-07, matched with data on state laws from Pritts, Kayne, and Jacobson (2009)

and data on physician markets from Baker, Bundorf, and Royalty (2013) and the Area

Health Resource File (AHRF, 2001-2007). We analyze claims for two common types of

outpatient visits: an evaluation and management visit for a new (CPT 99203) and an

existing (CPT 99213) patient. We test whether the proportion of visits by new patients in

states that adopted caps from 2001-07 differs from the proportion from states that did not,

holding county fixed effects, time fixed effects, the competitiveness of physician markets,

and other time-varying characteristics of counties constant. We also test whether the

prices charged to new and existing patients changed differentially in adopting versus non-

adopting states.

        To address the third question, we use data from the Healthcare Information and

Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Analytics database on the adoption of EMRs by

1,947 US hospitals from 2001-07, matched with the data on state laws above and data on

hospitals and hospital market competitiveness from Medicare Cost Reports. We test

whether hospitals in states that adopted caps were more likely to install an EMR that

hospitals in states that did not.




                                                                                           5
II.     Data

Physician claims data

        We use data from Truven Analytics MarketScan on approximately 30 million

physician claims from nonelderly individuals enrolled in a fee-for-service health plan

between 2001 and 2007. The MarketScan data contain information from claims filed by

privately insured individuals who obtain insurance through a participating employer.

Though (as we discuss below) these data are not representative of the entire U.S.

population, they contain claims from all states (except Alaska and Hawaii) which should

be sufficient to characterize patterns of variation in prices from area to area and over

time.

        We extracted claims for two specific services, CPT codes 99203 and 99213, from

doctors identified in the data as being in family practice, internal medicine, or one of a set

of selected medical specialties. 2 A code of 99203 represents an office visit with a new

patient (i.e. a patient new to the physician) of intermediate length and complexity. A

code of 99213 is an intermediate office visit with an established patient. A new patient is

defined as one who has not received any professional services from the physician or

another physician of the same specialty who belongs to the same group practice, within

the past 3 years. These are the most commonly billed of the 9920x and 9921x series. We

also imposed the additional selection criteria in Baker, Bundorf, and Royalty (2013).

        From each claim, we analyze what is commonly referred to as the “allowed

amount” – the amount the plan allows the physician to be paid for the service, after the

application of contractual discount provisions and other plan rules but before adjustment

2
 Other medical specialties include allergy/immunology, cardiology, dermatology, gastroenterology,
neurology, ophthalmology, pulmonary disease, nephrology, infectious disease, endocrinology, and
rheumatology.


                                                                                                    6
for patient copayments or deductibles. The physician may receive this amount partly

from the insurance plan and partly from the patient in the form of applicable copayments

or deductibles. Note that the “allowed amounts” we study are not the amounts charged

by physicians, but the actual transaction payments under physician contracts with health

plans, including payments made both by the patient and by the insurer.

        Ideally, to test whether caps affect switching, we would know each patient's

history of encounters with each physician. However, specific physicians are not reliably

identified in the MarketScan data throughout our study period. Thus we define a patient

as having switched in a given year if she has a new-patient visit (CPT code 9920x) with a

physician of a given specialty that was preceded, within the past 3 years, by either a new-

or an existing-patient visit (CPT code 9920x or 9921x) with a physician of that specialty.

Our approach is likely to be valid because physicians are paid more for new-patient

visits, yet at the same time, insurers can easily verify whether a not a patient has

previously received services from a given physician.

        We use this rule to construct two measures of switching. Both measures are

based on the seven repeated cross-sections of individuals who were enrolled in a fee-for-

service health plan for one of the years 2001-07 and for the three preceding years.3 The

first measure specifies a patient as switching her primary care physician if she had a new-

patient family practice or internal medicine claim that was preceded, within the past 3

years, by either a new- or an existing-patient family practice or internal medicine claim.

The second measure specifies a patient as switching her specialist physician if she had a

 For example, the 2001 cross-section would include everyone enrolled for all of 2001 in a fee-for-service
plan who also reported full-year enrollment in a fee-for-service plan in 2000, 1999, and 1998.


                                                                                                            7
new-patient claim in at least one of the medical specialties that was preceded, within the

past 3 years, by either a new- or existing-patient claim in that same specialty.

       We omit claims and patients from Massachusetts, which adopted a statewide

health reform law during our study period, which other research has shown affected the

cost of care (Cogan, Hubbard, and Kessler 2010).

Hospital technology adoption data

       We use data on hospital adoption of EMRs from the 2001-2007 releases of the

Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Analytics (until

2003, known as the Dorenfest Complete Integrated Healthcare Delivery System

Database). These data include detailed information on the majority of US general

medical, acute care hospitals, including their name and address, Medicare ID number,

number of beds, and the type of EMR (if any). We follow the approach of Miller and

Tucker (2009, 2011) and code a hospital as having an EMR if it reported installing an

"enterprise EMR" system. As they point out, "enterprise EMR" software is the backbone

of a system that underlies other potential information systems such as clinical decision

support and computerized order entry. As in our analysis of the physician claims data,

we omit hospitals from Massachusetts.

Other data

       We use data from four other sources, to control for the characteristics of hospitals

and geographic areas that may be correlated with the price of physician services and

hospital technology adoption (Abraham et al. 2011; McCullough 2008). First, we use the

AHRF (2001-2007) to obtain information on time-varying county-level market

characteristics, including the number of hospital beds, enrollment in Medicare, median




                                                                                             8
household income, and population. Second, we use the American Hospital Association

(AHA) survey to obtain information on the system membership status of hospitals.4 We

match this to the HIMSS data at the hospital level. Third, we use Medicare claims data

from 2001-07 to calculate at the county-year level the number and Hirchman-Herfindahl

Index (HHI) of physicians in each specialty, according to the method in Baker, Bundorf,

and Royalty (2013). We match the number of physicians to both the physician claims

and the HIMSS data by county and year; we match the physician HHI to the physician

claims data only by county and year. Fourth, we use data from the 2001-07 Medicare

cost reports to calculate the HHI of hospital markets at the county-year based on the

number of general medical, acute-care beds.

        Table 2 presents descriptive statistics on enrollees from the MarketScan data for

2001 and 2007. The first row and column of the table shows that, among enrollees who

had a visit to a primary care physician in 2001, 22.7 percent were seeing that physician as

a new patient, after having had an office visit with a primary care physician in the past 3

years. By comparison, among enrollees who had a visit to a specialist in 2001, 7.8

percent were seeing that physician as a new patient, after having had an office visit with a

specialist of the same type in the past 3 years. The proportion of patients who switch

remained roughly constant over our study period. The second row of the table reports

the proportion of enrollees from states with a cap on copy fees. In 2001, 87-89 percent of

enrollees (depending on the sample) lived in states with a cap on fees, but by 2007, caps

on fees covered essentially all (96 percent) enrollees.



4
 The AHA assigns each hospital that is a member of a multihospital system an identification number in the
public use version of its survey. We classify a hospital as being a system member if it has a non-missing
system identifier.


                                                                                                        9
       Table 2 also presents trends in the prices of physician visits by specialty.

Between 2001 and 2007, prices rose by 13 to 17 percent, depending on type of visit and

specialty. The price of a new-patient visit was approximately 70 percent higher than an

existing-patient visit, reflecting the fact that physicians are expected to spend twice as

much time on the former. There are virtually no differences in prices between primary-

care and specialist physicians for a similarly-coded visit. All of these characteristics of

the distribution of prices for standard evaluation and management encounters (CPT

99203 and 99213) are consistent with the results from a national survey of physician fees

described in Moore (2008). Finally, Table 2 presents some basic demographic statistics

about our sample. By 2007, 44-46 percent of patients were women, which very closely

tracks the gender distribution of the employed population (US Bureau of Labor Statistics

2007). However, MarketScan enrollees are slightly older and much more heavily

employed in manufacturing than the national average worker.

       Table 3 compares the characteristics of the hospitals in the HIMSS panel to the

national average of general medical, acute-care hospitals that report to Medicare. The

table shows that the HIMSS hospitals are systematically different from the average

hospital: they are more likely to be part of a system (68.6 percent in 2007, as compared

to 58.4 percent on average), less likely to be government-owned, more likely to be a

teaching hospital, larger, and in more competitive areas. Still, the HIMSS data include

approximately two-thirds of all hospitals (accounting for around three-quarters of all

hospital beds). Thus, although estimates based on HIMSS may not be generalizable to

the average hospital, they are certainly informative about the majority of hospital services

produced in the U.S.




                                                                                              10
III.     Models

         We estimate three types of models. The first type specifies the probability of

switching (SictM) for patient i = 1, ..., Nct in county c = 1,..., C during year t = 2001, ...,

2007 from a physician of specialty M = {primary care, other medical specialties}:

                       SictM = αc + γt + λZict + βXctM + δLct + εict ,                                 (1)

where

SictM            is an indicator = 1 if the patient switched, 0 otherwise;

αc, γt           are county- and year-fixed effects;

Zict             are a set of age, gender, and industry indicator variables;

XctM             is a set of time-varying county-level market characteristics, including the

                 number of hospital beds, enrollment in Medicare, median household

                 income, population, the number of physicians in specialty M and the

                 competitiveness of physician markets in specialty M, as measured by the

                 Hirschman-Herfindahl index of physicians in the specialty5;

Lct              is an indicator variable = 1 if county c is in a state with a cap on medical

                 record copying costs in effect in year t; and

εict             is an error term which we allow to be arbitrarily correlated across claims,

                 counties, and years within a state.

         This model identifies the effect of caps on the propensity to switch doctors as long

as there are no time-varying characteristics of states that are both correlated with (but not


5
 The number of hospital beds, Medicare enrollment, household income, and population do not vary across
specialties. The number of physicians and HHI are measured at the specialty level (i.e., cardiology). The
models, however, group together all of the listed specialties in one regression, which is equivalent to
imposing the restriction that the effect of physician market characteristics are equal across specialties.


                                                                                                        11
caused by) caps and correlated with the probability of a switching. The presence of

omitted factors that simply affect overall demand for medical care would not bias our

estimates, as our measure of switching is invariant to this factor. We control for the

competitiveness of physician markets to account for the possibility that market structure

might affect the propensity of states to adopt caps. To the extent that caps affect market

structure, however, our approach will understate caps' total effect.

         The second type of model specifies the price of a patient visit (PjctM), a new-

patient visit (PNEWjctM), and the price of an existing-patient visit (POLDjctM) as a

        This model identifies the effect of caps on the propensity to adopt EMRs as long

as there are no time-varying characteristics of states that are both correlated with (but not

caused by) caps and correlated with EMR adoption.6 To investigate whether our

estimates are sensitive to our use of county-fixed effects, we also estimate models with

state- and hospital-fixed effects.



IV.     Results

        Table 4 presents estimates of δ and selected elements of β from equation (1), the

effect of caps on copy fees and time-varying county characteristics on the probability that

a patient switches primary care or specialist physician. The table also reports

heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors allowing for arbitrary correlation of εict

within each state. The first row of the table shows that people from states that adopt caps

are more likely to switch both their primary-care and specialist physicians, although the

effect of caps on primary-care-physician switching is only marginally statistically

significant. These effects are also economically significant. For primary care

physicians, for example, caps on copy fees increase switching by 2.5 percentage points,

which translates into an increase of approximately 11 percent, given the base switching

rate of approximately 22 percentage points from Table 2 (0.11 ≈ 0.025 / 0.22). For

6
 We do not control for laws protecting patient privacy, which have been shown by Miller and Tucker
(2009) to affect hospital EMR adoption, because no state changed its privacy protection law over our study
period. Thus any effect of privacy protection law would be captured by the county fixed effects.


                                                                                                       13
specialists, the magnitude of the effect of caps in percentage terms is slightly larger.

Caps on copy fees increase switching by 1 percentage point, which translates into an

increase of approximately 13 percent (0.13 ≈ 0.010 / 0.075).

       Competitiveness does not have a systematic, significant effect on switching.

Increases in the HHI relative to the first (most competitive) quartile affect switching rates

by at most one percentage point, and generally less, and are rarely statistically significant.

This may be an artifact of the way that a new-patient visit is defined. Aggregation of

physicians into group practices tends not only to decrease the probability of a new-patient

visit (because patients who switch to a new physician in the same group are not formally

considered to have switched) but also to increase the HHI. Thus, use of the HHI (or any

measure that responded positively to the number of group practices in an area) could

mask a negative association between competition and switching; patients from less

competitive areas would appear to be less likely to switch, even if the true effect were in

the other direction. However, the fact that competitiveness has no effect on measured

switching does allow us to rule out a significant positive association between competition

and switching, which would be the theoretically more likely effect.

       Table 5 presents estimates of δ and selected elements of β from equation (2). The

leftmost two columns of the table present estimates of effects on the ln(price) of a visit

for new and existing patients together; the other panels present estimates of effects on the

price of a visit for new and existing patients separately. The first row of the table shows

that caps on copy fees do not have a statistically significant effect on prices, even

accounting for the greater number of new visits that they induce; point estimates range

from around 1-2 percent, with the upper bound of 95 percent confidence intervals




                                                                                             14
generally 5 percent or less. On a base of the price of an existing-patient visit of

approximately $62 in 2007, this amounts to around $1 (with an upper bound of $3). In

contrast, competitiveness has a much larger and statistically significant effect on prices,

consistent with Baker, Bundorf, and Royalty (2013) and previous analyses of analyses of

the MarketScan data such as Dunn and Shapiro (2014) and Schneider et al. (2008).

       Taken together, the estimates in Tables 4 and 5 suggest that caps on copy fees

create benefits for consumers that exceed the burden imposed on providers. Because

caps increase patient switching, we can infer that they bind (i.e., actually result in lower

copying fees) and were not simply a transfer from patients to physicians, but were

discouraging patients from switching when they otherwise would have preferred to do so.

The fact that the base price of either a new- or existing-patient visit did not increase in

response to caps suggest that either the copy fees or the base prices exceeded competitive

levels ex ante.

       For several reasons, however, we can not draw definitive conclusions about social

welfare from our analysis. First, although we do not reject that there was no effect of

caps on prices, we also fail to reject that caps increase base prices; the upper bound of the

95 percent confidence interval around our estimates includes a price increase of around

$3 per visit, which is sufficiently large to account for a plausible offset from the revenue

effects of a cap. Second, the fact that caps do not significantly decrease visit prices

implies that any equilibrium benefits of reducing switching costs through lower visit

prices are relatively small. Third, because we do not know the true cost of providing

copies of medical records, we can not exclude the possibility that the caps we study were

set too low.




                                                                                              15
       Fourth, we can not exclude the possibility that caps otherwise affect the quality of

a visit. The quality consequences of switching costs are theoretically indeterminate

(Farrell and Klemperer 2007, Section 3.7.1-3.7.2); by implication, so is the effect of caps.

Even if we had data on physician quality, detecting changes in quality of the (small)

magnitude that would be likely to result from a cap on copy fees would be difficult.

Physician quality is multi-dimensional and, for a non-elderly patient population unlikely

to suffer any serious adverse health events, highly imprecisely measured.

       Table 6 presents estimates of δ, θ and selected elements of β from equation (3).

The first column presents estimates that control for state fixed effects; the second and

third columns present estimates that control for county and hospital fixed effects,

respectively. The first row of the table shows that caps on copy fees provide a powerful

incentive for hospitals to adopt EMRs. Hospitals from states that imposed a cap were

approximately 8 percentage points more likely to adopt an EMR. On a 2007 base of

EMR adoption of 66 percentage points, this amounts to 12 percent. The magnitude of the

estimated effect declines very slightly when we substitute hospital fixed effects for

county fixed effects, but remains statistically and economically significant.

       The table also shows how the market environment and hospital characteristics

affect EMR adoption. Hospitals in more competitive markets are more likely to adopt

EMRs, although this effect is only marginally statistically significant, and only for

hospitals in the second quartile of the HHI distribution relative to the first quartile. For-

profit hospitals are significantly less likely to adopt EMRs, and teaching hospitals

significantly more likely to adopt EMRs, consistent with Abraham et al. (2011, Table 3)

and Miller and Tucker (2009, Table 2).




                                                                                            16
        The findings in Table 6 suggest another, possibly more important, channel

through which caps on copy fees create benefits for consumers: by encouraging the

adoption of EMRs. Whether the cap-induced expansion of EMR use is worth its costs, of

course, is a difficult question that we can not answer with our data. However, other work

suggests that it would be. The relatively low level of EMR use in the US is widely

believed to contribute to fragmentation of care that is not in patients' interests (e.g., Hall

and Schulman 2010). In addition, at least in the realm of childbirth, Miller and Tucker

(2011) show that the incremental adoption of EMRs attributable to the relaxation of state

privacy regulation is highly cost-effective. Whether the margin along which caps operate

is same as the margin affected by privacy regulation is an open question that could be

investigated in future research.

        We also estimated several variants of equations (1)-(3) to explore the robustness

of our results. First, we estimated models that added indicator variables =1 in the year or

1-2 years prior to a state's adoption of a cap on copy fees, in order to investigate whether

our effects were due to preexisting trends that were either unrelated to or due to factors

that precipitated adoption of the laws in question. In no model was the year or 1-2 year

lead of the law statistically significant. In addition, in no model did the inclusion of the

leads of the law substantively change our estimates of the effect of interest.

        Second, we estimated models that decomposed the effect of the cap into two

parts, a short-term effect (within 2 years of adoption) and a long-term effect (3 or more

years after adoption). The long-term effect of caps on the probability of switching

primary-care physicians was larger than but not statistically distinguishable from the

short-term effect; the long-term effect of caps on the probability of switching specialist




                                                                                             17
physicians was smaller than but not statistically distinguishable from the short-term effect

(compare to estimates of equation (1) in Table 4). Neither the long- nor the short-term

effects of caps had statistically significant effects on prices (compare to estimates of

equation (2) in the leftmost two columns of Table 5). The long-term effect of caps on the

probability of EMR adoption was larger than but not statistically distinguishable from the

short-term effect (compare to estimates of equation (3) in Table 6).

       Third, we estimated probit models of equations (1) and (3) allowing for arbitrary

correlation of the error term across claims, counties, and years within a state. Based on

probit estimates of equation (1), the marginal effect of caps for the average patient on the

probability of switching primary care physicians was 3.0 percentage points (standard

error 2.0 percentage points); the effect on the probability of switching specialist

physicians was 1.2 percentage points (standard error 0.7 percentage points). Based on

probit estimates of equation (3), the marginal effect of caps for the average hospital on

the probability of EMR adoption was 11.0 percentage points (standard error 2.4

percentage points, based on a model with state and year fixed effects).



V.     Conclusion

       The current approach to medical records ownership -- which gives providers

substantial (although not absolute) control over patients' health information -- may create

incentives for two types of inefficient behavior. First, it may encourage physicians to

take advantage of imperfections in implementation and enforcement of laws mandating

patient access to records in order to strategically inflate the costs of switching to a

competing provider. Some of the costs of switching are unavoidable: it takes time to




                                                                                            18
learn about a patient's medical condition and to develop a relationship that is conducive

to optimal care. But some switching costs are endogenous and dependent on strategic

decisions. In non-medical care settings, empirical studies have documented evidence of

strategic switching costs in a variety of industries including, but not limited to, credit

cards, computer software, supermarkets, air travel, phone services and bookstores (Farrell

and Klemperer 2007).

       Second, the current approach may discourage physicians and hospitals from

adopting EMRs. Despite some evidence that the incentives provided by Health

Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 have

increased adoption, there is still widespread agreement among health policy analysts that

EMR use in the US is still lower than would be in patients' best interests (DesRoches et

al. 2013).

       Yet, few papers have sought to understand how allocation of property rights in

medical records affects markets for health services. We take advantage of variation

across states and over time in laws that cap the fees that doctors and hospitals are allowed

to charge patients for a copy of their medical records. We test whether these laws

affected patients' propensity to switch doctors and the price of a new- and existing-patient

visit. We also examine the effect of laws on hospitals' propensity to install an EMR

system. We find that patients from states adopting caps on copy fees were significantly

more likely to switch doctors, and that hospitals in states adopting caps were significantly

more likely to install an EMR. We also find that laws did not have a systematic,

significant effect on prices.




                                                                                             19
       Our analysis has at least two limitations. First, it assumes that the causes of caps'

adoption are uncorrelated with unobserved determinants of the outcomes we examine.

This assumption could be violated if, for example, states' regulatory environments

affected both caps' adoption and switching, prices, or EMR use. Because we control for

fixed differences across states in all of our models, our results are necessarily robust to

correlation of caps' adoption with time-invariant unobservables. However, our results

might be biased if policy changes are endogenous. At least in the case of medical records

privacy laws, Miller and Tucker (2009) find no evidence that changes in laws were

correlated with changes in states' political environments. Insofar as adoption of caps on

medical record copy fees and medical records privacy laws arise out of similar processes

-- concern over appropriate access to medical records -- this result suggests that

endogeneity is not likely to be important.

       Second, because we do not directly observe the quality of care or patient health

outcomes, we cannot offer any definitive conclusions about the welfare effects of caps.

However, combining the results of previous work with plausible assumptions, we

conclude that caps create benefits for consumers that exceed the burden imposed on

providers. First, because caps do not have significant or economically substantial effect

on the price of a physician visit but do increase patient switching, we conclude that they

reduce switching costs, and that the reduction makes patients better off by better

matching their preferences with their physicians' characteristics. Second, because caps

make hospitals more likely to adopt EMRs (which have been shown by Miller and

Tucker (2011) to reduce neonatal mortality), we conclude that they have a second benefit:

improving patient health outcomes.




                                                                                              20
        The effect of caps on outcomes is qualitatively important. According to Miller

and Tucker (2011), a 10 percent increase in EMR adoption would reduce neonatal

mortality rates by 16 deaths per 100,000 live births, or about 3 percent. Combining their

estimate with the estimated effect of caps on EMR adoption of 12 percent (Table 6)

implies that the average cap would reduce neonatal mortality by 19 deaths per 100,000

live births, or approximately 3.7 percent. This is approximately half of the magnitude of

the effect of state privacy laws reported by Miller and Tucker (2009).

        Our findings also have broader implications for policies governing the ownership

of medical information. As Hall and Schulman (2010) point out, property rights in

medical records are poorly defined. On one hand, the underlying medical information is

not property, and must be provided to patients on demand under federal law. On the

other hand, the party that compiles and holds a medical record owns the embodiment or

expression of the information in that particular form. Caps on copy fees effectively

sharpen the boundaries of ownership of medical records and strengthen patients' rights to

it. Our findings suggest that similar policies might also create benefits for consumers that

exceed their costs. Hall and Schulman (2010) propose a range of changes to law that

would make it easier for patients to authorize use of their medical information for profit,

and transfer that right, while still protecting their privacy.

        Despite this, it may be necessary from a political economy perspective to allow

providers to retain some de facto ownership rights. For example, some states have

restricted the extent to which information gathered as part of a private, voluntary medical

error reporting system can be used in medical malpractice cases (Kessler 2011). Such

restrictions involve a tradeoff between gains from enhanced incentives for quality




                                                                                          21
improvement and losses from limiting injured plaintiffs' access to information; imposing

similar restrictions on the use of EMRs would involve the same sort of judgment.

Alternatively, physically locating the information with the patient herself (e.g., on an

encrypted USB drive) rather than with a third-party purchaser could limit or slow down

the process by which EMRs would be used to reduce provider bargaining power.

Investigation of the plausibility and potential consequences of these options is an

important topic for future research.
