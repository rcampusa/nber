                  Changes in American and British Stature
                     Since the Mid—Eighteenth Century:

             Nutrition, Labor Productivity, and Labor Welfare

                                  Abstract


       This paper is a progress report on the usefulness of data on physical

height for the analysis of long-term changes in the level of nutrition and

health on economic, social, and demographic behavior. It is based on a set

of samples covering the U.S. and several other nations over the years from

1750 to the present. The preliminary results indicate that native-born

Americans reached modern levels of height and nutrition by the time of the

American Revolution, but there were long periods of declining nutrition and

height during the 19th century.    Similar cycling has been established for

England. A variety of factors, including crop mix, urbanization, occupation,

intensity of labor, and immigration affected the level of height and nutrition,

although the relative importance of these factors has changed over time. There

is evidence that nutrition affected labor productivity. In one of the samples

individuals who were one standard deviation above the mean
                                                             height (holding weight
per inch of height constant) were about 8% more productive than individuals

one standard deviation below the mean height. Another finding is that death

did not choose people at random. Analysis of data for Trinidad indicates that

the annual death rate for the shortest quintile of males was more than twice as

great as for the tallest quintile of males.

                         Since the Mid-Eighteenth Century:
                     A Preliminary Report on the Usefulness of
               Data on Height for the Analysis of Secular Trends in
                Nutrition, Labor Productivity, and Labor Welfare

                          1. Nutrition and   Human Capital
       It is now well established that investment in human capital, especially

 through education, has made an important contribution to the   increase of   labor

 productivity and per capita income during the twentieth century (Schultz,

 Abrainovjtz, Denison, Becker, Griliches, Jorgenson and Griliches, Kuznets, Nelson

 and Phelps, Fishlow, Hanson). Although not as fully researched, several

 economists as early asIrving   Fisher have also   called attention to

 improved nutrition, public sanitation, and improved health as significant forms

of investment in human capital (Weisbrod, Mushkin, Kuznets, Fuchs, Perlman,

Barlow, Grossman, Meeker 1972 and 1974, Higgs, Fogel and Engerman 1974, Cain).

Nevertheless, until quite recently, the general tendency of economists was to

treat improvements in nutrition and health more as background influences than as

main factors in the explanation of the long-term growth of per capita income in

the U.S. and in other industrialized nations.

       Several recent developments have called new attention to the possibility

that improvements in nutrition and health may have been far more central to the

process of economic growth than is usually presumed--not only for   the eighteenth
and   nineteenth centuries, but for the twentieth century as well. One is the

debate over the explanation of the decline in mortality since 1800 in Great

Britain, the United States, and other industrialized nations (Blaug; Coale and

Hoover, Easterlin 1977, Eversley, Flinn, Habakkuk, Higgs, McKeown and Brown,

McKeown 1976 and 1978, Meeker 1972, Razell 1974 and 1977, Schofield, van Bathe,

van de Walle, Wrigley). Another is the emergence of development economics,

which has also turned attention to the economics of nutrition and health. It

was rapidly recognized that improvements in nutrition and health were central to

the alleviation of poverty in underdeveloped nations. This finding stimulated the

growth of a subfield in the economics ol food and nutrition (see the review

articles by Taylor and Johnston), which is concerned with such issues as the

impact of systems of food production and distribution on food consumption

within families; the links between malnutrition and income distribution; the

effect of malnutrition on the supply of labor; the effect of food subsidies,

not only on demand and supply in the market for food, but also on demand and

supply in non-food markets; and optimal governmental strategies for improving

nutrition and health.

     A third development is the emergence of a new emphasis on the effect of

improved nutrition on labor productivity. This line of analysis has been

stimulated by a series of advances in the fields of nutrition, development

economics, labor economics, and economic history. During the post-World War II

period, nutritionists developed estimates of caloric and nutrient requirements

for various occupations and labor tasks (FAO 1957 and 1962, Durnin and Passmore,

Davidson eta). Investigations of the effect of malnutrition, and of its

elimination, on labor productivity have been performed both in laboratory studies

of human   subjects   (Keys et) and in observational studies of laborers in actual

work situations (Wyndham et a!, Kraut, Lehmann et al, Lowenstein, FAO 1962,

Belvady, Areskog et jJ. These reveal that malnutrition results in a reduction

in the number of days at work as well as in substantial declines (as much as

50 percent) in work capacity while at work. Such findings have led economists

to explore the theoretical implications of including consumption as an argtunent

of firm and aggregate production functions (Leibenstein, Correa and Cummins,

Mirrlees, Stiglitz, Bliss and Stern). The paper by Bliss and Stern, the most

comprehensive examination of the question to date, includes a section on the

possibility of econometric measurement of the contribution of nutrition to

production. One of the major obstacles, as they point out, is the difficulty
                                           -3—


of obtaining an adequate index of the level of nutrition.

                    2. Objectives, Procedures, and Sources of Data

      This paper is a progress report on a collaborative project aimed at

investigating the usefulness of data on physical height for the analysis of

long-term changes in the level of nutrition and health on economic, social

and demographic behavior. The project, which was initiated in 1978, is now

in   mid-course. The findings reported here cover research completed through
the end of 1981. Section 2 of the paper summarizes the principal research
objectives, the principal samples on which the project is based and the
procedures employed in the analysis of the data contained in these samples.
Section     3 presents the principal findings through 1981. Section 4 discusses

some possible implications of these findings for the understanding of long-term

changes in economic and demographic behavior. Appendix A summarizes previous

research by anthropologists, physiologist, biologists, nutritionists, and

others on the relationship between human growth and socioeconomic conditions.

Appendix B deals with various tests of the samples listed in Table 1 and with

the procedures that have been employed for the detection and correction of

biases   that   might distort our estimates     of   secular trends in heights.

2.1 Detailed      Objectives
       In   pursuit of the general goal of this project, the following detailed

objectives have been     formulated: (1)   to   establish and compare secular trends
in   the level of nutrition in the United States, and in the main nations from

which the U.S. population was drawn, over the period from the mid-eighteenth

century to the present; (2) to measure secular changes in the differences in

nutritional levels between various socioeconomic classes; (3) to assess the

validity of various real wage indexes now employed as measures of the improve-
                                            -4-
 ment in the economic welfare of laboring classes; (4) to assess the impact of improved

 nutrition on labor productivity; and      (5)    to assess the impact of nutrition on

 demographic rates.

 2.2    Procedures
       This project relies on measures of        height as the principal. index of the level of

 nutrition. Both laboratory experiments on animal populations and observational studies

 of human populations have led physiologists and nutritionists to the conclusion that

 anthropometric measurements are reliable indexes of the extent of malnutrition among

 the socioeconomic classes of particular populations.1 Measures of height and weight

at given ages, the age at which growth       of   stature terminates,   attained final heights,
and especially the rate of change in height or weight during the growing ages
"reflect accurately the state of a nation's public health and the average nutritional
status of its citizens" (Eveleth and Tanner). Consequently, these measures are now
widely used by the World Health Organization and other agencies to assess the

nutritional status of the populations of underdeveloped nations.

       Use of anthropometric measures as measures of nutrition rest on a well-defined

pattern of human     growth   between childhood and maturity. The average annual increase

in height (velocity) is greatest during infancy, falls sharply up to age 3, and then

more slowly through the remaining pre-adolescent years. During adolescence velocity

rises sharply to a peak which is approximately one-half of the velocity during infancy,

then falls sharply and reaches zero at maturity. In girls the adolescent growth sput

begins about two years earlier, and the magnitude of the spurt is slightly smaller

than in boys. Girls and boys are about the same height prior to the spurt and the

difference in adult size between men and women is largely due to differences in the

adolescent spurt.

       This growth pattern reflects the interaction of genetic, environmental,




      1See Appendix A which summarizes the findings of the principal studies. For
more extensive descriptions see Tanner 1978 and 1981. The relationship between height,
per capita income, and the distribution of income is analysed by Steckel (1982) for a

                          evidence on the relationship between
nutrition, and health.                                         anthropometrjc measures,
                                   -5-

  and socioeconomic factors during the period of growth.   According to Eveleth and
  Tanner:

        Such interaction may be complex. The genotypes which produce the same
    adult heights under optimal environmental circumstances may produce
    different heights under circumstances of privation. Thus two children who
    would be the same height in a well-off community may not only be smaller
    under poor economic conditions, but one may be significantly smaller than
    the other. . . . If a particular environmental stimulus is lacking at a time
    when it is essential for the child (times known as 'sensitive periods'),
    then the child's development may be shunted, as it were, from one line to
    another.

    The relative importance of environmental and genetic factors in explaining

 individual variations in height is still a matter of some debate. For most well-

 fed contemporary populations, however, systematic genetic influences appear to

 have very little impact on the mean heights. For example, the mean heights of

 well-fed West Europeans, North American whites and North American blacks are nearly

 idential. There are, of course, some ethnic groups in which mean final heights of

 well-fed persons today differ significantly from the West European or North American

 standard. tn these cases the deviation from the European standard appers to be due

to genetic factors. But such ethnic groups have represented a miniscule proportion

of the U.S. and European populations. Consequently, they are irrelevant to an

explanation of the observed secular trends in mean final heights in the U.S. and in

the Various European nations since 1750; nor can they account for the differences at

various points of time between the means in the final heights of the U.S. population

and the principal populations from which it was drawn.2 In this connection, it

should be noted that today the mean final heights of well-fed males in the main

African nations from which the U.S. black population is derived also fall within

the narrow band designated as the West European standard (Eveleth and Tanner;

Appendix A).


      2The belief that heterosis (hybrid vigor) would make Americans substantially
taller than the ethnic groups from which they were drawn has not been sustained by
previous anthropometric research. See Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer for a theoretical
argument as to why the effect of heterosis in human populations is small. ()ir
investigations have failed to yield consistent signs on dummy variables for either
males or females born of mixed unions. The magnitude of the positive coefficients
for adults, not all of which are
                                 statistically significant, fall in the range of 0.17
to 0.66 inches. The average of all the coefficients so far estimated for adults
(N = 9) is 0.19 inches.
                                            -6-


        Physiologists, anthropologists, and nutritionists have charted the effect

 of nutritional deficiencies on the human growth profile. Short periods of

 malnutrition or prolonged periods of moderate malnutrition merely delay the

 adolescent growth spurt. Severe, prolonged malnutrition may completely erode

   typical growth-spurt pattern and. cause substantial permanent stunting. If
 the

malnutrition is prolonged and moderate, growth will continue beyond the age at
which the growth of well-fed adolescents ceases. Hence, the average age at

which the growth spurt peaks, the average age at which growth terminates, the

mean height    during adolescent ages, and    the mean final height are all important

indicators    of   mean   nutritional status. Any one   of   them can   be   used to trace
secular   trends in nutrition. The more of these measures that are available,

the more precise the determination of the severity and duration of periods of

malnutrition.

       Time series on height may be more reliable indicators of long-term changes

in the welfare of the laboring classes than are the currently available indexes

of real, wages. Critics of the real wage indexes that have been computed for

the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, in both the U.S. and Great Britain,

have noted the problems that beset the existing time series of nominal wages

as well as the price deflators. The nominal, wages for particular localities

and particular occupations often remain relatively fixed over many years, some-

times even during periods of sharp fluctuations in the level of prices, so that

the trend in real wages depends heavily on the choice of price indexes. Price

deflators are generally lacking in information on the cost of shelter, which

in   the more rapidly growing cities, may have accounted for more than            a quarter
of   the income of laborers. Efforts to turn wage indexes of particular
occupations   and particular     localities into general regional or national wage
indexes   have produced nominal wage indexes whose movements are dominated for

long periods of time by       changes in a few occupations or localities and        by
                                        —7—


 discontinuities in underlying series. Von Tunzelmann's recent examination of

 the real wage series for England revealed that different reasonable ways of

 combining the individual, series of nominal wage rates and the choice of different

 price deflators could imply either a rise of 250 percent in the national average

 of real wages between 1750 and 1850 or no rise at all. Data on height by

 occupation are more complete in their geographic scope than the wage data,

 especially for the lower-wage occupations, and do not need to be deflated by

 price indexes.

       In addition to these problems of constructing an accurate and representative

 index of real wages, the usefulness of the series currently available is limited

by a failure to distinguish between the experiences of different socioeconomic

or geographically defined subpopulations. The height-by-age data have the

significant advantage of allowing one to isolate a particular class of the

population and observe how the movement of its nutritional experience (which

was perhaps the major component of the standard of living for the economy during

the early stages of development) diverged from that of other classes. Although

an accurate   real wage series would certainly reflect aspects of material welfare
not   invovied with nutrition, it should also be recognized that height captures

the effects of conditions, such as the level and intensity of work, not typically

encompassed by real wage data. Even when real wage indexes of high quality are

available, height-by-age data constitute a valuable additional source of

information on a population's standard of living, and their attractiveness is

further enhanced for the U.S. during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries

by the poor quality of   the existing alternative indicators.


     3Suppose, for example, that real-wage and nutritional indexes, cleaned
of measurement error, diverged. Such divergence would point to aspects of the
standard of living not adequately captured by a real wage index, such as changes
in the number of days worked, in the intensity of labor, or in environmental
conditions not speedily reflected in prices.
                                     —8-


     Several alternative approaches are being pursued for the investigation of

the effect of nutrition on labor productivity and labor supply. One is to

relate the number of days of illness to final height. Published data on

morbidity rates by city size and other characteristics are available for the

last several decades of the nineteenth century. These can be related to the

data on height through regression analysis, with cities or counties as the units

of observation. We have also identified several bodies of data (see item 9 of

Table 1) that permit micro-level analysis of the relationship between height

and productivity using wage rates as the measure of productivity. These sources

provide information not only on the height, age, sex, and wage rates of each

individual, but also report education, occupation, and family wealth. A third

approach involves the use of mean height as a variable in production functions

estimated for both agriculture and manufacturing, with counties as the units

of observation. A closely related approach involves the computation of indexes

of total factor productivity for both agriculture and manufacturing industries;

height will then be used as a variable in explaining the variations in these

indexes for specific industries across counties. The last two procedures will

be attempted first for production in 1860, making use of the height data derived

from the Civil War samples and of input and output data for large samples of

farms and manufacturing firms collected by previous investigators and already

on computer tapes.4



      4Although income affects height and. height affects productivity, and
productivity affects income, the relationship is not necessarily simultaneous.
Final height will generally be determined not by the present income of the
individual whose height enters into the analysis of productivity, but by the incomes
of the parents of that individual during his growing years and the incomes of his
great-grand-parents during his parents' growing years. The intergenerational effect
will be stronger, the more rapidly incomes are changing over time and the more
tight the control for occupations,social class, etc.

  2.3    The Principal New Samples

         As shown by Table 1, the project is based on a set of thirteen samples of

  data containing information on height-by-age and various socioeconomic variables,

  and which cover the period from 1750 through 1937 for the United States, Trinidad,

 Great Britain, and Sweden. Cooperative arrangements will be undertaken to obtain

 comparable data for other nations from which the U.S. population was drawn,

 including Germany and France. The data in these samples will be linked with data

 available in both manuscript and published sources. Such linking will increase

 the range of variables that can be brought into the analysis and the complexity of

 the interrelationships between height, nutrition, and economic and social behavior

 that we seek to investigate.



        Table 1 also shows the, progress of the work toward the retrieval of the

data and its transcription into machine-readable form.       The number of observa-

tions currently in such form exceeds or is close to the original targets for

samples 1, 2, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 13.     Retrieval   is in midstream for samples

5 and 12 and is at an early stage or
                                        yet to begin for samples 3, 4, 8, and 9.
        When the total number of observations in a given source was sufficiently

small, all of the surviving data were collected. For larger bodies of data,

samples were drawn by random techniques. For example, in the case of the

sample   designated as "Union army, whites (item 1   of Table 1), a cluster sampling

procedure   was employed. A number was first assigned to each of the approximately
25,000 white companies in the Union army. A random number generator was used

to draw about 1,000 companies from the total. The records of about 75 percent

of the selected companies have been found; the remainder were destroyed by

accident or lost before reaching the National Archives.      Similar procedures have

 been, or are being, worked out for the samples designated as "Union army, blacks,"

 "Union army rejects," 'regular U.S. army," and "British military               recruitment   records"

 (items 2, 4, 5, and 12 of Table l). In the cases of the "colonial muster rolls,"

 and "Trinidad" (items          7 and   10 of Table 1) all surviving records with information

 on   height and   age   have   been included. The problem in the case of the colonial

 samples has been     to ensure that the search for surviving          records has   been exhaustive.
 In the case of the "coastwise manifests" (item 6 of Table 1), all the surviving

 records for Savannah were included and a judgment sample (of about 16,000

 observations)     was chosen from the Mobile and New Orleans record sets.

 We will not be able to         determine   our sampling procedure for the "Confederate army"

 sample (item 3,     of   Table 1)      '.mtil we colete the survey of southern archives and

 determine the volume and condition of           surviving records.
         The use of these samples to infer secular trends in

                                            particular subgroups of the U.S. and other

populations presents a number of statistical problems, some of which are novel.

Much effort during the past four years has been devoted to the assessment of the

selection biases inherent in the data sources and to the development of robust

procedures capable, not only of detecting them, but also of making the appropriate

adjustments. Tests of the procedures so far
                                                         developed   indicate that they are quite
effective. The      nature   of the biases, the procedures that have been devised with
them, and results     of tests are       discussed in Appendix B and in the sources cited
there.




      30f the 10,000 observations on tape
                                          in item 2, about 2,000 are from a
random sample and 8,000 are from a judgment sample. We expect to expand the
random sample to 5,000 observations, although for many issues the character-
istics of the random and judgment
                                   samples are sufficiently close to yield
similar conclusions.

                             3. Preliminary Findings


      Although the major portion of the work over the past three years has been

 devoted to solving problems of data retrieval, data management, and the development

 of appropriate statistical procedures, preliminary analyses of the data have already

 yielded striking findings regarding secular trends in heights, in nutrition and

health, and in the welfare implications of these trends. The secular pattern of

native-born U.S. whites prior to 1910 appears to be substantially different from

that of most European populations. Similarly, the experience of U.S. blacks

diverged from that of blacks born in the Caribbean or in Africa.

3.1 The Early Achievement of Modern Stature
     and Improved Nutrition in the U.S.

     By the time of the American Revolution, native-born whites appear to have

achieved nearly modern final heights. The analysis of a sample of recruits from

the Revolutionary army(1775-l783) indicates that the final height of native-born

white males age 25-35 averaged 68.2 inches. This figure is not only 1 to 4 inches

greater than the final height of European males reported for several nations

during the late seventeenthand early eighteenth centuries, but is virtually

identical with final heights in the Union army during the Civil War and in the

U.S. army during World War II (see Table 2).6 Extending the analysis to a sample

of recruits during the French and Indian War (1756-1763) indicates that final

heights were increasing during the middle of the eighteenth century. After




     he evidence on adult heights in Eurone during the eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries have not generally been analyzed for secular trends and in
some cases have not yet been adequately analysed for truncation bias. The
principal studies of European heights during this period are cited in Appendix A.
Only the series for Norway (Kiil) and the sample of Swedish heights recently retrieved
and analysed by Sandberg and Steckel provide continuous series that reach back to
the first half of the eighteenth century.

Karpinos. The Revolutionary, Gould, and Baxter samples are based on
inductees. The World War II sample includes rejectees. Maximum mean
height in the World War II sample falls in the 20-24 age category. The
data in Baxter's stiary do not permit the calculation of the standard
error of the mean. Data presented by Karpinos indicate that inductees
were about 0.09 inches taller than examinees. Data presented by Baxter
indicate that inductees were 0.03 inches taller than examinees.   None
of these averages are corrected for truncation bias, but the preliminary
analyses indicate that such corrections would not reduce the figures
shown by more than 0.2 inches.

  controlling    for place of birth, place of residence, and occupation, cohorts born

  between 1740 and 1765 were 0.4 inches taller (t =         2.4) than those born between
  1715 and 1739. Since cohorts born before 1740 still attained final heights that

  averaged above 67.5 inches, it appears likely that improvements in nutrition began

 early and were quite rapid in America.

         This inference   is supported   by data on food consumption     in Massachusetts
 discovered by    McMahon. Wills deposited in Middlesex county between 1654 and 1830

 indicate a sharp rise in the average amount          of meat   allotted to widows annually

 for their consumption. Between c.l675 and c.1750 the average allotment increased

 from about 80 to about 165 pounds per annum. Over the next 75 years allotments

 rose more gradually, reaching 200 pounds at the end of the firstquarter of the

 nineteenth century. Both the evidence on stature and on food allotments suggest

 that Americans achieved an average level of meat consumption by the middle of the

 eighteenth century that was not achieved in Europe until well into the twentieth

 century (cf. U.S.D.A.).




3.2 Cycles in Height

        The estimated mean   final   heights of males for the three wars reported in

Table 2 do not necessarily imply a perfectly flat secular trend between c.l778

and c.l943. Contrary to the popular impression that there have been continuous

secular improvements in nutrition and increases in height, the evidence thus

far analysed in this project indicates that there may actually have been cycles

in height of both native-born whites and blacks residing (but not necessarily

born) in the United States.

       Analysis of information contained in the coastwise manifests indicates         that
the    final heights of slaves born in the early l790s was about a half inch less

than those   born in the late 1770s (see Figure       1). The    final heights of cohorts
born   after 1790 increased for about 20 years, so that cohorts born after 1815

were slightly taller than cohorts born during the late l770s and l780s.

 Thereafter   final heights remained fairly steady at about 67.3 inches for

 cohorts born through the early 1830s. The data in the manifests now available

 is too sparse to carry the analysis of this time-trend beyond cohorts born in

 the early 1830s. But the data on blacks taken from the Union Army muster rolls,

 which mesh quite well with the results from slave manifests for overlapping

 cohorts,   indicate that cohorts born in the late 1830s and early l840s may
have   experienced a decline in final heights that was even sharper than that
 experienced for cohorts born between 1780 and 1795.
       The time trend in the final height of northern, native-born whites is
somewhat    different   front that of U.S. slaves. The rising trend observed for

cohorts born before the Revolution levels off and appears to have remained

fairly steady for cohorts born between the Revolution and the end of the

1790s. The regular army data needed to continue the trend from 1800 to 1819

have not yet been processed, but the preliminary analysis of a subsample

(N = 773) of Union army records bearing on this period, which covers only the

last   few years of the teens, suggests that cohorts born during the first two

decades may have experienced increasing final heights. It also appears that

their upward trend leveled during the 1820s and then declined (see Figure 2).

Over a period of 15 years the decline in the final heights of native-born whites

appears to have been about one inch.




       7Analysis of trends in heights of adolescent slaves confirm the general
pattern revealed by adult heights, except that the amplitude of the cycles in
adolescent heights are even greater than in final heights (cf. Steckel 1979a).
Taken together the evidence on adolescents and adults suggests that there were
periods of deterioration in nutrition and health of slaves that substantially
retarded their rate of development during adolescence, but that this loss in
tempo was partly compensated by a longer period of growth that permitted some
"catching up."

      There is also evidence of a cycle in stature between the Civil War and

 World War II. When data in Karpinos and in U.S.D.H.E.W. (1965) are arranged

 by birth cohorts, it is possible to calculate the growth rate of mean final

 height for cohorts born between c.1906 and c.l931. Table 3shors that final

 height increased at a rate of 1.2 inches per generation between the cohorts

 born c.1906 and c.l9Zl; between the c.l92l and c.1931 cohorts, the rate was

 2.7 inches per generation. Obviously, even the 1.2 inch rate could not have

 extended back to the Civil War. That would require the final height of c.1863

 to have been about two inches below the level indicated by the Gould and

 Baxter samples. Indeed, since the final height of the c.1906 cohort is about

 a half inch below the final height shown in the Civil War data, it seems that

 sometime between c.1863 and c.1926 (1906 +   20),   final height declined.

     Preliminary analysis of the British data has been focused on the trend

in heights in London of adolescent boys from poor families over the period

from 1770 to 1870. This analysis reveals that the mean height of boys aged

14-16 from families of laboring classes was relatively steady from c.1775

to c.l790 and then declined for two decades, the lowest point coming about

1810. The extent of the decline was about 1.5 inches. From c.lSlO to

c.1838 mean heights increased quite rapidly, at a rate of 2 inches per decade

so that the maximum previous mean was exceeded by 1820. After c.1838 heights again
appear to have declined, but the new rate. of decline was only about 0.2 inches

over a period of 20 years, after standardizing for socioeconomic characteristics.

     The exact timing of the sharp rise in height following the close of the

Napoleonic wars is still under investigation. Although future work on

statistical issues might lead to an expansion or compression of the period of

rapid increases in heights, it is clear that poor adolescent boys in London

were about 4 inches taller after 1838 than their counterparts had been before

1790. Indeed, the adolescent poor of London in the late eighteenth century were

Note: Data from longitudinal studies of stature indicate that shrinkage does
not usually begin before age 50 (Tanner, privately communicated). If taller
individuals were more likely to survive to a given age, the estimated growth
rates would be biased downward, but the size of the bias would be small. If,
for example, those who died between ages 30 and 40 were one inch shorter on
average than those who survived to age 40, then (using the applicable life
table in Preston, Keyfitz, and Schoen) one would have to reduce the height
of the c.l921 cohort by 0.03 inches before computing the 1921-1931 growth rate.
This change would increase the 1921-1931 growth rate from 2.70 to 2.77 inches
per generation. Cf. sections 3.4 and 4, below.

 so short that only two of 81 ethnic groups for which modern height data are available,

 record lower adolescent heights. These are the Lumi and Bundi of New Guinea--two

 exceedingly impoverished populations. Even after the period of rapid increase,

 poor London boys were still quite short by modern British standards; at age 14,

 they were about 5 inches shorter than British boys of the same age today- -a gap that

 is due partly to the slow rate of physical maturation and partly to the low final

 height of the nineteenth-century boys.

3.3 The Influence of Economic and Social
     Factors on Height

       Multivariate regression analysis has been applied to several of the samples

of data listed in Table 1 in order to relate final heights to such economic

characteristics as occupation, migration experience, urban birth or residence,

race, and place of birth. At the present time, with a. few exceptions, the analyses

have been limited to the information about each individual contained in the

records on height. However, work i&. now underway to link information on the

individuals     in   the original data sources with information on the same

individuals     and their families in     the manuscript schedules of censuses, in probate

and tax lists,       and other records. For example, the individuals included in the
sample from the muster rolls of the Union Army are now being linked with
information on their households contained in             the   manuscript schedules of the
1850, 1860 and 1870 censuses and with the pension recordson these individuals
and their heirs, usually filed late in their life or shortly after their death.
In   this   way it   is   possible to obtain relevant information on the individuals,
not   only at the age of en1isttent, ut also during their growing years and in

their later life. Such linking also allows the analysis of the effect of inter-

generational factors (such as the ethnicity, wealth and social status of parents and

grandtarents) on the development of children and grandchildren. Where such

interrelationships cannot be established through direct linking at
                                         - 22 -


 the   household level, it is possible to use cross-sectional regression techniques,

 with counties or sinii.lar geographic divisions as the unit of observation, to anslyz
                                                                                             -




 the   nexus between height and relevant social and economic variables.

       The regressions so far performed on the muster rolls of the French and Indian

War, the Revolutionary War, the regular army during the early national period, and

the Civil War show that in all four periods (1756-1763, 1775-1783, 1815-1820, and

1861-1865), persons of foreign birth were about an inch or more shorter than those

of native birth. There was a significant shift over time in the impact of urban-
rural residence on the final heights of the native born. Beginning with final
heights virtually identical with native-born persons of urban      birth, native-born
persons      of rural birth gained an advantage of 0,8 inches by the time of the

Revolution, and this gap continued down to the time of the Civil War.8 There were

also significant shifts over time in the relationship between occupations and

stature. From only minor discrepancies in final heights between farmers and

other occupational groups during the colonial period, significant differences had
emerged by the time of the Civil War. Blue collar recruits are nearly 0.8 inches
shorter than farmers, after      adjusting for urban/rural and nativity   status.   In all

four       time periods, the cross-sectional regressions yielded statistically significant

coefficients on region of birth, race, and migratory experience.




       8                .
       Among the native born serving during the French and Inth.an War, there       is no
evidence of a statistically significant relationship between urban        birth
                                                                           or residence
and stature. In the Revolutionary sample, the results are sensitive to the age
group over which the regressions are estimated. If the regression is estimated over
recruits aged 24-35, the urban birth coefficient is not significantly (in a
statistical sense) different from zero. The urban residence (for native born) co-
efficient is -0.9 and of marginal statistical significance Ct = 1.71). If one
estimates the equation over recruits aged 24-45, the urban     birth
                                                                   coefficient is
significant at the 90% level, and the urban r9sidence coefficient remains of iiarginal
statistical. significance. The negative coefficient on a native birth in an urban area
only becomes statistically significant and robust in the 1815-20 sample, when it is
-0.5 with a t-statistic of -4.12.
                                    - 23   -




       Because ex-slaves in the Union army were geographically concentrated, the

 sample already in hand is large enough to experiment with cross-sectional

 analysis at the county level. The analysis of final heights was performed

 on a sample of 913 ex-slaves who were between ages 12 and 17 at the time of

 the 1850 census. On average, ex-slaves were about an inch shorter than native-

 born whites. Moreover, slaves from the deep-South states that specialized in

 cotton and rice were shorter than those from border states engaged in tobacco

 and general farming. These state differentials appear to be explained by the

positive correlation of height with per capita corn production,9 a negative

correlation with the median size of the slave plantation, and a negative

correlation with urbanization.

     In the case of the London boys there is much information on their socio-

economic characteristics before they entered the Marine Society10 which may

be relevant in explaining variations in heights, but analysis of this information

is retarded by the limited range of differences in the occupational categories,

by variations in the minimum height standard, and by the rapid pace of change.

Two characteristics which do appear as significant determinants of height so

far are addresses outside of London (which are associated with taller boys)

and the designation "destitute" (which is associated with shortness).




      9Since corn was mainly   a   feed crop, corn per capita may be viewed as a
proxy for meat per capita.

     10The Marine Society, the source of the height data on the London boys,
was a charitable organization which took in indigent or otherwise poor boys
and prepared them for careers in the merchant marine or the Royal Navy.

3.4 The    Influence of Height on
       Social and Economic Behavior

       One of   the bodies of data recently analysed bears on the impact of height
on the productivity of manual     laborers.     Some commanders of the Union Army
treated    runaway slaves as contraband of war, and        so,   in addition to recording
some of the usual information    found in     muster rolls, they also included
information on the value of the slaves. One         such    contraband list, discovered
in records for Mississippi, has    recently    been ana1yzed. The mean        height   of
the   523 adult males in this sample was 67.4 inches, with a standard deviation

of 2.8 inches--almost identical with the corresponding figures for Mississippi

recruits   obtained in the main sample of black companies (see line 2 of Table 1) .




    11fhese records were discovered by Armstead Robinson. The estimates of
valueappear to have been made by bona-fide slave appraisers.

    12The contraband sample is exceptional not only because of the information
on value, but also because it is a rare instance, for the early and mid-
nineteenth century, when data are available for both height and weight. The
Mississippi slaves had a mean weight of 2.3 pounds per inch of height, when
measured at mean height. Corresponding figures for samples of adults aged
30-34 are 2.2 pounds per inch for whites in theUnion Army, 2.3 pounds per
inch for white registrants in Worid War II, and 2.3 pounds per inch for
black registrants in World War II. These weight-for-height figures indicate
that Mississippi slaves were slightly heavier, for given stature, than the
whites in the Union Army, but about the same as registrants for selective
service in World War II. The Union Army figure was computed             by fitting a
linear regression to the data in Gould, pp.426-428; the World War II figures
are from Karpinos, p.32.
                                        - 25 -


      Regression analysis revealed that the value of slaves was          positively
 associated with both height and    weight.    A slave of average weight for his

 height   who was one standard deviation taller than the mean height was worth
 7.7 percent more than a slave who was one standard deviation shorter than
 the mean height. Some part   of   this increment in value may     be   due to the
 fact that tall slaves were, on average, stronger, healthier, and         capable    of
 more intense labor than short slaves. But two other factors, which could

 not be entered into the regression because of the absence of information on

 them in the contraband sample, are probably also reflected in the differential

 in value associated with stature. It is probable that healthy slaves had a

 longer life expectation than unhealthy ones. It is also possible that slaves

in the more highly skilled jobs were taller than those engaged in field work.

Thus the increase in productivity implied by the height differential in value

could have taken several forms: one is greater intensity of labor per day

at a given task and for a fixed expectation of life and labor; a second is

unchanged intensity of daily labor at a given task with an increased expecta-

tion of life and labor; a third is unchanged intensity of daily labor and

life expectation, but employment in occupations requiring greater skill than

ordinary field work.

     Analysis of the data in the Trinidad sample (see item 10 of Table 1)

bears on these possibilities. Height was a factor in the selection of

slaves for particular occupations in Trinidad. Among adult males craftsmen

were on average a half inch taller, and       drivers   (the foremen of field gangs)

were an inch taller than fieldhands, while domestics were an inch shorter

than fieldhands. Since slaves were not usually chosen for craft occupations

until their twenties, and since regression analysis revealed no relationship

between the occupation of the parents and the height of tue children, it
                                       - 26 -


appears that the final height of children was not affected by their position,
but   that owners or overseers used height as a criterion for determining
which slaves would be assigned to particular occupations.
       Perhaps   the most important result to emerge from the study of the

Trinidad data thus far is      that death did not choose slaves at random. Short
slaves   at every age during the life cycle were more likely to die than tall

slaves. After standardizing for age, the annual death rate for the shortest

quintii.e of males (47 per 1000) over a twenty month period extending from

1813 to 1815 was more than twice as great as that of the tallest quintile

of males (21 per thousand). Among females       the standarized death rates for
the   lowest and highest quintiles of height were 43 and 29 per thousand,

which suggests that female death rates were less sensitive to nutritional

circumstances than were males. One      implication   of this finding is that the

combination of the exceedingly high death rates in Trinidad and the large

impact of height on the probability of dying makes the observed height-by-age

profile rise more rapidly than would have been so in a less severe

environment   in   which a larger proportion of short slaves would have survived

to adult ages. Alternative simulations suggest that a 50 percent reduction

in the death rate with other factors held constant, might have reduced the

observed final heights of males by about.an inch.

                       4. Some Economic and Demographic Issues
                           Raised by the: Preliminary Findings

      The apparent downward shift in the.U.S.- height profile for the. native-born

whites during the last several decades of the antebellum era does not imply

that the profile of every subpopulation declined. The decline might have

been heavily concentrated within the urban population. The rate of urbanization
                                     - 27   -



 accelerated   sharply after   1820, and conditions of life in the larger cities apparently
 deteriorated. There is evidence in several northeastern cities of an upward

 trend   in the mortality rates (Yasuba).       On the other hand, the decline might

 have   been a consequence of an increased flow of immigrants; experiments on
 animals indicate that malnutrition in one generation effects the      size of

 subsequent   generations (Chandra). The patterns observed in the height-by-age
 data are consistent with evidence that the period between 1820 and      1860 was

 marked by an increase in the inequality of the income distribution, with the

 heights and wages of common laborers falling relative to those of other groups

 (Lindert and Williamson).

        The two cycles in height discovered for U.S. slaves probably have somewhat

 different explanations. Since the coastwise manifests did not distinguish

 between foreign- and native-born slaves, and given the three-inch differential

between the height of U.S. slaves of African-born slaves in Trinidad indicated

by the data, an increase from 15 to 30 percent in the proportion of the African-

born    slaves listed in the manifests could account for about    three-quarters of the
first decline in slave heights. Since the years between the end of the Revolution
and the close of the international slave trade witnessed a sharp increase in
slave   imports, such an explanation is plausible. Some part of the second

height decline (of slaves born in the late l830s and the 1840s) might be due to

ethnic mix, but it is unlikely that the share so attributed could exceed

one-quarter of the estimated decline. The Trinidad data indicate that first

generation of native-born males in non-sugar production were about 1.5 inches

taller than the African-born males, which suggests that about half the height

gap was made up in one generation. Moreover, it is probable that close to

half of the persons descended from Africans imported into the U.S. between
                                  - 28   —



 1783 and 1808 and bàii between 1835 and 1845 were not children but grand—

 children or great-grandchildren of Africans. It seems likely, therefore,

 that most of the second decline was due to a rise in the intensity of labor,

 a decline in meat consumption, a rise in morbidity (cf. Steckel 197gb), or some

 combination of these factors.

      The changing levels of nutrition and health over time implied by the

 height data have substantial implications for the study. of the U.S. mortality

 experience. The evidently high level of nutrition in America at the time of

the Revolution may well provide a partial explanation of the high fertility

rates and low mortality rates, relative to Europe, which characterized the

early U.S. demographic experience.13As the consumption of food is a major

component of the standard of living in such preindustrial societies, the

advantage in height also provides strong evidence of the superior material



      13
        Recent summaries of evidence bearing on the link between nutrition,
fecundity (reproductive capacity) and fertility (actual reproduction) are
Bongaarts (1980) and Menkin, Trussefl. and Watkins (19&L)  Both papers stress
that moderate chronic malnutrition has only "a minor effect on fecundity" and
that the effect on fertility "is very small." However, famine and severe
chronic malnutrition can substantially reduce fertility. It is not clear  how
much of the reduction associated with famine and severe chronic malnutrition
is due to a decline in fecundity (although amenorrhea and reduction in sperm
motility and longevity are involved) and how much is due to such indirect
factors as loss of libido, increased separation of spouses (because of search
for work or food) and, especially for societies during the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, because of increases in deaths which lead to a premature
ending of childbearing or to increased birth intervals (because widowhood
reduces sexual intercourse).
                                        — 29 -


conditions enjoyed by the average American during the period. However, despite
the   close correlation between changes in heights and in mortality over the

period 1730-1865 (see N.B.E.R.), a substantial portion of the pre-1850 decline

in national mortality rates appears to be explained by other factors besides

changes in nutrition. The late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries

were characterized by the narrowing of interregional   differences in mortality
rates   between New England and the South. Crude mortality rates in Massachusetts

appear to have remained in the 15 to 25 per thousand range throughout this period,

while the rates for whites in the South declined from about 50 per thousand

to about 25 per thousand (Vinovskis, Fogel etal). The higher mean final

height found for the South than for the North during this period tends to dispel

the notion that the soutriern mortality rates were linked to lower levels of

nutrition in that area. It now seems more likely that superior nutritional

circumstances may have operated to close the gap between regional death rates

 by counteracting factors that tended to increase mortality   in the South (dise
pool, climate, etc.). Fragmentary evidence suggests that southerners were heavy

consumers of meat in the late colonial and early national eras (cf. Sokoloff and

Villafior 1q72.;   L.. C. Gray).14
        Nevertheless, it is possible that some part of the height advantage of

the South was due to the "Trinidad effect." Although death rates were far less

severe in the South between 1750 and 1860 than in Trinidad c.l8l3, the higher

probability of death for shorter persons would have tended to inflate southern

       In 1901, the earliest year for which systematic surveys of food consumption
by region are available, the per capita consumption of beef and pork was about 4
percent greater in the South than in the North. The food survey is from U.S.
Bureau of Labor, pp. 647-648. The North is an

as   weights.

heights   relative to northern heights, over and above the direct nutritional effect.

Consequently there not only appears to be a direct nutritional effect but (holding

nutrition constant) a mortality effect, and an interaction effect. The magnitudes
                                                    15
of these separate effects are yet to be determined.

      We are currently preparing to study the relationship between mortality

and nutrition in the United States (or height as an index of nutrition) more

directly. Utilizing genealogical and military data from the eighteenth and

nineteenth centuries, we are beginning to link estimated mortality rates at a

county level with mean final heights for the geographic regions. We will also,

as previously indicated, introduce measures of nutritional status into production

functions for both the agricultural and manufacturing sectors. The results may

not be unambiguous, since the intensification of labor that enhanced productivity

and accompanied the growth of the manufacturing sector could have led to an increase

in the per capita energy output relative to the consumption of calories and nutrients

among adolescent laborers, and this may have produced a decline in stature.



    15
      The "Trinidad effect" might also have contributed to the decline in white
heights after the nhid-1820s shown in Figure 2, since persons from the earlier
birth cohorts who survived to be mustered into the Union army would be taller
than those from later birth cohorts, even if the mean height of each cohort at
a specified age (such as 30) was the same. Given the
                                                      prevailing mortality schedubes,
however, and the age span involved (25-45), the "Trinidad effect" could account
for only about one-tenth of the drop after the mid-1820s shown in Figure 2, and
it could not explain the preceding rise in heights.
                                          — 31 —

        It   cannot be assumed, therefore, that a decrease in the final heights

 of native-born whites after 1825 necessarily implies a reduction in per capita

 food consumption. It might seem unlikely that the stature of whites, who were

 free and experienced most of their growth by age 20, would be much influenced

 by changes in labor organization. During the nineteenth century, however,

 especially before 1850, boys commonly entered the labor force before age 16

 and the peak of their adolescent growth spurt generally was not reached until

 age 16. Consequently, a decline in height could have resulted because there was

 an increase in the per capita energy output of these young workers without a

 corresponding increase in the per capita consumption of calories and nutrients.

British invesigations of child labor in factories during the nineteenth century

tend to support this hypothesis. Children of a given socioeconomic class who

worked in factories were substantially shorter at each age than children of the

same class who were not so employed (Great Britain 1833; British Association).

        Still, it is possible that the food consumption of the urban laboring classes

did decline between 1825 and 1860. This possibility cannot be ruled out either

because of the slight downward trend in food prices or because of the upward trend

in some of the currently available indexes of real wages. Part       of   the. problem with

the wage indexes, as previously noted, is that the series on money wages may confound

urban   with   rural wage rates and is not adequately standardized for locational and

occupational mix.     Another   part of the problem is that the current measures of

consumer prices do not include data on the cost of shelter, which may have accounted

for a quarter or more of the total expenditures of urban laborers during this

period. There is considerable evidence that the rapid growth of the urban

population between 1820 and 1860 led to severe shortages in urban     housing,
                                  - 32   -

 and hence probably to a sharp rise in the price of shelter. The decline in

 the availability of wood and the shift from wood to coal as a fuel source may

 also have contributed to the rising cost of shelter. Consequently, it is

 entirely possible that an index of consumer prices that included the cost of

 shelter would show that the real wages of urban laborers declined between

 1825 and 1860. Moreover, if the income and price elasticities of the demand

 for shelter by urban laborers (at the relatively meager incomes of the time)

 were sufficiently low, sharp rises in the cost of shelter could have led to

 decreases in the amount of food consumed, particularly in the consumption of

 such relatively expensive foods as meats and fish, even in the face of constant

 or declining food prices.

       In the English case, we have been able to make a comparison between

a series on heights and a widely used series on real wages for London artisans.

Although Von Tunzelmann has demonstrated that nation-wide indexes of real wages

are unreliable because of the implicit shifts in the weights brought about by

the splicing together of diverse series, there is still the question of whether

indexes for particular localities and classes of labor are reliable. Also at

issue is the assumption that trends in the real wages of artisans mirror those

of common laborers. Tucker's series on the real wage of London artisans benefits

from the restriction of its geographic scope to one locality. When one compares

the mean height of boys aged 14-16 from families of common laborers in the

London area, over the years between 1775 and 1865, with Tucker's series, a

certain degree of conformity is evident (see Figure 3). The heights of the boys

will reflect their cumulative nutritional experience over their lifetimes, and

especially the experience of the years iimnediately preceding and during the growth

spurt. Accordingly, the height series is related to the wage series lagged five
                                                                      16
years, although longer lags (10 and 13 years) provide similar results.

     The two series generally move together during both rising and declining

phases, except for the last two decades. The results suggest that for most

of the century, the real wages of artisans and of the poorest sections of

the London working class tended to move together in London. On the other

hand, the elasticity of height with respect to Tucker's wage index is not

constant, and the preliminary regression analysis of the relationship between

the height of boys in the Marine Society and the occupations of their parents

suggests that the difference in height by occupational strata within the

laboring classes changed over time. These findings raise the possibility

of a changing relationship between the wages of conunon laborers and of artisans

even prior to 1840, and illustrates the problem of generalizing from the

experience of one group of a population (or the average) to those of other

groups.

but   the British study reported that children employed in factories were

shorter and lighter at each age than those that were not) and Quetelet suggested

that the distribution of heights at each age was described by the normal curve.

Various studies between 1829 and 1875 showed variation in the age at which growth

of stature terminated, and as-socIated this-variation with socIoeconomic

factors (Villerme'; Quetelet, Dunant,     Gould,     Champouillon, Baxter).

          The existence of the adolescent height and weight spurts was noted by

Roberts and more completely described by Bowditch in the late 1870s. Boas in

1892 and 1930, and then Davenport, Shuttleworth (1937, 1939), and Tanner (1962)

demonstrated that both in cross-sectional and longitudinal growth studies the

standard deviation of height at each age rose during the adolescent spurt,

reached a maximum     at   the peak of the spurt, and then declined. Boas (1892)

and Tanner (1959) also noticed that, although the distribution of height at

each age was approximately normal before and after the growth spurt, it was

slightly right-skewed as growth accelerated and slightly left-skewed as it

decelerated. During the past half century there have been numerous investigations

of the relationships between such measures of maturity as the height spurt,

skeletal age, age of menarche, dental age, and muscle growth (Shuttleworth;

Stoltz and Stoltz; Tanner 1962; Frisch and Revelle; Frisch 1974 and 1975; Tanner,

Whitehouse, Marubini, and Resele).

5.2. Secular Growth

          Students of human growth during the nineteenth century debated the

question of secular shifts in the height-by-age profile but did not necessarily

presume   that   these shifts were upward. There was concern both in England      and
on the continent with the possibility that stature         might have declined CBoudin;
British Association; Floud 1978). Beginning in the late l920s, and continuing

at an accelerating pace down to the end of the 1960s, various investigators
                                      - 39 -


called   attention to evidence suggesting that substantial upward shifts in the

height-by-age profile had occurred over the 50 to 100 years following the third

quarter of the nineteenth century (H. Gray; Boas 1935; Kill; Morant; Boyne and

Letich; Hathaway and Foard; Tanner 1966; Ljung, Bergsten-Brucefors and Lindgren;

Greu.lich 1976; van Wieringen; Gandevia).

          While these studies have established a world-wide pattern in industrialized

countries during the past 100 years toward earlier maturation and greater final

heights, several important questions remain open. One is whether the secular

trend in heights has been (more or less) monotonic or cyclical. Some studies

indicate that while famines, epidemics, wars, and severe business cycles have

briefly interrupted or briefly reversed the pattern of secular growth (Tanner

1962; Udjus; van Wieringen), such episodes did not fundamentally alter the

generally upward thrust of secular growth. On the other hand, Trotter and

Glesser, using measurements of white and black cadavers, found evidence suggest-

ing that the long-term pattern of change in U.S. stature might have been cyclical,

with substantial periods of no-growth or decline. Another question is

when   the secular growth trend began. Norwegian military data stretching back to
1740 indicate little change in conscript heights prior to 1830 and only about a
half-inch increase over the next 50 years (Kiil), but a sample of Swedish
military    data indicates that adult Swedish heights increased between 1720

and 1760, stabilized for about 3 decades, and then increased again after

1790 (Sandberg and Steckel). Dutch data suggest that from about 1860 to

about 1900 secular growth was experienced mainly by conscripts from lower

classes but that after 1900 conscripts from upper classes were drawn into

the process (van Wieringen).

5.3 Socioeconomic and Other Factors Influencing the Pattern of Growth

       Observational studies of human populations and laboratory experiments

with monkeys have demonstrated the impact of nutrition on the shape and position

of the height-by-age profile (see Tanner 1962, Eveleth and Tanner, Tanner 1978,
                                         - 40 -
and the sources cited in these). The height profiles of well-fed males

(females) in a given population are higher at all ages than of poorly-fed males

(females) from the saiiie populations. Moderate chronic malnutrition will delay -

the growth spurt and extend the growing period but will have only a small effect
on terminal heights. Severe chronic malnutrition leads to permanent and sub-

stantial stunting. Severe but brief episodes of malnutrition, as in wartime

famines, delay growth but are generally followed by rapid recovery and do not

affect final height. Laboratory experiments on monkeys indicate that growth is

affected by both caloric and protein deficiencies but that the effects of

protein deficiencies on growth may be more severe than caloric deficiences alone.

(Fleagle, Samonds and Hegsted; Elias and Samonds). Minor diseases have little

effect on the growth profiles of well-nourished children but may have transient

effects on the profiles of poorly-nourished children. Major diseases, as with

severe brief famines, delay growth, but recovery leads to catching-up and, with

the exception of disOrders of the growth process itself, do not cause

permanent stunting.

       Twentieth-century studies show that urban     residents have more   rapid tempos
of   growth than rural ones and     achieve greater final heights (Eveleth and Tanner;

Tanner 1978). Quetlet found the same effect among the French in the 1830s but

Roberts reported that in Great Britain in the 1870s rural boys aged 8 to 13 were

1.5 to 3.0 centimeters taller than urban boys. It        thus appears that there may
have been significant changes over time and place in the effects of particular
socioeconomic variables on the tempo of growth7


       17
            In many   more developed nations, height differences by occupation are
narrower today than in the nineteenth century, but Sweden is the only nation
so   far   in which they have disappeared   (Tanner 1981).
                                          - 41   -



       There are differences in the height profiles by' race, both in tempo and

final heights, but the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors

is still a matter of dispute (Greulich 1958, 1975; Eveleth and Tanner). Well-fed

Nigerians have growth profiles quite similar to Europeans. Well-fed U.S. whites

and   blacks have the same   final   heights but blacks exhibit a more rapid tempo of

growth, with earlier peaking of the adolescent growth      spurt   and earlier menarche

than whites. Asians from high socioeconomic classes generally have a more rapid

tempo of growth than Europeans or U.S. whites, but have lower final heights. In

recent   years the difference in final heights between Japan and Europeans or
Americans has diminished.
          Both tempo and   final heights are correlated with occupation, although

 in twentieth-century U.S. and European populations the differences in final

 heights appear to be relatively small. Tempo also appears to be affected by

 birth order and number of sibs. Other factors affecting the height profile

 include psychosocial stress (apparently operating through the rate of hormone

 secretion); and climate, which may, over evolutionary time, have affected body

 proportions, but which appears to have little effect on tempo or final heights.

 The rate of growth appears to vary over the seasons of the year.

that might distort our estimates of secular trends in height. Many of these

problems relate to the fact that the oldest and              most numerous bodies of

information were collected by military organizations. Use of military data

raises questions about. the extent to which soldiers and sailors were

representative of the underlying populations from which they were drawn.

The problem is different in volunteer armies and in conscript armies.

Volunteer armies, especially in peacetime, are selective in their admission

criteria and often have minimum height requirements. Consequently, even if

information on rejectees exists, there is the question of the extent to which

applicants are self-screened. In conscript armies virtually every male in

the eligible age, including those who offer substitutes or are otherwise

excused,    are examined and      measured.

           Our   procedures for the detection and          correction   of b±as turn on a
combination of theoretical considerations, empirical information, and
simulation    techniques. Much of the power of these techniques turns on the
fact   that the distribution of final heights is well described by a normal

distribution. The standard deviation of this distribution is rather tightly

bounded    for European, North American, and Afro-American populations. Regardless
of the ethnicity or the socioeconomic conditions of the population, the standard
deviations appear       to   fall in the range of 2.6*0.6 inches8The distribution of height

       18This is the case in large samples of complete populations. Of course
for smaller sarnples the range of the standard deviatIbn Is larger. For further
evidence, see Kemsley, Zarpinos,              and the sources cited in then.

at   each age during growing years is not normal, but is nearly so. Moreover,

the standard deviation of height foL.ws a pattern during the adolescent growth

spurt that is quite similar to the velocity profile. It rises as the growth

spurt approaches, reaches a peak at the peak of the growth spurt, and then

declines back to the level just before the onset of the spurt.


6.1. Sample-Selection Biases

         Use of military records to measure secular trends in height poses a

variety of sample—selection biases. The most important of these is the problem

of left-tail truncation which is characteristic of both the U.S. and British

armies during peacetime. Truncation and other censoring problems are

discussed in section 6.3. Here we consider two other questions: the self-

selection bias of volunteers; and whether persons rejected for reasons

other than height are nevertheless shorter than those accepted.



         There is clearly evidence of self-selection bias in volunteer armies.

Persons of foreign birth and from cities are overrepresented. Native-born

individuals living in rural areas are underrepresented. Similarly, artisans

and non-farm laborers are overrepresented while farmers and those in white

collar occupations are underrepresented. Since there are significant differences

in height among these groups, it is necessary to standardize for these

characteristics in estimating the trend in aggregate heights. Necessary weights

are available from the federal censuses and other sources. Of course, much of

the interest turns on secular trends in the heights of particular groups which,

even if underrepresented, are nevertheless present in sufficient numbers to

permit analysis.

         There is, of course, the issue of whether volunteers in

particular subgroups (e.g., blue—collar urban laborers aged 20-25) are

representative of the class from which they are drawn. Our approach to this
                                     - 44   -



 question   is to compare the characteristics of the volunteers in the peacetime

 army with individuals of the same subgroups in wartime armies subject to

conscription (World War II), or in which a very high proportion of those of

military age were examined (the Civil War),or in scientifically designed

random samples (the U.S.D.H.E.W. sample of 1960-1962). Most of our work to date has

 focused on the Civil War records of the Union army. The Civil War involved

a larger proportion of persons of military age than any       other   war in American

history. Thus about 95 percent of white males aged 18-25 in the Union States

were examined;, and about 75 percent of the examinees were inducted9 The

results of our investigation so far indicate, that with respect to height

volunteers from particular subgroups are representative of the subgroups from

which they are drawn, although we are still at an early stage of this

investigation. If subsequent research should indicate biases so far undetected,

that work will also provide the desired correction factors.

        There is still the question of whether persons actually inducted into

the army, but rejected for reasons other than height, were shorter than those

accepted. The World War II data analysed by Karpinos show that 41 percent

of all those called for examination were rejected and that rejectees were an

average of 0.22 inches shorter than those inducted. Consequently, the failure

to take account of rejectees would bias the estimated mean final height of

the overall population upward by 0.09 inches. While a bias of this magnitude

is statistically significant because of the large sample size, it is too small

to have a significant effect on most of the points at issue in this study.

The data presented by Baxter     indicate   that the bias arising from the non-

measurement of persons rejected because of disease in the Union army introduces

 an upward bias in the estimated final height of the overall population of

 0.03 inches. Although we are planning to draw a sample       of   rejectees from

 the Union army     records   (see Table 1, item 4) to further analyze their

characteristics, the expense of corresponding samples for other military

organizations does not now seem warranted.

6.2. Measurement Biases

            These are a series of issues regarding the reliability of measures

pertaining to the height-byage schedule. Some pertain to the accuracy

of the age information, some to the accuracy of the height information.

Issues regarding age include age-heaping, whether ages are reported to the

nearest birthday or the last birthday, and whether ages were arbitrarily

assigned on the basis of height. Issues regarding height include heaping

on even heights, whether heights were rounded to the nearest inch (or

fraction of an inch) rather than to the last full inch (or fraction), and

whether individuals were measured with or without shoes.

            Accuracy in age has little bearing on the determination of the secular

trend in final heights, since it is of little importance whether a.       person
classified as 30 is actually 28 or 32. Such heaping is of some importance

during the growing years. There is evidence of age heaping at ages 10 and 20,

and at the minimum age for recruitment into military organizations. While

such heaping will add perturbation to the height—velocity profile, itusually will

not affect the determination of the age at which the profile peaks. A more

serious issue arises in the case of the coastwise manifests, where it has

been suggested that ages were arbitrarily assigned on the basis of height.

If   that   were true, however, the standard deviation of height would not have

the   characteristic pattern of increasing and then decreasing as the peak of
the growth spurt is approached and passed (cf. section 5.1 above). That
                                       - 46   -




pattern   is present in the manifests (Trussell and Steckel).

     Heaping on even inches is evident even when the measurement is conducted by

qualified personnel (as in the U.S.D.H.E.W. sample of 1960-1962).   In military

organizations with minimum height requirements, there is further evidence of

heaping at the inch just above the cutoff. Simulation models inicate that even-

number heaping does not introduce systematic bias. Although it may affect the

accuracy of estimates of mean height, even with large amounts of heaping (in the

range of 15 to 30 percent) the error will be in the neighborhood of a tenth of an

inch. With respect to rounding, from the earliest date for which military records

are available, the standard order was to round to the nearest inch or fraction. A

study of actual practice in World War II revealed a slight tendency to round down-

ward, which introduced an average error of 0.2 inches (Karpinos). There is no

reason to assume that this tendency has changed over time. Our analysis of the

data in the Union army records indicates that the bias may be due mainly to a

tendency to round the heights of tall persons who should have been measured at

fractional inches downward to the nearest inch. In any case, the magnitude of this

error will not seriously distort secular trends, nor should it significantly affect

the cross-sectional analysis of the relationship between height and economic or

demographic factors.

     In the case of the coastwise manifests and the colonial muster rolls (items

6 and 7 of Table 1) the question arises as to whether individuals were measured

with or without shoes. To resolve this question, we have turned to data on recruits

into the Union army or the regular army where individuals are known to have been

measured without shoes. The Gould report contains a sample of black recruits born

in the slave states who were aged 25 and over (N=13,653). The mean height in this

sample, 67.2 inches, is virtually identical with the mean height (67.1 inches)

computed for the same category in the coastwise manifests. Similarly, recruits
                                           - 47   -



into   the regular U.S army born between 1771 and 1790 averaged 68.3 inches (=61l),

whic! exceeds the mean height in the Revolutionary sample by 0.

inches. When the collection of data from the regular army is extended back to 1790,

the test can be repeated not merely with birth cohorts adjacent to thos2 in the

Revolutionary army but with cohorts that overlap those of the Revolutionarr army.°

6.3. Methods of Estimating Mean Height
      from Truncated Distributions

       For many of our files, the possibility of obtaining useful information from

the height-by--age data depends on solving the problem of selection bias duo to

truncation or shortfall in the height distribution, particularly for iocr heights.

Various distortions of the true underlying distribution of heights in the population

contributing soldiers and sailors are to be expected in military height distributions,

including heaping on whole or even numbers of inches, oversampling in the center of

the distribution, and sometimes undersampling of high heights. While some distortions

are apparent in all our bodies of data, the problem of undersampling of small heights

is particulary acute for the regular armed forces of Britain and the United States.

These organizations set minimum height limits at different times, varying with military

needs, sometimes shifting frequently, and sometimes ranging as high as 67 inches.

Minimum height standards were flexibly enforced, so that very sharp cutoffs are not

usually apparent in the data. It appears that in some cases 30% or 40% of the small

heights in the underlying distribution may be missing. Such undersampling could

vitiate the information content of the data, unless reliable statistical procedures

are employed to correct for the problem.




     20The Baxter sample was limited to military units where men were measured with-
out shoes. Baxter (pp.14-iS) conjectured that the recruits in some of the units in
the Gould sample were measured with shoes. However, for the ages shown in Table 2
above, the Baxter and Gould samples yield mean heights that differ from each other by
less than a tenth of an inch. This finding indicates that the proportion of the men
in the Union army that may have been measured with shoes was too small to affect the
analysis.

      An important aspect of the project has been the development of statistical

estimators that perform reliably in the presence of undersampling of small heights.

These estimators must also cope with the other distortions that we suspect in the

observed distributions. The multiple distortions make our problem more complicated

than most undersampling problems treated in the statistical literature (cf., e.g.,

Cohen 1950, Harter and Moore 1966, Poirier 1978), although some ideas in the

literature may be capable of extension. Our problem occurs at two levels. The

first is the estimation of average height of an underlying distribution for men

old enough to attain their terminal heights. A gaussian distribution for terminal

heights is well-established for contemporary data and consistent with preliminary

examination of our files, and the assumption of normality for the underlying

distribution puts our problem into a well-defined parametric framework. There is

also the problem of how to estimate the mean of a distribution of height at a given

age during the ages of growth. Modern data indicate that the underlying

distributions during adolescence are at first skewed to the right, as early maturers

attain peak growth velocity, and then skewed to the left, when only late maturers

still await their growth spurts.

      Our two principal methods for correcting left-tail censoring, the quantile

bend method (QQ) and the maximum likelihood method (RSMLE) are described in

Wachter and in Nachter and Trussell. The extension of the RSMLE method to

regression analysis is reported in Trussell and Wachter. These methods have been tested

extensively both by Monte Carlo techniques and by simulation techniques on actual

distributions of heights. The tests have shown that both methods are generally

reliable.

      One of the tests, for example, was performed on a sample of the heights

of London school children for 1965. The data consist of complete (i.e. non-truncated)

distributions at each age during the growth spurt. Sample sizes varied from
                                      - 49   -




801 to 2,493;   the   absolute value of the coefficient of skewness (y1) varied

from 0.031 to -0.201. Our procedure was to use our estimators to estimate the

true mean of the distribution under conditions of increasing truncation. The

truncation was allowed to range from 0 to 80 percent of the distribution

(truncating from the lower end). The particular point at issue was whether

techniques devised to cope with truncation of normal distributions would be

reliable on distributions of height at growing ages, which are positively skewed

during the rising portion of the growth spurt and negatively skewed during the

declining portion. This effect was first discovered by Boas in 1892, but it

was documented by Tanner using London County Council data for 1955. The degree

of skewing is statistically significant but small enough so that the

distribution is treated as normal in the estimation of the centiles that demarcate

the bounds for normal adolescent development. Nevertheless, it was necessary to

determine whether even such moderate skewing would mislead our estimators in

situations in which such skewing is combined with truncation, as is the case in

the Marine Society data which were used in Figure 3.

      The estimators achieved nearly perfect results before truncation, demonstrating

that skewing was too small to require the abandonment of the normal approximation

in this case (a conclusion previously reached by Tanner, Whitehouse, and Takaishi).

The estimators generally continued to behave quite well even with truncation of

up to 50 percent of the original distribution. The RSMLE estimator performed very

well with both continuous and grouped data. Up to a

50 percent level of truncation it consistently produced estimates close to the

true mean, although there was a tendency to over-correct, i.e., to produce

estimates below the true mean. The accuracy of the RSMLE estimator decreased with

truncation above the modal value. The QQ estimator was generally correct even with

truncation above 50 percent, although in one instance it was thrown off for

reasons we are still investigating. In this instance, however, the RSMLE continued
                                           - 50 -


 to   do well.


      6.4 The "basketball" problem

      It has   been   argued that one cannot assume, merely from the fact that a

military distribution appears to be closely approximated by a. normal or truncated

(censored) normal distribution, that theniean of the distribution may be

taken as a reasonable estimate of the mean final hei.ght of males in civilian life.

The issue raised here goes beyond biases of the type already considered.

Persons rejected for reasons other than height, as we have seen, are only

slightly shorter than those accepted (less than a tenth of an inch in the

Civil War case); and the self-selection biases served to favor particular

socioeconomic subgroups rather than to distort the height distributions of

these subgroups.

      What is at issue in the "basketball" problem is the possibility that

the sampling criteria of the military organizations might produce distributions

of height which, while they are normal, have a much higher mean height than

that of the general population of adult males. In this connection, it is

argued     that one cannot use   the normality of a given distribution as evidence

of   its   representativeness. It is further suggested that if procedures such

as those that we have developed were applied to the height distribution of

players in the National Basketball Association, we would discover that this

distribution was also normal, so that careless application of our procedures

could lead to the erroneous conclusion that the mean height of American males

was 78 inches.
                                  — 51


    Clearly, one cannot use the mere normality of a military distribution

as evidence that it represents the overall adult civilian distribution--

among other reasons, because the height distribution of each of the major

socioeconomic subgroups in the population is also normal, although their
                                  21
means are significantly different. The power of the QQ plots lies in what

they tell us about height distributions that depart from normality. The

distortions in such distributions are clues which, when carefully analysed,

suggest the nature of the selection or self-selection criteria that produced

the distortions.

    The usefulness of our procedures is well-illustrated by applying them

to the distribution of heights in the National Basketball Association.

Figure 8.1 shows the QQ plot for the N.B.A. If the distribution of heights

was normal, the plot should form a straight line, with the mean of the

distribution given by the intersection of the plot with the zero ordinate.

As can be seen in Part A of Figure 8.1 ,   the   plot of the N.B.A. distribution is

quite irregular, unlike the Civil War distribution of heights in Part C.

Upon inspection, it appears that the N.B.A. distribution might actually

consist of at least two, and possibly three, straight-line segments. In

other words, the plot in Part A suggests that the N.B.A. distribution of

heights might actually be the result of a composite of three normal

distributions. Indeed, when separate distributions are computed for

guards, centers, and forwards, we obtain 3 single-peaked distributions

that appear to be censored normals, with means at 74.4, 80.2 and 83.4 inches

(see Part B of Figure B.l). Thus it appears that the managers of teams



     21
         Theoretically, if the heights of each of the subgroups of a population
are normally distributed, but have different means, the overall population
cannot be normally distributed and have the same standard deviation as the
sub-populations. Nevertheless, the normal distribution gives a good fit to
the overall distribution in such data sets as the Union army, as well as to
each of the major subgroups, and the standard deviations are generally quite
similar.

in   the N.B.A. have target heights for each position. Target heights will yield

normal distributions even if the underlying population from which the sample is

being drawn is highly skewed (as is the extreme right-hand tail of the distribu-

tion of adult heights).

      It follows that when working with military data one should take into account

the sampling strategy of particular military units. In the case of the U.S.

army, official orders that established the standard for recruiting in different

units have been published. In the British case, the standards are described in

unpublished orders. The most common procedure was to have a minimum height

requirement, which shifted up or down, depending on the demand for, and supply

of, recruits. Some units, such as the cavalry and the navy, had both minimum

and maximu requirements. Only a few parade companies had target heights.
