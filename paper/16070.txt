This paper presents the first causal evidence on the effects of school accountability systems on teacher
labor markets. We exploit a 2002 change in Florida's school accountability system that exogenously
shocked some schools to higher accountability grades and others to lower accountability grades, and
measure whether teachers in shocked schools are more or less likely to move. Using microdata from
the universe of Florida public school teachers, we find strong evidence that accountability shocks influence
the teacher labor market; specifically, teachers are more likely to leave schools that have been downward
shocked -- especially to the bottom grade -- and they are less likely to leave schools that have been
upward shocked. We also find that accountability shocks influence the distribution of the measured
quality of teachers (in terms of value added measures) who stay and leave their school, though the
average differences are not large.

I.     Introduction

       School accountability -- the process of evaluating schools on the basis of the performance

of their students and holding them responsible for this performance -- is becoming increasingly

prevalent around the world. Accountability systems are intended to solve the principal-agent

problem in education, and the incentives that they provide to educators to improve student

efficiency take several forms. These systems provide direct incentives, in the form of explicit

rewards or sanctions associated with good or poor performance. In addition, many of the

mechanisms for improvement involve social pressure, since a school’s constituents have both

educational and financial reasons to influence low-performing schools to improve. The financial

reasons derive from the fact that school accountability ratings tend to be capitalized into housing

values (Figlio and Lucas, 2004). In addition, school accountability affects a school's ability to

raise voluntary contributions (Figlio and Kenny, 2009). This paper makes use of detailed data at

the individual teacher level to gauge the degree to which teachers respond to these direct and

indirect forms of accountability pressure by leaving the high-pressure school.

       There is certainly reason to believe that educators respond to accountability pressure in

the ways in which they carry out their jobs. Early evidence concerning the effects of these

accountability systems on student performance indicates they tend to improve the outcomes of

low-performing students (see, e.g., Chakrabarti, 2006; Chiang, 2009; Figlio and Rouse, 2006;

Jacob, 2005; Rouse et al., 2007; West and Peterson, 2006).1 However, Krieg (2008), Neal and

Schanzenbach (2008) and Reback (2008) argue that the benefits of accountability pressures are

concentrated in the more marginal students rather than the students whose performance would be

1
  Recent nationwide studies by Carnoy and Loeb (2002) and Hanushek and Raymond (2005) also
find significant improvement in student outcomes as a result of standards-based accountability,
whereas the results from some specific state systems have been less positive (see, e.g, Koretz and
Barron, 1998; Clark, 2003; and Haney, 2000, 2002).
                                                                                                3


far above or far below the performance thresholds set for the purposes of school accountability.

That said, the weight of the evidence suggests that accountability systems have led schools to

become more productive, at least along some measurable dimensions. Rouse et al. (2007)

document a number of the ways in which accountability pressure has changed school

instructional policies and practices in Florida’s low-performing schools, and relate these

instructional policy and practice changes to increased student performance.

          In addition to actively changing policies and practices to improve student outcomes,

schools have also responded to accountability pressures by engaging in apparently strategic

behavior with questionable educational benefit. For instance, some schools have responded by

differentially reclassifying low-achieving students as learning disabled so that their scores will

not count against the school in accountability systems (see, e.g., Cullen and Reback, 2007; Figlio

and Getzler, 2007; Jacob, 2005).2 Figlio and Winicki (2005) suggest that Virginia schools facing

accountability pressures altered their school nutrition programs on testing days to increase the

likelihood that students will do well on the exams, and Figlio (2006) indicates that schools

differentially suspend students at different points in the testing cycle in an apparent attempt to

alter the composition of the testing pool. Jacob and Levitt (2003) find that teachers are more

likely to cheat when faced with more accountability pressure. And the distributional effects

documented by Neal and Schanzenbach (2008) and others are also evidence of strategic behavior

on the part of schools.       In sum, school accountability systems cause schools to behave

differently, and school personnel almost certainly are very responsive to increased accountability

pressure.




2
    Chakrabarti (2006), however, does not find that schools respond in this way.
                                                                                                 4


       Of course, the individuals implementing the changes in instructional policies and

practices are teachers, and school accountability therefore has the potential to influence the

desirability of certain teaching jobs. Likewise, accountability may influence the willingness of

schools to retain certain teachers.   From a theoretical perspective, the effects of accountability

pressures on the teacher labor market are ambiguous. On the demand side, in order to avoid

sanctions and/or the stigma associated with being designated as a “failing” school, schools could

increase their efforts to identify low performing teachers and remove them from their

classrooms. In this case, it is difficult to call these personnel changes a “job choice,” at least

from the perspective of the teacher. On the supply side, accountability pressure and associated

changes in school policies could lower the net benefit of teaching in a school by reducing teacher

discretion over curriculum or teaching methods. Likewise, the potential stigma from teaching in

a “failing” school could lead some teachers to seek employment at other schools. On the other

hand, the resources that often accompany sanctions (e.g. reading coaches, training for teachers,

etc.) could reduce the non-monetary costs associated with working in low-performing schools

and actually increase teacher retention.

       Similar patterns could be possible in the case of schools receiving high accountability

marks. Schools that perform well under accountability systems face the pressure to maintain

their high scores or to improve upon them. In Florida, for instance, schools receive extra bonus

money for maintaining a top accountability score or for improving from one year to the next.

Given that the housing market capitalization effects of school accountability are strongest in

more affluent school areas (Figlio and Lucas, 2004), coupled with the fact that measurement

error in test scores introduces a significant degree of randomness into the school accountability

ratings (Kane and Staiger, 2004), it is reasonable to believe that relatively high-performing
                                                                                                 5


schools may face as much or more real accountability pressure as do low-performing schools.

Goldhaber and Hannaway (2004), in a case study of schools in Florida, find that teacher and

administrator anxiety levels due to school accountability were highest in the high-performing

schools, where school personnel felt the most pressure to maintain their accountability marks.

Hence, while teaching in a highly-rated school has its advantages, the extra accountability

pressure may deter teachers as well. And, just as with the low-rated schools, highly-rated schools

may engage in more teacher selection as a consequence of accountability.           Therefore, the

theoretical expectations of how accountability pressures influence teacher job choice/placement

are ambiguous for both highly-rated and low-rated schools.

       A number of recent papers have analyzed the determinants of teacher mobility and

attrition (Boyd et al., 2005a, 2006, 2007; Clotfelter et al., forthcoming; Feng, 2009; Hanushek et

al., 2004; Imazeki, 2004; Krieg, 2006; Podgursky et al., 2004; Scafidi et al. 2007). However, the

literature relating accountability pressures to teachers’ labor market decisions has been much

spottier. Boyd et al. (2005) explore the responses of teachers to the introduction of mandated

state testing in New York State. They find that teacher turnover in fourth grade, the critical

accountability year in New York, decreased following the introduction of testing, and that

entrants into fourth grade were more likely to be experienced than had previously been the case.

Clotfelter et al. (2004) evaluate how North Carolina’s accountability system has influenced the

ability of schools serving low-performing students to attract and retain high-quality teachers.

They find that the introduction of the accountability system has exacerbated teacher turnover in

these schools, though it is less evident that accountability has led to lower qualifications of the

teachers serving low-performing students.        Both of these papers carefully describe the
                                                                                                       6


accountability systems in their states, but because they evaluate accountability systems that

affected all schools within a state, it is difficult to derive causal inference from their analyses.

        In this paper, we exploit a major rule change in Florida’s school accountability system

that took place in the summer of 2002 to identify the effects of changing school accountability

pressures on teacher job changes. Florida had graded every school in the state on a scale from

“A” to “F” since the summer of 1999, based on proficiency rates in reading, writing and

mathematics. In 2002, the state dramatically changed its grading system to both recalibrate the

acceptable student proficiency levels for the purposes of school accountability and to introduce

student-level changes as an important determinant of school grades. Using student-level micro-

data to calculate the school grades that would have occurred absent this change, we demonstrate

that over half of all schools in the state experienced an accountability “shock” due to this grading

change, with some schools receiving a higher grade than they would have otherwise received and

other schools receiving a lower grade than would have otherwise occurred. Furthermore, some

schools were shocked downward to receive a grade of “F”, which no school in the state had

received in the prior year of grading. These grading shocks provide the vehicle for identification

of accountability effects in this paper.

        We apply these accountability shocks to data on the universe of public school teachers in

Florida. We measure the effects of accountability pressures on teachers’ decisions to stay at a

given school, move to another school in the same district, move to another school district in the

state or leave public school teaching. Since Florida has had statewide achievement testing in all

grades 3-10 since 1999/2000 we are also able to compute “value-added” measures of teacher

quality and determine whether teacher mobility engendered by accountability pressures tends to

increase or decrease teacher quality.       We find strong evidence that accountability shocks
                                                                                                    7


influence the teacher labor market; specifically, teachers are more likely to leave schools that

have been downward shocked -- especially to the bottom grade -- and they are less likely to leave

schools that have been upward shocked. We also find that accountability shocks influence the

distribution of the measured quality of teachers (in terms of value added measures) who stay and

leave their school, though the average differences are not large.    The results, therefore, suggest

that school accountability can have quite consequential effects for professional educators.



II.    The Florida School Accountability Program

       Education reform, and specifically a system of school accountability with a series of

rewards and sanctions for high-performing and low-performing schools, was the policy

centerpiece of Jeb Bush’s 1998 gubernatorial campaign in Florida; the resulting A+ Plan for

Education was Bush’s first legislative initiative upon entering office in 1999. The A+ Plan

called for annual curriculum-based testing of all students in grades three through ten, and annual

grading of all traditional public and charter schools based on aggregate test performance. As

noted above, the Florida accountability system assigns letter grades (“A,” “B,” etc.) to each

school based on students’ achievement (measured in several ways).            High-performing and

improving schools receive rewards while low-performing schools receive sanctions as well as

additional assistance, through Florida’s Assistance Plus program.          The most famous and

publicized provision of the A+ Plan was the institution of school vouchers, called “Opportunity

Scholarships,” for students attending (or slated to attend) chronically failing schools – those

receiving a grade of “F” in two years out of four, including the most recent year. Opportunity

Scholarships allowed students to attend a different public school, or an eligible private school.
                                                                                                   8


       School grading began in May 1999, immediately following passage into law of the A+

Plan. In each year from 1999 through 2001, a school would earn a grade of “F” if fewer than 60

percent of students scored at level 2 (out of 5) or above in reading, fewer than 60 percent of

students scored at level 2 (out of 5) or above in mathematics, and fewer than 50 percent of

students scored at level 3 (out of 6) or above on the Florida Writes! writing evaluation, known

from 2001 onward as the FCAT Writing examination. A school could avoid the “F” label by

meeting any one of these three standards in 1999; the same was true in 2000 and 2001 provided

that at least 90 percent of the test-eligible students took the examination (or that the school could

provide the state with a “reasonable explanation” for why fewer than 90 percent of students took

the test.) All schools in the distribution were subject to accountability pressure, and according to

Goldhaber and Hannaway (2004), schools throughout the distribution apparently felt pressure to

perform in measurable ways.

       Thus, between 1999 and the summer of 2001, schools were assessed primarily on the

basis of aggregate test score levels (and also some additional non-test factors, such as attendance

and suspension rates, for the higher grade levels) and only in the grades with existing statewide

curriculum-based assessments,3 rather than on progress schools make toward higher levels of

student achievement. Starting in summer 2002, however, school grades began to incorporate test

score data from all grades from three through ten, and were also the first to evaluate schools not

just on the level of student test performance but also on the year-to-year progress of individual

students. In our analysis, we take advantage of the fact that during the 2001-02 school year

teachers would not have been able to anticipate their school grade in summer 2002 because of

the changes in the formula and because the changes were not decided until the last minute.

3
  Students were tested in grade 4 in reading and writing, in grade 5 in mathematics, in grade 8 in
reading, writing and math, and in 10 in reading, writing and math.
                                                                                                 9


       By the beginning of the 2001-02 school year several things were known about the school

grades that were to be assigned in summer 2002. First, the school grades were to have been

based on the test scores of all students in grades three through ten in reading and mathematics,

and in the fourth, eighth and tenth grades in writing. Second, the standards for acceptable

performance by students were to be raised from level 2 to level 3 in reading and mathematics.

Third, some notion of a “value-added” system was to be established, though little was known

about the specific nature of this system except that it would augment the levels-based grading

system and would focus principally on the lowest-performing students. These elements would

be combined to give each school a total number of “grade” points. The school’s grade would be

determined by the number of points. However, the specifics of the formula that would put these

components together to form the school grades were not announced until March 5, 2002, leaving

teachers entering the 2001-02 school year with virtually no information with which to anticipate

their school’s exact grade.

       Table 1 shows the distribution of schools across the five performance grades for the first

six rounds of school grading, for all graded schools in Florida. As is apparent from the variation

across years in the number of schools that fall into each performance category, there are

considerable grade changes that have taken place since the accountability system was adopted.

Most notable is the fact that while 70 schools received an F grade in the first year (1998-99) only

4 did so the subsequent year and none did by the summer of 2001. At the same time, an

increasing number of schools were receiving A’s and B’s. This is partly due to the fact that

schools had learned their way around the system: A school had to fail to meet proficiency

targets in all three subjects to earn an F grade so as long as students did well enough in at least

one subject the school would escape the worst stigma. Hannaway and Goldhaber (2004) and
                                                                                                10


Chakrabarti (2006) find evidence that students in failing schools made the biggest gains in

writing which is viewed as one of the easier subjects in which to improve quickly. When the

rules of the game changed, so did the number of schools caught by surprise: For instance, 60

schools earned an "F" grade in the summer of 2002. The number of schools that received an A

grade also increased, due in large measure to the shift to the “grade points” system of school

grading, which allows schools that miss performance goals in one area to compensate with

higher performance in another area. Finally, note that as schools have adapted to the new

grading system, the number of failing schools has decreased. 4

       In this paper, we seek to exploit the degree to which schools and teachers were

“surprised” by the change in school grading. Using an approach to identification introduced by

Rouse et al. (2007), we measure the “accountability shock” to schools and teachers by comparing

the grades that schools actually received in the summer of 2002 with the grade that they would

have been predicted to receive in 2002 based on the “old” grading system (that in place in 2001).

We have programmed both the old and new accountability formulas and, using the full set of

student administrative test scores provided us by the Florida Department of Education, we have

calculated both the actual school grade that schools received in 2002 with the grade that they

would have received given their realized student test scores had the grading system remained

unchanged. It is essential that we make this specific comparison, rather than simply comparing

year-to-year changes in school grades, because year-to-year changes in school grades could

4
  Note that in Table 1 there are 68 elementary schools that received a grade of “N” in 2002.
These were new schools in that year. As such, they were not given a formal grade although the
state did calculate their accountability points. Rouse et al. (2007) experimented with imputing
what their grades would have been, and found that there would have been an additional 9 "F"
graded schools and 10 additional "D" graded schools, for instance, had the state graded these
schools in 2002. Rouse et al. (2007) found that their results regarding test scores were
completely insensitive to the treatment of these schools. For the purposes of the present analysis,
we exclude them from the analysis of teacher job changes.
                                                                                                 11


reflect not just accountability shocks, but also changes in student demographics, changes in

school policies and practices, changes in school staffing, and other changes in school quality.

Given that understanding school staffing is the point of this paper, it is clearly inappropriate to

compare grade changes per se.

       Table 2 compares realized school grades to predicted school grades (based on the old

grading system but the new student test scores) for the set of schools in the state of Florida.5 We

demonstrate that 51 percent of schools experienced a change in their school grade based on the

changing parameters of the grading system itself.          Most of these schools (42 percent)

experienced an upward shock in their school grades, while 9 percent of all schools experienced a

downward shock in their school grades, receiving a lower grade than they would have expected

had the grading system remained unchanged.          Twenty percent of schools that might have

expected to receive a “D” under the old system received an “F” under the new one, while 38

percent of these schools received a grade of “C” or better. Meanwhile, 59 percent of schools that

might have expected to receive a “B” under the old system received an “A” under the new one,

while 9 percent of these schools received a grade of “C” or worse. It is clear that the grading

system change led to major changes in the accountability environment, and provides fertile

ground for identification.




5
  The number of observations in Table 2 does not exactly match that in Table 1 because we rely
on administrative data on students provided by the Florida Department of Education to simulate
each school’s grade in 2002. This administrative dataset does not include some students in
charter schools, “alternative” schools, and, of course, schools that do not have any students in the
accountability grades.
                                                                                                12


III. Data and Empirical Approach

       We are interested in modeling the effects of school accountability shocks on teacher

mobility. The most natural way to estimate this relationship is to consider year-to-year changes

in teacher employment at a school. In this paper, we estimated log-odds ratios generated from

logit models in which the dependent variable is the likelihood that a teacher in year t leaves his

or her school before year t+1, and our key independent variables are indicators for whether the

school was upward or downward shocked in the 2002 school grading regime -- a change in

accountability pressure that is exogenous to the school and its teachers. As we observe teacher

mobility decisions in the years before and after the school grading change, we can estimate

difference-in-difference models in which we condition on school and time effects. Our models

are estimated at the individual teacher level, but since our treatment is a school-level treatment,

all standard errors are clustered at the school level. We report the results of models both

including and excluding school and student body characteristics.

       The primary source of our data is the Florida Department of Education's K-20 Education

Data Warehouse (FL-EDW), an integrated longitudinal database covering all Florida public

school students and school employees from pre-school through college.              Like statewide

administrative databases in North Carolina and Texas, the FL-EDW contains a rich set of

information on both individual students and their teachers which is linked through time. Unlike

other statewide databases, however, the FL-EDW links both students and teachers to specific

classrooms at all grade levels.

       Statewide data, as opposed to data from an individual school district, are particularly

useful for studying teacher labor markets since we can follow teachers who move from one

district to another within Florida. We cannot, however, track teachers who move to another
                                                                                              13


state. Due to population growth and a constitutionally mandated maximum class size, Florida is

a net importer of teachers. Thus, unlike many Northern states where the school-age population is

shrinking, there is relatively little outflow of teachers from Florida during the period under

study.6 Using national data from the Schools and Staffing Survey and associated Teacher

Follow-Up Survey (SASS/TFS) which track teachers across state lines, Feng (2010) finds that

there are relatively fewer teachers moving into or out of state of Florida compared to other

Southern states, such as North Carolina and Georgia.

       The FL-EDW contains teachers’ data from the 1995/96 school year to the 2004/05 school

year, though our primary analyses are based on data through 2002/03, the first year following the

school accountability shock. Teachers’ school affiliation and status can be identified for the

universe of all classroom teachers. In some of our specifications we condition on student test

performance (or measure teachers' value added based on student performance); student test score

records for all grades 3-10 are only available from the 1999/2000 school year forward. We also,

in some specifications, we control for average test scores, disciplinary incidents and socio-

economic status and demographics of the students in a teacher's school and district in an attempt

to control for other factors that might affect teacher mobility.



IV. Accountability Shocks and Teacher Mobility

       We begin by investigating the number of relevant teachers who faced different

accountability conditions during the accountability shock of summer 2002. Table 3 presents a

descriptive summary of teacher job change before and after the accountability shock, broken

  With the recent sub-prime mortgage crisis after 2008, one might expect more of a teacher
exodus out of state of Florida than has occurred previously.

down by the type of shock a school received.7 Independent of the type of accountability shock,

teacher mobility was increasing over the time period. This general increase in teacher job

change could be due to the general expansion in the number of teachers employed; relatively

inexperienced teachers tend to be more mobile than veteran teachers. Prior to the accountability

shock, downward shocked schools have the highest teacher departure rate (18.2 percent), with

slightly lower rates in no-shock schools (16.6 percent) and upward shocked schools (15.9

percent). There is little difference in the inter-temporal change in teacher job change between

upward-shock and no-shock schools. The fraction of teachers leaving non-shock schools was 1.0

percentage points higher in the post-accountability-shock period and for upward-shock schools it

was 0.7 percentage points higher. However, there is a relatively large and statistically significant

difference in the change in teacher departures between no-shock and downward-shock schools.

Teacher job change increased by 2.8 percentage points in schools that received lower grades

under the new accountability regime, whereas schools that did not experience a change in their

grade as a result of the change in the accountability system had only one percentage point

increase in teacher mobility. This 1.8 percentage point difference in the rate of teacher departure

is statistically significant at better than a 99.9 percent confidence level.

        The simple descriptive evidence suggests that schools experiencing downward shocks see

more of their teachers depart after the implementation of the accountability formula change than

do schools that did not experience an accountability shock. In contrast, there is no significant

difference in teacher departure from schools that receive higher grades under the new


7
  Since 2002 school grades were announced in mid-June 2002, too late for most teachers to make
a job change before the start of school in August, we define the pre-shock period as job changes
that occurred between the three school-year pairs, 1999/00-2000/01, 2000/01-2001/02 and
2001/02-2002/03. The post-shock period is the transition between school years 2002/03 and
2003/04.
                                                                                                   15


accountability system relative to schools that experience no change in their grade as a result of

the change in the accountability formula. It is possible that any improvement in teachers’

perceptions of their work environment engendered by an unexpected increase in the school grade

is offset by increased pressure to maintain a higher grade. Of course these descriptive results do

not directly account for other time-varying factors that may influence teacher mobility and which

could be correlated with the type of shock a school receives.              Further, the descriptive

comparisons are based on teacher job changes occurring between the pair of school years

following the accountability shock (ie. differences between the 2002/03 and 2003/04 school

years). If teacher job changes occur over a longer time frame, our results may underestimate the

behavioral response to an accountability shock.

       To account for other time varying factors that may affect teacher mobility, we first

estimate logit models of the likelihood of leaving the current school, conditional on the

characteristics of the teacher's current school. Results are presented in Table 4. For ease of

interpretation, the table reports the parameters in terms of the odds ratio, relative to the reference

group of teachers (those whose schools did not face an accountability shock.) An odds ratio of

one indicates that a teacher whose school is shocked has equal odds of leaving the school as a

teacher whose school is not shocked. An odds ratio of less than one implies that the odds of

leaving for a teacher whose school is shocked is lower than for the reference group of teachers.

Our key variable of interest is the accountability shock faced by the cohort of teachers. Because

we observe multiple cohorts of teachers from schools, before versus after the accountability

shock, we report differences-in-differences estimates in which we compare, say, teachers'

decisions to move before versus after the policy shock from schools experiencing a downward
                                                                                                16


shock to those from schools that are un-shocked. All standard errors are adjusted for clustering

at the school year level.

       The first column of Table 4 presents the key parameter estimates of this model,8 in a

specification that includes no covariates except for year indicators, a post-shock indicator, and

shock-type fixed effects for upward and downward shocked schools. Similar to the descriptive

statistics reported above, we find that teachers who are teaching in schools with an unexpected

increase in accountability pressure (downward accountability shock) are about 11 percent more

likely to leave their schools, and those with an unexpected decrease in accountability pressure

(upward accountability shock) are 2.3 percent less likely to leave their schools, than are teachers

facing no accountability shock. These estimated effects are statistically distinct from one another

and the downward-shocked estimate is statistically different from the no-shock status at a 90

percent confidence level. Therefore, this simplest specification provides some initial evidence

that teachers may respond to the information conveyed by accountability shocks.

       The remaining columns of Table 4 include increasing numbers of control variables. The

second column controls for time-varying district-level demographics and FCAT math score level

variables, and the third column controls for both district-level and school-level time-varying

demographic variables. These include disciplinary incidents, percent of minority students (Black,

Hispanic) and percent of students receiving subsidized lunches, in addition to time effects and

shock-level fixed effects.9 The fourth column further controls for school-level FCAT math score

levels, and the fifth column controls for both school-level FCAT math score levels as well as

math score gains. The point estimates are essentially constant across specifications, with the

interest, but all coefficient estimates are available on request from the authors.

  Because we are conceiving of the accountability shock as a school-level treatment, we do not
condition on teacher characteristics.
                                                                                                  17


precision of the shock effect estimates generally increasing with the number of controls in the

model. Given the stability of our findings across model specifications, we focus on the fully

specified model -- the model that controls for school and district student characteristics and

school-level test score levels and gains (model 5) in the tables that follow. The descriptive results

and parsimonious model 1 results are both supported by our preferred specification, model 5.

Teachers teaching in downward shocked schools are 11 percent more likely to leave their schools

compared to teachers in no-shock schools post reform. Differences between upward shocked

schools and no-shock schools are not statistically significant throughout various specifications,

suggesting teachers in these schools are just as likely to leave their schools as their counterparts

in no-shock schools.

       In the last two columns of Table 4 we report two conditional logit specifications. The first

conditional logit model is similar to logit model 5 with the exception that shock-level indicators

are now replaced by school fixed effects to better control for time-invariant school factors that

may affect teacher mobility. Schools and teachers may react differentially to upward and

downward accountability shocks that lead to different school grades. Figlio et al. (2007), for

instance, find that test scores for "F" graded schools change more than test scores for other

downward-shocked schools following the accountability policy change, and test scores decrease

in "A" graded schools relative to those in other upward-shocked schools. We are interested in

finding out whether teachers respond differently to being accountability-shocked to different

portions of the grading distribution as well. The final column of Table 4, therefore, presents an

augmented version of our most preferred specification broken out to reveal differences in

teachers’ responses by grade status.
                                                                                                  18


       Estimates in the final column of Table 4 show that teachers do indeed respond differently

when shocked to different portions of the school grading distribution. Teachers in schools whose

school grade unexpectedly falls to a "B", "C" or "D" are no more likely to leave their school than

are teachers in schools that did not experience a change in grade due to the new accountability

system. However, teachers in schools that experienced an unexpected drop into the failing

category are 42 percent more likely to leave their school than are teachers in schools that did not

experience an accountability shock. Once the difference between downward shock to "F" and

downward shocks to higher grades are taken into account, teachers in schools that were upward

shocked are found to be 6.5 percent less likely to leave their schools than teachers in no-shocked

schools. However, the impact on teacher job change from being upwardly shocked to a school

grade of “A” is not statistically different from that resulting from being upwardly shocked to a

“B” or “C” (there were no “F” schools in the pre-shock year).10 Hence, it appears that teachers

who receive unexpected good news about the rating of their school are moderately more likely to

stay in their current school whereas teachers are much more likely to depart their school if it is

unexpectedly hit with a failing grade.

       Prior research on general teacher mobility distinguishes between moves between schools

within a district, moves between districts and exit from public school teaching and finds that

different factors can affect the type of move (c.f. Hanushek et al., 2004; Boyd, et al., 2005a;

Scafidi, et al., 2007; Feng, 2009). These studies show that working conditions have a large

impact on teacher mobility within a district, but inter-district moves and exits are more likely to


10
   The coefficient of the differential effect of upward shock to "A" versus upward shock in
general is actually positive, though statistically insignificant. While the sign of this differential
relationship may seem surprising, it is consistent with the qualitative findings of Goldhaber and
Hannaway (2004) that suggest that educators in "A" schools felt more under pressure to maintain
their high grades than did educators in lower-rated schools.
                                                                                                  19


be affected by factors other than working conditions, such as salary differentials and geographic

preferences. The accountability pressure under study here can be considered as a characteristic of

teachers’ working conditions and thus we would expect there be differential effects of

accountability pressure on the type of move. In particular, we would expect accountability

pressure to have a greater effect on within district moves and exits than on cross-district job

changes.

       In Table 5 we present a set of conditional logit models by three possible transition

destinations: intra-district move, inter-district move, and exit Florida public school teaching.

The results are consistent with our general findings on the effect of accountability on teacher job

change as well as the evidence in the general teacher mobility literature on the differential effects

of working conditions on alternative types of teacher transitions. Schools shocked downward to

"F" grades tend to lose teachers to other schools in the same district. Specifically teachers in

these schools are nearly 67 percent more likely to move to a new school within the same district

than are teachers in schools that experienced no accountability shock. Not surprisingly,

movement of teachers between Florida’s countywide school districts is not significantly affected

by downward accountability shocks, including receipt of an “F” grade.             Most likely such

relatively long-distance moves are governed primarily by external factors such as spousal job

changes or other significant family events, rather than a desire to change one’s work

environment. Being shocked down to a failing grade does increase the likelihood that a teacher

will exit the Florida public school system entirely. Although the exit effect is smaller, the

evidence suggests that teachers are both more likely to switch schools and to give up on public

school teaching when their school is designated as “failing.”
                                                                                                 20


       In contrast to downward accountability shocks, receipt of a higher school grade or

upward movement to an “A” grade does not have a statistically significant effect on either

within-district teacher mobility or on the probability of remaining as a public school teacher,

though the estimated effects on leaving teaching in the school district (or entirely) are on the

margin of statistical significance at conventional levels. Thus it appears that movements to the

left tail of the school grade distribution have the greatest consequences for both the total supply

of teachers and the distribution of teachers across schools.



VI. Teacher Quality and Differential Mobility

       As numerous authors (e.g., Rivkin, Hanushek and Kain, 2005; Aaronson, Barrow and

Sander, 2007) have demonstrated, there exists dramatic within-school variation in the level of

teacher quality. The degree to which teacher mobility engendered by accountability pressures

affects the level and distribution of teacher quality across schools depends critically on which

teachers within a school stay or go. If relatively high-quality teachers depart schools facing

accountability pressure this could mitigate any direct benefits to student learning brought about

by the accountability system. In contrast, if increased pressure leads to (either voluntary or

involuntary) exit of the least capable teachers this could reinforce the direct positive effects of

accountability pressure.11

       While teacher quality is multidimensional, for the purposes of this paper we simply

define teacher quality in terms of a teacher’s individual contribution to her student’s test scores.

This is possible in the state of Florida because of the ability to link individual teachers to the

contexts see Goldhaber, Gross and Player (2007) and Feng and Sass (2008).
                                                                                                21


students for whom they are responsible on a classroom basis. Specifically, we estimate a so-

called “restricted value-added” model of student achievement of the following form:12

 Ait  β1Z it  β 2 Pijmt  β 3Tkt  β 4 S mt   kt   it                                   (8)

The gain in student achievement, Ait is a function of student/family inputs (Z), classroom-level

peer characteristics (P), a vector of teacher experience indicators (T),13 school-level inputs (S)

and a year-specific teacher effect, . The subscripts denote students (i), classrooms (j), teachers

(k), schools (m) and time (t).14 The model is estimated for both math achievement and for

reading achievement in all grades 3-10 over the period 1999/2000 – 2004/05.15 Only students

with a single teacher in the relevant subject area are included in the analysis.

         The estimated value of the year-specific teacher effect, kt, is our measure of teacher

quality. The teacher-by-year estimates are re-centered to have a mean value of zero in each

school level (elementary, middle, high) within each year. The estimates represent the average

achievement gain of a teacher’s students, for all classes taught in the relevant subject in a year,

controlling for student, peer and school characteristics as well as for teacher experience. Student

achievement is measured by year-to-year gains in the normalized-by-grade-and-year FCAT-NRT

12
   We also produced teacher quality estimates from two alternative models: an “unrestricted”
value-added model whereby current achievement is regressed on lagged achievement and the
same set of controls as in equation (8) and a “restricted” value-added model like (8) in which
student fixed effects were used to control for student heterogeneity. We obtain very similar
results for the relationship between accountability pressure and teacher quality using these
alternative specifications. Results using these alternative value-added specifications are
available from the authors.
13
   We control for teacher experience, but not other teacher characteristics, because we are
interested in identifying measured teacher quality for a given level of experience. We have also
estimated models in which teacher experience levels are excluded, and the results are
fundamentally similar to those reported herein.

(2003).

   Details of the estimation sample and estimation procedures are provided in Harris and Sass
(2007).

score. Thus the teacher effects are calibrated in standard deviation units. Since there are no

school-level fixed effects in the calculation of teacher effects, our year-specific teacher effect can

be interpreted as the effectiveness of a given teacher relative to all other teachers teaching the

same subject with the same level of experience at the same type of school.16 The teacher quality

measure can only be constructed for teachers who are responsible for teaching courses in the

subjects and grades covered by achievement testing, reading and math.              In the following

discussion we focus on the quality and mobility of math teachers. Results for reading teachers

are very similar, and are available on request from the authors.

        Table 6 reports the average teacher value added for stayers versus leavers in schools that

were negatively shocked, those that were positively shocked, and those that were un-shocked

when the accountability system changed. It appears that in the case of positively shocked and

un-shocked schools, the average quality of teachers did not change following the change in

school accountability. However, in the case of negatively shocked schools, the average teacher

quality of leavers and stayers both improved after the shock. While the average quality of

teachers who depart improved more that the average teacher quality of stayers the difference in

the quality of leavers and stayers as a result of downward accountability shocks is not

statistically significant.

        In addition to comparing stayers and leavers within a given type of school, we also

compare the average quality of leavers between accountability-shocked schools and unshocked

schools in Table 7. The sample size is smaller than in Table 3 since some teachers are teaching

in non-tested subjects or grade levels or can’t be reliably matched to the performance of their

students.    As a consequence, results must be interpreted with some caution. For schools

16
  We also analyzed teacher quality measured not conditioned on experience and obtained similar
results.
                                                                                               23


experiencing either no shock or an upward shock, the average quality of leavers does not change

significantly over time. In contrast, teachers who departed upwardly shocked schools were of

significantly higher measured quality than those who left downwardly shocked schools before

the accountability change. As a result, the difference between the quality of teachers who leave

downwardly shocked schools and those who depart no-shock schools increased over time. Thus

unexpected worsening of a schools grade lead to increases in both the number of teachers

departing and the average quality of teachers who leave, relative to schools that did not

experience a change in their school’s grade.

       In Table 8 we make a similar comparison between the quality of stayers in shocked and

un-shocked schools. The average quality of stayers improved in downward shocked schools by

about 0.05 standard deviations in student achievement while there was no significant change in

the quality of teacher who stay in un-shocked schools. This is consistent with the findings of

Rouse et al. (2007), suggesting that downward-shocked schools experience larger test score gains

the year after the accountability shock. The apparent increase in stayer quality could be due to

positive effects of accountability (either increased resources like reading coaches or increased

pressure to perform) that improve teacher quality.

       Table 9 demonstrates that the effects of downward accountability shocks on the quality of

teachers who stay and leave essentially balance out. Unexpected declines in a school’s grade

lead to higher quality teachers departing but also lead to improvements in the quality of teachers

who stay. The net result is that the difference between the quality of stayers and leavers in

downward-shock schools and the difference between the quality of stayers and leavers in no-

shock schools is unchanged. Thus it appears that increased accountability pressure has both
                                                                                                  24


positive and negative effects on average teacher quality and that schools receiving unexpected

decreases in school grades do not lose ground on the teacher quality margin.

        The mean changes in teacher value added might mask changes in the distribution of

movers and stayers. In order to understand the impact of accountability pressure on the

distribution of teacher quality, we plot kernel density estimates of the distribution of teacher

quality. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of mathematics teacher quality before and after the

accountability shock by move status for schools that received no change in accountability and for

schools that experience increased pressure (downward shock) as a result of the change in the

school grading system. In zero-shock schools there is little difference in the quality distributions

of leavers and stayers, but the quality distribution of leavers shrinks after the accountability

system change. Un-shocked schools experience fewer instances of teachers leaving at both ends

of the quality spectrum. In schools with increased accountability pressure there are more

pronounced differences in the quality distributions of teachers who stay and those that leave.

Prior to the accountability system change, the quality distribution of movers is to the left of the

stayer distribution and the right tail of the stayer quality distribution is longer. Following the

accountability change, the right tail of the quality distribution of teachers staying in negatively-

shocked schools is truncated to become nearly equal to the right tail of the leaver quality

distribution. Further, the quality distribution of leavers shifts to the right while the distribution

of stayers remains relatively constant over time.



VII. Conclusion

       This paper provides new evidence of the effects of school accountability systems on

teacher mobility.     While prior papers on the subject analyzed the introduction of an
                                                                                                  25


accountability system within a state, and therefore had no natural counterfactual, this study is the

first to exploit policy variation within the same state to study the effects of accountability on

teacher job changes.

       Taking advantage of exogenous changes in accountability pressure for schools, we find

that schools that are downward-shocked – receiving a lower accountability grade post-change

than would have happened before – are less likely to retain their teachers than are schools that

received no accountability shock.      While downward-shocked schools in general lose more

teachers, the effects are strongest for those shocked downward to a grade of "F". Teachers in

schools who unexpectedly receive a grade of "F" are over 40 percent more likely to leave their

school and are nearly 70 percent more likely to move to another school in the same district than

are teachers in schools that did not receive an accountability shock. We also find some evidence

the upward-shock schools are better able to retain their teachers than no-shock schools, though

the measured effects are smaller and less precise than for downward-shock schools.

       The mobility caused by school accountability also has significant effects on the

distribution of teacher quality within and across schools. We find that downward accountability

shocks lead to an increase in the quality of teachers who leave.               However, increased

accountability pressure also leads to improvements in the quality of teachers who remain in

downwardly shocked schools. In contrast, schools that are not hit with an accountability shock

do not experience any significant change to the quality of teachers that leave or stay. While the

quality differential between stayers and leavers does not change as a result of increased

accountability pressure, we do find that downward shocked schools experience changes to the

distribution of the quality of their teachers. The upper tail of the quality distribution of teachers

staying in negatively-shocked schools is truncated as a result of increased accountability
                                                                                                 26


pressure. Further, the quality distribution of teachers who move shifts to the right while the

distribution of those who stay remains relatively constant. It may be the case that the distribution

of teachers staying or leaving schools shocked to "F" grades may be different, but we are hesitant

to make those comparisons given the relatively small number of "F" school teachers for whom

we have data to conduct the teacher quality analysis.

          The results have strong implications for public policy. Struggling schools that come

under increased accountability pressure face many challenges in terms of changing instructional

policies and practices to facilitate student improvement. We have discovered that (in the case of

those facing the highest accountability pressure) they also face the challenge of having to replace

more teachers, and particularly, their higher-quality teachers (measured in terms of contribution

to value-added). On the positive side, schools facing increased accountability pressure also see a

rise in the average quality of the teachers who stay. It may be that those who stay respond work

harder as a result of increased accountability pressure or they may appear to be more productive

as a result of increases in complementary inputs like reading coaches. The findings presented in

this paper suggest that if these schools were able to retain more of their high-quality teachers

(perhaps through increased incentives to remain in the school), the accountability gains could be

greater still. This last argument, of course, is still speculative.

Notes: All row fractions are student-weighted. The number of schools is in brackets. Simulated grade
changes are generated by applying both the old grading system and the new grading system to 2002
student test scores, using the approach introduced by Rouse et al. (2007). They are therefore generated
based on precisely the same student tests; the only differences in the calculations are the formulas used to
convert these same tests into school grades.

Note: The parameter estimates presented above are expressed in terms of odds ratios relative to the un-
shocked set of teachers. Standard errors clustered at the school-by-year level are in parentheses beneath
parameter estimates. Conditional logit by transition destination models the probability of moving to a new
school, moving to a new district, and exiting Florida public schools separately between year t and t+1.
The number of observations may differ across these transition outcomes depending on the number of
dropped teacher/year observation due to all positive or negative outcomes. The conditional logit models
also include year indicators, post-shock indicators, school fixed effects, school and district characteristics
such as percent of minority students (Black, Hispanic), percent of students on free or reduced lunch
program, average math score on the Sunshine Standards FCAT, disciplinary incidents, and school-level
math FCAT raw score gains. A full set of coefficient estimates is available upon request.
